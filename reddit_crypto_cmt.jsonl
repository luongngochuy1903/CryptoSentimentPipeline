Aujourd'hui, parlons de BNB, le jeton natif de la plateforme Binance. Lanc√© en 2017, BNB a rapidement grimp√© les √©chelons pour devenir l'une des cryptomonnaies les plus populaires. Mais qu'est-ce qui fait vraiment la force de BNB ? Est-ce seulement son association avec la plus grande bourse de crypto au monde, ou y a-t-il plus derri√®re ce succ√®s ?\n\nCertains louent BNB pour ses utilisations vari√©es, allant des r√©ductions de frais de transaction √† l'acc√®s √† des offres exclusives sur Binance. D'autres, cependant, se montrent plus critiques, soulignant les risques li√©s √† la centralisation et √† la d√©pendance √† une seule plateforme. Alors, qu'en pensez-vous ? BNB est-il une pi√®ce ma√Ætresse dans votre portefeuille crypto, ou pr√©f√©rez-vous diversifier ailleurs ?

Not finding any good references for how you can move XRP around other than flat out selling &amp; buying again or swapping on a CEX and eating the capital gains tax. Not many DEX seem to support native XRP, and there's so many exchanges with horror stories it's hard to know what you can or can't trust. That being said, I'm curious as to what is the most efficient, safe way to move XRP from a cold wallet (e.g. trezor) to a DEX that supports xrp swapping and preferably no KYC.\n\nYou can swap within exodus/trezor but I've heard those fees are high - appears to be anywhere between 3-7% or higher. I've also seen XRP has a built-in DEX, but quite frankly it doesn't have a very intuitive UI for non-coders.\n\nCan someone explain the steps in which you would follow to swap XRP to say SOL, as an example? What should you expect to lose in fees for a transaction like this, 1%?\n\ne.g.:\n\n1. In Trezor, send XRP to Uniswap address\n\n2. In Uniswap, initiate the swap from XRP to SOL\n\n3.

To understand the shift, we need to examine stablecoins, their purpose, XRP, and the broader financial system as they evolve toward a digital economy.\n\nStablecoins are the next evolution of fiat\n\nStablecoins are digital versions of traditional currencies. Some come from central banks, others from regulated institutions. They function like Central Bank Digital Currencies without the label. They're meant to bring stability and faster transactions while backed by fiat. But if tied to fiat, the fundamental problem remains. The real game changer is infrastructure. Many of these new stablecoins will run on RippleNet using XRP and On-Demand Liquidity to move value instantly Over time, crypto will converge with this technology and the broader financial system. XRP is the universal settlement layer, powering tokenized assets, liquidity, and cross-sector payments efficiently.\n\nWhy XRP matters\n\nWell, as stablecoin demand grows, XRP's role as liquidity backbone becomes essential. XRP is not a speculative asset, it's a commodity for the digital economy. The adoption by institutions reduces friction and costs in cross-border payments confirms it. This is a long-term structural shift in how digital money moves. Few will see it until it's too late.\n\nThe double-edged nature of stablecoins\n\nCentral banks have used cycles of liquidity and debt restructuring since 2008. Stablecoins provide a new liquidity source, extending these cycles and managing systemic risk. RLUSD, the proposed digital dollar, shows how institutions expand the dollar digitally. Integrating stablecoins with existing infrastructure prepares for a digital asset-dominant world.\n\nControl and decentralization\n\nStablecoins integrate people into the debt-based system digitally. XRP could operate fully decentralized, but current approaches bridge to legacy systems, giving institutions control while providing liquidity.\n\nSystemic risks\n\nCrypto volatility is inevitable. Over-leveraged participants face risk. Markets remain tied to economic pressures, credit constraints, Al-driven trading, and systemic factors. Understanding this allows anticipation rather than reaction.\n\nLong-term perspective\n\nDigital assets integrated with the broader system, especially XRP, will play a critical role. Stablecoin growth and XRP-backed infrastructure favor utility and adoption over speculation. Those who understand XRP in banking and settlement will navigate these changes best.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nStablecoins evolve fiat and integrate traditional finance with digital infrastructure. XRP sits at the center as a liquidity source, enabling global settlements. Focus on facts, not narratives, to survive and thrive in this pivotal moment.", "num_comments": 39}
