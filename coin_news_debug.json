Ether-focused BMNR, SBET posted bigger losses.\n- The move coincided with bitcoin and ether sharply reversing from big moves higher less than two days ago.\nIn this article\nDigital asset treasury (DAT) firms, seen as high-beta plays on crypto prices, sold off sharply on Friday as the August crypto rally showed signs of exhaustion.\nStrategy (MSTR) fell another 3% on Friday, extending its decline to 20% since July’s high and 33% from the November 2024 all-time high. The MSTR/IBIT ratio dropped to 5.43, its lowest since March, signaling continued underperformance against BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and a return to levels last seen at the start of the year.\nOther bitcoin treasury stocks also declined, with Metaplanet (3350) down 9% and Nakamoto (NAKA) off 12% following the completion of its merger with KindlyMD to form a new bitcoin treasury entity.\nBreaking from the trend, KULR Technology (KULR) gained over 5% after reporting second quarter revenue growth of 63% year-over-year, the highest in its history, driven by its bitcoin-first balance sheet strategy.\nFirms with ETH-heavy portfolios suffered steeper losses.\nBitmine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink Gaming, the two most prominent Ethereum strategy firms, declined 7% and 14%, respectively, in the early hours of the session.\nSolana-focused companies weren't spared either. Upexi (UPXI) plunged over 9%, while DeFi Development (DFDV) was 5% lower.\nBTC, ETH, SOL rally cools\nThe move coincided with bitcoin\nsliding below $117,000, extending its reversal from Thursday's short-lived spike to $124,000, a new all-time high. Ether (ETH) tumbled back after challenging its record high above $4,800, now barely holding the $4,400 level.DATs pursue a strategy to raise funds by selling equity and debt to accumulate cryptocurrencies, a playbook pioneered by Michael Saylor's Strategy. They are seen as a high-beta play on crypto prices, rising more when the underlying asset rallies, but suffering bigger drawdowns when the market cools.\nMost crypto-related stocks also traded lower during the session. Bitcoin miner Riot Platform and digital asset conglomerate Galaxy (GLXY) were lower by roughly 8%. Coinbase (COIN) was modestly down 1.6%, while Circle (CRCL) gained 3.5% following the successful completion of a secondary share offering.\nRead more: Bitcoin Rally Stalls on U.S. Inflation, Policy Whiplash: Crypto Daybook Americas\nKrisztian Sandor\nKrisztian Sandor is a U.S. markets reporter focusing on stablecoins, tokenization, real-world assets.

The probe now targets suspected money laundering and illegal drug handling, separated from a broader investigation that also examined abuse of power.\nJiřikovský was convicted and served a prison sentence for running a darknet drug marketplace called Sheep Marketplace. He was arrested in 2016 and subsequently convicted of embezzlement and drug trafficking, serving four years of a nine-year prison sentence.\nThe arrest was the result of a raid by police on a house in Břeclav where Jiřikovský was staying.\nThe bitcoin donation case rocked Prime Minister Petr Fiala's administration only months before the country's election laster this year.\nThe government survived a vote of no confidence filed by opposition party ANO, which leads the polls at present ahead of October's vote.\nFormer Justice Minister Pavel Blažek resigned in June over the affair, having accepted the donation of 468 BTC, which was sold for roughly 1 billion Czech koruna, worth around $45 million.\nHis successor, Eva Decroix, commissioning an independent audit from Grant Thornton.

(BSTR), a bitcoin\ntreasury vehicle led by cryptography pioneer Adam Back, sees itself as a company with a mission to accelerate real-world bitcoin adoption.But it might be setting out on another milestone: becoming one of the biggest corporate bitcoin holders.\nThe company, which is preparing to go public on Nasdaq by merging with Cantor Equity Partners (CEPO), already has 30,021 BTC on its balance sheet, with plans to grow its stack beyond 50,000 coins.\nThis will set it on the path of potentially overtaking MARA Holdings (MARA) as the second-largest corporate holder of BTC behind Strategy. MARA has more than 50,600 BTC, according to bitcointreasuries.net. Strategy has just under 629,000.\nCurrently, MSTR, MARA, and BSTR collectively hold roughly 710,000 bitcoin, which represents about 3.38% of bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million.\n'Liquidity, security, and scale'\nUnlike some corporate treasuries that sit on bitcoin passively, BSTR intends to use techniques that include selling puts to accumulate BTC at lower prices, using bitcoin-backed revolvers and placing collateral with regulated tri-party custodians.\n“We’re not interested in chasing DeFi yield or taking on counterparty risk we can’t manage. This is about liquidity, security, and scale,\" Back said exclusively with CoinDesk. “Bitcoin was created as sound money and BSTR is being created to bring that same integrity to modern capital markets.”\nThe SPAC deal with Cantor combines, for the first time, traditional Wall Street financing with a bitcoin-denominated private placement of equity (PIPE).\nIn addition to 25,000 BTC contributed by the company's founders, another 5,021 BTC will be raised from the bitcoin community.\nThe company is also raising up to $1.5 billion in fiat financing, the largest PIPE ever announced alongside a bitcoin treasury SPAC merger.\n- $400 million in common equity at $10 per share.\n- Up to $750 million in convertible senior notes (30% conversion premium, $13 per share).\n- Up to $350 million in convertible preferred stock with a 7% dividend and a $13 per share equivalent conversion price.\nCEPO could add up to $200 million from its trust, subject to redemptions.\n“By securing both fiat and bitcoin funding on day one, we are putting unprecedented firepower behind a single mission: maximizing bitcoin ownership per share while accelerating real-world bitcoin adoption,” Back said.\nA first for bitcoin treasuries\nThe in-kind PIPE allows investors to deliver BTC at closing and potentially capture upside before settlement. Back said the approach was designed to appeal to both crypto-native players and traditional managers seeking exposure without waiting for post-close market buys.\nThe firm's CIO Sean Bill, who previously helped a U.S. pension fund make one of the first institutional allocations to BTC, said the strategy resonated with traditional investors. \"We’re building the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) of Bitcoin, an actively managed Treasury that will pursue yield and alpha strategies, and strategic acquisitions within the Bitcoin ecosystem”.\n“We’re flipping the script on Wall Street as we seek to fuse Bitcoin into Finance and Capital Markets, unlike other Treasury companies we’re not coming to Wall Street seeking fiat currency to buy Bitcoin, we’re showing up with a 25,000 Bitcoin commitment and more importantly we issued the first ever Bitcoin in kind Equity PIPE in the United States, raising another 5,021 Bitcoins from OG Bitcoiners. We’re brining the Bitcoin to Wall Street. We believe that the future of finance runs on Bitcoin”,” Bill told CoinDesk exclusively.\nBridging bitcoin and Wall Street\nThe leadership team sees BSTR as a bridge between the bitcoin ecosystem and institutional capital markets.\n“We’re bringing the traders, we’re bringing the bitcoiners to Wall Street,” Back said, noting the potential for the U.S. market’s liquidity to amplify the success of bitcoin-denominated convertibles that have already gained traction in Europe.\nThe deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, with the company trading under the reserved ticker BSTR. If the raise is fully subscribed, the launch could set a new scale record for corporate bitcoin treasuries and offer a template for others looking to merge sound money with modern market instruments.\nJames Van Straten\nJames Van Straten is a Senior Analyst at CoinDesk, specializing in Bitcoin and its interplay with the macroeconomic environment.

CoinDesk Data's technical analysis model suggests XLM is approaching a key resistance level at $0.50, with a breakout potentially targeting $0.60–$0.77, backed by strengthening network fundamentals and growing institutional participation.\nOn-chain metrics continue to paint a bullish picture. Stellar’s active enterprise wallets hit an all-time high of 9.69 million, with 5,000–6,000 new institutional addresses added daily.\nTotal value locked on the network jumped 80% to $150 million, reflecting a surge in corporate adoption. Traders are closely watching the $0.47–$0.50 zone, a potential trigger point for institutional short covering that could fuel the next leg higher.\nDespite early pressure pushing XLM down to $0.42 in the first six hours of the session, buyers consistently emerged at that level, signaling strong institutional support.\nOvernight, the token staged a steady recovery, retesting $0.43 before consolidating. In the final 60 minutes, heavy selling briefly drove prices back to $0.42, but a swift rebound and lighter volume suggest selling pressure may be easing, leaving room for renewed upside momentum.\nCorporate Technical Indicators Signal Consolidation Phase\n- Stellar established robust institutional support at $0.42 zone with consistent corporate buyer emergence during early session decline.\n- Cryptocurrency tested resistance near $0.43 during overnight institutional trading before consolidating in upper price range.\n- Trading volume peaked at 71.43 million during initial six-hour decline, indicating significant institutional participation and interest.\n- Technical formation approaches critical resistance at $0.50 level, representing key institutional breakout threshold.\n- Corporate momentum indicators suggest potential advancement toward $0.60-$0.77 institutional price target zones.\n- Diminishing trading volume in final hour signals exhausted institutional selling pressure and market stabilization potential.\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

The climb from overnight lows showed solid momentum with volume backing, hinting at systematic accumulation.\nHowever, the subsequent pullback to $0.251 reflected profit-taking near resistance and pointed to potential short-term consolidation.\nBroader market sentiment added to the volatility. Grayscale filed for Delaware trust registrations for potential HBAR and Cardano spot ETFs, using a structure familiar from previous crypto investment products.\nMeanwhile, Binance expanded BNB Smart Chain functionality to include HBAR and SUI, enabling more efficient cross-chain transactions and increasing retail accessibility. These developments signaled strengthening institutional interest even as near-term price action wavered.\nTechnical Indicators Synopsis\n- Trading range of $0.015 representing 6% differential between $0.259 peak and $0.244 trough during 24-hour period.\n- Critical support threshold established at $0.248-$0.249 where buying interest emerged systematically.\n- Resistance zone materialised around $0.255-$0.256 where distribution pressure intensified substantially.\n- Volume surge to 65.56 million during recovery peak at $0.259 exceeded 24-hour moving average significantly.\n- Breakdown below $0.252 support confirmed by elevated volume exceeding 5 million during final trading hour.\n- Institutional distribution pattern evident during 13:35-13:45 timeframe with acute price deterioration.\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

They converted much of their haul into 21,957 ETH at roughly $2,414 per coin, only to sell 9,631 ETH for $44 million worth of stablecoins this week.\nThey still control 12,326 ETH alongside the stablecoin proceeds, for a combined $101 million, around $48.3 million more than the value of the original stolen assets.\nA similar playbook emerged from the Infini exploit in February. That attacker siphoned $49.5 million in USDC and bought 17,696 ETH at $2,798 each.\nWhile laundering 5,000 ETH through Tornado Cash, they also sold 3,540 ETH for $13 million worth of stablecoins at an average $3,762. The ETH rally has swelled the value of their remaining stash, netting an extra $25.15 million on top of the initial theft.\nThe third case was an unidentified exploiter who stole 17,412 ETH from THORChain and Chainflip in March sold those holdings for $33.9 million DAI at $1,947.\nIn June, they re-entered the market, buying 4,957 ETH at $2,495 before selling them early Friday for $22.13 million worth of stablecoins at $4,464, profiting $9.76 million in the process.\nThe three hacks all played part in a rampant 18 months for hackers, with investors losing $3.1 billion in in the first half of 2025 and $1.49 billion in 2024.\nOliver Knight\nOliver Knight is the co-leader of CoinDesk data tokens and data team.

Pharmacies can now enroll in the beta version of the program.\nThe system is built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), an open-source blockchain with core development led by Ripple Labs.\nWith a network of more than 6,500 pharmacies and 200 manufacturers, Wellgistics is one of the first healthcare companies to launch an XRPL payment solution at scale. The firm's CEO, Brian Norton, said pharmacy owners have embraced the initiative, calling them more forward-thinking on blockchain than many in the industry assume.\nThe program enables pharmacies to settle invoices over XRPL, though Wellgistics has not disclosed whether participants must hold XRP directly or use fiat-to-XRP conversions for settlement.\nThe program was designed to meet strict compliance standards, including HIPAA and anti-money laundering requirements. After the pharmacy roll-out, Wellgistics plans to extend the platform to manufacturers and test direct-to-patient programs, allowing medications to be shipped from drugmakers directly to patients under physician oversight.\nThe initiative builds on a May 8 announcement that Wellgistics intends to use XRP not just for payments but also as a treasury reserve asset. That plan is backed by a $50 million equity line of credit, which management said would support programmable liquidity and on-demand financial infrastructure across its healthcare network.\nFounded as Wellgistics LLC in 2016, the company was acquired by Danam Health in September 2024 before being spun off through an initial public offering in February 2025. Today, Wellgistics Health operates as a standalone Nasdaq-listed entity, providing wholesale distribution, prescription routing, and AI-powered hub services to pharmacies nationwide.\nShares have dropped more than 80% since the February debut. They closed Tuesday at $0.62, down 7%, before rising to $0.65 in after-hours trading. The company's current market cap is around $47 million.\nBy linking pharmacy payments to the XRP Ledger while preparing to hold XRP on its balance sheet, Wellgistics is aiming to position itself as both a user and financial backer of the blockchain.\nSiamak Masnavi\nSiamak Masnavi is a researcher specializing in blockchain technology, cryptocurrency regulations, and macroeconomic trends shaping the crypto market.

In April, the Federal Reserve withdrew its earlier crypto guidance that directed bankers to get approvals from the government supervisors before engaging in new crypto activity. The other two U.S. federal banking regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. made matching moves to toss out the previous guidance, leaving banks to make their own crypto decisions under existing risk-management expectations.\nThe idea behind the novel-activity program was that the Fed needed to gather special expertise and put a closer focus on risks to the banking system that might emerge from innovative and untested technologies. The initiative followed closely in the aftermath of the 2023 crisis in which three U.S. lenders closely associated with technology and crypto clients — Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank — failed about five months earlier.\nIn the two years since establishing the program, though, the Fed has \"strengthened its understanding of those activities, related risks, and bank risk management practices,\" according to Friday's statement, so the work will be directed back to the regular supervisory process.\nThe crypto industry and U.S. banking regulators have been through a tumultuous few years in which digital assets firms and insiders have complained of an organized campaign from government entities to cut them off from bank services — a campaign the industry and its Republican lawmaker allies call Operation Chokepoint 2.0. But Trump has appointed crypto-friendly officials to redirect the banking agencies, and though the Fed is protective of its independence, it's generally joined the OCC and FDIC in the trend of relaxing crypto constraints.\nRead More: Fed Joins OCC, FDIC in Withdrawing Crypto Warnings for U.S. Banks\nJesse Hamilton\nJesse Hamilton is CoinDesk's deputy managing editor on the Global Policy and Regulation team, based in Washington, D.C.

This includes adjusting rules \"that have been around for 90 years or so,\" he said.\n\"We don't want the crypto assets to be on some flash drive in somebody's drawer,\" he said on Friday. \"They need to be in a secure place … the reason for doing all this and addressing these various regulations is to provide some certainty for people.\"\nThe SEC's work will be based on the legislation passed by Congress, he said, pointing to the already-signed GENIUS Act and existing market structure legislative efforts.\n\"Our goal is to get clarity and certainty,\" he said. \"It will be undergirded by whatever comes out of Congress but I believe that we have authority to move forward in these areas and provide that certainty and clarity for people.\"\nAsked about a district court ruling on debit card interchange fees, Atkins said it could support real-time or instant payment networks, and moving toward instant payment settlements \"would be ideal,\" he said.\nThis type of payment could be bolstered by using a blockchain, he said, though he also said that the system could need to have some sort of delay built in to address mistakes.\n\"The longer that it takes to have clearance on some of the transactions, the more risk there is in the system for something to go wrong, some black swan event,\" he said.\nJoin the crypto policy conversation Sept. 10 in D.C. — Register now for CoinDesk: Policy & Regulation.\nNikhilesh De\nNikhilesh De is CoinDesk's managing editor for global policy and regulation, covering regulators, lawmakers and institutions.

This means that, relative to its volatility, bitcoin has delivered exceptional returns over the historical period.\nStrategy (MSTR), which maintains significant bitcoin exposure through corporate holdings, follows closely with a Sharpe ratio of 2.00, reflecting similarly strong performance.\nA Sharpe ratio of 2 means an asset has delivered twice the excess return over the risk-free rate for every unit of volatility taken, which is considered excellent in risk-adjusted performance terms.\nFor context, several large-cap tech names are clustered around a Sharpe ratio of 1.0.\nThe data is current as of Aug. 14, for securities and Aug. 15, for bitcoin, according to the Strategy dashboard.\nA key driver of late for both has been volatility compression. Bitcoin’s implied volatility has fallen to 37%, near a two-year low, suggesting market participants expect more stable price action in the short term.\nWhile, Vetle Lunde, an analyst at K33 Research, says “low volatility is maturity” and notes that over the past six months, 30% of the 100 largest S&P 500 companies have been more volatile than Bitcoin, which shows the cryptocurrency is becoming more of a mature asset class.\nBy contrast, MSTR’s implied volatility is higher at 56%, as it's a leveraged bitcoin proxy, but this figure is well below the extremes seen in the past year, with 140% in December 2024 and over 120% in April 2025, according to the Strategy dashboard.\nFrom a valuation perspective, MSTR’s multiple to net asset value (mNAV) sits at 1.61 following its recent Q2 earnings call. The company has stated it will not conduct an at-the-market offering of its common stock until its mNAV rises above 2.5, except for paying dividends on its perpetual preferred stock and to pay interest on its debt obligations.\nYear-to-date bitcoin is up 27%, while MSTR is up 24%.\nJames Van Straten\nJames Van Straten is a Senior Analyst at CoinDesk, specializing in Bitcoin and its interplay with the macroeconomic environment.

While valuations for the market’s largest technology names remain elevated, he noted that earnings growth outside Tesla helped justify the multiples. “MAG-7 year-on-year growth is like 54%,” he said, adding that the pace makes the sector difficult to ignore.\nOn the bond side, Rieder highlighted the appeal of income.\nInvestors can still build portfolios yielding between 6.5% and 7%, a level he described as highly attractive in a world where inflation has drifted below 3% on a core basis. He argued that while the Federal Reserve has room to cut rates — potentially starting as soon as September — current yields already offer investors solid returns.\n'Crazy low' volatility\nRieder also emphasized today’s unusually subdued volatility. He described trading equity volatility, or “vol,” at levels near 9.5 to 10, which he called “crazy low.” Low volatility, he said, makes hedging against downside risk relatively cheap, giving investors what he called an “escape hatch” if conditions sour. “You don’t actually have to take the downside risk,” Rieder said.\nStill, Rieder cautioned that complacency is his biggest concern. With insurance in markets so inexpensive, he sees signs investors may be underestimating risks, particularly in credit spreads and other corners of fixed income.\nFed's interest rate\nOn monetary policy, Rieder argued the Fed’s rate hikes have done little to suppress inflation, given that large corporations rely less on borrowing to finance investment.\nThe real drag, he said, has been on housing activity and lower-income households that depend more heavily on credit. Keeping rates too high, he warned, risks imposing excessive costs on the government and households without meaningful disinflation gains.\nHe believes the central bank could lower the funds rate by as much as 100 basis points over the coming year, a move he sees as unlikely to rekindle inflation given low structural volatility and rising productivity from advances in data, hyperscale computing and even space-related technologies.\n“There’s something spectacular happening around productivity,” he said, calling it a once-in-a-generation dynamic.\nFor crypto investors, Rieder’s comments reinforce a broader narrative: an environment with falling rates, ample liquidity, and low volatility could support renewed appetite for risk assets beyond equities. If his call proves correct, the same technical tailwinds driving stocks higher could spill into digital assets that thrive on excess cash and investor risk-taking.\nSiamak Masnavi\nSiamak Masnavi is a researcher specializing in blockchain technology, cryptocurrency regulations, and macroeconomic trends shaping the crypto market.

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it.\nIn this article\nBy James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\nBitcoin's (BTC) flirt with a record high $124,000 on Thursday was followed by a drop that led to it closing last weekend's CME gap at $117,600 after hotter-than-expected PPI inflation data and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s apparent flip-flop on bitcoin purchases for a strategic reserve.\nThe gap occurs because CME hours for BTC futures don't match bitcoin's 24/7 trading. When the futures market is closed over the weekend, bitcoin's movements can create a discontinuity in prices on the CME chart. While filling the gap is a recurring pattern in market behavior, there's not guarantee it will take place.\nBitcoin has now set four all-time highs in 2025. Importantly, the magnitude of pullbacks following these peaks has been shrinking. After it hit $109,000 in January, BTC fell 30% to $76,000 by April. In May, the $112,000 high was followed by a 12% drop in June. July’s $123,000 peak led to a 9% decline. Most recently, August’s $124,000 high has so far seen only a 7% percent pullback, though we're only one day in.\nLooking ahead, Friday’s U.S. retail sales report is forecast at 0.7% month-over-month, which would mark the strongest reading since March. A stronger-than-expected number could further undermine expectations for a September rate cut.\nFurther out, attention turns to the end of August when $12 billion in bitcoin options are set to expire on Deribit. The majority of open call options are concentrated between the $120,000 and $124,000 strike prices, suggesting that if bitcoin trades near these levels, it would align with the positioning of many derivatives traders.

Bitcoin OI is led by Binance ($13.8 billion) and Bybit ($9.3 billion).\n- The elevated open interest is supported by steady gains in BTC three-month annualized basis, currently 8%-9% across all exchanges, according to Velo data. Compared with fourth-quarter 2024 levels of 15%, there is still room to grow.\n- In options, implied volatility (IV) across different option maturities is upward sloping (contango), with near-term IV low at around 20% , Velo data show. The line rises toward 50% for maturities in mid 2026, a sign of increasing uncertainty further out.\n- Looking at the past day's flows for puts vs calls, the ratio is 50:50, implying no extreme directional bias at the moment.\n- Funding rate APRs across major perpetual swap venues are muted at around an annualized 5%-7%, pulling back from the elevated levels seen in the run up to bitcoin's record high on Thursday.\n- This pattern suggests that the rally was largely spot driven, with an influx of shorts helping offset long demand. With funding now relatively low, there is room for fresh leveraged longs to enter the market, potentially adding momentum to the next move.\n- Coinglass data shows $960 million in 24 hour liquidations, skewed 85% towards longs. ETH ($342 million), BTC ($162 million) and others ($116 million) were the leaders in terms of notional liquidations. Binance liquidation heatmap indicates $117,091 as a core liquidation level to monitor, in case of further price drops.\nMarket Movements\n- BTC is up 0.68% from 4 p.m. ET Thursday at $118,739.67 (24hrs: -1.67%)\n- ETH is up 1.9% at $4,622.44 (24hrs: -1.58%)\n- CoinDesk 20 is up 1.33% at 4,257.98 (24hrs: -2.78%)\n- Ether CESR Composite Staking Rate is up 1 bp at 3.05%\n- BTC funding rate is at 0.0082% (8.9976% annualized) on Binance\n- DXY is down 0.37% at 97.89\n- Gold futures are up 0.16% at $3,388.50\n- Silver futures are down 0.52% at $37.87\n- Nikkei 225 closed up 1.71% at 43,378.31\n- Hang Seng closed down 0.98% at 25,270.07\n- FTSE is unchanged at 9,181.53\n- Euro Stoxx 50 is up 0.42% at 5,457.44\n- DJIA closed on Thursday unchanged at 44,911.26\n- S&P 500 closed unchanged at 6,468.54\n- Nasdaq Composite closed unchanged at 21,710.67\n- S&P/TSX Composite closed down 0.28% at 27,915.99\n- S&P 40 Latin America closed down 1.16% at 2,653.40\n- U.S. 10-Year Treasury rate is down 0.2 bps at 4.291%\n- E-mini S&P 500 futures are unchanged at 6,493.75\n- E-mini Nasdaq-100 futures are down 0.2% at 23,883.00\n- E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average Index are up 0.64% at 45,283.00\nBitcoin Stats\n- BTC Dominance: 59.4% (-0.42%)\n- Ether-bitcoin ratio: 0.03901 (1.5%)\n- Hashrate (seven-day moving average): 908 EH/s\n- Hashprice (spot): $58.40\n- Total fees: 4.33 BTC / $519,718\n- CME Futures Open Interest: 140,870 BTC\n- BTC priced in gold: 35.7 oz.\n- BTC vs gold market cap: 10.08%\nTechnical Analysis\n- Bitcoin dominance recently fell below the key historical level of 60%.\n- In the past, such drops have often preceded significant altcoin rallies. However, given the current lack of a strong catalyst for a full-fledged altcoin season, the key question is the potential severity of the drop.\n- The current level suggests that a selective or minor 'alt season' is underway. It does not yet imply a major, market-wide shift in the way previous cycles have.\nCrypto Equities\n- Strategy (MSTR): closed on Thursday at $372.94 (-4.35%), unchanged in pre-market\n- Coinbase Global (COIN): closed at $324.89 (-0.65%), +0.11% at $325.25\n- Circle (CRCL): closed at $139.23 (-9.1%), -1.61% at $136.99\n- Galaxy Digital (GLXY): closed at $28.57 (+0.81%), -0.25% at $28.50\n- Bullish (BLSH): closed at $74.63 (+9.75%), +1.73% at $75.99\n- MARA Holdings (MARA): closed at $15.75 (-0.69%), -0.13% at $15.73\n- Riot Platforms (RIOT): closed at $12.25 (+5.69%), -1.14% at $12.11\n- Core Scientific (CORZ): closed at $13.84 (-0.11%), -0.61% at $13.75\n- CleanSpark (CLSK): closed at $9.95 (-0.2%), +0.3% at $9.98\n- CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI): closed at $26.97 (+5.76%)\n- Semler Scientific (SMLR): closed at $35.13 (-1.24%), unchanged in pre-market\n- Exodus Movement (EXOD): closed at $26.85 (-1.79%), +8.01% at $29\n- SharpLink Gaming (SBET): closed at $23.49 (-0.13%), -0.17% at $23.45\nETF Flows\nSpot BTC ETFs\n- Daily net flows: $230.8 million\n- Cumulative net flows: $54.97 billion\n- Total BTC holdings ~1.29 million\nSpot ETH ETFs\n- Daily net flows: $639.6 million\n- Cumulative net flows: $12.75 billion\n- Total ETH holdings ~6.27 million\nSource: Farside Investors\nChart of the Day\n- The total value locked (TVL) on yield-trading platform Pendle has surged past the $8 billion mark, representing a roughly 30% increase this month and positioning it as the ninth largest protocol by TVL.\n- The majority of the growth has taken place on the Ethereum blockchain.\n- A key factor driving growth is its close relationship with Ethena's stablecoin. Some 68% of Pendle's TVL is tied to USDe and sUSDe, making the protocol a direct proxy for the growth of Ethena's ecosystem and a bet on the continued expansion of high-yield, stablecoin-based strategies in the market.\nWhile You Were Sleeping\n- Altcoin Season Could Begin in September as Bitcoin’s Grip on Crypto Market Weakens: Coinbase Institutional (CoinDesk): Investor rotation into altcoins could accelerate in September, fueled by declining bitcoin dominance, better liquidity for alternative tokens and improving risk appetite, Coinbase Institutional’s David Duong said.\n- Circle to Offer 10 Million Class A Shares at $130 Each (CoinDesk): The stablecoin issuer is selling 2 million shares in a secondary offering, while insiders are offloading the other 8 million at over four times the price of the June IPO.\n- Hong Kong Regulator Tightens Custody Standards for Licensed Crypto Exchanges (CoinDesk): The SFC set minimum standards for senior management responsibility, cold wallet operations, third-party wallet solutions and real-time threat monitoring after finding cyber and asset-protection weaknesses at some licensed platforms.\n- Crypto Group Backed by Trump Sons Hunts for Bitcoin Companies in Asia (Financial Times): U.S.-based miner American Bitcoin, co-founded by Eric Trump, is reportedly pursuing listed firms in Japan and Hong Kong to convert into bitcoin-treasury vehicles, seeking to spark demand through stock-market exposure.\n- China’s Economy Slows Broadly Even as Exports Keep Rising (The New York Times): China’s statistics bureau linked July’s slowdown in retail sales, factory output and fixed-asset investment primarily to escalating trade frictions, which its chief economist characterized as protectionism and unilateralism.\n- Japan’s Economy Records Modest Growth Despite Trade Uncertainty (The Wall Street Journal): Second-quarter GDP rose 0.3%, but economists warn automakers’ prolonged absorption of U.S. tariff costs could squeeze profits, curb wage growth and dent household spending.\nIn the Ether\nJamie Crawley, Siamak Masnavi contributed reporting.\nJames Van Straten\nJames Van Straten is a Senior Analyst at CoinDesk, specializing in Bitcoin and its interplay with the macroeconomic environment.

        "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-falls-behind-solana/",
        "text": "Recent data has shown that Ethereum briefly fell behind Solana in a major metric. This has raised questions about what it could mean for the altcoin season, since ETH usually leads the way during that period.\nEthereum Falls Behind Solana In Perp Volume\nDeFiLlama data shows that Ethereum fell behind Solana in perp volume by chains on August 14. The former recorded a perp volume of $2.667 billion while the latter recorded a perp volume of $2.989 billion during this period. However, Ethereum has quickly reclaimed its position above Solana to rank second behind Hyperliquid over the last two days.\nFurther data shows that Ethereum recorded $2.22 billion in perp volume on August 15, while Solana saw $1.635 billion in volume. Meanwhile, Ethereum hit $2.22 billion again in perp volume on August 16 while Solana’s volume stood at $1.635. Over the last 30 days, ETH is also well ahead of Solana, with the former recording a $61.067 billion volume while the latter hit $44.406 billion in perp volume.\nFurthermore, Ethereum ranks number one in terms of decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, above Solana. The former’s DEX volume in the last 24 hours stands at $4.817 billion, while the latter’s stands at $3.869 billion. Over the last 30 days, ETH has also recorded the most DEX volume, hitting $123.513 billion, while Solana hit $114.681 billion.\nEthereum’s lead in these major metrics coincides with the resurgence of its native coin, ETH. The largest altcoin by market cap is up over 33% in the last 30 days and 78% in the last 90 days. Solana is up just 10% and 11% during these periods, respectively. This suggests that ETH is still likely to lead the altcoin season when it finally happens, with its dominance notably rising against Bitcoin’s.\nAltcoin Season Is Coming, And ETH Is Driving It\nIn an X post, Coinbase declared that the altcoin season is coming and suggested that Ethereum is the major catalyst behind the altcoin season. The exchange noted that as September approaches, the transition to a full-scale altcoin season is likely. They added that this positive outlook stems from macro trends such as potential Fed rate cuts and expected regulatory advancements.\nRegarding Ethereum’s role, Coinbase stated that institutional interest in ETH is driving the altcoin season at the moment. This interest is fueled by digital asset treasuries like BitMine and stablecoin narratives. The exchange added that the divergence in the altcoin season index and total altcoin market cap reflects rising institutional interest in ETH.\nAt the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $4,400 while Solana is at $188, both down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",

        "text": "Ethereum is trading at critical levels after days of volatility, pushing closer to its all-time high near $4,800. Bulls remain in control, and the market is increasingly focused on whether ETH can break through resistance and confirm a new phase of the uptrend. Adding to the momentum, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc., a blockchain technology company primarily based in the United States, announced that it has just purchased $129.9 million worth of ETH following a brief day of inactivity.\nThis strategic acquisition highlights the growing trend of institutional players allocating directly into Ethereum, reinforcing confidence in its long-term value. Bitmine’s move mirrors similar treasury strategies adopted by firms such as Sharplink Gaming, signaling a wider corporate shift toward ETH accumulation. The timing is notable, as exchange balances continue to shrink and demand intensifies, placing supply-side pressure on the market.\nFor investors, the convergence of institutional buying and strong technical positioning suggests Ethereum may be gearing up for a decisive breakout. However, with volatility still high, market participants are closely watching whether ETH can sustain momentum above key levels and solidify its leadership role in the broader altcoin rally.\nEthereum Accumulation Grows As Bitmine Expands Holdings\nWith this latest acquisition, Bitmine’s total holdings now stand at 1.174 million ETH, valued at approximately $5.26 billion. This ongoing accumulation trend comes at a critical juncture for Ethereum, as the asset tests major resistance levels near its all-time highs.\nThe timing of Bitmine’s purchase highlights a growing conviction among institutional players that Ethereum will continue to outperform in the current cycle. Exchange reserves and OTC desk supply have been steadily shrinking, signaling strong demand while available liquidity dries up. This tightening supply dynamic often serves as fuel for sharp upward price movements, particularly when paired with significant institutional inflows like those from Bitmine.\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin remains under pressure just below its all-time high, struggling to confirm a breakout. This contrast is shaping a new phase in the crypto market, where Ethereum’s relative strength is becoming increasingly evident. If ETH successfully pushes through resistance, it could lead the next leg of the altcoin rally, with liquidity flowing toward stronger assets in the sector.\nPrice Holds Key Support After Strong Rally\nEthereum’s price action shows resilience despite the recent pullback from highs near $4,800. On the 4-hour chart, ETH is currently trading around $4,422, holding above the 50-period moving average at $4,347. This level is acting as short-term dynamic support, suggesting that buyers remain active even after profit-taking at the top.\nThe rally over the past weeks has been marked by higher highs and higher lows, confirming strong bullish structure. Volume spikes during upward moves highlight continued demand, while the most recent correction has seen relatively lower selling volume, an encouraging sign for bulls. The 100- and 200-period moving averages at $3,988 and $3,780, respectively, remain far below the current price, reinforcing the broader uptrend.\nIf ETH maintains support above $4,350, a rebound toward $4,600–$4,800 is likely, with a potential breakout attempt at all-time highs. However, a breakdown below the 50-period moving average could trigger a deeper correction, with $4,000 as the next major support zone. With bullish fundamentals, reduced supply, and growing institutional interest, the market appears poised for a decisive move.\nFeatured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",

        "text": "Ethereum is now at the center of market attention as Bitcoin fails to confirm a breakout above its all-time highs. While BTC’s momentum stalls, altcoins are struggling to extend their strength, leaving Ethereum in a decisive position. Trading above $4,400, ETH is now less than 10% away from reaching new record highs.\nBulls remain confident in a continuation of the uptrend. Analysts argue that accumulation trends and strong on-chain activity point to further gains ahead. Exchange reserves continue to decline, while OTC desks show thinning liquidity, suggesting demand is outpacing available supply. This combination has historically preceded sharp upward moves.\nHowever, risks are also growing as the market enters a new phase. With Bitcoin showing weakness near its highs, Ethereum’s ability to decouple and push forward will determine the direction of altcoins broadly. Some analysts view this as the beginning of a true altseason, while others warn that failure to sustain momentum could trigger a correction.\nEthereum MVRV Ratio Signals Potential Short-Term Pullback\nAccording to top analyst On-Chain Mind, Ethereum’s MVRV ratio is moving into the +3σ to +4σ zone, a range that has historically marked overheated conditions and led to short-term pullbacks. This suggests that profit-taking pressure is likely to surface between $4,600 and $5,200, creating a critical test for ETH in the days ahead.\nDespite these risks, Ethereum remains strong, less than 10% away from new all-time highs, and many analysts believe a breakout could still materialize. Some expect consolidation as short-term holders lock in gains, while others view the current setup as the prelude to Ethereum pushing decisively beyond its previous highs.\nInstitutional accumulation continues to accelerate, with large players treating ETH as both an investment and a strategic asset. Meanwhile, legal clarity across key jurisdictions has reduced uncertainty, creating a more stable environment for long-term adoption. At the same time, exchange supply has been steadily declining, signaling conviction among holders and reducing potential selling pressure.\nIf Ethereum breaks through resistance levels despite its overheated MVRV, it could spark a powerful continuation rally, potentially leading the broader altcoin market. However, if profit-taking dominates, a pullback would not weaken the bullish trend but instead set the stage for healthier continuation later.\nTechnical Details: Key Levels To Hold\nEthereum is showing remarkable momentum on the weekly chart, now trading at $4,447 after hitting a recent peak at $4,792, just below its 2021 all-time high. The price has surged above the 50, 100, and 200-week moving averages, with the 50-week SMA ($2,771) crossing decisively above the longer-term averages. This alignment confirms a strong bullish structure that historically precedes extended rallies.\nVolume has also expanded notably during this rally, reflecting strong demand and conviction from buyers. The breakout from the $3,600–$3,800 resistance zone has been followed by sharp upward momentum, showing that bulls remain firmly in control. However, Ethereum is now approaching historically significant resistance near $4,800–$4,900, where sellers could attempt to cap gains.\nIf ETH manages a weekly close above $4,800, the path toward fresh all-time highs above $5,000 becomes increasingly probable. On the other hand, failure to hold above current levels could trigger a healthy correction back to the $4,200–$4,000 support zone, where the 50-week SMA is now acting as a cushion.\nFeatured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",

This zone has now emerged as a key support level, tested multiple times without breaking.\nBONK subsequently staged a modest recovery, gaining roughly 1% from $0.000024 to $0.00002425. The rebound was fueled by sharp volume spikes at 10:48 UTC and 10:49 UTC, 21.99 billion and 31.43 billion tokens, respectively, suggesting accumulation from larger players just above prior resistance.\nTraders now face a defined battle line: resistance remains fixed at $0.000026, with support anchored at $0.000023. A sustained push above $0.000025 could signal the beginning of a more pronounced upward move, while a break of the lower bound risks retesting early-August lows, according to the model.\nBONK’s continued high liquidity, even amid recent volatility, underscores its position as one of the more active tokens in the meme coin sector. Institutional participation has kept price action tightly bound, but it has also increased the potential for sudden breakouts should order books thin at key levels.\nTechnical Analysis\n- Trading range: $0.000023–$0.000026 over the 23-hour period.\n- Resistance locked at $0.000026 after 4.02T token sell wall.\n- Support confirmed at $0.000023 with 1.07T tokens traded.\n- Price closed at $0.00002448, down 0.92% over the period.\n- Late-session bounce from $0.000024 to $0.00002425 (+1%).\n- Volume spikes at 10:48 UTC (21.99B) and 10:49 UTC (31.43B) suggest accumulation.\n- Consolidation zone emerging between $0.000024 and $0.000025.\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

        "text": "Ethereum is on the brink of reclaiming its all-time high, after setting a fresh multi-year peak at $4,792. Bulls remain firmly in control, driving momentum as Bitcoin pauses in a consolidation range. This stall in BTC’s advance has created room for altcoins to shine, igniting a broad bullish phase across the market.\nInstitutional demand continues to play a pivotal role in Ethereum’s rally. On-chain data shows a steady accumulation by large investors, with wallets linked to major institutions and funds consistently adding to their holdings. This buying pressure is reinforced by a tightening supply dynamic — ETH balances on exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) desks are rapidly declining, reducing the amount of coins readily available for sale.\nThe combination of shrinking supply, strong investor confidence, and a favorable macro backdrop has put Ethereum in a prime position to challenge its previous highs. Market participants are closely watching the $4,800–$4,900 range as a critical resistance zone. A breakout above this level could set the stage for new price discovery and accelerate the altcoin market’s bullish momentum.\nEthereum Whale Activity Signals Confidence Ahead of Potential Altseason\nAccording to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence, Ethereum has just witnessed one of its largest single whale transactions of the year. A newly created wallet withdrew 60,000 ETH — valued at approximately $284.76 million — from Coinbase Prime last night. The entire sum is now being staked, signaling a strong long-term commitment to holding and securing the network.\nFurther analysis shows that the whale has already moved 3,200 ETH (worth $14.75 million) into four separate wallets. Notably, one of these wallets has deposited its share directly into Coinbase Staking, confirming that this is not a speculative short-term trade but rather a deliberate accumulation and yield-generation strategy. The wallet address, 0x697D8eFb007Ec5CCAC0C67290D545b916348480B, is now on the radar of market watchers.\nAnalysts suggest that such large-scale staking activity is a bullish signal for Ethereum’s price trajectory. By locking up a substantial amount of ETH, this whale effectively removes significant liquidity from the market, potentially tightening supply during a period of strong institutional demand.\nSome market experts believe Ethereum could become the primary catalyst for a broader altseason in the coming weeks. With Bitcoin consolidating near record highs, capital rotation into high-quality altcoins — led by ETH — could ignite a fresh wave of market enthusiasm, pushing the sector into a more aggressive bullish phase.\nPrice Action Details: Weekly Chart Analysis\nEthereum (ETH) continues its impressive rally, closing the week with a strong gain and pushing to a multi-year high near $4,792, just shy of its all-time high. The weekly chart shows a steep upward trajectory over the past month, with ETH breaking through key resistance levels at $3,200 and $4,000 with little hesitation.\nThe 50-week moving average (blue) has crossed decisively above the 100-week MA (green), signaling strong bullish momentum. Price action remains well above the 200-week MA (red) at around $2,443, underlining the strength of the current uptrend. Volume has also spiked notably during this rally, indicating that buying pressure is supported by solid market participation rather than thin liquidity.\nHowever, the sharp vertical move suggests overextended short-term conditions, raising the risk of a pullback or consolidation before the next leg higher. As long as ETH holds above the $4,200–$4,300 support zone, the bullish structure remains intact, with traders eyeing a potential breakout into uncharted territory.\nFeatured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",

        "text": "As cryptocurrency gained significant recognition in the financial sector, Ethereum is experiencing notable adoption at the institutional level, with big firms hoarding the altcoin in their treasury reserves. Following this massive wave of accumulation from individuals and institutions, Tom Lee believes ETH could become the leading asset in the future, as the financial system evolves.\nThe Next Biggest Investment Story Is Ethereum\nIn the midst of robust adoption and interest in Ethereum, Tom Lee, the co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, has dropped a bullish comment about the altcoin’s future in the financial world. His bullish remarks on ETH come as the asset demonstrates significant upward performance, drawing closer to its all-time high.\nDuring an interview on the CNBC Squawk Box, Tom Lee made a bold proclamation that Ethereum is poised to become the biggest macro trade opportunity in the next 10 to 15 years. Lee’s statement is backed by ETH’s growing role in tokenization, decentralized finance, and blockchain infrastructure.\nEthereum’s network effects and usefulness put it in a position to play a revolutionary role in the global digital economy. In addition to being a cryptocurrency, the founder’s prediction paints ETH as a long-term, highly conviction investment that is set to revolutionize technology and banking.\nOne of the major factors that solidifies Lee’s claim is the notable role of stablecoins on the ETH network, which has become the ChatGPT moment for crypto. Adding to this is the recently signed GENIUS Act and the Project Crypto from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), reflecting Wall Street’s growing interest in the blockchain landscape.\nAs Ethereum gains ground in the financial sector, the founder stated that the Ethereum treasury is revolutionizing exposure to the altcoin, becoming the best approach in recent times.\nWhen asked about his unwavering bullish stance on ETH, Lee pointed to the distinction between the altcoin and Bitcoin. According to Lee, Ethereum is able to perform several programmable contracts like Smart Contracts, which Bitcoin fails to do, and Wall Street needs it. “It is the place where Wall Street is essentially financializing the system,” he added.\nBeing the second-largest blockchain, ETH now handles the majority of stablecoin creations in the crypto sector. Prominent companies such as JP Morgan, Coinbase, and Robinhood are building their Layer 2s on Ethereum, cementing its position as a leading blockchain.\nETH To Rise Beyond $7,500 Target\nEthereum is seeing multiple bullish forecasts as its price surges. The most recent bullish prediction comes from Standard Chartered, which has forecasted a move to new all-time highs, particularly to the $7,500 level.\nOffering his insights on this bold forecast, Lee has backed the prediction, stating that the target is within the realm of expectations for this cycle. However, for the altcoin to achieve this new target, it needs to clear its current all-time high of $4,891.\nOnce the altcoin manages to surpass its all-time high, the founder believes that $7,500 might be a low target. Considering ETH’s potential, Lee foresees a much larger rally to the $10,000 and $15,000 price range.",

Over the past six days, these funds have attracted more than $2.3 billion, driving ETH prices above $4,900.\nStandard Chartered has raised its year-end price forecast for ETH from $4,000 to $7,500, citing ETF inflows, institutional buying, and strengthening network fundamentals. Since June, ETFs have absorbed 3.9% of Ethereum’s circulating supply, outpacing even corporate treasury accumulation.\nWhale Activity Signals Confidence in Ethereum’s (ETH) Future\nAs Ethereum trades at $4,730, just 2.5% below its record peak, large holders, or “whales,” are making decisive moves. A mysterious investor recently purchased 379,000 ETH worth $1.8 billion in just 10 days, while another whale re-entered the market with a $70 million buy after previously selling.\nNot all large-scale activity is bullish, some early ICO participants and even the Radiant Capital hacker have taken profits, but the sheer volume of strategic accumulation suggests strong confidence in Ethereum’s long-term trajectory.\nOn-chain data shows significant withdrawals from major exchanges, reducing immediate selling pressure and supporting the bullish case.\nETH's price trends to the upside on the daily chart.

        "text": "Ethereum is on the verge of rewriting history, trading near $4,792 — its highest level since November 2021 and just shy of its all-time high (ATH) around $4,860. The recent surge has cemented bullish control over the market, with buyers steadily pushing prices higher after weeks of strong momentum. However, many analysts are cautious, noting that the ATH zone is a critical resistance level that may take several days, or even weeks, to decisively break.\nWhile the technical setup remains overwhelmingly positive, a wave of speculation has emerged around potential market suppression. A growing narrative suggests that entities such as Wintermute and Binance could be influencing short-term price movements. Onchain analysts have highlighted large transfers between Binance and Wintermute wallets, coinciding with abrupt intraday pullbacks — adding fuel to the debate over whether these moves are intentional liquidity plays or routine market operations.\nDespite these concerns, Ethereum’s long-term outlook appears strong, with shrinking exchange supply and robust buying interest from institutional and retail investors alike. If bulls can absorb selling pressure near the ATH, Ethereum could enter a price discovery phase for the first time in years — a scenario that could trigger an aggressive upward breakout into uncharted territory.\nEthereum And Solana Hold Uptrend Amid Onchain Market Maker Activity\nEthereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are both displaying notable resilience, with strong momentum suggesting they are seeking higher price levels. According to top analyst Ted Pillows, the latest market dip — which occurred in the final hour of trading — wasn’t driven by retail selling pressure, but by significant movements between Binance and Wintermute.\nOnchain data, Pillows explained, shows a series of large transfers totaling millions of dollars in both ETH and SOL. These transactions coincided almost exactly with the sudden price pullback, hinting at coordinated market maker activity rather than a shift in broader sentiment.\nThe analyst emphasized that “proof is on-chain,” pointing to transparent blockchain records of wallet movements between Binance and Wintermute, a well-known liquidity provider. While such transfers are not inherently bearish, their timing has raised eyebrows, particularly as both assets were pressing against critical resistance levels — with ETH nearing its all-time high and SOL pushing toward multi-month peaks.\nThe coming sessions could be pivotal. ETH and Bitcoin are both in a high-stakes battle with their respective ATH levels, where breakout attempts face concentrated liquidity from sellers. If buyers can absorb the pressure, the market could transition into a more aggressive bullish phase. However, if similar large-scale transfers trigger more intraday dips, traders may face an extended consolidation period before the next leg higher.\nPrice Action Details: Testing All-Time High Liquidity Zone\nEthereum’s weekly chart shows a powerful surge, with price reaching $4,792 — its highest level since November 2021. The move marks a continuation of the strong bullish momentum that started after ETH broke above the $3,000 level in late July. The recent candles show large-bodied gains, confirming aggressive buying interest and sustained demand.\nThe current price of $4,719 sits just below the all-time high of $4,860, a historically significant resistance. This level may act as a psychological barrier, potentially triggering short-term profit-taking before any confirmed breakout. However, the steep upward slope of the 50-week moving average (blue) and the distance from the 100-week and 200-week MAs suggest that momentum remains firmly on the bulls’ side.\nFailure to break above $4,860 in the short term could result in a healthy retest toward the $4,300–$4,400 zone, aligning with the breakout area from early August. This level would likely act as a strong support before any renewed attempt at higher highs.\nFeatured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",

        "text": "Analysts at Standard Chartered have revised their long-term Ethereum target from $7,500, following the altcoin’s resurgence. They also outlined reasons why they are bullish on ETH, including the network’s dominance as the foremost layer-1 blockchain.\nStandard Chartered Predicts Ethereum To Reach $25,000 By 2028 Year-End\nAccording to a Reuters report, Standard Chartered has raised its 2028 year-end target for Ethereum from $7,500 to $25,000. Meanwhile, the bank also raised its year-end target from $4,000 to $7,500. Analysts at the firm noted an improvement in industry engagement and an increase in holdings of ETH in recent months.\nEthereum has surged over 81% in the last three months and has recently rallied to a new yearly high of around $4,700. With this, the altcoin now has its current all-time high (ATH) of $4,891 in sight, which it reached way back in 2021. Standard Chartered believes that Ethereum’s dominance as the foremost blockchain, which processes the most stablecoin transactions, will help provide a boost for ETH’s price.\nThe firm’s head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, said that the stablecoin sector would grow 8 times by the end of 2028. He noted that this would have a significant direct impact on fees on the Ethereum network. Therefore, they expect ETH’s demand to surge massively as more people use stablecoins on the network.\nIn line with this, Kendrick said that ETH’s long-term growth depends on the usage of its layer-1 (and not layer-2s) for high-value transactions, especially those that have ties to traditional finance. The analyst remarked that a big boost in the network’s capacity could help achieve this.\nExperts such as BitMine’s Tom Lee have already stated that Ethereum will be the network of choice as the tokenization hype heats up. Lee explained that the network has legal clarity and has never had downtimes like some of its competitors.\nETH Treasury Companies Could Hold 10% of Total Supply\nThe Standard Chartered analyst also declared that Ethereum treasury companies have the potential to hold 10% of all ETH in circulation. These companies are expected to provide massive demand for the altcoin, which could also contribute to higher prices. Tom Lee’s BitMine, the largest ETH treasury firm, has already declared its intention to hold 5% of the total supply.\nThe company recently filed a $20 billion stock offering, with plans to use the net proceeds to advance its Ethereum strategy. Other companies like SharpLink Gaming and the Ether Machine are also actively raising capital to buy more ETH. Notably, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan recently asserted that a supply shock is coming for the altcoin thanks to these companies and the ETFs.\nAt the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $4,733, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",

The move, unveiled on August 15, comes as more publicly listed firms around the globe add crypto to their balance sheets.\nWiseLink Leads Investment\nAccording to the company, Taiwan-based fintech firm WiseLink played a major role in the raise. WiseLink purchased three-year convertible notes and signed a memorandum of understanding with Top Win, outlining a plan to work together on what it calls a “bitcoin + cross-border finance” initiative.\nOther private investors also took part, including Chad Koehn, founder of United Capital Management of Kansas. The fresh capital will be directed mainly toward Bitcoin purchases, with a portion kept for working capital needs.\nStock Reaction To Bitcoin Strategy\nThe news of the capital raise was seemingly well-received by market participants on Friday. At the time of writing, Top Win International’s stock had seen a pre-market price increase of 12.5%, trading at $5.80.\nThe price was a 50% drop from the $12.12 reported in pre-market trading on the day that the company announced its pivot to Bitcoin accumulation. Still, the stock is up almost 51% year-to-date, showing investors remain engaged despite the swings.\nRiding The Bitcoin Treasury Trend\nReports have disclosed that Top Win is joining a growing list of companies holding BTC as a core reserve.

That statement has been seen by market observers as a sign of stronger institutional backing for Bitcoin in the US.\nFor Top Win, the decision is a major step beyond luxury retail.

        "text": "A widely shared cycle model has reopened the debate over whether Bitcoin’s recent rally has already peaked.\nAccording to posts on social platforms, the chart lines up past market cycles and points to a possible top on December 22, 2025, while price action near $117,000 this week keeps both cautious and bullish cases alive.\nCycle Model Points To December Peak\nBased on reports, the chart tracks previous peaks occurring over 30 months after prior market lows, then extends that pattern to a 37-month span from the November 2022 bottom.\nThe projection places a modeled top on December 22, 2025, and the same curve gives a mid-cycle price target near $200,000.\nThose time-based markers have drawn attention because they fit a clear pattern: each cycle so far has been longer than the one before it.\nVeteran Trader Issues A Risk Scenario\nAccording to public comments, veteran trader Peter Brandt has weighed in with a downside scenario. He gave Bitcoin a 30% chance of having already topped in this cycle and suggested a pullback to about $60,000–$70,000 by November 2026 could come before a later major rally toward $500,000.\nI think there is a 30% chance that BTC has topped for this bull market cycle. Next stop then back to $60k to $70k by Nov 2026, then next bull thrust to $500k https://t.co/xPujqCjp9e\n— Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) August 15, 2025\nBrandt framed his view as a probability rather than a firm prediction, and that kind of numeric thinking is meant to help traders weigh risk rather than to declare certainty.\nAt the time of reporting, Bitcoin was trading around $117,790, down 0.90% over the past 24 hours. Price has dropped 0.18% over the last seven days and 0.38% over the last month.\nOver longer frames, BTC has risen 18% in the last six months and is up 24% year to date. Those figures help explain why opinions diverge: some see a market that has run far and fast, while others point to steady gains that still leave room for more upside.\nSignals To Watch Next\nBased on market practice, the clearest ways to test these scenarios are flows and positioning. Track ETF and institutional inflows, exchange balances, and derivatives data.\nA steady stream of institutional buying would make a long, deep retrace less likely. On the flip side, sustained outflows, rising exchange inventory, or heavy derivative liquidations would strengthen the case for a larger pullback toward the $60k–$70k zone.\nHas Bitcoin Already Peaked?\nBrandt’s estimate — a 30% chance BTC has already peaked and a possible slide to $60,000–$70,000 by November 2026 before a later push toward $500,000 — gives traders a concrete downside scenario to factor into position sizing and risk plans.\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

The company originally had an option for as many as 17,280 units but decided to move fast to avoid price hikes from US tariffs on Chinese-made mining gear.\nIndustry trackers say orders of this scale have been rare for American miners in 2025. While the firm has not revealed where the rigs will be deployed, sources familiar with the matter said they plan to distribute them across multiple large sites to reduce operational risks.\nBitmain’s Antminers at Hut 8’s Vega facility in Texas. Source: The Miner Mag.\nPolitical And Trade Pressures\nThe deal came just before the Trump administration began enforcing tariffs on imported Chinese mining hardware. The policy covers a wide range of technology goods, including ASIC miners, and is aimed at pushing production back to the US. However, critics say these tariffs could raise operating costs for domestic miners.\nJaran Mellerud, CEO of BTC mining firm Hashlabs, warned that higher costs could cut into profitability. He warned that steep price increases could raise mining costs in the US to a point where demand collapses, blaming regulators he viewed as ineffective.\nBitmain Eyes US Expansion\nBitmain, which controls about 80% of the global ASIC market according to a University of Cambridge study, is adjusting its operations in response to the tariffs.\nThe company plans to open its first US-based ASIC production site in early 2026. By the end of this year, it also expects to set up a new headquarters in Texas or Florida.\nThe aim is to make its products accessible to US customers at reasonable prices and escape import taxes by manufacturing locally.\nIndustry experts opine that this action would prompt other industry leaders such as MicroBT and Canaan to explore the possibility of diverting some production capacity to North America.\nAlthough the complete implications of the tariffs on the mining supply chain are still uncertain, this recent acquisition indicates the depth of stakes for manufacturers and operators alike.\nFor American Bitcoin, the $314 million order indicates faith in the profitability of the industry in spite of fluctuating Bitcoin prices and increased competition.\nFor Bitmain, it’s an indication that being able to bend with political and economic gusts will be the ticket to maintaining its dominance of the US market.\nFeatured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView",

Prices fell and crypto commentators called out the gap between a firm “no” on buying and a later “we’re exploring” stance.\nThe Treasury, for its part, also confirmed it will stop selling existing Bitcoin holdings and that the reserve is valued in a range Bessent put at between $15 billion and $20 billion.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview with Fox, “We are not going to be buying,” referring to crypto reserves, and will instead use seized assets.

Exploration without a firm plan keeps uncertainty high, and in crypto that can mean quick price swings.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $118,872, down 2.4% in the last 24 hours, data from CoinMarketCap shows.\nFeatured image from Drive, chart from TradingView",

Combined, the two Musk-linked companies now hold roughly $2.42 billion in Bitcoin on paper, a figure that depends entirely on the price snapshot used to value the coins.\nReports say the Treasury’s plan to rely on confiscated crypto for any government reserve rather than buying new BTC could keep selling pressure off the market short term, but price action will follow many signals — macro moves, on-chain flows, and public remarks from big holders.\nAccording to multiple reports, SpaceX’s remaining 8,285 BTC is worth about $1.02 billion, but that headline number is now sensitive to fast price swings after the Treasury’s announcement.\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",

        "text": "The Bitcoin reversal over the $121,000 level has triggered another wave of bullish sentiment in the market. This has led to expectations that the bull rally will continue and that the leading digital asset is set to put in a new all-time high above its previous $123,000 peak. This has also come with the formation of multiple bullish patterns on the Bitcoin price chart that lend credence to predictions that a new all-time high is on the horizon.\nBull Flags Put Bitcoin At New All-Time Highs\nCrypto analyst Madden shared an interesting development on the Bitcoin price chart after its recent rally. This analysis focused on the recent break that has now ended the long-standing consolidation that points toward a continuation of the rally. Additionally, the analyst also outlined the possible next steps for the Bitcoin price and where it could end up.\nOne of the most notable things that has happened during this time is that the price was able to retest and break out of the channel above $117,000. As Madden explains, this retest and break have now led to the creation of a possible bull flag, and this could point to a further price surge.\nThere is also the fact that there is now a rising blue diagonal line from the previous support, suggesting higher lows for the Bitcoin price. Then again, a bullish cross could possibly be on the horizon. This is forming in the MACD-indicator that suggests that bears will continue to lose their hold on the market.\nTaking all of these developments into account and adding in the fact that Bitcoin is now forming a textbook bull flag, the most likely outcome from here is that the cryptocurrency will see a possible 10% increase to notch new peaks.\nHow High Can The Bull Flags Take The BTC Price?\nThree bull flags are highlighted in the chart that could see the Bitcoin price hit new all-time high after all-time high. The first bull flag is at the $127,500 level that would signal the first continuation of the bullish trend. Once this is established, then the other two bull flags come into play.\nNext is the second bull flag at the $131,500 level as the bulls continue to dominate the market. Then, last but not least, is the third bull flag marked at the $136,900 level, to complete a 10% increase from its current all-time high.",

        "text": "The Bitcoin dominance has now fallen below 60% for the first time in six months. But despite altcoins moving to grab more market share, this high dominance has remained a hindrance for the altcoin market. Given this, the Bitcoin dominance is expected to continue to determine where the crypto market will be headed from here, and by extension, when the altcoin season will begin.\nHow Bitcoin Dominance Is Driving The Market\nAs the crypto market struggles to find its footing in an ever-changing macro landscape, Bitcoin’s dominance continues to put pressure on the broader altcoin market. Crypto analyst Luca points this out in an analysis that focused on the Bitcoin dominance and how it is driving the market recently.\nLuca points out that the Bitcoin dominance had actually dropped below a notable level for the first time this cycle. This is the Weekly Bull Market Support Band, and the last time that the dominance was below this level was back during the last cycle. In addition to breaking below this support band, the Bitcoin dominance also happened to have retested this same level as resistance.\nHistorically, such a move is not bullish for the price, but the bearishness tends to play out over a longer period of time compared to the short-term. As Luca explains, this is because it signals that risk appetites are high once again, and market makers tend to use this as a distribution tool.\nAmid this, the crypto analyst expects that attention will begin to shift as investors rotate out of Bitcoin. Naturally, this rotation would lead to a move into altcoins, which currently have a higher margin for profits compared to Bitcoin, which is trading close to all-time highs.\nAltcoin Season And The Dominance Bottom\nOnce the rotation from Bitcoin to altcoins begins, then it could signal the start of the altcoin season. This would be characterized by a massive drop in the Bitcoin dominance as large-cap altcoins begin to rally and steal market share. Then, the wait for the Bitcoin dominance bottom begins.\nLuca points out that this phase will only end once the Bitcoin dominance finds a bottom. As for where the bottom might lie, the crypto analyst points to the 47%-48% level as the possible bottom. Once this happens, it would signal an end to the altcoin season as Bitcoin begins to take control again.",

        "text": "Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz says a million-dollar Bitcoin next year wouldn’t be a victory but rather a sign that the US economy is in serious trouble.\n“People who cheer for the million-dollar Bitcoin price next year, I was like, Guys, it only gets there if we’re in such a shitty place domestically,” Novogratz told Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast on Wednesday.\nNovogratz prefers stability over soaring BTC prices\n“I’d rather have a lower Bitcoin price in a more stable United States than the opposite,” Novogratz said, explaining that severe currency devaluations often come at the expense of civil society.\nWhen a national currency falls, investors often seek alternative safe havens to protect their wealth, and Bitcoin\nis frequently referred to as digital gold.Crypto analyst Wolf Of All Streets echoed a similar sentiment in an interview with Cointelegraph Magazine in July 2023: “The faster it happens, the worse the world is.”\nHowever, several Bitcoiners have been speculating on the possibility of a million-dollar Bitcoin by 2026. One of them is BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes, who said in October 2023 that he expects Bitcoin to be $750,000 to $1 million by then. He has recently been more vocal about his prediction of Bitcoin reaching $250,000 by the end of this year.\nMore recently, Jan3 founder Samson Mow told Cointelegraph Magazine in June that Bitcoin could reach $1 million “maybe this year, maybe next year.”\nNovogratz says Scott Bessent “is failing”\nNovogratz also voiced concerns over the US’ ongoing debt issues. He suggested that US President Donald Trump’s decision to bring on Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has not had the anticipated outcome.\n“As much as I like Scott Bessent and I think he meant everything he said, he’s failing at bending debt to GDP,” Novogratz said.\n“The deficit is going to be higher, not lower,” he added.\nNovogratz is nervous about the Bitcoin treasury play\nNovogratz warned that the growing adoption by Bitcoin treasury companies could be turning into a bubble.\n“I’m a little nervous in general that there is what feels like a frenzy,” he said, revealing that Galaxy Digital receives approximately five calls weekly from new companies adopting the asset on the balance sheet.\nRelated: Bitcoin’s all-time high gains vanished hours later: Here’s why\n“At one point, that’s what bubbles feel like, when the cab driver asks you about the balance sheet company,” he said.\nIt came only a couple of months after the venture capital (VC) firm Breed shared similar concerns.\nBreed argued a few Bitcoin treasury companies will stand the test of time and avoid the vicious “death spiral” that will impact BTC holding companies that trade close to net asset value (NAV).\nMagazine: Ether eyes $6K as supply plunges, Justin Sun’s legal saga: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 10 – 16",

Duong frames this as a cyclical transition, with capital moving down the risk curve as market confidence builds.\nBitcoin dominance — its share of total crypto market value — has shown signs of softening after peaking earlier this year. Coinbase argues that as this measure declines, capital historically flows into large-cap altcoins, and then into mid- and small-cap names. This rotation effect, they suggest, will become more pronounced in September.\nLiquidity trends are also turning more favorable for altcoins. Coinbase notes tighter bid-ask spreads and deeper order books across major exchanges, making it easier for traders to enter and exit altcoin positions without incurring heavy slippage. Improved liquidity often encourages participation from larger players who might otherwise avoid less-traded tokens.\nThe third factor is sentiment. Duong writes that as macro conditions stabilize and volatility remains contained, investors are more likely to seek higher returns in riskier crypto assets. This environment could foster sustained inflows into the altcoin market, particularly if bitcoin’s price consolidates rather than surges to new highs.\nCoinbase stops short of predicting which tokens will lead the charge but highlights the pattern from previous market cycles, where blue-chip altcoins outperformed first, followed by smaller-cap assets. The report cautions that while September may mark the start, the duration and magnitude of the move will depend on both market and macroeconomic conditions.\nBTC is up 27.2% year-to-date but has trailed some major altcoins such as ETH (+37.9%) and XRP (+49%), while others like SOL (+1.67%), ADA (+8.96%) and DOGE (-27.5%) have lagged. Coinbase maintains that market conditions overall could favor a broader rotation into altcoins in the coming months.\nSiamak Masnavi\nSiamak Masnavi is a researcher specializing in blockchain technology, cryptocurrency regulations, and macroeconomic trends shaping the crypto market.

The guidelines also form the basis of expectations for virtual asset custodians more broadly.\nBy coupling product expansion with hard rules on asset protection, Hong Kong is looking to differentiate itself from regional rival Singapore, which has taken a more restrictive stance on retail crypto services.\nThe announcement ties directly into the Infrastructure and Safeguards pillars of the SFC’s ASPIRe strategy, unveiled in February at CoinDesk's Consensus 2025 in Hong Kong, which outlines a five-pronged plan to address liquidity fragmentation, regulatory arbitrage, and market volatility while expanding the range of regulated products and services.\nThe custody push follows a series of regulatory moves this year aimed at widening market access while tightening oversight.\nIn February, the regulator announced new licensing regimes for over-the-counter trading and custody services, alongside a review of derivatives and margin trading for virtual assets. In April, it greenlit staking services for licensed exchanges and funds, albeit under strict asset control and risk disclosure requirements.\nSam Reynolds\nSam Reynolds is a senior reporter based in Asia.

Earlier this month, Bo Hines, the leader of the White House's Council of Advisors on Digital Assets — whose tasks, among other things, included the SBR — exited his position.\nBitcoin\ncontinued to trade at about $118,000 late in the U.S. afternoon Thursday, down sharply since hitting a new record high of $124,000 just hours earlier.The bulk of the decline came after a far stronger than anticipated Producer Price Index report, which called into question the idea that inflation is receding enough for the Federal Reserve to trim interest rates in September.\nHelene Braun\nHelene is a New York-based markets reporter at CoinDesk, covering the latest news from Wall Street, the rise of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds and updates on crypto markets.

Here's what's making news in the markets:\nWelcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.\nAs Hong Kong begins its trading day, ETH is changing hands above $4600, down 3% on-day.\nAs ETH is up nearly 16% in the last week, and 45% in the last month, this probably isn't a concern for most traders. After all, the ETH/BTC ratio has broken above its 365-day moving average, a signal that has historically marked extended periods of ETH outperformance, and spot ETF flows are reinforcing the move.\nHowever, the same data shows early warning signs of near-term cooling, as CryptoQuant argued in a recent report.\nDaily ETH inflows to exchanges have surpassed Bitcoin’s, suggesting some holders are positioning to take profits. ETH’s MVRV ratio against BTC has risen from 0.4 in May to 0.8, approaching historical overvaluation territory. CryptoQuant warns that in past cycles, such levels have preceded pauses or pullbacks in ETH’s relative strength.\nTrading desks echo this view.\nIn a recent note, France-based FlowDesk reports that while there were $1 billion in single-day ETH ETF inflows on Monday, with broad client buying versus BTC and SOL, there were also increased call overwriting in ETH options at the $7K–$8K strikes for December — a sign some are capping upside expectations.\nQCP framed ETH’s rally within a macro backdrop of softer headline CPI in its daily Asia Color telegram update, with strong expectations for a September Fed cut, and geopolitical easing, but flags upcoming Jackson Hole remarks and remaining CPI/NFP prints as potential sentiment pivots.\nMarket maker Enflux added in comments to CoinDesk that a hotter-than-expected PPI print reminded traders that inflation risks remain uneven, and that ETH’s outsized performance could invite consolidation.\nWhile the structural drivers remain intact, ETF demand, institutional participation, and favorable on-chain signals, the market is entering a phase where stretched positioning and macro event risk could test ETH’s momentum. As CryptoQuant’s data shows, the rally is strong, but so are the early signs of profit-taking.\nMarket Movers\nBTC: Bitcoin fell over 3% from record highs after hotter U.S. inflation dampened rate cut hopes and the Treasury signaled it will not expand Bitcoin purchases for its strategic reserve.\nETH: ETH is down 3.3% as sell pressure increases, as traders take profit after a record rally.\nGold: Gold fell 0.62% to $3,336.6 as hotter U.S. inflation and strong jobs data boosted the dollar and yields, trimming expectations for a large September Fed rate cut.\nNikkei 225: The Nikkei 225 opened higher as Japan’s economy grew an annualized 1.0% in Q2, beating forecasts on strong exports and capital spending, though analysts warn U.S. tariffs could slow growth in the coming months.\nS&P 500: U.S. stocks stalled Thursday as a hotter-than-expected PPI dampened hopes for a large September rate cut.

        "text": "Wall Street Joins Consumer Advocates to Call for Edit to GENIUS Act on Stablecoins\nU.S. bankers are pushing hard for revisions of the new stablecoin law even before regulators have begun the first steps of writing the rules.\nWhat to know:\n- U.S. banking groups are petitioning lawmakers to make changes to the stablecoin law known as the GENIUS Act, and consumer groups joined them for one of the requests — aligning associations that are typically on opposite sides of policy issues.\n- In one letter, bank lobbyists and the consumer groups asked to cut a provision in the law that could allow state-chartered uninsured depository institutions a business advantage against rivals, and in another, the bankers ask that stablecoin affiliates be stopped from offering yield.\n- The lobbyists are asking that future crypto market structure legislation be used to overhaul the new stablecoin law.\nWall Street bankers are hammering away at some provisions of the new U.S. stablecoin law that was hailed by President Donald Trump and the crypto sector as a huge first step toward establishing a fully regulated U.S. industry, and the banks are joined by unusual bedfellows from the consumer-advocate world in sounding alarms.\nHoping to revise and cut provisions that might threaten aspects of the current financial system, the American Bankers Association and other bank lobbying groups aligned in a letter this week with Americans for Financial Reform — usually a staunch opponent of Wall Street's policy aims — and the National Consumer Law Center. One provision of the stablecoin law known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act lets a stablecoin-issuing subsidiary of a state-chartered uninsured depository institution run money-transmission and custody services nationwide, which the bankers argue bypasses existing state licensing and oversight.\nTheir letter asked several key U.S. senators to insist that whole section be erased entirely.\n\"Ignoring state law in this regard invites regulatory arbitrage, allowing certain uninsured depository institutions special privileges to operate across state lines as federally insured banks currently do, but without the panoply of regulatory and supervisory requirements, or limitations on preemption applicable to those institutions,\" the August 13 letter argued.\nThe bank lobbyists, also cooperated in a separate effort to protect deposits and other core aspects of their businesses from the GENIUS Act, arguing in another letter to lawmakers this week that the law leaves an opening for crypto firms to offer returns on stablecoins. While the law bans stablecoin issuers themselves from offering interest or yield, it doesn't stop the issuers' affiliates or exchanges from doing so indirectly. The bankers fear a massive loss of deposits and money-market fund activity from the resulting rivalry stablecoins might offer.\n\"Congress must protect the flow of credit to American businesses and families and the stability of the most important financial market by closing the stablecoin payment of interest loophole,\" according to the groups, including the ABA, Bank Policy Institute, Financial Services Forum and others. Banks turn deposits into loans, so the lack of deposits threatens necessary U.S. lending.\nFaryar Shirzad, the chief policy officer at U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase, criticized the banks' position in postings on social media site X.\n\"Congress shouldn't be in the business of passing legislation that takes away consumer choice and the opportunity for the average person to earn returns on their hard-earned dollars,\" he wrote, additionally arguing that the $6 trillion figure on what desposits may be at stake is overblown.\n\"Let’s play along for a second,\" Shirzad added. \"If customers really would move $6T away from banks into stablecoins, what does that say about what value consumers feel like they're getting from their banks?\"\nThe GENIUS Act was signed into law by President Trump, but the bigger and more complex legislation to regulate U.S. crypto markets is still pending. That future bill, which already passed the House of Representatives as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, could still overhaul provisions of the stablecoin law, even before that new law is converted into rules by the U.S. financial regulators. That's what the bankers are advocating, alongside their temporary customer-advocate allies.\nRead More: Banks Must Adopt Crypto or 'Be Extinct in 10 Years,' Eric Trump Says\nUPDATE (August 14, 2025, 21:51 UTC): Adds comment from Coinbase's Faryar Shirzad.\nJesse Hamilton\nJesse Hamilton is CoinDesk's deputy managing editor on the Global Policy and Regulation team, based in Washington, D.C.

        "text": "S&P Dow Jones Indices (S&P DJI) is in discussions with major exchanges, custodians and DeFi protocols to license and list tokenized versions of its benchmarks, according to Stephanie Rowton, the firm’s director of US equities.\nRowton told Cointelegraph that the index provider is taking a “strategic approach” to ensure tokenized S&P products are launched only on platforms that meet high standards for transparency, security and regulatory compliance.\n“By establishing these types of relationships, we hope we can work together to participate in a robust infrastructure that supports the trading and accessibility of tokenized versions of our indexes, ultimately enhancing the investor experience,” she said.\nThe push into blockchain comes as institutional interest in tokenized financial products accelerates. S&P DJI entered the space earlier this year by licensing the S&P 500 for a tokenization initiative with Centrifuge, which uses official data to offer programmable index-tracking funds via smart contracts.\nRowton said the move has already generated “an uptick in curiosity and engagement” from both traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) market participants. “This interest reflects a broader market trend as investors increasingly seek innovative and efficient ways to interact with established financial products,” she added.\nRelated: Ex-Binance dealmaker joins Hilbert Group to launch tokenized funds platform\nBridging TradFi and DeFi\nRowton said the blockchain technology has a “transformative potential” in the financial markets. “As demand for digital assets grows, tokenization could play a crucial role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance,” Rowton noted.\nShe added that the S&P DJI’s tokenization strategy aligns with the firm’s mission to meet the needs of “a new generation of investors who are looking for innovative ways to engage with established benchmarks.”\nInterest in tokenized index products is strongest among digitally native investors, including crypto and blockchain participants, as well as institutions seeking to diversify portfolios. Regionally, Europe, Asia and LatAm lead the charge.\nRowton also revealed that the company is evaluating opportunities to tokenize other flagship benchmarks such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and thematic indexes. “We recognize that different investor segments may have varying interests in specific indexes, and we will aim to respond to market demand accordingly,” she said.\nRelated: Animoca launches NUVA marketplace to unify ‘fragmented’ RWA sector\n2030 vision for tokenized indexes\nRowton said tokenized indexes would be “pivotal” in global markets by 2030, enhancing cross-border market access and liquidity. The technology could lower traditional investment barriers, while enabling new strategies that leverage DeFi features like fractional ownership and automated trading.\nHowever, she pushed back on the notion that tokenization threatens S&P DJI’s traditional licensing business. Instead, she described it as “a complementary innovation” that expands commercial opportunities and opens index investing to new audiences without compromising the integrity of the benchmarks.\nRowton’s comments come as tokenized stocks continue to gain momentum, with market capitalization for blockchain-based financial products hitting $370 million by the end of July.\nLast week, OpenEden partnered with BNY Mellon to manage and custody the assets behind its tokenized US Treasury product, TBILL, the first Moody’s “A”-rated tokenized Treasury fund to use a global custodian.\nMagazine: Will Robinhood’s tokenized stocks REALLY take over the world?

        "text": "Opinion by: Slava Demchuk, co-founder and CEO of AMLBot\nAsia’s cryptoverse has lost more than 1.5 billion in the first half of 2025 — more than during 2024, including Bybit and pig butchering scams in Southeast Asia. Most engines are built around typologies of Western money laundering. They miss custom laundering channels tailored to each region, which are popping up across Asia.\nBlockchain analytics firms must build customized regional risk libraries and collaborate with local law enforcement to combat the level and caliber of cryptocurrency-enabled crime in Asia. Failure to address this means criminal funds will still be able to lurk in plain sight and subvert the very integrity of global compliance systems.\nWestern tools, Eastern loopholes\nThe global risk engine most commonly targets mixers, tumblers and centralized on-ramps in North America and Europe. But the Asian financial underground uses different weapons: unlicensed OTC desks in Thailand, mobile-money corridors in the Philippines, and informal peer-to-peer parking methods that don’t trigger red flags as seen through today’s general compliance lens.\nWith the corresponding flows, these wallets build the wallet clusters and flow patterns that circumvent legacy detection rules. Proceeds are often left idle or are discreetly layered, before ending up at decentralized exchanges, letting the laundering cycle slip by general compliance triggers.\nLocal problems need local maps\nThe ability to effectively monitor crime in APAC is based on jurisdiction-level expertise. That includes mapping typical tactics, such as circular trading via Singaporean shell companies, or layering transactions with Indonesian e-wallets. Analytics providers must ingest locally published onchain data and hold living typologies to mimic real-time laundering innovations rather than wait to reverse engineer them when it’s too late.\nBuilding regional risk libraries — flagging wallet clusters, known bad actors and unique entry/exit ramps — is fundamental. These tools must be built into enforcement engines, not tacked on after a scam becomes newsworthy.\nBuilding bridges with law enforcement\nData alone doesn’t stop crime. Local regulators are typically not well-versed in blockchain, and private analytics companies require legal authority to act. This is where public-private partnerships (PPPs) are crucial. PPPs may formally permit secure data-sharing, joint training and real-time alerts.\nRelated: North Korea crypto hackers tap ChatGPT, Malaysia road money siphoned: Asia Express\nThese partnerships are already bearing fruit: In countries like Thailand and Malaysia, law enforcement has used real-time dashboards and analytics software to freeze funds within hours of reported fraud — compared to weeks or months in the past. These are not hypotheticals; they’re operating efficiencies that save millions.\nEnforcement is what trust and development depend on\nRetail participation in crypto is booming in markets like Vietnam, Thailand and India, but that growth is exposed without enforcement confidence. We must incentivize investors to stay in a market where fraud is rife. Public-private collaboration demonstrates commitment to protecting consumers, allowing for rulemaking that is done in concert, and supporting long-term engagement across the retail and institutional market participants.\nThere are dangers in regional compliance, say the critics. Different global standards, privacy in onchain, and government overreach are all real issues. Privacy-preserving design — like short-term data retention, permissioned audit trails and the publication of enforcement reports — can protect user privacy and legal accountability.\nLocal expertise wins\nCrypto firms partnering with analytics providers with hyperlocal compliance capabilities will win mandates from hedge funds, banks, and custodian banks investing in the APAC region. Institutions are looking for confidence in blockchain hygiene and proving that the vendors understand the terrain. Vendors dependent upon “one-size-fits-all” compliance tooling risk losing their exchange listing, investor confidence, and regional access.\nTo push this model, industry coalitions must collaborate with analytics vendors, which will co-develop APAC-wide compliance standards. This undertaking should involve employing local specialists in underground financial activity and the development of jurisdiction-specific risk libraries.\nSetting up public-private partnerships with regulators is equally important; they allow immediate cooperation and enforcement rights. The pan-APAC compliance architecture should also include transparency through quarterly impact reports to assess the model’s effectiveness in preventing money laundering across the region.\nThe subsequent surge relies on trust\nAsia stands at a crossroads. Without regionally tailored risk detection and cross-sectoral collaboration, it is in danger of becoming like the “Wild West”. However, with proper underpinnings, it could be a leader in constructing a compliant, innovation-focused crypto economy. Speaking the language of Asia’s financial underground — and partnering with local enforcers — is the only way to regain trust and unlock the next chapter of growth.\nOpinion by: Slava Demchuk, co-founder and CEO of AMLBot.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "text": "Capital requirements for banks from by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), which crafts banking standards, create a “chokepoint,” designed to throttle the growth of the crypto industry, according to Chris Perkins, president of investment firm CoinFund.\nThe current capital rules lower a bank’s return on equity (ROE), a critical profitability metric in banking, by forcing higher reserve requirements for holding crypto, making crypto-related activities too expensive for banks, Perkins told Cointelegraph.\n“It's a different type of chokepoint, in that it's not direct. It's a very nuanced way of suppressing activity by making it so expensive for the bank to do activities that they’re just like, ‘I can't,’” he added.\nIf I have a certain amount of capital I want to invest, I'm going to invest it in high ROE businesses, not low ROE businesses,” he continued.\nIn April, Perkins criticized the Bank for International Settlements for its proposals to impose know-your-customer requirements (KYC) and other legacy banking regulations on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and stablecoins, saying that they violate the core principles of permissionless networks.\nThe real systemic risk to the financial system comes from the asymmetry of having online, permissionless, 24/7, peer-to-peer, decentralized networks that can shift liquidity in real time while traditional financial infrastructure closes on nights and weekends and refuses to adapt to changing technology, Perkins said.\nRelated: New BIS plan could make ‘dirty’ crypto harder to cash out\nBank for International Settlements remains entrenched against crypto\nThe Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which acts as a central bank for sovereign central banks and organizes the BCBS conferences, released a report in April claiming that crypto could destabilize the financial system.\nThe authors of the report also argued that the growth of the crypto market exacerbates the wealth gap and urged stricter government regulation in response.\nIn June, the BIS released a follow-up report titled “Stablecoin growth: Policy Challenges and Approaches,” which claimed that stablecoins fail as money and could create systemic risks in the financial system.\n“Stablecoins’ rising market capitalization and increasing interconnections with the traditional financial system have reached a stage where potential spillovers to that system can no longer be ruled out,” the authors of the report wrote.\nThe BIS has repeatedly pushed for the adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and other centralized digital technologies as an alternative to privately-issued and decentralized cryptocurrencies.\nMagazine: DeFi will rise again after memecoins die down: Sasha Ivanov, X Hall of Flame",

The miner’s latest haul brings its total holdings to 1,297,093 ETH, valued at about $5.75 billion, according to transactions tracked by Lookonchain.The transactions reveal that BitMine acquired much of the ETH through large over-the-counter (OTC) deals and direct transfers from well-known institutional intermediaries, including Galaxy Digital, FalconX and BitGo.\nAdding to the buying spree, an unidentified whale has quietly amassed 92,899 ETH, around $412 million, over the past four days. The entity set up three fresh wallets before withdrawing the funds from Kraken, suggesting a deliberate long-term storage strategy.\nRelated: Ethereum whales scoop sales by traders in ‘disbelief’ of rally: Santiment\nBitMine and SharpLink raise billions\nAdding fuel to the corporate push into Ether treasuries, Public Bitcoin mining firm BitMine Immersion Technology is raising $24.5 billion through an at-the-market (ATM) stock offering, while SharpLink completed a $389 million capital raise from common shares.\nWhales, or large crypto holders, have also started accumulating Ether. As reported, a newly identified entity purchased $1.3 billion in Ether across 10 new wallets this week, surpassing the $1 billion record set by ETFs on Monday.\nNotably, Standard Chartered has lifted its 2025 Ether price target to $7,500 from $4,000, pointing to intensified institutional accumulation and faster stablecoin adoption following recent US regulatory shifts.\nThe bank’s new long-term outlook sets ETH at $12,000 in 2026, $18,000 in 2027 and $25,000 by 2028.\nRelated: Michael Saylor is not sweating the rise of Ethereum treasury companies\nETH profit-taking starts\nProfit-taking, however, is starting to emerge as ETH approaches a fresh all-time high.

The offering will be led by a syndicate of major banks, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and others.\nPost-offering, Gemini will have a dual-class share structure, including Class A stock carrying one vote per share and Class B stock carrying ten votes.

Across the first two weeks of August, they’ve recorded more than $3 billion in net inflows marking their second-strongest monthly performance to date.\nBalchunas said it was almost as if Ether ETFs were “asleep” for the past 11 months and “then crammed” one year’s worth of activity into six weeks.\nWhile there was excitement ahead of their July 2024 launch, Ether ETFs initially saw lower demand than anticipated, sparking speculation that Wall Street had yet to find a clear use case for the asset.\nRelated: Ether bull flag targets $6K as ETH supply on exchanges falls to 12%\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs reached new highs of $73,679 just two months after launching in January 2024.\nAnalysts are now drawing parallels between Ether’s recent price surge and Bitcoin’s post-ETF rally.\n“This move is comparable to the BTC ETF launch, when Bitcoin continued to rally upward,” van de Poppe said, adding, “The ETFs have a massive impact and there’s a lot to come for Altcoins.”\nHowever, some analysts warn that investors must be patient before Ether reaches a new all-time high.\nNansen analyst Jake Kennis said in comments shared with Cointelegraph that a new all-time high for Ether may be weeks or months away, despite ETH currently sitting only a few hundred dollars off a new record price.\nMagazine: Altcoin season 2025 is almost here… but the rules have changed",

        "text": "Key takeaways:\nEther queued for unstaking hits a record $3.8 billion, led by Lido, EthFi, and Coinbase.\nStrategic reserves and ETF holdings have jumped by 140% since May 1.\nETH’s $4,200 support is critical, with $1.2 billion in longs at risk if the price tags the level.\nThe staking ecosystem of Ethereum has reached new highs, with 877,106 Ether\nworth $3.88 billion currently queued for a withdrawal, with a 15-day wait time on Friday. Data from ValidatorQueue notes that the current number of active validators is above 1.08 million, with 29.5% of the total ETH supply staked, i.e., around 35.3 million ETH.Decentralized finance (DeFi) analyst Ignas said that the surge in unstaked ETH is being driven largely by the top three liquid staking platforms. Lido leads with 285,000 ETH queued for withdrawal, followed by EthFi with 134,000 ETH and Coinbase with 113,000 ETH.\nWhile this rise in queued unstaked ETH could mean massive profit-taking could be underway, the analyst believes that the recent accumulation and buying strength from Ether treasury companies and spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is absorbing much of the selling pressure.\nData from strategicethreserve.xyz highlights that collective holdings of strategic reserves and ETFs have surged 140% since May 1, climbing to 10,008,263 ETH from 4,140,953 ETH. The sharp increase underscores a swift consolidation of Ether supply into the hands of major institutional and corporate players.\nIgnas highlights another bullish narrative tied to the potential launch of ETH staking ETFs. The analyst suggests that some investors may be freeing up liquidity now to re-enter through these products later, effectively reshuffling their exposure without exiting the ETH market altogether.\nWhile the SEC’s final deadline for approval is set for April 2026, Bloomberg ETF analyst Seyffart notes that the green light could come much sooner, possibly as early as October 2025.\nRelated: Ether price prediction markets bet ETH will hit $5K by end of August\nHow does “the wait” impact Ether price?\nThe high number of queued ETH is a double-edged sword for Ether’s price action. If institutional flows keep pace, ETH could hold its ground and even set up for another leg higher. However, if those inflows slow down, the backlog of unstaked ETH could weigh on the market.\nEther price has faced a sharp correction on Thursday and Friday following a hot US Producer Price Index (PPI) print, which raised inflation concerns. With prices currently around $4,500, Ether could tag the daily order block or internal liquidity zone between $4,370 and $4,160 before moving toward the $5,000 level.\nCrypto intelligence platform Kiyotaka reported a large ETH liquidation cluster between $5,000 and $5,200 on Wednesday. However, in the past 24 hours, the pressure has shifted to longs, with over $1.2 billion in positions at risk of liquidation near $4,200.\nIf Ether fails to hold the $4,200 level, the next key support lies between $4,100 and $3,900, aligned with the 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci retracement range, often referred to as the “golden zone” for uptrend retests. This area also overlaps with a previous higher high level, adding to its potential strength as a support zone.\nRelated: Ether rally turns Radiant Capital exploit into $103M windfall for hacker\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "text": "Update (Aug. 15 at 11:40 pm UTC): This article has been updated to include a statement from Genesis’ counsel.\nVenture capital firm Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of many entities tied to cryptocurrency and blockchain, has filed a complaint against two of its subsidiaries over a promissory note to guard against the 2022 default of Three Arrows Capital (3AC).\nIn a Thursday filing in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, DCG alleged that Genesis Global Capital and Genesis Asia Pacific, both under the venture capital firm, owed their parent company overpayments based on recoveries from 3AC.\nThe complaint said that DCG issued a $1.1 billion promissory note to the Genesis entities, which profited by “hundreds of millions of dollars“ without suffering any loss from the default of 3AC in 2022.\nAccording to DCG, the company issued a 10-year promissory note to Genesis Global Capital in June 2022 as a safeguard against any potential “hole” in Genesis Asia Pacific’s equity that could have been caused by the collapse of 3AC, one of Genesis’ borrowers. DCG alleged that rather than facing significant liquidity problems from 3AC, Genesis “reap[ed] a massive windfall” and was obligated to return payments made on the promissory note.\nThe recent complaint was just the latest legal entanglement between DCG and Genesis over the collapse of 3AC. In May, Genesis filed lawsuits against its parent company, affiliates and CEO Barry Silbert, alleging fraud, insider enrichment and concealed transfers. The company sought $3.3 billion over DCG allegedly withdrawing funds before Genesis’ bankruptcy.\n“DCG’s unfounded, haphazard and convenient about-face to withhold 3AC distributions is meritless,” said Luke Barefoot, a partner at law firm Cleary Gottlieb and counsel to Genesis, in a statement to Cointelegraph. “It flatly contradicts the written agreements, DCG’s representations to the bankruptcy court, and the fact that DCG already handed over $100M+ in distributions.\"\nRelated: FTX users bolster lawsuit claiming law firm was ‘key’ to FTX fraud\nThe $1.1-billion promissory note mentioned in the filing was issued in response to the collapse of 3AC, with Genesis potentially facing a shortfall in its equity for the second quarter of 2022.\nHowever, DCG noted that “cryptocurrency prices eventually recovered,” allowing Genesis to use 3AC’s collateral — shares of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust, which increased in value with the price of the cryptocurrency — to profit from the loans.\n“[T]he incremental amounts realized by Genesis after issuance of the Note were, based on the pleadings filed by Genesis in this Court seeking approval of that transaction, far more than sufficient to overcome the prior $1.1 billion collateral shortfall—and, on information and belief, allowed Genesis to profit from [3AC]’s default by recovering nearly $2.8 billion on the original $2.36 billion in [3AC] Loans,” said the filing.\nDownfall of FTX caught up in the mix\nThe crypto market crash of 2022, which many experts suggested had been influenced by the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, resulted in multiple bankruptcies and liquidity issues, with many retail investors losing millions. Amid the market uncertainty, FTX, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges at the time, filed for bankruptcy, and some of its executives were indicted for fraud.\n“While [Genesis Global Capital’s] direct credit exposure to FTX was not material, the FTX bankruptcy spawned the equivalent of a tsunami in the crypto world, causing broad and lasting effects including [Genesis Global Capital’s] bankruptcy filing on January 19, 2023 due to the ‘run on the bank’ that ensued in November 2022 and caused Genesis to halt withdrawals,” said the filing, adding:\n“Even had [3AC] not defaulted in June 2022, [Genesis Global Capital] would not have had sufficient capital to withstand the unexpected and devastating market rout that followed the collapse of FTX in November 2022, which also led crypto lender BlockFi to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the same month.”\nAfter Genesis’ bankruptcy filing, the company completed its restructuring plan in August 2024 and announced and the disbursement of about $4 billion in funds to affected parties. DCG requested the court order Genesis to pay more than $105 million plus interest.\nMagazine: How Ethereum treasury companies could spark ‘DeFi Summer 2.0’",

The decentralized clinical trials segment, for example, is forecast to grow from $8.3 billion in 2023 to about $33 billion by 2033, according to a Market.us report.\nDespite the adoption, blockchain in healthcare still faces major roadblocks. Germany’s government-backed blockchain healthcare pilots have stalled in 2024, mainly due to strict data privacy rules under Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nRelated: Bitcoin, Ether, XRP price bump pushes market sentiment to ‘Greed’\nHealthcare treasury companies on the rise\nSeveral healthcare entities have added digital assets to their corporate treasuries in recent months, showing the healthcare industry’s growing interest in cryptocurrency.\nIn June, Cointelegraph reported that Prenetics Global Limited, a health sciences company listed on Nasdaq, became the first healthcare firm to launch a significant Bitcoin treasury strategy. The company acquired 187 BTC (worth $20 million) through Kraken, and appointed former OKEx chief operating officer Andy Cheung to its board to oversee the initiative.\nSingapore-based Basel Medical Group also announced plans to establish a Bitcoin reserve by acquiring $1 billion in BTC in May.

The stock now trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the BLSH ticker.\nIn its SEC filings, Bullish cited rising digital asset market activity and growing institutional interest as key drivers behind the timing of its IPO.\nPantera makes big bet on crypto treasury companies\nPantera Capital, which correctly predicted Bitcoin’s 2025 price back in 2022, is ramping up its exposure to crypto treasury plays amid growing ETF adoption.\nPantera executives Cosmo Kiang and Erik Lowe explained that digital asset treasuries (DATs) “can generate yield to grow net asset value per share, resulting in more underlying token ownership over time than just holding spot.”\nFollowing this strategy, the company has invested more than $300 million in crypto treasury companies with exposure to Bitcoin\n, Ether , Solana and other assets.“These DATs are taking advantage of their unique situations to employ strategies to grow their digital asset holdings in a per-share accretive way,” the executives said.\nBitMine targets $24.5 billion raise for Ether purchases\nBitMine Immersion Technology, a publicly traded Bitcoin mining company, has announced plans to raise $24.5 billion through a stock sale to acquire more Ether — underscoring the intensifying race to accumulate the cryptocurrency as it nears record highs.\nAlready the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, BitMine owns about 1.2 million ETH valued at roughly $5.3 billion, according to industry data.\nIn July, BitMine appointed Fundstrat’s Tom Lee as chairman of the board — a move seemingly aimed at mirroring the high-profile corporate crypto strategy of Strategy and its Bitcoin evangelist, Michael Saylor.\nThe plan comes as Ether’s price has surged 55% over the past month, putting it within striking distance of its all-time high.\nUS banking lobby’s war on stablecoins continues\nLess than three months after Cointelegraph reported on the US banking lobby “panicking” over yield-bearing stablecoins, industry groups are now urging the government to close a perceived loophole in the GENIUS Act. The loophole, they argue, could allow stablecoin issuers and their affiliates to offer yields on stablecoin holdings.\nSeveral banking associations, led by the Bank Policy Institute, noted that while the GENIUS Act prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying interest to digital dollar holders, the ban does not explicitly extend to affiliates or crypto exchanges.\nPublicly, the groups claim their concern is that stablecoins could undermine the banking system. However, critics say the more pressing fear may be that stablecoins will erode their business model — especially given banks’ long history of offering minimal returns to depositors.\nCrypto Biz is your weekly pulse on the business behind blockchain and crypto, delivered directly to your inbox every Thursday.",

        "text": "The US Justice Department has authorized the seizure of more than $2.8 million in cryptocurrency along with cash and other assets as part of a criminal case against an alleged ransomware operator.\nIn a Thursday notice, the Justice Department said it had unsealed six warrants authorizing the seizure of $2.8 million in crypto from a wallet controlled by Ianis Aleksandrovich Antropenko, as well as $70,000 in cash and a luxury vehicle.\nHe has been charged with conspiring to commit computer fraud and abuse, computer fraud and abuse, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\"As alleged in the unsealed warrants, the cryptocurrency and other assets are proceeds of (or were involved in laundering the proceeds of) ransomware activity,\" the notice reads.\n“Those assets were laundered in various ways, including by using the cryptocurrency mixing service ChipMixer, which was taken down in a coordinated international operation in 2023. Antropenko also laundered cryptocurrency by exchanging cryptocurrency for cash and depositing the cash in structured cash deposits.\"\nThe seizure was the latest US government action involving cryptocurrency that could be used to bolster its national stockpile, set up by an executive order from US President Donald Trump in March.\nOn Monday, the Justice Department said it had seized about $1 million in crypto from the ransomware group BlackSuit, and federal officials are seeking to lay claim to $2.4 million in Bitcoin\nseized by the Dallas FBI in April.How much Bitcoin does the US government hold?\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made headlines this week after suggesting the government was “not going to be buying” BTC as part of its crypto stockpile plans, shortly before the price of Bitcoin fell below $119,000. He later clarified on social media that the department would be “exploring budget-neutral pathways” to acquire BTC.\nAccording to Bessent, the US government’s Bitcoin stockpile comprised assets seized in criminal cases after victims were compensated, totaling about $20 billion as of Thursday. With the Bitcoin price at $117,387 at the time of publication, estimates suggest a US stockpile of 198,012 BTC, worth more than $23 billion.\nMagazine: Bitcoin inheritances: A guide for heirs and the not-yet-dead",

        "text": "US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins signaled that the regulatory agency will work with US President Donald Trump’s administration to allow retail investors equal opportunities to invest in private equity.\nAtkins cited the recent Trump executive order to allow crypto and alternative assets in 401K retirement accounts — tax-sheltered retirement plans funded by individuals and their employers — as the catalyst for the effort. He told Fox Business on Saturday:\n“It's not really great to have a situation where large endowments and pension funds like state pension funds can be diversified in the public and private markets, while the 401ks cannot. I think that's one of the goals of this executive order: to direct the Department of Labor and the SEC to work together to help make that a reality.”\nHowever, Atkins urged caution and putting the “proper guardrails” around alternative investments. “We can't just fling the gates open and have investors rush in where one has to be careful,” he said.\nThe agency has prioritized regulating cryptocurrencies to make the US the global leader in digital assets, Atkins recently said.\nBroadening access to private equity will allow retail investors to invest in early-stage crypto projects and private token sales typically reserved for accredited or institutional investors.\nCointelegraph reached out to the SEC for details on a potential overhaul of accredited investor rules, but the agency declined to comment.\nRelated: SEC to focus on ‘clear’ crypto regulations after Ripple case: Atkins\nCrypto investors welcome the change, but risks loom\nThe SEC overhauled accredited investor regulations in 2020 to emphasize financial knowledge and skill over net worth, broadening who could qualify as an accredited investor in the US.\nDespite this, the current regulations are prohibitive and lock out retail investors from some of investment products, according to Christopher Perkins, president of investment fund CoinFund.\nAccreditation rules exist as a form of consumer protection to shield investors from taking on too much financial risk, according to the SEC.\nThese risks are compounded in private businesses that do not have to follow the same disclosure requirements and may need more financial acumen to fully understand over their public counterparts.\nPrivate investments are also illiquid, and a contagion could spread through the financial system through overleveraging or malinvestment that spills over into other asset classes and markets during a financial crisis.\nMagazine: SEC’s U-turn on crypto leaves key questions unanswered",

The daily chart flashed a bearish engulfing pattern for the first time since July 15, raising concerns that seasonal weakness during Asia’s “ghost month” could extend the downturn.Despite the dip, onchain data point to resilient dip-buying activity. The Coinbase Premium Index climbed to a monthly high yesterday, signaling strong US spot demand. In Asia, the Kimchi Premium Index turned positive, indicating renewed Korean buying pressure.\nCrypto trader Hansolar summed up the sentiment and said collective buy bids were spread across Coinbase, Bitfinex, and the South Korean market.\nThe bullish undertone is further supported by stablecoin flows. According to crypto analyst Maartunn, USDC inflows to exchanges surged to $3.88 billion since the price dip, suggesting traders are gearing up to deploy capital.\nData also indicates that capitulation signs were muted. Just 16,800 BTC were moved to exchanges at a loss by short-term holders (STHs), well below volumes seen in past sell-offs. For context, previously, when Bitcoin dipped more than 5%, over 48,000 BTC were sold at a loss by STHs.\n📊MARKET UPDATE: #Bitcoin slipped 5% on Aug. 14, but capitulation signs were muted with just 16.8K $BTC moved to exchanges at a loss from Short-Term Holders, far less than in past drawdowns.\n— Cointelegraph Markets & Research (@CointelegraphMT) August 15, 2025\nBlue arrow trend shows shrinking STH sell pressure. 👍 pic.twitter.com/sVUvRSVXj5\nRelated: Analysts see Bitcoin buyer exhaustion as retail shifts to altcoins\nCan ‘ghost month’ extend BTC’s correction period?\nAnonymous analyst Exitpump notes that Bitcoin could find support between $116,000 and $117,000, where both spot and futures buying interest is showing up in the order books.\nWhile this could lead to swift recovery, a recurring seasonal pattern tied to Asia’s “ghost month” has often coincided with sharp pullbacks.\nThis year’s ghost month runs from Aug. 23 to Sept. 21. In the Chinese lunar calendar, it marks the seventh month of the year, a period often associated with bad luck in Asian culture. While the phenomenon doesn’t directly impact markets, its psychological effect on traders can be significant, influencing risk appetite and profit-taking behavior.\nHistorically, Bitcoin has shown a tendency to sell off during ghost month. Since 2017, BTC’s average peak decline in this period has been roughly 21.7%, with notable drops such as -39.8% in 2017 and -23% in 2021.\nWith Bitcoin currently hovering near $117,320, a drawdown in line with the historical average could drag prices into the $105,000–$100,000 range before any meaningful rebound. This aligns with key technical support zones, where long-term buyers may look to step in.\nWhile some years have ended ghost month with positive ROI, the recurring mid-period volatility means traders should remain cautious. Any deeper correction into late August could set the stage for a stronger recovery in Q4, after testing the resolve of short-term bulls.\nRelated: BlackRock Bitcoin, Ether ETFs buy $1B as BTC price mostly fills CME gap\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "text": "SharpLink Gaming, an online gaming company with the second-largest corporate Ether treasury, announced a net loss of $103 million for the second quarter of 2025, driven by a paper loss from accounting for liquid staked Ether (LsETH). The loss marks a steep drop from a $500,000 loss in the same period of 2024 — a year-over-year change of -25,980%.\nAccording to a Friday announcement, SharpLink now holds 728,804 Ether\nworth approximately $3.5 billion at this writing. The only publicly traded company with more ETH is BitMine Immersion Technologies, which holds a little more than 1.15 million ETH worth approximately $5.1 billion.Of SharpLink’s Q2 loss, $87.8 million — or 85% — is related to the company’s LsETH. A SharpLink representative told Cointelegraph that the company still has all its LsETH and that the impairment “reflects accounting rules, not a sale or loss of ETH.”\n“Under US GAAP, LsETH is currently treated as a digital intangible asset, which is recorded at cost and subject to impairment,” a SharpLink spokesperson said. “In Q2, the lowest market price of LsETH was $2300, triggering the $87.8M non-cash impairment.”\nGAAP stands for “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,” and is widely used by corporations for financial reporting. SharpLink posted revenue of $700,000 for Q2 2025.\nSharpLink’s shares trended downward on the news. According to Google Finance, the company’s share price is down 12.58% on the Nasdaq at this writing.\nRelated: BitMine targets huge $24.5B raise as SharpLink boosts Ether war chest\nEther treasury companies could spark DeFi summer\nEther treasury companies and exchange-traded funds are expected to support buying pressure for ETH, with renewed price predictions already emerging.\nMultinational banking company Standard Chartered has said ETH could hit $7,500 by the end of 2025. Market strategy and research firm Fundstrat is even more optimistic, saying ETH could reach $15,000 by year’s end.\nEtherealize’s Vivek Raman says that competition between Ether treasury companies could spark further activity on decentralized finance networks, leading to an institutional-scale DeFi summer 2.0.\nEther has been rising since the ecosystem’s May Pectra upgrade. On that day, ETH had a price of roughly $1,811.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\nEric Trump urges bullish bets on crypto; altcoins like LILPEPE, TRON, KAS, and ALGO gain investor attention.\nTable of Contents\n- Eric Trump’s bullish opinion on Bitcoin and Ethereum sparks interest in altcoins for 2025.\n- LILPEPE, TRON, KAS, and ALGO are poised for growth ahead of the 2025 crypto bull run.\n- Affordable altcoins backed by strong tech are attracting attract investors ahead of the next bull cycle.\nA possible bull run in 2025 has already got the cryptocurrency market buzzing. Recently, Eric Trump made statements urging investors to “stop betting against Bitcoin and Ethereum”, further exciting the market around digital assets.\nWhile both Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the titans they are, strategic investors are shifting their focus to undervalued altcoins with solid fundamentals and the potential to ignite explosive growth. From Eric Trump’s interview, it’s safe to say he is very bullish about the crypto market, and if current trends are anything to go by, Little (LILPEPE), TRON, KAS, and ALGO are poised to skyrocket by 2025. In short, these cryptocurrencies are affordable and backed by state-of-the-art technology.\nLittle Pepe: The memecoin with layer 2 ambition\nLittle Pepe is reshaping the memecoin world by combining technology with viral appeal. Now in Stage 10 of its presale, priced at $0.0019, Little has completed more than $18.3 million in fundraising and has sold 12.2 billion tokens.\nThis has also led to the rare presale listing on CoinMarketCap, which enhances its global exposure. While common memecoins such as PEPE and SHIB focus solely on their developed community and meme culture, Little Pepe is taking a different direction as it is developing a Layer 2 meme and community tokens blockchain, which will have minimal charges, instantaneous transaction completion, and will be EVM compatible.\nLittle Pepe Launchpad, designed by the project, is designed to assist new meme projects by providing protective anti-bot mechanisms for fair launches. Little Pepe is set for tremendous growth given their 100,000-strong community and CEX listing planned for after the presale. Although memecoins are highly risky and speculative, Little’s low entry price and infrastructure focus make it an opportunity for high reward for investors speculating at 50x-100x return during the 2025 bull run.\nTRON: The DeFi giant with steady momentum\nTRX currently trades at $0.315 and has a market cap of $32.2 billion. Gaming and NFTs have spawned a vibrant dApps and financial services ecosystem. It is becoming the go-to network for stablecoin transactions. Recently, $1 billion of USDT was minted on its blockchain.\nThe price structure of TRON currently sits in an ascending channel, which shows bullish signs. With whale dominance currently peaking, analysts speculate that if TRX breaks past $0.45, it may retrace to its 2024 highs of $0.50. This move provides an estimated profit of 10 to 20 percent.\nKaspa: The scalable blockchain innovator\nWith a market cap of $2.89 billion, KAS is priced at $0.075. It is designed for high transaction speed, which makes it a competitor to traditional blockchains. The recent Crescendo v1.0.0 hard fork increased block speed to 10 blocks per second, and the DAGKNIGHT consensus improves security and finality.\nThe new EVM-compatible testnets and the KRC20 token standard proposed by Kaspa enable new avenues in DeFi and smart contracts. With increasing developer interest and the Caravel testnet coming soon, analysts expect KAtold to reach $1 by the end of the year, representing a 13x increase from its current price.\nAlgorand: The green with real-world utility\nALGO fuels DeFi and NFT ecosystems and bridges traditional and decentralized finance. With a market cap of $2.2 billion and priced at $0.24, ALGO powers DeFi and NFT ecosystems. Its plans for 2025, like enabling native token transfers through Wormhole, collaboration with Paycode for digital identities in emerging markets, and other initiatives, reveal ALGO’s ecosystem.\nAlgorand attracts institutions and developers because of low costs, native staking rewards, and a carbon-negative promise. Its recent joining of the Blockchain Association to advocate for crypto-friendly regulations further boosts credibility. ALGO has excellent upside potential, especially with the growing adoption of DeFi and payments.\nConclusion\nEric Trump’s bullish sentiment towards Bitcoin and Ethereum hints at a booming market. As for other investment options, Algorand, Kaspa, Little Pepe, and TRON also offer diverse opportunities. TRON’s dominance in DeFi provides a safe investment, while Little Pepe’s dog meme-driven Layer 2 project could yield significant gains in weeks.\nCompleting the list is Kaspa with its scalable infrastructure, Algorand with its real-world applications — both holding strong for long-term gains — coins priced under a dollar offer affordable entry positions ahead of the predicted bull run in 2025. As always, conduct due diligence and speak to a financial advisor; with any investment, cryptocurrencies come with risks.\nTo learn more about Little Pepe, visit the website, Telegram, and X.\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party.

We didn’t notice.”\nUdi even floats a price target that sounds insane now but might soon feel tame: “I think 400K is conservative.”\nFrom Ether’s new treasury companies to the fragility of leveraged players, this exclusive Cointelegraph interview is packed with insights that challenge mainstream crypto thinking.\nWatch the full conversation to hear Udi’s full case, and why he thinks the next Bitcoin rally could leave crypto-natives on the sidelines.\nMagazine: Growing numbers of users are taking LSD with ChatGPT",

Tokens are available at just $0.000000147, with no complicated sign-ups or staking requirements to participate.\nThe project has already raised over $6 million and offers staking at 244% APY, making it attractive for both early entry and yield seekers. Known as the “God of Frogs” and rumored to have connections to a former PEPE co-founder, Pepeto merges meme culture with practical tools such as PepetoSwap (a zero-fee exchange) and PepetoBridge (secure cross-chain transfers).\nIts tokenomics favor the community with no trading tax, no team wallets, and third-party audits from Coinsult and SolidProof. Many analysts suggest Pepeto could be a life-changing play for early backers, similar to the early days of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.\nCardano: Secure but slow-moving\nCardano‘s research-driven model emphasizes scalability and security, earning it a strong reputation. The rollout of smart contracts has expanded its capabilities, and the project maintains a large, loyal community.\nHowever, its slower development pace has caused it to miss faster-moving trends, making it more suited for long-term holders than traders seeking quick gains.\nSolana: Speed comes with risk\nSolana has built its brand on lightning-fast, low-cost transactions, fueling growth in NFTs, DeFi projects, and token launches. Recent memecoin activity has brought renewed interest from retail traders, and institutional attention is also on the rise.\nHowever, Solana’s history of major network outages has raised concerns about its reliability. The chain’s reputation for short-lived pump-and-dump tokens adds to its volatility, potentially deterring serious capital. With heavy competition from other high-speed chains, questions remain about the sustainability of its growth beyond short-term hype cycles.\nHyperliquid: New ideas, early stage\nHyperliquid is an emerging name in decentralized trading, promoting zero-gas transactions and an on-chain matching engine. While the technology has promise, the platform is still in its early growth phase with limited adoption, and it faces strong competition from established players like dYdX and GMX. Its token, HLP, remains speculative, with value depending heavily on future user adoption that hasn’t yet been proven. In contrast, Pepeto is already building momentum with a large and engaged presale community.\nFinal verdict\nIn the crypto market, early positioning can make all the difference. Pepeto offers more than just hype it combines the viral power of memecoins with audited products, fair tokenomics, and utility available from day one. While Cardano and Solana have already seen much of their growth priced in, and Hyperliquid is still proving itself, Pepeto presents a rare chance to buy in at $0.000000147 with over $6 million raised and 244% APY staking live before launch.\nFor those who recall the breakout runs of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, Pepeto’s presale could be the next high-risk, high-reward play with the potential to change fortunes.\nTo learn more about PEPETO, visit its website, Telegram, and Twitter.\nDisclaimer: Only use the official website to purchase PEPETO. As the launch date approaches, be cautious of fake platforms using the name to scam investors. Always verify sources before buying.\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party.

        "text": "5 cryptos that could explode and create millionaires in 2025\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\nAs the 2025 bull run unfolds, these five tokens could match or surpass PEPE’s explosive rally.\nTable of Contents\n- Little Pepe leads 2025’s millionaire-maker crypto list.\n- Its presale nears $19.32m goal, rapid sales, with 206k participants garnered.\n- Stage 10 of Little Pepe presale has raised $18.89m after selling 12.52b tokens and has passed audit.\nDuring the last bull run, Pepe Coin (PEPE) astonished the market by giving early investors incredible returns. Traders are looking for the next wave of tokens that can follow PEPE’s trajectory and transform small holdings into fortunes that can change lives as the 2025 bull cycle starts to take shape.\nAlthough memecoins dominate the excitement, Layer-2 plays, community-driven assets, and high-utility tokens are all driving the next cycle. These five cryptocurrencies can equal or exceed PEPE’s 2025 run.\n1. Little Pepe: The layer-2 backbone memecoin\nOne of the more ambitious memecoin initiatives in 2025 is Little Pepe (LILPEPE). The Little Pepe Chain, a unique Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 built for incredibly low fees, lightning-fast transactions, and complete EVM compatibility, supports LILPEPE, unlike most memecoins that rely solely on community hype.\nLittle Pepe, which is now at Stage 10 of its presale at $0.0019, has sold more than 12.52 billion tokens and raised almost $18.89 million of its $19.32 million goal. With over 206,000 entries thus far, the presale’s quick sales rate and $777,000 giveaway have garnered a lot of attention. With a thorough smart contract audit and a well-planned vesting model — no tokens are unlocked at launch, there is a three-month cliff, and only 5% are unlocked every 30 days after that — the project also places a high priority on security.\nThe purpose of this structure is to maintain momentum and prevent post-launch dumping. Little Pepe might be the 2025 regret-eraser if it even comes close to meeting experts’ most optimistic projections, which call for a 50,000% increase from presale to $1.\n2. Kaspa: The quickest proof-of-work in the world\nAlthough Kaspa isn’t a meme currency, its technology is making it cult-like. Powered by the GHOSTDAG protocol, Kaspa enables near-instant block confirmation without sacrificing decentralization or security. With a market valuation of $2.46 billion and a current price of $0.09271, Kaspa is still regarded by many analysts as being cheap given its potential for widespread adoption.\nMiners looking for long-term sustainability may choose it as their preferred network due to its scalability in the proof-of-work space. Kaspa may experience enormous growth if 2025 witnesses another wave of Layer-1 appreciation akin to the previous runs of Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n3. Pudgy Penguins: Making NFTs into cultural phenomena\nFrom an NFT brand, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has grown into a well-known crypto culture figure. The project is now a lifestyle brand with a substantial social media following, partnerships, and widespread awareness, and it is currently trading at $0.03726 with a market valuation of $2.34 billion.\nFew projects in the memecoin and NFT crossover niche have demonstrated the kind of enduring appeal that Pudgy Penguins has. PENGU is well-positioned to profit from the subsequent viral explosion in meme culture in 2025, thanks to its more than 50 billion social media views and brand appearances in mainstream advertising.\n4. Arbitrum: Ethereum’s layer-2 titan\nArbitrum is a popular Layer-2 Ethereum scaling option due to its strong DeFi ecosystem, low transaction costs, and high throughput. The ARB cryptocurrency, worth $2.32 billion and priced at $0.4514, is a key actor in Ethereum’s scaling story.\nArbitrum’s usage and token value may rise during Ethereum’s 2025 bull run. Its large developer community and dApp selection give it an edge over alternative scaling methods.\n5. Algorand: High-speed, eco-friendly blockchain\nAlgorand is a Layer-1 blockchain that is well-known for being eco-friendly and having low fees. Algorand is worth $2.26 billion on the market and is now priced at $0.2597. It has already worked with DeFi, gaming, and even national-level projects. With an emphasis on enterprise-grade scalability and real-world utility, ALGO may surprise in 2025 as institutional usage increases and the need for quick, environmentally friendly blockchains increases.\nConclusion\nThese five projects, Little Pepe, Kaspa, Pudgy Penguins, Arbitrum, and Algorand, stand out as potential millionaire-makers if the 2025 bull run replicates the previous cycle’s rapid gains. With genuine blockchain technology supporting it, Little Pepe leads the field in terms of unadulterated buzz and meme appeal. While Pudgy Penguins demonstrates that culture may be just as valuable as code, Kaspa and Arbitrum focus on scalability and performance. Algorand completes the list with an institutional-grade, environmentally friendly blockchain. Significant risks often accompany big gains, but for investors looking for the next PEPE-level run, this shortlist can serve as the cornerstone of a revolutionary 2025 portfolio.\nTo learn more about Little Pepe, visit the website, Telegram, and X.\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party.

Finance and infrastructure players also dominated the week’s deals, from Story Protocol’s $220 million token-driven partnership with Heritage Distilling to fresh rounds for cybersecurity firm 1Kosmos and payments gateway Transak.\nHere’s the full breakdown of who raised what, and where investors are betting next, according to Crypto Fundraising data.\nBullish\n- Bullish priced its IPO at $37 per share, above expectations, giving the crypto exchange a $5.4 billion valuation with backing from JPMorgan, Jefferies, and Citigroup.\n- The upsized $1.1 billion raise sold 30 million shares, buoyed by strong demand from investors, including BlackRock and Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest.\n- Trading under ticker BLSH on the NYSE, the deal marks a comeback for Bullish after its 2022 SPAC collapse, now backed by Peter Thiel and led by ex-NYSE chief Tom Farley.\nStory Protocol (PIP Labs)\n- Heritage Distilling (Nasdaq: CASK) became the first U.S.-listed company to adopt Story Protocol’s IP token as a reserve asset, holding about 52.5 million tokens worth $361 million.\n- The move includes a $220 million private placement of cash and tokens, with $82 million allocated to purchase IP directly from Story Foundation at $3.40 per token.\n- Heritage will also raise $100 million via stock and warrants, with added token contributions from strategic partners and major crypto investors.\n1Kosmos\n- 1Kosmos raised $57 million in a Series B round\n- Investors include Forgepoint Capital, Silvertech Ventures, and Daher Capital\n- The project is a cybersecurity platform that offers identity-first authentication solutions\nSui (Mysten Labs)\n- Gathered $20 million in an Unknown round\n- The investment was backed by Hill City Ventures\n- Sui (SUI) has raised $415.45 million so far\nNeon Machine (Shrapnel)\n- Neon Machine raised $19.5 million in an Unknown round\n- Investors include Gala Games, Griffin Gaming Partners, and Polychain Capital\n- The project has raised $57 million so far\nTransak\n- Secured $16 million in a Strategic round\n- Transak is a web3 payments infrastructure provider\n- The investment was backed by IDG Capital, Tether, and Prism Capital\nProjects > $15 million\n- USD AI (Permian Labs), $13.4 million in a Series A round\n- Mesh (ex Front Finance), $9.5 million\n- Hyperbeat, $5.2 million in a Seed round\n- Bitlayer, $5 million in a Public sale\n- HoneyCoin, $4.9 million\n- HackQuest, $4.1 million in a Series A round\n- HolmesAI, $3 million in a Seed round\n- Riva Money, $3 million in a Pre-seed round\n- PublicAI, $2 million in a Public sale with $70 million fully diluted valuation\n- XMAQUINA, $315,000 in a Public sale with $45 million fully diluted valuation\n- ODX (ex Ordinox), $260,640\n- Silo Labs, $122,500",

        "text": "This new XRP rival continues to go vertical while other coins struggle in August\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\nShiba Inu and Pepe Coin face pressure this August, but Remittix is climbing steadily toward milestones that could spark explosive growth.\nTable of Contents\n- Remittix rises as SHIB, PEPE stall, and analysts see 100x gains after first CEX listing.\n- Remittix presale is heating up fast because of a Certik audit, $250k giveaway, and 40% bonus.\n- Dubbed the XRP rival, Remittix could parabolically surge from its $0.0944 presale price.\nThe memecoin market looks wobbly this August, with Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin prices under pressure despite pockets of whale activity. Both tokens await market momentum for their next moves.\nIn contrast, a fundamentally different project, Remittix (RTX), dubbed by some as the “XRP rival,” is climbing steadily toward major milestones that could send it parabolic once it hits exchanges.\nShiba Inu fights to hold critical support\nAfter a sharp drop from $0.00001419, Shiba Inu held onto $0.00001260, a solid support zone that traditionally spurred rebound rallies. Traders are watching SHIB’s capacity to recover $0.00001330 with volume, which might lead to $0.00001380.\nAlthough there may be brief recoveries, SHIB is still susceptible to additional declines if selling pressure continues. Market sentiment shows that only a decisive breakout above $0.00001400 could rekindle the momentum that characterized previous meme coin surges.\nPepe Coin price faces seller pressure\nPepe Coin price slipped around 4% over the past 24 hours, underperforming the broader crypto market. Despite the drop, whales have quietly increased their holdings by 1.5% over the last month, a sign of longer-term confidence.\nTechnical charts show PEPE struggling to break above $0.000012, with repeated rejection at that level. If buyers fail to reclaim it, the token could revisit lower supports around $0.00001180.\nFor SHIB and PEPE, the path forward likely depends on a renewed surge in memecoin trading activity, something that’s cooled noticeably in August.\nRemittix: The XRP rival that’s still climbing\nWhile memecoin favorites are struggling, Remittix continues its vertical climb in presale. It is designed as a next-gen cross-border payments solution.\nRemittix combines multi-chain interoperability, real-time FX conversion, and direct bank payouts in over 30 countries, giving it real-world utility beyond memecoin speculation.\nKey highlights from RTX’s ongoing momentum:\n- $19.5 million+ raised and 599m tokens sold so far in presale\n- Beta web3 Wallet launching Q3 2025 with multi-chain support and gas fee optimization.\n- CEX listing announcement imminent once the $20m milestone is reached.\n- Early buyers still get a 40% presale bonus before public trading.\nInvestor demand has surged because of the centralized exchange listing, luring early-stage cryptocurrency funds and ordinary purchases.\nWhy RTX might go vertical\nUnlike SHIB and PEPE, whose rallies depend on sentiment swings, RTX’s growth is anchored in a clear use case and upcoming adoption catalysts.\nThe project already has a cult-like community of followers, enhanced by the $250,000 giveaway and 40% presale bonus. Meanwhile, its ecosystem is safe for transactions, with a completed Certik audit.\nAnalysts expect a liquidity surge once its first CEX listing goes live, which could push prices 100x from the current $0.0944 presale level. The microcap advantage and relatively untapped niches are potential catalysts for parabolic runs.\nWith whales chasing utility tokens in 2025 and payments-focused cryptos seeing renewed institutional interest, Remittix may be setting up for one of the fastest post-listing climbs in the market this year.\nTo learn more about Remittix, visit the website, socials, and $250k giveaway.\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party.

        "url": "https://crypto.news/tokenized-private-stocks-have-a-fundamental-problem/",
        "text": "Tokenized private stocks have a fundamental problem | Opinion\nDisclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial.\nTokenization is one of blockchain’s applications, proving truly disruptive in its utility and scale. Real-world assets such as bonds, art, and even real estate are fractionalized and digitalized as tokens recorded on blockchain’s private ledgers, becoming tokenized investments and part of a transparent system of ownership. This increases accessibility to typically ring-fenced assets and pulls in greater liquidity by making it easier for investors to access and invest in these tokenized assets — at any time.\n- Tokenizing private company shares promises 24/7 trading and broader access to high‑value assets, but today’s offerings mostly wrap illiquid, opaque markets in a digital shell.\n- Current tokenized private stocks often lack clear ownership rights, investor protections, and exit options, making them more complex and risky than their traditional counterparts.\n- True democratization requires enforceable equity rights, transparent ownership records on‑chain, and explicit support from the companies themselves.\n- Tokenization has succeeded elsewhere — from $3.2B in tokenized real estate today to a projected $19.4B by 2034 — proving its potential when built on traceability and access.\n- With legal clarity, unified markets, and genuine company backing, tokenized private stocks could evolve into a powerful bridge between private and public markets.\nConsidering the above, it is not surprising that tokenization is now being applied to private company shares. At first glance, it makes sense; private companies can yield large returns and unique investment opportunities, so simply adding them to a blockchain should, in theory, unlock capital in previously untouchable markets. The hypothesis is that tokenized private stocks will enable 24/7 trading, allowing public access to a greater share of the world’s return-generating assets.\nUnfortunately, the reality is less appealing. Instead of tokenization making private stocks more accessible and transparent, investors are presented with digital wrappers on top of an opaque, fragmented, and illiquid trading system.\nThis is a major step back from the original purpose of tokenization. However, there is still time to course correct — the RWA community must rally around its fundamental principles to ensure that future adoption achieves the democratising aims of tokenization.\nTokenized private stocks lack real equity\nThe driving force behind the tokenization of private stocks is the democratization of access to high-value assets and the elimination of gatekeepers. The hope is that retail investors, buoyed by opportunities to invest in Silicon Valley unicorns or pre-IPO tech firms, would be quick to support the tokenization of private stocks.\nBut the truth is that retail investors who purchase tokenized private stocks would only be buying into locked-up instruments with no guaranteed exit, few investor protections, and unclear rights to underlying assets. In their current form, tokenized private stocks are over-engineered, introducing complexities around regulation and uncertainty around the custody of the underlying stock.\nProperly tokenizing private companies\nGiven the aforementioned problems with tokenized stocks, it would not be unreasonable to expect the RWA community to abandon them altogether and for financial regulators to prohibit them completely. However, such actions might be too heavy-handed and drastic. Rather, we need to revisit the infrastructure underpinning tokenized private stocks.\nIf platforms want to uphold basic principles of investment while tokenizing currently private companies, they must treat their platforms as a middle ground between complete privacy and a public listing. Three base improvements are necessary for any platform attempting to properly tokenize private stocks:\n- Equity ownership rights — legally enforceable ownership that provides, at a minimum, economic rights (the ability to transfer ownership and receive dividends).\n- Traceability — clear records of previous ownership, market participants, and token holder rights listed on the blockchain.\n- Support from private companies — clear endorsement from the listed private companies, ensuring that investors are not put off by competing public statements.\nTokenization is gaining traction\nOutside of private stocks, tokenization has proven its credibility as a mechanism of accessing high-value, yield-generating assets that were previously inaccessible to many. Take the tokenized real estate market; worth $3.2 billion in 2024, current estimates predict that the market will grow 21% year-on-year and reach $19.4 billion in 2034. Real estate investment is traditionally opaque, paper-based, and inefficient — characteristics that in fact lend themselves perfectly to market transformation through tokenization, with fractional investments and digitalisation democratising access to the property market on a traceable blockchain.\nWithout the underlying principles of democratization and traceability, tokenized private stocks will eventually be exposed for what they truly are: a digital wrapper on an inaccessible asset. Their current form is not decentralization; it’s window dressing.\nBut tokenized stocks don’t have to remain this way.\nIf we can create clear ownership structures that link tokens to legitimate legal rights for investors, establish unified secondary markets with tangible liquidity, implement investor protections, and, most importantly, gain the consent of the companies involved, tokenized private stocks can be a marquee success for the crypto industry.\nTokenized private stocks can become a uniquely powerful tool for investors, unparalleled by traditional instruments. But only if we stop pretending the current model works. By reimagining these assets as stepping stones to public markets, we can bring trust, access, and efficiency to a corner of finance that desperately needs it. Anything less risks undermining the very credibility of tokenization itself.",

It remains 217% above the lowest level in April, and its strong fundamentals and technicals point to a 55% surge\nAmerican institutional and retail investors continued accumulating Ethereum this week. SoSoValue data shows that these funds added $2.8 billion, much higher than Bitcoin’s (BTC) $547 million. It was the fourth week that Ethereum ETFs added more money than Bitcoin.\nETH ETFs now hold $30 billion in assets, with BlackRock’s ETHA leading the way with $15.9 billion. Its daily traded volume on Friday surged to $2.4 billion, a sign of the rising demand. The other top Ethereum funds are from Grayscale, Fidelity, and Bitwise.\nEthereum ETFs have added assets because of its robust growth across various areas in the crypto industry. It maintains a 68% market dominance in the decentralized finance industry, with its total value locked jumping to $203 billion.\nSimilarly, Ethereum’s stablecoin growth has accelerated recently. Its stablecoin supply has increased by 10% over the last 30 days to $144 billion, while the number of addresses has risen by 30% to 2.6 million.\nEthereum’s average transaction volume soared to $878 billion in the same period, much higher than Tron (TRX) $664 billion.\nEthereum price technical analysis\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that ETH price has been on a bullish momentum after bottoming in April. This surge happened as the ETF inflows and ecosystem growth gained momentum.\nETH formed a golden cross in July, confirming the bullish momentum. Most importantly, it formed a cup-and-handle pattern with a depth of 68%.\nMeasuring the same distance from the cup’s upper side yields a target of $6,840, which is approximately 55% above the current level.\nHowever, in the near term, Ethereum price will likely retest the support at $4,110 and then bounce back. This pattern is known as a break-and-retest. It occurs when an asset breaks out above a crucial resistance level, retests it, and then resumes its bullish trend.",

        "text": "XLM price nears breakout as key metric nears 100m milestone ahead of protocol upgrade\nStellar Lumens is on a tear, nearly doubling in value since July as record network activity and an upcoming protocol upgrade fuel hopes for further gains above $0.70.\n- Stellar price is approaching a bear market after falling by 17% from the year-to-date high.\n- XLM has formed a bullish pennant pattern, pointing to more gains.\n- Its transaction growth is accelerating ahead of the Stellar Protocol 23 upgrade.\nXLM price technical analysis\nThe Stellar Lumens (XLM) token was trading at $0.43 on Saturday, Aug. 16, giving it a market capitalization of over $13 billion. It has jumped by 97% from its lowest level in July, with technicals and an upcoming upgrade pointing to more gains.\nThe three-day chart shows that Stellar price has formed several highly bullish patterns. It initially formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.2178, its lowest level in April and June, and a neckline at $0.3350. A double-bottom pattern often leads to more gains.\nThe XLM price is now forming a bullish pennant pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle. The two lines of this triangle are about to converge, which is then followed by a strong breakout.\nThe price target in a bullish pennant is estimated by first measuring the flagpole’ height, which is about 57%. Measuring the same distance from the breakout point gives it a target price of $0.7270, up by over 50% from the current level.\nThese gains will be confirmed when the price rises above the crucial resistance level at $0.6356, its highest level in November last year. A plunge below the support at $0.3350 will invalidate the bullish XLM price forecast.\nKey catalysts for Stellar Lumens\nXLM price has three major catalysts that will push it higher in the near term. First, smart contract transactions on the network are growing, with the network gaining market share in areas like lending, staking, and lending.\nThese transactions recently crossed the 100 million milestone, with the total value locked in decentralized finance reaching a record high of $150 million.\nNansen data shows that Stellar’s transactions increased by 11% in the last 30 days to 81.85 million, while active addresses rose by 49% to 493,774.\nThe other bullish catalyst for the XLM price is that it is achieving its goal of simplifying payments. Its stablecoin supply jumped by 10% in the last 30 days to a record high of $222 million. This is notable since Stellar’s goal is to disrupt the payment industry by reducing transaction costs.\nThird, Stellar is working on the upcoming Protocol 23 upgrade, which is expected to go live in September. Its top features will be optimizing its Soroban transactions and introducing parallel transaction execution. Tokens often jump ahead of a significant upgrade.",

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\nAnalysts say only one of XRP, ADA, and XYZVerse could deliver unimaginable gains by late 2025.\nTable of Contents\n- XYZVerse eyes memecoin breakout with presale, token burn, and major exchange listing plans.\n- With 17.13% burn and 15% liquidity, XYZVerse builds momentum as retail chases viral tokens.\n- Analysts say only one altcoin could soar by 2025 and all signs point to XYZVerse’s bold entry.\nAmong the top digital tokens, only a single project seems likely to rise far above the rest by late 2025. XRP, ADA, and XYZVerse each have strong communities and ambitious plans. However, close watchers suggest only one could see gains beyond imagination. The details behind this outlook might change how the market is viewed.\nXYZVerse price outlook: Can XYZ deliver a 30x gain?\nXYZVerse is entering the memecoin market as retail traders continue to chase community-driven tokens. The success of assets like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk shows that branding, viral marketing, and engaged communities can drive rapid price appreciation.\nWith the altcoin market showing signs of rotation and lower-cap tokens attracting speculative flows, XYZVerse’s presale launch could benefit from favorable sentiment — if the project secures high-profile exchange listings and sustains community momentum post-launch.\nMarket position and tokenomics\nThe project is targeting a broad audience through sports and influencer partnerships, with deflationary mechanics that include a planned 17.13% token burn. Liquidity reserves of 15% are earmarked to support post-launch trading, while 10% of supply is allocated to community rewards.\nXYZ price forecast\n- Presale price: $0.005\n- Post-presale target: $0.10 (project estimate)\n- Short-term potential: $0.15–$0.25 in the first two weeks, contingent on demand and listings\n- 6–12 month range: $0.20–$0.40, assuming broader adoption and top-tier exchange access\nBuy XYZ early for maximum gains.\nKey drivers\nA 30x jump from presale levels will depend on three factors:\n- Exchange visibility — Listing on platforms such as KuCoin, OKX, or Binance could drive immediate volume.\n- Community velocity — Viral growth via sports influencer channels could sustain speculative interest.\n- Macro backdrop — Continued strength in Bitcoin and altcoins would likely support memecoin inflows.\nAt $0.0053, the path to $0.10 represents a roughly 3,000% gain. The fundamentals for a strong initial run are present, but execution will determine whether XYZVerse sustains value beyond the launch window.\nInvest in XYZ before it surges.\nRipple\nXRP keeps pressing upward. The coin gained 8.56% in the past week, 9.84% for the month, and 18.61% across six months. It now trades between 2.93 and 3.41, a range that shows steady bids rather than wild swings.\nThe price sits a touch above the 10-day average at 3.29 and the 100-day average at 3.23. RSI is calm at 44.84, neither hot nor cold. A low stochastic reading of 21.99 hints at fading sell pressure. MACD has turned slightly positive at 0.009086, suggesting buyers still have an edge.\nA close above 3.41 could send XRP toward the nearest lid at 3.64, a gain of 8-12%. If that barrier breaks, the next target is 4.12, almost 25% above the lower bound of today’s range. Should price slip under 2.93, support waits at 2.68, about 9% below. A deeper fall to 2.20 would equal a 25% drop. With the coin holding over its 100-day average, odds favor a slow grind higher toward 3.64 in the coming sessions.\nCardano\nADA keeps traders glued to the screen. The coin trades between 0.73 and 0.85 after a fiery week that sent the price up 35%. A 36% jump in a month and a 25% climb in six months confirm that longer-term momentum is alive.\nBulls stare at 0.90, the nearest ceiling. Clearing it could open a sprint to 1.03, about 20% above today’s range. Yet the momentum index stands at 82 and the stochastic reads 92, both deep in hot territory. Add a 10-day average at 0.97 sitting above spot price, and buyers know they must push hard.\nIf bulls stall, 0.65 is the first safety net, roughly 12% below the lower end of the range. A slip under that may drag ADA toward 0.53, another 18% down. For now, the 100-day average at 0.83 acts as a magnet, hinting that sideways action could come before the next breakout. Hold that line and the chart favors another 10-20% leg higher; lose it and a 10-15% pullback looks more likely.\nConclusion\nXRP and ADA are solid options, but XYZVerse stands out. It aims for 30x growth by blending meme culture with sports, making it the top contender for market dominance.\nTo learn more about XYZVerse, visit the website, Telegram, and Twitter.\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party.

        "text": "Key points:\nBitcoin’s pullback is finding support near $117,000, indicating buying on dips.\nEther has given up some ground but is likely to find support near $4,094.\nBitcoin\nturned down sharply from $124,474 on Thursday, but a positive sign is that the bulls are trying to arrest the decline near $117,000. According to a recent Bitcoin Intelligence Report, BTC has immediate resistance just above $130,000, but its year-end target is near $200,000.Along with BTC, traders are keeping a close watch on Ether\n, which has been in a strong uptrend since July. According to SoSoValue data, spot ETH exchange-traded funds have recorded more than $2.9 billion in net inflows this week. That suggests institutional investors expect ETH’s up move to continue for some more time.ETH’s strength is giving confidence to traders that an altcoin season could be around the corner. In a monthly outlook report on Thursday, Coinbase Institutional global head of research David Duong said that market conditions “suggest a potential shift toward a full-scale altcoin season” in September.\nWhat are the important support levels to watch out for in BTC and the major altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.\nBitcoin price prediction\nBTC has pulled back to the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($117,485), which is a critical near-term support to watch out for.\nIf the price bounces off the 20-day EMA, it signals solid buying on every minor dip. The bulls will then make another attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the BTC/USDT pair above $124,500. If they can pull it off, the Bitcoin price could skyrocket to $135,000.\nConversely, a close below the 20-day EMA signals profit booking by the bulls. The pair may then dip to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) ($115,137) and later to the solid support at $110,530. A break below $110,530 could intensify selling, signaling a potential short-term top.\nEther price prediction\nETH is facing selling near $4,788, opening the doors for a retest of the breakout level of $4,094.\nIf the price rebounds off $4,094, it suggests that the bulls are trying to flip the level into support. If they do that, the ETH/USDT pair could rally toward the overhead resistance zone between $4,788 and $4,868. A close above $4,868 clears the path for a rally to the psychological level of $5,000 and, after that, to $5,662.\nContrary to this assumption, if Ether’s price turns down from the overhead zone and breaks below $4,094, it signals profit booking by short-term traders. The pair could then tumble to $3,745.\nXRP price prediction\nXRP\nturned down and broke below the 20-day EMA ($3.11) on Thursday, indicating a lack of demand at higher levels.The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to pull the XRP/USDT pair to the solid support at $2.73.\nOn the upside, a break and close above $3.40 indicates an advantage to buyers. The XRP price may then climb to $3.66. The next trending move could begin on a break above $3.66 or below $2.73.\nBNB price prediction\nBNB\nsurged above the $861 resistance on Thursday, but the bulls could not build upon the breakout.Failing to maintain the price above $861 may have tempted the short-term buyers to book profits. That has pulled the price toward the 20-day EMA ($794). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will try to shove the BNB/USDT pair above $869. The BNB price may then soar to $900 and later to the psychological level of $1,000.\nContrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could sink the pair to the solid support at $732. This is a critical level to watch out for because a close below $732 indicates a potential double-top pattern.\nSolana price prediction\nSolana\nturned down from $210 on Thursday, signaling that the bears are selling on rallies. The price is nearing the 20-day EMA ($180), which is a vital level to keep an eye on.The gradually upsloping moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint indicate that the buyers have a slight edge. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will attempt to overcome the barrier at $210. If that happens, the SOL/USDT pair could surge toward $240.\nThe first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day EMA. That suggests the Solana price could range between $155 and $210 for some time.\nDogecoin price prediction\nDogecoin\nturned down from $0.26 and fell to the 20-day EMA ($0.22) on Thursday, signaling that the bears are active at higher levels.The DOGE/USDT pair is taking support at the 20-day EMA, indicating buying on dips. Buyers will again attempt to thrust the price above $0.26. If they manage to do that, the Dogecoin price could reach $0.29. This is an important level to watch out for because a close above $0.29 could start a new up move toward $0.35.\nThe pair may remain inside the large $0.14 to $0.29 range if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages.\nCardano price prediction\nCardano\nskyrocketed above $0.94 on Thursday, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling near the $1.02 resistance.The moving averages have started to turn up, and the RSI is near the overbought zone, indicating that the bulls remain in control. Buyers will again try to propel Cardano’s price above $1.02. If they succeed, the ADA/USDT pair could surge toward the $1.17 to $1.25 overhead resistance zone.\nThe first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day EMA ($0.81). That opens the doors for a drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.73).\nRelated: BlackRock Bitcoin, Ether ETFs buy $1B as BTC price mostly fills CME gap\nChainlink price prediction\nChainlink\nturned down from $24.74 on Wednesday, indicating profit booking by the bulls.The RSI is forming a negative divergence, suggesting that the bullish momentum may be weakening. Sellers will have to pull the Chainlink price below the 20-day EMA ($20) to make a comeback. If they do that, the LINK/USDT pair could descend to $18.\nOn the contrary, if the price turns up from the current level, the bulls will strive to push the pair above $24.74. The Chainlink price could then resume its uptrend and rally toward the overhead resistance of $27.21.\nHyperliquid price prediction\nHyperliquid (HYPE) re-entered the ascending channel pattern on Wednesday, but the buyers are struggling to sustain the higher levels.\nThat suggests the bears are fiercely defending the zone between the channel’s support line and $50. Sellers will have to tug the price below the moving averages to gain the upper hand. The HYPE/USDT pair could then plunge to $36.\nThis negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the bulls push the Hyperliquid price above $50. If they manage to do that, the pair could skyrocket toward the channel’s resistance line near $64.\nStellar price prediction\nStellar\nturned down from $0.47 on Thursday, indicating that the bears are selling on rallies.The XLM/USDT pair is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the 20-day EMA ($0.42). If the price closes below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop toward the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.34.\nBuyers will have to push the price above the $0.47 resistance to signal strength. The Stellar price could then rally to $0.52, where the bears are expected to step in. The pair will complete a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on a close above $0.52.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "text": "These 3 memecoins have potential to reach $50 billion market cap this cycle\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\nMemecoins near $50b market cap as three tokens emerge with hype, utility, and growth potential.\nTable of Contents\n- Bonk, Pudgy Penguins, and Little Pepe are leading a $50b meme sector shift with real utility and scale.\n- Little Pepe’s presale is close to $17 million with audit approval, redefining the memecoin landscape.\n- Built as a meme-focused Layer-2, Little Pepe offers speed, fairness, zero tax, and anti-bot design.\nAs crypto cycles heat up, memecoins continue to defy expectations, turning community-driven branding into enormous value. With memecoin market capitalization hovering near $50 billion and institutional interest stirring, the potential for explosive growth is real. In this cycle, three tokens stand out as being primed to reach or surpass that milestone through irresistible hype, evolving utility, and structural advantages.\nWhy memecoins can still surprise\nMeme tokens succeed when they blend narrative velocity with tangible utility or scarcity mechanics. A viral meme can ignite interest, but long-term expansion requires product hooks: integrations, token burns, launchpads, or Layer-2 rails that reduce friction. Market cycles amplify these dynamics.\nWhen liquidity returns and traders search for asymmetric upside, projects with visible catalysts and growing ecosystems attract outsized attention. That combination — story plus utility plus momentum — is what can turn a modest market cap into something substantially larger in a matter of months.\n1. Little Pepe: The memecoin with infrastructure edge\nEmerging as perhaps the most sophisticated entry in the meme universe, Little Pepe redefines what a memecoin can be. Far from just cultural energy, it demonstrates clear structural advantages backed by tangible execution.\nIts presale is in Stage 10, priced at $0.0019, following the completion of nine sellouts that collectively raised over $16.4 million and sold more than 11.25 billion tokens. Credibility has followed momentum. Little Pepe is now CertiK audited and also cleared Freshcoins.io’s technical review with a strong trust score — moving scrutiny from speculation to security.\nThat gives it undeniable structural cred. But infrastructure is what sets it apart. As a meme-focused Layer-2 built for speed, fairness, and ultra-low fees, Little Pepe tackles the scale and access limitations older memecoins have struggled with. Analysts note its anti-sniper bot design and zero-tax model, features unheard of in most meme launches.\nThis unique technical foundation, layered with narrative potency — Einstein’s formula for explosive growth — has landed Little Pepe listings on several top decentralized platforms and promises of centralized exchange entry soon.\n2. Bonk\nBonk began as a Solana-native cultural play that quickly earned a broad holder base and deep retail distribution. Solana’s scaling story and developer activity matter here: as Solana attracts more users and DeFi volume, Bonk benefits from being the cultural token of that chain, with real use cases such as staking, NFT payments, and launchpad integrations that improve its odds of graduating from a viral meme to a pervasive network asset.\nCurrent market data show Bonk maintaining multi-billion dollar market attention on Solana, and if Solana’s narrative accelerates into the next leg up, Bonk is well placed to capture a substantial portion of the incremental meme allocation on the chain.\n3. Pudgy Penguins\nPudgy Penguins has a unique advantage thanks to its brand recognition that transcends niche crypto circles. Importantly, the PENGU token’s architecture is being tied to ecosystem features — from marketplace fees to in-game currencies — which changes the valuation calculus from pure speculation to utility-driven token demand.\nMarket trackers are already reporting Pudgy Penguins among the top tokens by market activity, and analyst coverage has begun to incorporate product roadmaps into price expectations; this institutionalization is the kind of structural improvement that can support a multibillion-dollar market cap expansion.\nThe road to $50 billion\nTurning any single memecoin into a $50 billion asset requires a confluence of forces: cycle-wide liquidity, mass retail FOMO, institutional interest, and real utility that keeps tokens in demand beyond the first spike. For BONK, the path runs through Solana’s resurgence and tighter tokenomics.\nMainstream adoption of PENGU’s brands, gaming ties, and token utility could push valuation into new territory. For LILPEPE, its current presale momentum, a Layer-2 launchpad, and CEX listing excitement can solidify the bullish narrative that rides to a multi-billion dollar valuation..\nThe bottom line\nWe are likely entering a chapter where memecoins are no longer a mere byproduct of crypto mania; they are becoming organized plays with product hooks and real economic levers. Bonk captures Solana-native culture and liquidity, Pudgy Penguins converts NFT brand power into token utility, and Little Pepe brings presale velocity, an audited codebase, and a Layer-2 roadmap that aims to scale meme innovation.\nCollectively, they exemplify different pathways to the same outcome: a re-rated meme sector capable of hosting multiple multibillion-dollar tokens. A $50 billion market cap for any of these projects would require several vectors to align, but the building blocks are visible. For investors with a bullish horizon and appetite for volatility, these three tokens represent distinct, credible asymmetric bets on what the next meme-driven cycle could look like.\nTo learn more about Little Pepe, visit the website, Telegram, and X.\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party.

        "text": "Bitcoin price derails as Polymarket Fed interest rate cut odds fall\nBitcoin pulled back and formed a risky pattern this week as market participants pared back their Federal Reserve interest rate cut expectations.\n- Bitcoin price pulled back after the hot producer price index data.\n- Polymarket odds of Federal Reserve cuts have fallen in the past few days.\n- Technical analysis points to more downside before an eventual rebound.\nBitcoin (BTC) retreated from the all-time high of $124,420 to $117,760 at last check Saturday, Aug. 16. Its market cap is $2.34 trillion, down from a peak of $2.47 trillion. This decline coincided with the declining odds of Federal Reserve cuts amid concerns about stagflation.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell, much to President Trump’s dismay, views a strong labor market as one paired with stable prices. Currently, that balance is lacking in the U.S., where tariffs enacted on Aug. 7 are driving up costs as companies pass import duties onto consumers.\nBitcoin pressured by falling Fed cut odds\nBTC price jumped to a record high of $124,420 on Aug. 14 after the Bureau of Labor Statistics published an encouraging consumer inflation report. While the core Consumer Price Index rose to 3.1%, the headline figure remained unchanged at 2.7%.\nThe sentiment changed a day later after the producer price index data soared to 3.6% in July. This report led to jitters about whether the Fed would cut interest rates in September, as many analysts had expected.\nThese jitters emerged on Friday when the U.S. released its latest inflation expectation report. A survey by the University of Michigan showed that inflation expectations for 2026 jumped to 4.9% and 3.9% for the next five to ten years.\nThese numbers, together with the weak nonfarm payrolls report earlier this month, suggests that the US is heading towards stagflation, which is characterized by high inflation and slow economic growth.\nTherefore, Bitcoin price pulled back as traders pared back their Federal Reserve interest rate cut odds. Polymarket data shows that the odds of a September cut, while still high, have declined from 80% to 70% as of today.\nHistorically, BTC price does well when the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates or when the cut expectations are rising.\nBitcoin price also pulled back after Austan Goolsbee, an FOMC member, warned that the bank needed more data to determine the next course of action because the impact of new tariffs would take time.\nBTC price technical analysis\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that Bitcoin price has come under pressure in the past few days. This pressure began to form as a highly bearish double-top pattern at $123,200, with a neckline at $112,000.\nBitcoin has also formed a bearish divergence pattern, as evidenced by the Relative Strength Index and the MACD indicators, which have formed lower lows and lower highs.\nTherefore, BTC price will likely pull back in the next few days and then resume the uptrend. More gains will be confirmed if it rises above the all-time high of $124,420.",

        "text": "Ethereum ETFs hit pause: $59m flows out as ETH pulls back from all-time highs\nU.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded net outflows of $59.34 million on August 15, ending an eight-day streak that brought $3.7 billion in total inflows.\nThe reversal comes as Ethereum (ETH) retreated from near all-time highs to current levels around $4,450.\nAccording to SoSoValue data, only BlackRock’s ETHA maintained positive flows with $338.09 million in single-day inflows, while other major ETFs posted outflows.\nGrayscale’s ETHE led withdrawals with $101.74 million in outflows, followed by Fidelity’s FETH at $272.23 million.\nEthereum price surge drives institutional interest\nThe recent surge in inflows coincided with Ethereum’s rally to $4,788. This brought ETH within 3% of its all-time high of $4,891.\nThe price surge attracted institutional investment through ETF products, resulting in cumulative total net inflows of $12.67 billion across all Ethereum ETF products.\nBlackRock’s ETHA has accumulated $12.16 billion in cumulative inflows since launch. This makes it the leading Ethereum ETF in terms of assets.\nFidelity’s FETH holds $2.74 billion in cumulative inflows, despite the recent outflows. This has helped it earn its position as the second-largest Ethereum ETF.\nVanEck’s ETHV and Franklin’s EZET reported zero flows for the day, and smaller ETFs including ETHW, CETH, and QETH posted mixed results.\nETF flows mirror price action\nThe correlation between Ethereum’s price movement and ETF flows shows how institutional investors respond to market strength.\nThe eight-day inflow streak began as Ethereum broke above key resistance levels and surged as prices approached all-time highs.\nCurrent outflows may show profit-taking after substantial gains or rotation into other cryptocurrency products.\nEthereum’s retreat from $4,788 to $4,450 has cooled retail enthusiasm. However, as Lookonchain reported, an Ethereum ICO participant transferred 334.7 ETH after over ten years of dormancy.\nThe participant invested only $104 in the ICO and achieved a 14,629x return.",

        "text": "Chart of the week: OKB, KCS, ADA, HYPE and ARB could extend gains\nBitcoin holds steady above $117,000, and Ethereum is trading close to $4,500 on Friday. Several altcoins like OKB, KuCoin, Cardano, Hyperliquid and Arbitrum posted double-digit rallies in the past seven days.\n- OKB rallied over 100% in the last seven days, in anticipation of half the supply burning on Friday, August 15.\n- KuCoin gained nearly 20% as traders fueled demand in response to the $2 billion “Trust Project” initiative.\n- Cardano posted 20% gains in the same timeframe, as Bitcoin and Ethereum rallied this week.\n- Hyperliquid price is up 15% and the token is close to $30 billion in daily volume catalyzed by whale accumulation.\n- Arbitrum price climbed 10% in the last seven days with institutional adoption, alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nTop 5 altcoin price analysis\nAmong the top 100 cryptocurrencies, OKB (OKB), KuCoin (KCS), Cardano (ADA), Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Arbitrum (ARB) gained between 10% and 100% in the past seven days.\nWhile the top two cryptos, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) climbed as traders turned bullish, speculation of an altcoin season is brewing mid-August.\nTable of Contents\nCardano\nCardano is currently trading at $0.9517, just shy of the psychologically important $1 level. Two key resistances for ADA are R1 and R2, at $1.1723 and $1.3264, respectively. Momentum indicators RSI and MACD support a bullish thesis for ADA.\nIn the event of a correction, ADA could sweep support at $0.6800, as seen in the ADA/USDT daily price chart below.\nKuCoin\nKuCoin’s KCS token could rally; the setup is similar to ADA. The closest resistance is at $8.71 and the nearest support is $3.40. Traders are expected to watch both levels, even though the momentum indicators support an extension of KCS price rally in the coming week.\nKCS is trading at $5.91 at the time of writing.\nOKB\nOKB is trading at $93.91 at the time of writing. The native token of the OKX exchange could revisit its recent peak at $142.88 if it climbs higher. The momentum indicators support gains in OKB and the token could extend its rally.\nRSI indicates OKB is currently overvalued; a drop under 70 could generate a sell signal. Traders should watch MACD for signs of a trend reversal in the native token of the exchange.\nHYPE\nHYPE could test resistance at R1, the closest resistance level to the current price at $50. HYPE is trading at $47.087 at the time of writing. The two closest support levels to HYPE are $42 and $35, marked in the HYPE/USDT daily price chart below.\nHYPE’s daily price chart supports a bullish thesis for the token. RSI reads 59 and is sloping upwards. MACD flashes consecutively taller green histogram bars, signaling an underlying positive momentum in HYPE’s price trend.\nState of altcoin season\nThe altcoin season index reads 47 on a scale from 0 to 100. A reading of 75 and above means it is officially altcoin season, a time period in which over 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin in a 90 day reference frame.\nOver 249 days have officially passed since the last altcoin season.\nThe index shows that it was Bitcoin season prior to July 2025, at the time of writing the market is between Bitcoin and altcoin season, with a reading of 47.\nWith Bitcoin’s new all-time high above $124,000, traders are speculating whether the cycle top is in and altcoin season is brewing. The largest altcoin, Ethereum, is climbing steadily towards its $5,000 target, supporting the thesis.\nBitcoin and Ethereum performance\nBitcoin corrected to $117,374, losing its gains after hitting a new all-time high at $124,474. The $130,000 is the next target for BTC as it enters price discovery. At the time of writing, BTC is less than 11% away from its $130,000 target.\nBitcoin could find support at $111,750, a level where BTC can sweep liquidity prior to its next leg up.\nRSI and MACD show mixed signals. RSI reads 51 and is sloping downwards. MACD flashes green histogram bars above the neutral level, supporting a bullish thesis for Bitcoin.\nEthereum is nearly 10% away from its previous all-time high. The largest altcoin faces sticky resistance at the $4,800 level, in its rally to the target. The $4,000 level is a psychologically important support level and a correction in Ethereum could send the altcoin to this level.\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

        "text": "Shiba Inu price at risk of a crash despite burn rate jumping 1,550%\nThe Shiba Inu price remained in a tight range on Saturday, August 16, as the recent consolidation continued; however, our technical analysis suggests a bearish breakdown.\nShiba Inu (SHIB) token was trading at $0.000013, down by 18% from its highest point in July and 27% below the year-to-date high.\nShiba Inu price risky pattern points to a crash\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the SHIB price has dropped below the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages, which is often a bearish sign.\nWorse, it is forming the highly bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, with its head at $0.00001760. The left and right shoulders are at $0.000016, while the neckline is at $0.00001027.\nThis pattern often leads to a strong bearish breakout. If this happens, the initial target will be the neckline at $0.00001027. A move below that level will indicate further downside, potentially to $0.000090.\nA move above the psychological point at $0.000015 will invalidate the bearish SHIB price forecast.\nRising SHIB burn rate not enough to boost price\nData shows that the Shiba Inu burn rate accelerated on Saturday. According to ShibBurn, the burn rate jumped by 1,550% to 3.77 million. 3.5 million of this burn came from one wallet, which moved its tokens to one of the inaccessible addresses.\nShiba Inu is one of the most deflationary meme coins, as the circulating supply has dropped to 584 billion, down from 999.9 billion at its inception in 2021. In theory, a rising burn rate should boost a token’s price by reducing supply.\nHowever, the rising burn rate may not be enough to ameliorate Shiba Inu’s woes. Nansen data shows that investors, who often buy low and sell high, have reduced their holdings to 61.7 billion from 70 billion last month.\nSimilarly, demand from whale investors has eased as their holdings have remained intact at 45 billion since early July. This is a sign that these investors don’t expect substantial gains in the near term.\nAdditional data indicates that Shiba Inu’s futures open interest has decreased to $173 million, down from $328 million as of July 22. Falling interest rates are bearish, as they indicate low demand among investors.\nWorse still, Shiba Inu’s ecosystem is not performing well, with the total value locked on Shibarium plunging to $1.69 million. Strong Shibarium growth is bullish for SHIB price as it boosts its burn rate and sentiment among investors.",

Bullish’s debut on Wednesday made it only the second publicly traded crypto exchange in the U.S., after Coinbase Global.\nGemini wants to be next.\nGemini’s IPO pitch comes with heavy losses attached\nThe firm confidentially filed in June and plans to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker “GEMI.”\nGemini, which hired Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to lead the underwriting, recently disclosed in its U.S. IPO filing that revenue fell and losses deepened in the first half of 2025, Reuters reports.\nThe filing, released Friday, left the offering size blank — perhaps the one number Gemini is happy not to put on-chain. Net loss came in at $282.5 million on $68.6 million in revenue for the six months ended June 30. Compare that to the firm’s $41.4 million loss on $74.3 million a year earlier.\nProceeds from the listing will be used for general operations and debt repayment, Gemini said. The firm also issues and supports several stablecoins, a corner of crypto freshly spotlighted after last month’s passage of the GENIUS Act, which sets a federal framework for dollar-pegged tokens.\nGemini itself mints the Gemini Dollar (GUSD), which is designed to remain pegged 1-to-1 with the U.S. dollar.\nGemini isn’t exclusive to the U.S.\nFounded in 2014 by billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini now supports more than 70 cryptocurrencies across 60-plus countries.\nThe company is also doubling down on tokenized stocks in Europe, rolling out 14 new U.S. equities — from Nike and McDonald’s to Uber and Adobe — that can be traded around the clock.\nThe move builds on its June debut of tokenized equities for EU customers, broadening access across the consumer, travel, and software sectors. Each asset is backed 1:1 by real shares and issued on Ethereum’s (ETH) Arbitrum network.",

It will also allow investors to gain Dogecoin (DOGE) exposure without directly owning tokens.\nThe ETF proposal joins similar applications from Rex-Osprey and Bitwise as the SEC weighs dozens of cryptocurrency ETF filings under the crypto-friendly Trump administration.\nDogecoin (DOGE) has failed to rally on the news, trading at $0.23 and down 2.3% over the past seven days.\nCoinbase Custody named sole asset holder\nGrayscale selected Coinbase Custody Trust Company to safeguard the ETF’s Dogecoin holdings, which will serve as the trust’s sole asset.\nThe fund is intended as a passive investment vehicle, with no active trading, loan utilization, or derivative exposure. Grayscale’s application identifies various risk concerns.\nThis includes DOGE price swings, regulatory uncertainty, and future competition from other digital assets. The ETF proposal conforms to the NYSE’s amended listing standards, effective January 31.\nCompetition builds for meme coin ETFs\nBitwise submitted its own Dogecoin ETF application in late January, also naming Coinbase Custody as the proposed asset custodian.\nThe multiple filings show growing institutional interest in meme coin exposure through regulated investment products.\nThe SEC is reviewing various cryptocurrency ETF proposals covering tokens including Solana and XRP following the more favorable regulatory environment under the current administration.\nGrayscale’s existing Dogecoin Trust has provided institutional exposure to DOGE since its launch, though the ETF structure would offer improved liquidity and potentially lower fees for investors.\nDogecoin’s lack of price reaction to the ETF filing contrasts with the typical response of other cryptocurrencies to news of institutional adoption.\nThe ETF applications must receive SEC approval before trading can begin, with no guaranteed timeline for regulatory decisions. Grayscale emphasized that share offerings will only become available after receiving authorization.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at levels around $117,400.",

        "text": "Ethereum ETF inflows hit 8-day streak as markets eye $5k price breakout\nThe U.S.-based exchange-traded funds are once again on a winning streak, strengthening market confidence in Ethereum ETF inflows and the asset’s price trajectory.\n- U.S. Ethereum ETF inflows recorded $639.6 million in inflows on August 14, marking their eighth consecutive day of inflows.\n- Total inflows over the past eight days have reached about $3.7 billion, signaling strong institutional demand.\n- Market expectations for ETH to hit $5,000 are high, with Polymarket bettors placing the probability at 55%.\nEthereum ETF inflows recorded another day of inflows on August 14, pulling a combined $639.6 million according to data from SoSoValue. BlackRock made up the majority of the inflows with approximately $520 million, followed by Grayscale and Fidelity with $61 million and $57 million each.\nInvesco Galaxy was the fourth issuer with inflows, adding a more modest $2.3 million, while the remaining five recorded no activity. Ethereum (ETH) ETFs have now stayed in the green for eight consecutive days, with total inflows so far reaching about $3.7 billion.\nThe positive streak follows a previous 20-day run of similar inflows, reflecting the funds’ strong performance in recent months. It marks a clear turnaround from their sluggish early days, when they lagged far behind their Bitcoin (BTC) counterparts.\nThe renewed momentum comes as Ether itself pushes to multi-month highs, surprising the broader market with double-digit gains after months of muted action. While the asset has dipped 1.5% in the past 24 hours to trade at $4,642 at press time, it is still up nearly 20% on the week and more than 56% from its lowest point this month.\nWith ETFs now showing solid institutional demand, optimism for fresh price targets is growing.\nEthereum ETF inflows could lead to $5,000 support\nPolymarket odds for Ethereum to reach $5,000 before the end of August stand at 55%. Though the bets are down 9% on the day, likely due to the recent pullback in price, the current odds echo broader industry expectations for the milestone.\nMore bullishly, bets for a new all-time high above the $4,800 peak set in November 2021 are at 90%, reflecting the overall positive outlook for the asset. The optimism is supported by the shifting market spotlight to Ethereum, evidenced by the fast-growing global institutional demand.\nAlongside ETF issuers, several corporate institutions are going all in on ETH, committing billions to accumulation and various treasury strategies.\nLong term, analysts see even greater potential. Standard Chartered recently doubled its year-end Ethereum forecast to $7,500, up from a previous target of $4,000. Some industry members, like Tom Lee, the chairman of the largest corporate ETH holder, have argued that the $7,500 year-end target may be too low, expecting ETH to significantly outperform current market expectations.\nMulti-year projections now stand at $12,000 by late 2026, $18,000 in 2027, and $25,000 by 2028–29. Still, moving from a new all-time high above $4,800 to $5,000 and eventually $25,000, will all depend on Ethereum maintaining its current momentum and upward trend.",

        "text": "Czech police arrest infamous darknet operator in Bitcoin-for-favors scandal\nThe man behind Sheep Marketplace, a defunct darknet hub, now faces fresh charges after allegedly funneling $45 million in Bitcoin to Czech officials in the justice ministry. Prosecutors confirm the probe covers money laundering and illegal drug operations, signaling a complex criminal web.\n- Czech police arrest Tomáš Jiřikovský, former darknet operator, over a $45M Bitcoin donation linked to the Ministry of Justice.\n- Authorities investigate money laundering and illegal drug operations connected to the donation.\n- Former Justice Minister Pavel Blažek resigned in June amid the scandal.\nAccording to a local report from Deník N, Czech police stormed the Břeclav residence of Tomáš Jiřikovský late Thursday evening, detaining the convicted drug trafficker after an attempted rooftop escape. The raid followed months of scrutiny into a 468 Bitcoin (BTC) donation, worth roughly $45 million at the time, which Jiřikovský allegedly made to the Ministry of Justice earlier this year.\nChief State Prosecutor Radim Dragoun confirmed the operation targeted suspicions of money laundering and narcotics trafficking, with investigators seizing evidence tied to both the donation and Jiřikovský’s darknet past.\nFrom darknet profits to political influence: Unpacking Jiřikovský’s Bitcoin scheme\nThe arrest of Tomáš Jiřikovský represents more than just another darknet operator facing justice. It exposes how illicit crypto wealth attempted to infiltrate the highest levels of Czech governance.\nAccording to court documents from his 2017 trial, Jiřikovský amassed his Bitcoin fortune through Sheep Marketplace, an underground platform that facilitated over 680 BTC in drug sales before he abruptly shut it down in 2013. In a brazen exit scam, he allegedly siphoned an additional 841 BTC from user accounts, building a war chest that would later fund his controversial political donation.\nA conviction that didn’t stick\nDespite receiving a nine-year prison sentence in 2017 for embezzlement, drug trafficking, and illegal arms possession, Jiřikovský served only half his term before being released on parole in 2021. Czech authorities never recovered the bulk of his Bitcoin holdings, a failure that now haunts the justice system as those same coins reappeared in government coffers.\nThe 468 BTC donation, traced by blockchain analysts to wallets linked with Nucleus Marketplace, another darknet operation, arrived at a politically sensitive moment. With national elections approaching, the scandal has become Prime Minister Petr Fiala’s administration’s most damaging crisis, undermining public trust in the ruling ODS party.\nThe fallout and failed cover-up\nFormer Justice Minister Pavel Blažek’s June resignation marked only the beginning of the political earthquake. His successor, Eva Decroix, commissioned auditing firm Grant Thornton to investigate the donation, a move that revealed damning conclusions.\nThe audit determined the ministry “should not have accepted the bitcoin donation” due to clear red flags about its criminal origins. More explosively, it suggested ministry officials may have violated anti-money laundering laws by processing the transaction.",

        "text": "Investors are preferring this coin below $0.01; here’s why\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\nSOL eyes $400 with ETF buzz and upgrades, but under-a-penny LILPEPE steals speculative spotlight.\nTable of Contents\n- LILPEPE presale nears sellout with $17m raised and aiming for up to 10,000% gains post-listing.\n- At under $0.01, it offers locked liquidity, no tax, fixed supply, and CertiK-audited code.\n- Outpacing many memecoins, LILPEPE’s tiered presale builds long-term holder confidence and demand.\nAfter weathering the 2022 storm, an Ethereum challenger has been quietly, then rapidly, winning back momentum, racing ahead of most dominant L1 ecosystems in both transaction speed and the hive of builder energy.\nFresh bullish models suggest that SOL could climb to $400 in the next major market run, helped by ETF flows, institutional recognition, and tech upgrades like Firedancer. But quietly, away from the spotlight, another coin is gaining ground among speculative investors — Little Pepe (LILPEPE). It trades for under a penny and doesn’t yet live on major exchanges. But despite the low price, it’s commanding outsized attention — and funding.\nWhy $400 may be a stretch for Solana\nIn the previous 2021 bull cycle, Solana came dangerously close to $260 before the broader market collapsed under macroeconomic pressures. Since then, SOL has bounced back considerably, regaining strength from its active developer ecosystem, cheap transaction fees, and fast execution.\nHowever, looking at the chart below, many experts warn that Solana’s price prediction beyond $400 could be out of reach, at least in the medium term. A glance at the charts shows a clear ceiling forming just around its ATH of $295.\nAfter hitting its ATH in January 2025, SOL has struggled to return to this mark. Technical analysts suggest that the longer it remains stuck in this range, the more difficult a breakout to $400 becomes. With strong overhead resistance and waning bullish momentum, $300 may be more realistic than $400 soon.\nLittle Pepe: Sub-$0.01 token with outsized potential\nThat brings us to LILPEPE, a memecoin with a surprisingly serious structure underneath. The token is currently in Stage 10 of its presale, with over $17 million raised and 11.5 billion tokens sold, nearing a complete stage sellout.\nInvestors are scooping it up not just because of its price, but because of what it represents: an early-stage opportunity with clear tokenomics, transparent mechanics, and arguably the strongest presale performance of any meme coin this year.\nThe fact that LILPEPE passed a CertiK audit with a 95% trust score has added even more legitimacy. Unlike many memecoins that rely on little more than community buzz, this project invests in long-term security and credibility.\nWhy many prefer LILPEPE over Solana at this stage\nIt may sound counterintuitive to compare Solana, a legend in the layer-1 race, with a memecoin still in presale. However, regarding risk-reward, investors are increasingly betting on asymmetric outcomes, especially during bull market run-ups. That’s where LILPEPE’s edge becomes clear.\nUnmatched entry point\nAt under $0.01, LILPEPE sits in the psychological sweet spot. It’s still accessible for the smallest portfolios, yet structured to prevent dilution, with no transaction tax, locked liquidity, and fixed supply with no hidden team wallets.\nPresale with serious momentum\nStage after stage has sold out in record time. Unlike meme projects that rely purely on virality, LILPEPE has achieved real presale traction, showing persistent demand through multiple pricing tiers. This isn’t a one-stage pump; it’s a carefully tiered launch model targeting long-term holder confidence.\nSmart tokenomics and security\nMany memecoins forgo audits entirely or opt for lesser-known firms. LILPEPE took the opposite path: engaging CertiK, one of the most respected blockchain security auditors. The 95% score isn’t just a badge, it’s peace of mind. The codebase is clean, permissionless, and fully transparent.\nProjected gains\nSolana doubling or tripling would be impressive, but LILPEPE has the kind of projection Solana had in 2021, when it traded under $1. With analysts calling for up to 10,000% gains, some predict a future listing price of $0.10 or more. That’s a nearly 100x return from the current presale price of $0.0018, with the final stage at $0.0019 and a projected listing at $0.0030.\nConclusion: LILPEPE vs. SOL\nToken Entry Price Target Price (2026) Potential ROI\nSolana $175 $300 ~2x\nLittle Pepe $0.0019 $0.10 50x–100x+\nFor retail investors hoping to turn hundreds into tens of thousands, LILPEPE offers an unmatched blend of low price, strong tokenomics, and validated security. With its presale nearly sold out and final stages in sight, LILPEPE might be the best-positioned underdog to surprise the entire crypto market in 2025.\nTo learn more about Little Pepe, visit the website, Telegram, and X.\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party.

        "text": "BitMine’s ETH buying spree is clogging Ethereum’s staking pipes: What comes next?\nA $130 million ETH purchase puts BitMine further ahead of its corporate rivals, but the influx lands just as Ethereum’s staking entry lines hit multi-day highs, squeezing validator activation timelines. Now, the question isn’t just who’s buying, it’s who can even move their coins anymore.\n- BitMine purchased $130 million in ETH, increasing its corporate holdings to 1.15M ETH.\n- Ethereum validator queues hit multi-day highs, delaying staking entry and exit timelines.\n- Meanwhile, South Korean retail investors are shifting from Tesla and tech stocks into BitMine and other crypto-related equities.\nOn August 15, a wallet tagged as belonging to BitMine received five large Ether (ETH) transfers totaling approximately 28,650 ETH (worth $130 million) from Galaxy Digital’s over-the-counter desk.\nThe transactions, tracked via the Arkham Intelligence dashboard, landed in BitGo-custodied wallets. BitGo is a U.S.-regulated provider of institutional-grade storage solutions, currently safeguarding over $100 billion in digital assets. The move follows BitMine’s recent announcement of a $24.5 billion stock offering, explicitly earmarked for expanding its ETH treasury, now valued at $5 billion.\nWhile sizable by any measure, the latest inflow carries broader weight in today’s market context. BitMine already holds the largest corporate ETH treasury on record, and each addition compounds its influence on Ethereum’s supply and staking dynamics.\nCorporate ETH hoarding meets staking congestion\nFollowing its latest $130 million purchase, BitMine’s Ethereum stash now stands at roughly 1.15 million ETH, worth over $5 billion at current prices, according to Arkham data. That figure eclipses every other corporate holder, including SharpLink’s 728,804 ETH, The Ether Machine’s 345,400 ETH, and even the Ethereum Foundation’s 231,600 ETH, according to StrategicETHReserve.xyz data.\nBitMine has stated that all of its holdings are staked for yield. This posture not only removes coins from circulating supply but also embeds the firm more deeply into Ethereum’s validator economy.\nThat economy appears to be under strain. Data from Validator Queue shows 355,919 ETH currently in the validator entry queue, with would-be stakers facing a wait time of six days and four hours before they can start earning rewards.\nThe exit queue is even more congested, holding 831,056 ETH with an estimated delay of 14 days and 10 hours. With 1,085,264 active validators and 35.6 million ETH (about 29.46% of total supply) already staked, the network is seeing one of its most crowded activation periods in recent weeks.\nFor smaller operators, these delays complicate capital planning. For large treasuries like BitMine’s, they signal that the staking landscape is becoming increasingly competitive and yield-sensitive.\nIs the market unfazed?\nMarkets appear to be treating BitMine’s aggressive ETH accumulation as a bullish signal. South Korean retail investors, locally known as “seohak ants,” sold $721 million worth of Tesla shares over the past month and redirected $269 million into BitMine’s stock alone, The Korea Economic Daily reported, citing data from the Korea Securities Depository.\nThe shift mirrors a broader appetite for crypto-linked equities, with Coinbase, Robinhood, and SharpLink also seeing heavy inflows. The trend suggests growing retail confidence in corporate ETH accumulation as a viable investment strategy, despite warnings from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who recently likened overleveraged treasuries to “leveraged poker.”\nYet risks linger beneath the surface. Buterin’s caution, while tempered by optimism, underscores the precarious nature of corporate ETH hoarding. A sudden market downturn could force liquidations, adding sell pressure. Meanwhile, the validator backlog introduces operational risks like delayed exits, which could trap capital at precisely the wrong moment.",

On Friday, August 15, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, was appointed interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum board. Fink will share the role with André Hoffmann, vice chairman of Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche.\nFollowing their appointments, Fink and Hoffmann emphasized the need for a more inclusive global economy and a broader distribution of prosperity. They also expressed interest in greater collaboration with governments on shared policy goals.\n“We remain optimistic. The Forum has an opportunity to help drive international collaboration in a way that not only generates prosperity but distributes it more broadly,” Larry Fink and André Hoffmann.\nAs CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, Fink has played a major role in accelerating crypto adoption on Wall Street.

Moreover, the Davos gathering is a popular target in many conspiracy theories, including the Great Reset, a term coined by Schwab.\nWhat is more, its founder, Klaus Schwab, was accused of nepotism, financial impropriety by his employees.

The move added 3.5% to the asset on the day and pushed total crypto market capitalization to a record high of $4.26 trillion.\nMow said there are now two possible paths for Bitcoin:\n“We Godzilla or Omega up, suck all the oxygen out of the room, and altcoins drop 30-40%,” or “alt mania” peaks, triggering a massive sell-off as the “Bagholder’s Dilemma loses equilibrium,” which would see BTC dipping briefly before going up again when altcoins tank, he said on Thursday.\nThe Bitcoin maximalist couldn’t resist having another bash at Ether\n, as he compared market capitalizations and said, “But no matter what, it’s impossible that Ethereum is worth 4,600,000 BTC,” before adding, “this has to correct sooner or later.”Bitcoin briefly flips Google market cap as investors eye rally above $124,000\nBitcoin climbed to an all-time high above $124,000 on Thursday, stoking fresh optimism that the next leg of price discovery could push the cryptocurrency’s market value toward Apple’s $3.4 trillion.\nBitcoin hit an all-time high of $124,457, leading the world’s first cryptocurrency to briefly surpass Google’s $2.45 trillion market capitalization, becoming the fifth-largest global asset.\n“Bitcoin all-time high and it’s only Wednesday,” said Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss in an X post, triggering optimistic responses, including from popular investor Kyle Chassé, who predicted that this would be the “best week for Bitcoin.”\nBitcoin’s new milestone has inspired a new wave of optimism, as investors now eye the continuation of the price discovery phase, which may see Bitcoin surpass Apple’s market capitalization next.\nBitcoin would need to rise above $175,000 to flip Apple’s current $3.4 trillion market capitalization, which may occur before the end of August, said crypto analyst and Taproot developer Udi Wertheimer in a Thursday X post.\nSEC to focus on “clear” crypto regulations after Ripple case: Atkins\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission is signaling an increasing focus on developing a clear cryptocurrency regulatory framework after ending one of the industry’s longest-running legal battles.\nThe SEC and Ripple Labs ended their almost five-year dispute after both parties filed to drop their legal appeals and bear their costs and fees, according to a filing last Thursday with the Second Circuit Appeals Court.\nThe case’s conclusion is a “welcome development” that ensures “minds once occupied with litigation now can concentrate on creating a clear regulatory framework for crypto,” said SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce in a Monday X post.\n“With this chapter closed, we now have an opportunity to shift our energy from the courtroom to the policy drafting table,” said SEC Chair Paul Atkins in response to Peirce’s post. “Our focus should be on building a clear regulatory framework that fosters innovation while protecting investors,” he added.\nThe SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, alleging the company raised $1.3 billion through unregistered XRP securities sales. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP was not a security when sold to retail investors but was a security in sales to institutions. Ripple was fined $125 million in August 2024.\nDeFi market overview\nAccording to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, most of the 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization ended the week in the green.\nThe OKB (OKB) token rose over 110% as the week’s biggest gainer, followed by the Aerodrome Finance\ntoken, up over 60% during the past week.Thanks for reading our summary of this week’s most impactful DeFi developments.

The Federal Reserve also says it now has a better grasp of risk management practices since the program’s launch.\nEnding the program allows for the integration of gained knowledge into traditional oversight frameworks.\n“Since the Board started its program to supervise certain crypto and fintech activities in banks, the Board has strengthened its understanding of those activities, related risks, and bank risk management practices. As a result, the Board is integrating that knowledge and the supervision of those activities back into the standard supervisory process,” Federal Reserve wrote in an update.\nBanks and the crypto market\nThe U.S. banking regulator’s announcement on Friday adds to similar moves in the past few months, including the Fed’s decision to remove several guardrails on banks’ crypto-related activities in April.\nIn this case, the Federal Reserve withdrew supervisory documents that pushed banks to seek advance approval before engaging in cryptocurrency and stablecoin activities.\nAs well as the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have pulled guidelines that meant banks had to take extra scrutiny when looking at crypto-related activities.\nThe OCC withdrew its hands-off crypto stance in May, with its announcement at the time stating that banks were now allowed to buy and sell custody-held crypto assets on behalf of their customers. Banks can also offer crypto custody services.",

Its market capitalization has dropped from a peak of $188 million to $127 million.\nWhales are buying SPK as staking inflows surge\nSpark’s price declined amid ongoing weakness in the crypto industry, with the combined market cap of all coins falling to $3.9 trillion.\nStill, its strong fundamentals will likely help it bounce back in the near term. Data on its website shows that more users are staking their SPK tokens. There are now 4,400 users who have staked 217.13 million tokens worth over $18 million.\nSoaring staking market capitalization is a sign that investors are optimistic about a cryptocurrency and are willing to hold it for the long term.

        "text": "XRP price prediction: analyst predicts $5 as markets weather liquidation storm\nAfter a brutal $1 billion liquidation wave knocked XRP to weekly lows, late-session buying suggests whales are reloading. Analysts now see the dip as a shakeout, with the next leg potentially catapulting prices toward $5 amid weakening sell pressure.\n- XRP rebounds from $3.05 after a $1 billion crypto market liquidation, with whale accumulation suggesting a potential breakout toward $5.\n- Analysts highlight a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart, but price must reclaim $3.13 resistance amid macroeconomic headwinds.\n- Institutional support and Ripple CTO’s remarks on XRP Ledger utility help underpin sentiment despite broader market volatility.\nOn August 15, a market analyst on X flagged a critical development: XRP’s price action had formed a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart. According to the analyst, this technical setup, which often precedes explosive upside moves, points to a potential breakout toward $5.00.\nThe call came just hours after the token weathered one of its most volatile sessions this quarter, with a violent liquidation cascade wiping out over $1 billion in leveraged positions across crypto markets and sending XRP tumbling to $3.05.\nYet, while retail traders scrambled, blockchain data revealed large holders were quietly accumulating at key support levels, propping the token back above $3.10 before it settled around $3.00 as of press time, crypto.news data shows.\nWhy XRP’s bullish setup defies short-term market pressures\nAt first glance, that bullish flag pattern pointing to $5.00 seems at odds with XRP’s 7% slide. But beneath the surface, this doesn’t appear to be an XRP-specific breakdown. The entire crypto market got caught in a liquidation whirlwind while traditional markets suddenly turned risk-averse.\nTraders started taking money off the table ahead of the Fed’s Jackson Hole meeting, sending U.S. stocks lower. And when equities sneeze, crypto tends to catch a cold. The correlation was unmistakable: when the S&P 500 faltered, so did XRP, testing critical support at $3.05 before institutional buyers stepped in.\nWhat makes this recovery notable isn’t just the resilience at $3.05; it’s the way XRP stabilized. Trading volume plummeted 38% after the midday sell-off, suggesting liquidation pressure had exhausted itself.\nMeanwhile, previous late-session volume spikes revealed large players were accumulating at discounted levels, treating the dip as a buying opportunity rather than a reason to flee.\nThis aligns with Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s recent comments reinforcing the XRP Ledger’s institutional-grade utility, a fundamental anchor that may be mitigating panic during technical downturns.\nThe path to $5: A battle between momentum and macro risks\nFor the analysts eyeing the $5.00 target, the key question isn’t whether XRP can break out, but whether it can do so before broader market headwinds intensify. For XRP to make its next move, two critical factors come into play.\nXRP faces a clear technical hurdle at the $3.13 level; what was once support has now become resistance. The market’s next move hinges on whether buyers can firmly establish this price as a new base of operations.\nThe bigger wildcard remains the traditional financial markets. Cryptocurrencies continue dancing to the stock market’s tune, and all eyes are on potential volatility from the Fed’s upcoming policy signals.\nYet zooming out reveals an encouraging setup. XRP currently trades within striking distance of its historic peak, and this period of consolidation bears an uncanny resemblance to the quiet before previous dramatic surges.",

On Friday, August 15, Solayer, the company behind InfiniSVM, announced the launch of SVM Bridge. The bridge will serve as an interoperability solution for networks using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).\nThe bridge will connect the Solana network with InfiniSVM and other SVM chains. Solayer claims that it will feature ultra-low latency and minimal transaction fees to keep asset transfers efficient.\n“SVM Bridge keeps interoperability native to SVM—deterministic, low-latency, and simple for builders. You sign once, keep your tooling, and move assets at chain speed without translation layers,” Chaz, Founding Engineer, Solayer\nBecause of its native support for SVM chains, the SVM Bridge eliminates translation layers. This enhances performance compared to similar interoperability solutions. Solayer claims that the network can achieve finality in one second, with fees at 0.0006 SOL.\nSolayer partnered with SOON, which is already building across multiple layer-1 models with its Decoupled SVM model. This enables it to deploy the Solana Virtual Machine on other chains.\n“SVM Bridge lets every SVM chain operate like one environment—composability without seams and direct liquidity across networks,” Joanna Zeng, Co-Founder of SOON\nSVM Bridge offers safer Solana integration\nSolayer highlighted that multichain bridges present significant security challenges. Since 2021, users and protocols have lost $2.7 billion in bridge attacks, making them one of the most vulnerable technologies in the blockchain space.\nThis is largely due to the fact that they introduce centralization in an otherwise decentralized environment. While bridge technology is improving, centralization remains a key concern.",

Strong support at $42.24 and rising volume signal the potential for a breakout into price discovery.\n- Price consolidating below $49.86 all-time high with strong bullish structure.\n- $42.24 major support flipped from resistance, holding as a demand zone.\n- Sustained bullish volume increases breakout probability into price discovery.\nHyperliquid (hype) has shown remarkable resilience, maintaining its bullish momentum with a series of higher highs and higher lows. Price action recently approached its all-time high, slightly front-running the $49.86 level, and now sits above a critical support zone that could fuel the next leg higher.\nKey technical points\n- Major Support at $42.24: Former value area high, now flipped into support.\n- All-Time High at $49.86: Key resistance level to break for price discovery.\n- Bullish Volume Profile: Sustained influxes of demand at higher levels.\nHyperliquid ’s bullish momentum continues to build, driven by a market structure that has consistently delivered higher lows and higher highs. The recent rally brought price within striking distance of its $49.86 all-time high before a minor pullback. This consolidation phase is occurring above $42.24, a critical high time frame support previously acting as the value area high. Flipping this zone into support has reinforced its importance, and holding it on retests will confirm ongoing demand from buyers.\nThis move higher also followed a liquidity run, reducing the likelihood of a deep retracement. The $42.24 level’s confluence with the former value area high makes it a natural launchpad for another rally attempt toward new highs. Below it, the point of control acts as the next significant structural and volume-based support — but price has not returned to this region since reclaiming it, further underscoring market strength.\nFrom a volume perspective, Hyperliquid continues to show healthy bullish influxes, reflecting strong interest and demand at these levels. A sustained rise in volume on any breakout attempt would provide additional confirmation for further upside. As long as this buying activity remains steady, the probability of taking out the $49.86 all-time high and entering price discovery significantly increases.\nWhat to expect in the coming price action\nIf $42.24 support holds, Hyperliquid is well-positioned to test and potentially break its $49.86 all-time high. A confirmed breakout with volume expansion could trigger an accelerated rally into uncharted territory. It is important to monitor how the volume profile behaves during the breakout.",

In addition to a highly publicized spat with NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, the progressive wing of the Democratic Party appears to be increasingly obsessed with the Trump family business dealing, which have only added pressure on the President following his support for the crypto industry.\nDemocrats look to crack down on Trump family’s crypto businesses, namely WLFI\nThe slew of democrats who have voiced concerns over Trump family’s crypto businesses range from Senator Elizabeth Warren through to Bernie Sanders and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, but many lesser known voices on the Democratic side of the bench are heeding growing calls from their constituents to look into Trump family crypto business.\nRecently, his family’s newest connection to a treasury entity called ALT5 Sigma has raised the specter of concern among house Democrats.\nALT5 is a fintech and blockchain services company co-founded by Tony Isaac in 2018. It recently welcomed several close Trump family and allies onto its board, including son Eric Trump, who in August of this year accepted a board position with ALT5 Sigma, along with several other prominent Trump family allies like Zach Witkoff, son of United States special ally to the Middle East Steven Witkoff.\nThe relationship highlights the potential for corruption within the world’s highest office, with Democrats arguing that Trump family crypto insiders are profiting from his role in the administration.\nEarlier this year, Eric Trump co-founded World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a cryptocurrency entity whose mission it is to advance US-pegged stablecoins and boost America’s global role in digital finance and DeFi infrastructure.\nAs part of the partnership between ALT5 Sigma and WLFI, the former has agreed to purchase $1.5 billion worth of WLFI tokens, a governance token associated with the WLFI entity itself.\nWhile WLFI’s primary aim is to make decentralized finance services—such as lending, borrowing, and portfolio management—accessible to mainstream users, especially Americans, and to support the global dominance of the US dollar via USD-pegged stablecoins. leading many to worry that the merger could be used as a way to curry favor within the White House.\nThe details of the WLFI sale and its role within the Trump family ecosystem has raised concerns among Democrats, who warn that crypto is being used by the President and his extended family to increase their wealth behind closed doors.\nAccording to the agreement signed on Aug. 11, ALT5 received $750 million worth of WLFI tokens at a valuation of $0.20 a token, and will directly inject an additional $750 million in cash following the registered direct sale of WLFI when it goes public as part of a treasury operation. Part of this money will be spent to acquire more WLFI tokens, in a flywheel that seems, at least from the outside, unscrupulous to Democrats.\nAfter the deal, ALT5 ended up with about 7.5% of the total WLFI token supply in its corporate treasury. Yet following the announcement, stock prices for ALT5 dipped from $9 to $5 but gradually rose to $7 by Aug. 13, as the market came to terms with reaction to the terms of the fundraising it is now engaged with on behalf of WLFI.\nTrump family and business dealings\nPresident Trump alongside his family occupies two mutually complementing positions: he is a cryptocurrency entrepreneur and a key figure in policymaking in the crypto space. Under the current administration, the White House has held a crypto summit, which established the national digital asset strategy. Trump signed a series of bills and orders, setting the legal framework for the stablecoin industry, encouraging investments in crypto ETFs, protecting the crypto business from debanking (a practice that existed during Joe Biden’s tenure), and pledging not to sell Bitcoin owned by the U.S. government.\nOn top of that, the new staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped Biden-era legal cases targeting key cryptocurrency companies like Binance, Circle, and many others. The SEC has invited the crypto industry to work on regulation together, with many in the crypto industry itself hailing Trump as the most crypto friendly President in US history.\nAt the same time, his family’s wealth has ballooned since he and his sons started dealing in digital assets. In June, Forbes evaluated Trump’s crypto fortune at $1 billion, which is nearly 20% of his overall net worth, the wealth tracker states. After the release of this evaluation, new cryptocurrency ventures tied to the the Trump’s have brought in even more money.\nAccording to an April 2025 report in the New York Times, entrepreneurs in the crypto industry have been secretly fielding offers from Trump-connected individuals to invest in WLFI.\n“Everything we do gets a lot of exposure and credibility,” said WLFI co-founder Zak Folkman, explaining the synergy the firm competes for in the still emerging DeFi space.\nOther crypto ventures associated with the Trumps include Bitcoin mining company American Bitcoin, a treasury company associated with Trump Media, and memecoins Official Trump (TRUMP) and Melania (MELANIA).\nWith respect to the memecoins, a report in the FT found that several wallets connected to the Melania coin pre-sale profited over $100 million from the token soon after launch, adding to concerns that the Trump family is simply using his time in office to profit from insider crypto deals.\nAll of this worries Democrats immensely.\nDemocrats double down on scrutiny into Trump family crypto dealings\nIn June of this year, Senator Jeff Merkley called for a ban on “Trump-style crypto corruption,” voicing concern that Trump’s unscrupulous attention to detail and sheer diversity into crypto is rife for potential misuse.\nIn July, Democrats also held an Anti-Crypto Corruption Week after Trump used the Presidential office to host several of WLFI’s largest holders, including, at the time, controversial billionaire crypto investor Justin Sun. The panel was overseen by Maxine Waters and Stephen Lynch who assessed that Trump had “stripped away the oversight mechanisms meant to keep crypto corruption in check, clearing the way for him and his allies to profit off their crypto cons in the shadows, unchecked.”\nFellow right leaning Republicans have also voiced similar concerns. According to right-leaning investor and author of the influential crypto missive Operation Chokepoint 2.0, Nic Carter, the release of the Official Trump token “opens the door to secretive foreign buyers trying to curry influence with our leaders.” Carter points out that a potential conflict of interest can be exploited vis-a-vis WLFI and other mechanisms, underscoring that any President creating memecoins opens the possibility to rampant violations of the emoluments clause, which bars direct foreign investment in the US political process.\nAll of this is to say that the Democrats, who are entering the fall mid-term election season in the hopes of retaking the House of Representatives, are now bringing increased scrutiny on Trump and his family’s crypto businesses. What will come of these and other entities? Pending a Democratic victory, team-MAGA may soon find itself in the crosshairs of progressive legislators keen on breaking up Trump-family crypto businesses.",

        "text": "AVAX price on the cusp of a breakout as key metric surges 715%\nAVAX price remained in a horizontal channel this week as Bitcoin and most altcoins jumped and then dived.\n- AVAX price has formed the bullish double-bottom pattern.\n- The adjusted stablecoin volume jumped by 715% in the last 30 days.\n- Avalanche’s DEX volume has been trending upward.\nAvalanche (AVAX) was trading at $23.78 on Friday, Aug.15, up by 60% from its lowest level this year. It has formed a unique pattern that may trigger a strong comeback in the near term.\nAvalanche stablecoin and transaction growth\nAVAX price could be ripe for a breakout as third-party data show that the ecosystem is performing well. One notable metric relates to stablecoin growth, an area expected to accelerate after Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law.\nArtemis data shows that stablecoin supply on Avalanche jumped by 14% in the last 30 days to $1.5 billion. Most importantly, adjusted transaction volume rose by 715% to $131 billion. This growth makes Avalanche one of the most active chains in the stablecoin sector.\nAdditional data from Nansen shows that the number of transactions on the Avalanche network has been on a strong upward trajectory. The network processed 4.5 million transactions in the past seven days, a 55% increase.\nAvalanche is also becoming a key player in the decentralized exchange industry. Protocols on its chain, including Blackhole, LFJ, and Uniswap, processed transactions worth over $7.7 billion in July and have already reached $5.8 billion this month.\nAvalanche’s non-fungible token network is also booming, with weekly sales soaring by 52% to over $1.42 million. This growth was driven by veBlack, whose sales volume rose by 72%.\nRising stablecoin activity, DEX volume, and NFT sales are all positive signs for AVAX price, as they enhance its utility.\nMeanwhile, Avalanche is also entering the tokenized assets industry. On Thursday, Dinari Financial Network announced it would launch the first order book for U.S. stocks on the Avalanche network.\nAVAX price technical analysis\nThe three-day timeframe chart shows that AVAX has formed a double-bottom pattern at $15.60, its lowest level in both May and July. A double-bottom is a historically reliable bullish reversal pattern.\nAvalanche has also moved above the 50-day moving average and is about to flip the neckline at $27.4. Moving above that level will confirm the bullish breakout.\nThe distance between the neckline and the double bottom is approximately 43%. Therefore, a breakout could see AVAX rally to $40, which would represent a 65% gain from the current level.",

        "text": "XRP poised for $4.19 expansion as bullish structure holds\nXRP maintains a bullish market structure despite its current correction, with technical confluences pointing toward a potential rally toward $4.19 once key Fibonacci levels are retested and held.\n- XRP remains bullish despite a corrective pullback, holding strong high time frame support at $2.80.\n- A retest of the local 0.618 Fibonacci could trigger a rally toward $4.19.\n- Market structure shows higher highs and higher lows, signaling sustained bullish momentum\nRipple (XRP) has been consolidating following its all-time high of $3.60, but the underlying technicals remain firmly bullish. A combination of Fibonacci confluences, high time frame support, and strong market structure suggests that the recent pullback may be setting the stage for the next leg up.\nKey technical points\n- Key Support: $2.80 high time frame support, aligning with previous resistance turned support.\n- Fibonacci Confluence: Retest of the local 0.618 Fibonacci could trigger bullish expansion.\n- Upside Target: Fibonacci extension target at $4.19 remains in play.\nThe recent all-time high of $3.60 marked a significant milestone for XRP. Following this peak, price action rotated back toward the value area high, where it found support and initiated a bullish reaction. This retest was reinforced by the 0.618 Fibonacci level and high time frame support, providing a strong technical foundation for continuation.\nAnother critical observation is that the local 0.618 Fibonacci retracement remains untested. A revisit and hold of this level would create an ideal higher low setup, enabling the market to springboard toward the next major resistance zones. Historically, XRP has shown strong impulsive rallies after clean Fibonacci retests, making this a key area to monitor.\nThe broader market structure continues to print consecutive higher highs and higher lows, signaling sustained bullish momentum. While short-term pullbacks are healthy for trend continuation, the current corrective phase remains shallow, suggesting that buyers are actively supporting price at higher levels.\nFrom a volume perspective, the profile shows steady demand near key supports, although a stronger influx of bullish volume will be needed to power through resistance and sustain higher price levels. Should $2.80 remain intact, this would further validate the bullish outlook, keeping the structure well-supported for continuation.\nWhat to expect in the coming price action\nAs long as $2.80 holds as support, XRP has a high probability of resuming its uptrend toward the $4.19 Fibonacci extension target. A bullish retest of the local 0.618 Fibonacci would be the final catalyst for acceleration.",

The two companies have signed a memorandum of understanding, which establishes a collaboration around WiseLink’s “bitcoin + cross-border finance” initiative.\nIn addition to WiseLink, Top Win secured private investments from other investors, including Chad Koehn, founder of United Capital Management of Kansas.\nInvestment towards the BTC strategy follows Top Win’s announcement of the venture in May.\nBitcoin treasury companies – 167 and counting\nTop Win’s move comes as Bitcoin treasury companies continue to grow in number. The market got a further boost following comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy leads the charge with 628,946 BTC, while Metaplanet and Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. hold 18,113 and 15,000 BTC respectively.\nLike other firms entering crypto with a treasury strategy, Top Win plans to deploy all proceeds from the raise into purchasing BTC.\nThe company also plans to consider investing in other publicly listed Bitcoin treasury companies, with some proceeds allocated as working capital. However, it does not intend to operate solely as an investment company.",

        "text": "These 3 crypto below $1 have massive growth potential\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\nAmid market uncertainty, LILPEPE, XLM & HBAR trade under $1 but show Ethereum-like potential for massive 2026 gains.\nTable of Contents\n- LILPEPE, XLM, and HBAR trade under $1, but LILPEPE’s presale buzz is unmatched.\n- It’s presale nears launch and eyes $1.20 by 2026 after raising $16.9m.\n- With Layer-2 speed and 1,200% upside, LILPEPE could leap from meme to market star.\nThe crypto market feels different right now, doesn’t it? The world is dealing with economic shifts, inflation stress, and whispers of another financial reset.\nWhile some people pull their money into cash, savvy investors are doubling down on undervalued assets, especially in crypto. Why? Because it’s the underdogs that usually give the most significant returns when things settle.\nBack in 2015, Ethereum was barely a whisper. Today it’s a titan. Now in 2025, three tokens under $1, Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Stellar (XLM), and Hedera (HBAR), are showing that same early potential.\nThey’re cheap now, but they carry serious long-term value. And if projections hold, LILPEPE could explode from its presale price of $0.0019 to over $1.20 by 2026, handing early investors wild gains. Let’s unpack why these three deserve your attention.\nLittle Pepe: The meme that’s growing muscles\nForget everything people know about memecoins. Little Pepe is built differently. It’s not just riding on nostalgia or hype; it’s backed by real infrastructure. This Ethereum-based Layer 2 chain was made for speed, fun, and function, allowing meme tokens to live without the high fees that kill momentum.\nStage 10 of the LILPEPE presale is 90% filled, selling tokens at $0.0019. That’s up from $0.0018 in Stage 9, and the price is about to climb to $0.0020 in Stage 11.\nThe full launch will be at $0.0030, meaning anyone jumping in now could walk away with a potential 60.89% profit by the time it hits exchanges. But that’s just short-term. If the current trajectory continues, analysts are already eyeing $0.10 to $1.20 by 2026. And with over $16.9 million raised, an ongoing 777k token giveaway, and a huge fan base behind it, it’s more than a meme; it’s a movement.\nLILPEPE is also listed on CoinMarketCap and audited by Certik, giving it a stamp of legitimacy that most memecoins dream about. And with 20 presale stages planned, things are only just heating up. The launch price is close, but post-launch growth could turn this frog into a prince.\nStellar: The steady hand in global payments\nStellar is focused on making global payments simple, fast, and low-cost. Think of it like the PayPal of blockchain, but with a much bigger vision.\nCurrently, XLM trades around $0.30–$0.40, and analysts expect it could hit $1 or more by 2026, with longer-term forecasts pushing past $2.50. It’s already partnered with IBM and other payment networks to streamline cross-border transactions.\nFor anyone looking for a coin that prioritizes utility and adoption over flashy marketing, XLM is one to watch. It’s been around since 2014 and has weathered multiple market crashes. That kind of resilience isn’t just impressive, it’s promising. Those who missed ETH in its early days, Stellar might be your second shot.\nHedera: The enterprise sleeper pick\nThen there’s Hedera, a quiet but powerful force in blockchain. Unlike typical blockchains, Hedera uses a hashgraph consensus model that’s fast, secure, and energy-efficient. It’s backed by some of the biggest names in tech and finance, and it’s already integrated into enterprise-level applications.\nCurrently, HBAR is priced around $0.25, making it seriously undervalued. Many see it rising to $0.50 or even $1 by 2026, especially as more companies move onto decentralized platforms. And while it’s not as flashy as meme tokens, Hedera might be one of the most stable underdogs in the market.\nFinal thoughts\nLILPEPE, XLM, and HBAR all sit under $1 today, but their potential runs deep. Looking for the one with the loudest buzz and the most significant upside? LILPEPE is the one to watch. That presale is still open, the clock’s ticking, and the launch is close. This could be a window for those who have been burned or sat on the sidelines too long. With LILPEPE already up 90% from its Stage 1 price, and potential gains of up to 1,200% if it hits $1.20, it’s not just hype, it’s math. Don’t sleep on this frog; it might just leap past $1 and keep going.\nTo learn more about Little Pepe, visit the website, Telegram, and X.\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party.

        "text": "Here’s why Aero crypto price is rising and targeting $2\nAERO crypto price continued its strong bull run, reaching its highest level since January as Aerodrome Finance’s revenue jumped and whale and smart money accumulation continued.\n- Aerodrome Finance token soared amid whale and smart money buying.\n- Its DEX volume and market share has continued to grow this month.\n- Technical analysis signals more gains to $2 possible.\nAerodrome Finance (AERO) jumped to a high of $1.4852, up by over 450% from its lowest point this year. The surge coincided with a big increase in volume, with the 24-hour figure soaring to $172 million.\nAerodrome Finance volume and revenue gains\nAERO price rose as third-party data showed that its network was performing well. DeFi Llama data shows that Aerodrome processed transactions worth over $1.122 billion in the last 24 hours, making it the fourth-biggest player in the decentralized exchange industry after Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and HumidiFi.\nAerodrome’s volume will likely continue rising after it is incorporated in Coinbase’s platform, which is used by millions of users globally.\nThe rising volume has led to higher network revenue. TokenTerminal data shows that monthly revenue jumped by 26% to $15.1 million, a trend that may continue this year.\nAERO crypto price also jumped as whale accumulation continued. Nansen data shows that whales now hold 13.27 million tokens, a 1.5% monthly increase. Similarly, smart money investors have increased their holdings by 22% in the last 30 days to over 16.34 million.\nSmart money accumulation is a bullish factor because these investors often buy low and sell high. More data shows that millions of tokens have exited exchanges in the past few months. There are now 1.3 billion tokens on exchanges, down from 1.33 billion on July 17.\nFalling exchange balances are a sign that investors are accumulating and not selling the token. In most cases, a surge in exchange inflows happens when investors are preparing to sell their tokens.\nAERO crypto price technical analysis\nThe daily chart shows that AERO has been in a strong bull run over the past few months, rising from a low of $0.2900 in April to $1.4880.\nIt has already moved above and retested the upper side of the ascending channel at $1.1123, confirming a bullish breakout.\nAerodrome has soared above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which formed a golden cross pattern in July. Therefore, the most likely AERO price forecast is continued upside as bulls target the key resistance level at $2, which is 45% above the current level.",

        "text": "OKX cuts OKB supply to 21m in $26b token burn\nMost token burns are incremental. OKX went nuclear with the destruction of 93% of OKB’s supply, marking the most radical deflationary move by any major exchange and leaving traders questioning what comes next.\n- OKX burned 278,999,999 OKB tokens worth $26 billion, cutting total supply from 300 million to 21 million.\n- The burn permanently caps OKB, removing its minting function and establishing a deflationary model.\n- OKTChain is being phased out, with remaining tokens automatically converted to OKB by August 15.\nAccording to onchain data captured on August 15, a wallet tagged “OKB Buy-Back and Burn” sent 278,999,999 OKB tokens, worth roughly $26 billion at the time, to an unrecoverable dead address in a single transaction.\nThe move, part of a broader overhaul of OKB’s tokenomics, permanently reduces the total supply from 300 million to just 21 million tokens, effectively mirroring Bitcoin’s hard cap. The burn follows OKX’s announcement earlier this week that it would eliminate excess supply accumulated through buybacks and reserves, locking OKB into a strictly deflationary model going forward.\nThe strategy behind OKX’s nuclear option\nOKX’s unprecedented token burn is part of a sweeping overhaul designed to fundamentally reshape OKB’s role in the exchange’s ecosystem. On August 13, the exchange revealed a multi-pronged strategy that goes far beyond simple supply reduction, tying OKB’s fate directly to the success of X Layer, its flagship blockchain network.\nThe most consequential change removes OKB’s minting function entirely. After August 18, when the upgraded smart contract goes live, no new OKB will ever be created. This permanent scarcity mechanism differs markedly from other exchange tokens, which typically maintain some inflationary controls.\nSunsetting OKTChain: The silent casualty\nBuried in the announcement was the quiet demise of OKTChain, OKX’s original blockchain project. The network will continue operating until January 2026, but its fate was sealed the moment OKX committed to X Layer as its primary infrastructure.\nOKT token holders are being forcibly migrated to OKB at predetermined rates, completing a consolidation that positions OKB as OKX’s undisputed native asset. This strategic retreat marks a rare admission from a major exchange that not all in-house blockchain projects succeed.\nOKTChain never gained meaningful traction against competitors, and its overlap with X Layer’s functionality made maintaining both networks untenable. The conversion process, which began automatically on August 15, has so far proceeded without technical hiccups, though some decentralized applications built on OKTChain now face an uncertain future.\nMarket reactions and road ahead\nOKB’s price action tells a story of cautious optimism mixed with volatility. After spiking 25% to $120 immediately following Wednesday’s announcement, the token has settled at $93.46 as of press time, still a 107% weekly gain but reflecting the market’s uncertainty about such radical supply shocks.\nThe retracement suggests traders are weighing whether artificial scarcity can compensate for the token’s still-limited real-world use cases beyond the OKX ecosystem.\nThe coming weeks will prove critical as OKX executes the final phases of its plan. By August 18, the token’s smart contract will be permanently locked, eliminating any possibility of future supply adjustments. Meanwhile, all eyes will be on X Layer’s adoption metrics. In binding OKB’s fate so tightly to its new blockchain, OKX has made the two projects inseparable.",

        "url": "https://crypto.news/lost-ethereum-wallet-worth-billion/",
        "text": "The billion-dollar Ethereum wallet that no one can unlock — why?\nBitcoin Pizza Day and the lost Newport hard drive have company — an Ethereum wallet worth over a billion dollars, frozen since 2014.\n- In 2014, Estonian banker Rain Lõhmus bought 250,000 ETH in Ethereum’s presale, storing it in a wallet that has never been accessed.\n- The stash, worth about $1.18 billion today, is fully visible on-chain yet unreachable without the lost presale password and JSON wallet file.\n- Lõhmus’s case joins Bitcoin Pizza Day and James Howells’s landfill hard drive as one of crypto’s most famous billion-dollar “what if” stories.\n- Ethereum’s presale encryption makes brute-forcing the password nearly impossible without strong clues, leaving the fortune likely to remain untouched indefinitely.\nThe untouched Ethereum wallet of Rain Lõhmus\nIn the summer of 2014, Ethereum (ETH) was still a bold experiment, its future uncertain and its value measured in cents.\nThe project’s founders were raising funds through a 42-day presale, offering early supporters a chance to buy ETH at roughly $0.30 for each token, a price that seemed speculative at the time but would later prove life-changing for those who held on.\nAmong the early buyers was Rain Lõhmus, an Estonian banker known for co-founding LHV Bank. He secured a large allocation, placing it in a newly created wallet that, from that moment, would remain untouched.\nThe wallet’s existence might have remained a quiet footnote in Ethereum’s history if not for a public revelation nearly a decade later.\nIn late 2023, Coinbase executive Conor Grogan linked an address holding exactly 250,000.0256 ETH to Lõhmus. The connection surfaced after Lõhmus appeared on Estonian public radio and mentioned losing access to his original presale wallet.\nHe openly admitted that it was no secret he owned it and even suggested he would consider splitting the funds with anyone who could help recover them.\nOn-chain records confirmed his claim that the address, labeled “Rain Lohmus” on Etherscan, had never executed a single outgoing transaction since the day Ethereum allocations became spendable.\nDespite this inactivity, it had steadily accumulated a range of airdropped tokens over the years, a side effect of simply existing on the blockchain during a period of relentless innovation.\nAt today’s market levels, with ETH trading at around $4,700 and daily global spot volumes approaching $60 billion, that dormant stash is worth about $1.18 billion.\nAgainst its original cost basis of less than $80,000 in 2014, the increase is almost unimaginable, rivaling some of the most famous early crypto windfalls.\nYet unlike those who eventually sold or reinvested, Lõhmus’s holdings remain frozen, inaccessible without the private keys that have been lost for years.\nWhere Lõhmus fits among crypto’s most famous losses\nCrypto’s early years are dotted with stories that blend chance, miscalculation, and the relentless march of market prices into billion-dollar legends.\nThe first, and perhaps most cited, is Bitcoin Pizza Day. On May 22, 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz spent 10,000 BTC to buy two pizzas, the first documented commercial transaction using Bitcoin.\nAt the time, the payment was worth around $40. Fifteen years later, with Bitcoin trading above $120,000 as of Aug. 14, those same coins would be valued at roughly $1.2 billion.\nThe second is the case of James Howells, a Welsh IT worker who accidentally threw away a hard drive believed to contain between 7,500 and 8,000 BTC.\nFor years, Howells pursued legal avenues to excavate the landfill where it was discarded, offering recovery plans backed by investors and engineers.\nIn early 2025, the UK’s High Court dismissed his claim, effectively closing the chapter on any realistic retrieval. At current prices, that cache would also be worth close to a billion dollars, securing its place in the canon of lost digital fortunes.\nRain Lõhmus’s situation now joins these as a third defining example in crypto’s “what if” category. However, the distinction lies in the nature of the loss.\nUnlike Hanyecz’s spent Bitcoin or Howells’s physically destroyed storage, Lõhmus’s 250,000 ETH remains fully visible on-chain, preserved in a single address that has not moved a fraction of a token since Ethereum’s launch.\nOn-chain data shows it represents around 0.2% of Ethereum’s circulating supply of roughly 120.7 million ETH.\nWhile this is far from a destabilizing amount for the market, it is large enough to be noticed and large enough to cement its status as one of the clearest examples of a billion-dollar ghost balance in the history of digital assets.\nWhy cracking a presale wallet is nearly impossible\nEthereum’s 2014 presale distributed purchased coins in the form of encrypted JSON files known as “presale wallets.”\nThese files contain the seed data needed to generate the private key, but the seed is locked behind the password chosen at the time of purchase.\nThe encryption process relies on PBKDF2-HMAC with a unique salt, a deliberate design choice that significantly increases the time and computational power required for brute-force attacks.\nWithout the exact password, or at least very strong hints, cracking the encryption moves from challenging to practically unfeasible.\nWhile there are open-source tools and professional recovery firms that specialize in this type of work, all of them require the original JSON file to begin.\nThe process is not about blockchain-level intervention or any form of reset; it is a localized password-cracking exercise applied to a strongly protected file.\nEven with powerful hardware, the work involves systematically testing password candidates from a finite search space, making the quality of any remembered fragments critical to success.\nPresale wallets introduce further complexity. If the wrong password is used, the decryption process can still output a valid-looking seed that produces an Ethereum address, but it will often not match the intended target.\nThis quirk means that recovery attempts must include a verification step to ensure the derived address is indeed the correct one, eliminating any benefit from so-called near misses.\nPublic discussions in developer forums and documentation for password-cracking tools consistently highlight this as a major constraint.\nIn practice, recovery rates remain low. Password-recovery services report most successes when clients can recall substantial parts of their original passwords, often in combination with personal wordlists tailored from past habits.\nEven the most optimistic practitioners frame their results in terms of carefully constrained dictionaries and years of accumulated expertise rather than guaranteed outcomes.\nFor someone in Rain Lõhmus’s position, the starting point is binary. If he no longer has the presale JSON file or any strong clues to the password, the probability of recovering 250,000 ETH is negligible.\nIf he does have both, the task shifts into an extended engineering effort that could take months or years, with a measurable but uncertain chance of success.\nIn either case, the outcome depends less on public curiosity and more on what was preserved, and how much of it remains accessible a decade after the purchase.",

        "text": "XYZVerse’s $15m presale: Momentum builds as liquidity rises\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\nA $750m USDC mint on Solana and XYZVerse’s $15m+ sports-meme presale are fueling speculation on where the next big crypto rally could emerge.\nTable of Contents\n- Circle minted $750 million USDC on Solana in under an hour, boosting liquidity and highlighting Solana’s DeFi strength.\n- XYZVerse, a sports-themed memecoin, has raised over $15 million in presale with a tiered pricing model and planned exchange listings.\n- Both Solana’s speed advantage and XYZVerse’s niche positioning are drawing investor attention ahead of the next market upswing.\nCircle has minted a substantial $750 million worth of USDC on the Solana blockchain in a single transaction window, within less than an hour. This alone marks a massive liquidity injection and contributes significantly to already soaring stablecoin activity on Solana.\nCircle’s rapid minting of $750 million USDC on Solana is a clear demonstration of rising demand for stablecoin liquidity, and signals Solana’s increasing role as a major DeFi and payment infrastructure hub.\nMeanwhile XYZVerse, a new memecoin pioneering a sports themed niche, has impressed many market participants with a presale jump above $15 million. With so much change, one question stands out, where is the most momentum building for the next major rally?\nXYZVerse presale crosses $15m\nIn a crowded crypto market, projects that manage to stand out tend to combine a clear narrative with real community appeal. XYZVerse seems to be doing just that.\nBlending the adrenaline of sports with the viral energy of memecoins, the project is carving out its own niche for fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports.\nWith more than $15 million already raised in its ongoing presale, momentum is building as the token inches closer to its much-anticipated Token Generation Event (TGE).\nA presale structure built for early movers\nXYZVerse has taken a tiered approach to its presale pricing, rewarding early participants with bigger discounts.\n- Stage 1 price: $0.0001\n- Current price: $0.0053\nThe next milestone is set at $20 million raised, after which the presale will move to its next stage. With five stages still to go, early buyers are locking in positions ahead of what could be a significant price step-up post-TGE.\nInside the XYZVerse roadmap\nThe project’s roadmap outlines a sequence of milestones designed to build both hype and long-term value:\n- Token generation event (TGE) – Once the presale concludes, XYZ will officially launch, backed by a large-scale marketing push.\n- Exchange listings – Plans include both CEX and DEX listings to ensure broad accessibility.\n- Community engagement – Fan-driven events, giveaways, and reward systems are set to keep users active and involved.\n- Deflationary burn mechanism – Over time, 17.13% of total supply will be burned to limit circulation and potentially boost demand.\n- Sports partnerships – Talks with sports organizations and influencers are underway to strengthen brand visibility.\nWhy investors are taking notice\nThe appeal of XYZVerse lies in more than just presale hype. The project is combining:\n- A fresh sports-meets-meme concept\n- A clear execution plan with measurable goals\n- Sustainable tokenomics designed for longevity\n- A growing, engaged community\nThis multi-layered approach gives XYZVerse a competitive edge in the memecoin landscape, especially in the sports-themed subcategory, a space still ripe for breakout leaders.\nSolana’s fast lane: Why SOL is catching eyes this cycle\nSolana was built for speed. While rivals like Ethereum and Cardano can slow when traffic rises, Solana keeps moving by packing more work into each block instead of adding extra layers. Its design lets developers write apps in several common languages and send thousands of transactions in a blink. The SOL coin is the fuel for all this action. People use it to pay fees, run custom programs, and earn rewards for helping secure the network.\nThe market now favors chains that stay quick and cheap, and Solana fits that mood. Trading volumes for SOL have climbed as new games, art markets, and finance tools launch on the network. Investors like its simple path to growth, no need to split the chain or bolt on fixes.\nEthereum still holds the crown for size, but Solana often wins on cost and speed, two big talking points this cycle. If demand for lively, high-traffic apps keeps rising, SOL could remain a standout choice among major coins.\nConclusion\nSOL’s strong USDC backing and XYZ’s sports-meme synergy position both for bullish growth. Yet, XYZ’s ambition and unique approach make it slightly more promising.\nTo learn more XYZVerse, visit the website, Telegram, and Twitter.\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party.

        "text": "SharpLink stays course on $2.6b ETH strategy despite $87m non-cash loss\nSharpLink’s Q2 results show an $87.8 million non-cash impairment on LsETH, but the company remains fully committed to its multibillion-dollar ETH treasury strategy. With 728,804 ETH locked in and compounding, SharpLink appears to play a longer game than quarterly reports suggest.\n- SharpLink reports Q2 2025 results with $87.8 million non-cash impairment on liquid staked ETH.\n- The company holds 728,804 ETH, worth roughly $2.6 billion, and continues aggressive accumulation.\n- No ETH was sold or redeemed; staking continues, generating ongoing rewards.\nOn August 15, SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ: SBET) announced its its Q2 2025 earnings, revealing an $87.8 million non-cash impairment tied to its liquid staked ETH (LsETH) holdings. This paper loss was mandated by U.S. GAAP accounting rules rather than reflecting an actual divestment.\nThe Minneapolis-based iGaming giant, which has rapidly positioned itself as one of the largest corporate holders of Ethereum, reported no sales of its staked Ethereum (ETH) and instead emphasized its continued accumulation strategy, now holding 728,804 ETH worth approximately $2.6 billion.\nBacked by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as chairman and ex-BlackRock digital asset strategist Joseph Chalom as co-CEO, SharpLink has staked nearly all of its ETH, generating over 1,300 ETH in rewards since inception.\nThe GAAP paradox and SharpLink’s unshaken Ethereum bet\nSharpLink determined the $87.8 million impairment on its LsETH holdings using standard U.S. GAAP accounting rules. The company compared the carrying value of each LsETH unit to the lowest price quoted on an active exchange since acquisition.\nWhen the carrying value exceeded this minimum, a non-cash impairment was recorded, reducing the carrying value of LsETH to $382.4 million as of June 30, 2025. Crucially, SharpLink did not sell or redeem any ETH, meaning the adjustment reflects a technicality rather than an economic setback.\nThe impairment highlights the volatility inherent in digital asset accounting but has not deterred SharpLink from doubling down on Ethereum.\nWhy Ethereum? Institutional-grade conviction\nSharpLink said its ETH treasury strategy hinges on Ethereum’s role as the backbone of decentralized finance, a thesis underscored by its high-profile hires and partnerships.\n“SharpLink’s treasury strategy is based on a single conviction: ETH will serve as the core trust commodity of the next-generation financial system being built on Ethereum,” the company wrote. “Every step of this strategy strengthens the Ethereum network and creates enduring long-term value, aligning stockholder growth with the growth of the ecosystem itself.”\nThis alignment is measurable. SharpLink’s ETH Concentration metric, a proprietary gauge of accumulation efficiency, jumped 98% from 2.00 to 3.95 in weeks, reflecting aggressive buying and staking. The company has deployed over $2.6 billion raised through PIPEs and direct offerings to amass its massive ETH holdings, nearly all of which is staked and yielding rewards.\nFinancial realities beyond the impairment noise\nFinancially, SharpLink reported $0.7 million in revenue and $0.2 million in gross profit for Q2 2025, compared with $1.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in the prior-year quarter.\nOperating expenses rose to $2.3 million, including $16.4 million in non-cash stock-based compensation linked to the strategic advisory agreement with Consensys, alongside other ETH-related unrealized gains and losses.\nAccording to the press release, the net loss for the quarter came to $103.4 million, driven largely by the non-cash impairment and stock-based compensation. Yet the company emphasizes that its long-term ETH accumulation and staking strategy remains intact.",

        "text": "Pepeto’s zero-fee model, cross-chain tools spark hopes\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\nPepeto is drawing investor attention with its meme appeal and real utility, while XRP holds steady as a proven market contender ahead of the next bull run.\nTable of Contents\n- XRP is trading near $3.14, with analysts targeting $4–$5.50 by late 2025 if adoption and regulation progress.\n- Pepeto offers zero-fee trading via PepetoSwap and cross-chain transfers through PepetoBridge, aiming to solve speed and cost issues.\n- At $0.000000147 in presale, Pepeto could deliver outsized returns if it mirrors the early growth of past memecoin successes.\nXRP, Solana (SOL), and Pepeto are all preparing for the next bull run, each with its own strengths. XRP is the veteran a long-running project that has fought legal battles, gained institutional interest, and seen growing ETF discussions.\nSolana proved in the last cycle how fast strong technology and a loyal community can push prices up, jumping from under $10 to nearly $260. Pepeto, known as the “God of Frogs,” is the new competitor.\nIt offers zero-fee trading and cross-chain transfers through PepetoSwap and PepetoBridge, staying on Ethereum while solving gas cost and speed problems. The winners in the next cycle will be decided by adoption, market sentiment, and performance in the bull run.\nXRP: Is this crypto on the verge of a major pullback?\nXRP is trading near $3.14, up about 0.6% in the last 24 hours. Futures open interest is close to $8.8 billion, and daily trading volume has more than doubled, showing strong participation from large traders. Still, XRP has not yet broken the $3.42 resistance level, despite testing it multiple times.\nData also shows open interest dropped from $11.2 billion to $8.8 billion, suggesting some traders took profits after the move toward $3.66. Without a strong breakout, the price could return to the $3.14 support before making another attempt higher.\nXRP price target\nThis doesn’t mean XRP is in trouble. The long-term outlook is still positive. Analysts expect XRP to reach between $4 and $5.50 by late 2025 if regulation improves and adoption grows, with more bullish 2026 predictions ranging from $8 to $15.\nXRP’s gains usually come from steady buying and gradual network growth, not sudden overnight rallies. For investors looking for stability and institutional backing, XRP fits well.\nWhy Pepeto could be the sleeper hit that 100x\nPepeto might look like another frog-themed memecoin, but it has much bigger ambitions. It’s launching an exchange only for memecoins, one that lists strong projects, charges zero listing fees, and removes pay-to-play deals. Behind the project, rumors say a betrayed ex-founder of Pepe is now adding the missing elements that could have made the original far stronger.\nPepetoSwap offers zero-fee, high-speed trades even during busy periods, while PepetoBridge allows safe, direct cross-chain transfers without risky third parties. This gives memecoins a proper home and keeps PEPETO in constant demand.\nAt $0.000000147, a $2,500 investment gets about 17.01 billion tokens. If the price rises 92×, that stake could be worth over $230,000, similar to the life-changing returns early Shiba Inu and Dogecoin holders enjoyed.\nBig move potential: $20,000 to $1 million?\nAt a live presale price of $0.000000147, the math is straightforward: if Pepeto simply re-rates to PEPE’s current level near $0.000009587, a $20,000 entry would be worth about $1.30m, roughly 65x on capital. And that’s before any fresh catalysts arrive.\nWhat could extend it? Multiple desks see a 5,000% path (50x) as realistic if Tier-1 listings land and on-chain activity scales. The thesis is grounded in product: a zero-fee PepetoSwap, a native cross-chain bridge, dual audits (SolidProof, Coinsult), $6m+ already committed in presale, and 850+ projects queued to list.\nIn short, working rails plus early float is why smart money targets this phase; once momentum turns public, the easy multiple is usually gone.\nConclusion\nXRP may be the steady option and Solana the proven runner, but Pepeto is the one set up to surprise. With zero-fee trading, a built-in cross-chain bridge, and a listings model that rewards real projects, it blends meme appeal with true utility. Audited by Coinsult and SolidProof and still early at $0.000000147, Pepeto has the tools and timing to become one of this cycle’s standout success stories. Some analysts suggest that a $20,000 position at this stage could easily grow to more than $1 million if momentum and adoption play out as expected.\nTo learn more about PEPETO, visit its website, Telegram, and Twitter.\nDisclaimer: To buy PEPETO, make sure to use the official website: https://pepeto.io.

For this reason, on Friday, August 14, Huma Finance, the company behind PayFi, partnered with Arf, Geoswift, and PolyFlow to offer same-day payouts to sellers on global e-commerce platforms.\nThe solution is particularly needed in Asia, home to one of the largest seller communities. There, timezone differences and banking hours often create significant payment delays. For instance, if a buyer in the U.S. initiates a payment after banks in Asia close, the seller will only receive the funds on the next business day.\n“Global e-commerce runs 24/7, but traditional banking rails don’t,” said Richard Liu, Co-Founder of Huma Finance. “PayFi closes that gap—turning settlement delays into real-time cash flow for merchants everywhere.”\nPayFi bypasses banking limitations\nHuma Finance runs the PayFi network, which coordinates payouts, provides stablecoin liquidity, and embeds AML/KYC checks for compliance. Arf provides settlement rails that bridge stablecoin liquidity with local fiat currencies.\nGeoswift receives the payout triggers and funds merchant accounts as soon as the instructions are received. This enables the network to offer payments in hours rather than days.\n“Our merchants asked for faster settlements,” said Raymond Qu, Founder & CEO of Geoswift and Co-Founder of PolyFlow. “We delivered and set a whole new benchmark for PSPs serving global marketplaces.”\nCross-border payments have long been one of the key use cases for crypto and stablecoins. Still, the system has a long way to go. According to McKinsey, stablecoin circulation accounts for $30 billion in daily transactions, which is less than 1% of all money flows.",

The combination of strong trend support and healthy buying activity keeps the bias firmly bullish.\nKey technical points\n- Key Support: $0.31 high time frame level, in confluence with a bullish retest.\n- Trend Structure: Consecutive higher highs and higher lows with 50 MA support intact.\n- Next Resistance: $0.43 high time frame resistance once swing high is breached.\nPrice action on Tron has established a consistent bullish trend, characterized by a vertical accumulation pattern where each pullback forms a higher low, followed by a swift push to new highs. The 50-day moving average has been acting as a reliable support zone, helping sustain the bullish trend on the higher time frames.\nThe $0.31 high time frame support has already been backtested successfully, confirming its role as a strong demand zone. Even in the event of a revisit, this level is expected to remain structurally bullish and provide a potential springboard for further upside.\nCurrently, TRX is approaching its swing high. A bullish breakout above this level would likely open the door for a push toward the $0.43 resistance, a significant high time frame barrier. Breaking and holding above $0.43 would mark a major technical milestone and signal continued bullish control.\nVolume analysis further supports the bullish thesis. The volume profile shows consistent bullish influxes, indicating healthy market participation. This sustained demand suggests that buyers remain active and committed to driving price higher. In vertical accumulations, rallies often persist until a blow-off top or climatic volume spike forms, something not yet visible in Tron’s current price action.\nWhat to expect in the coming price action\nAs long as Tron maintains its vertical accumulation structure and holds the $0.31 support, the probability favors continued upside toward $0.43. A volume-backed breakout above this level could accelerate momentum toward new highs.",

        "text": "Hong Kong SFC rolls out new custody standards for crypto platforms\nHong Kong SFC authority has unveiled new guidelines for how licensed crypto platforms handle customer funds, warning that recent failures overseas show the risks of weak custody controls.\n- The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission has issued new mandatory custody standards for crypto.\n- Service providers must apply stringent governance and security measures to safeguard customer funds.\n- The new rules require secure cold wallet infrastructure, robust withdrawal controls, and real-time cybersecurity threat monitoring.\nA new circular issued on August 15 by the Hong Kong SFC set out mandatory standards for licensed virtual asset trading platform (VATP) operators in the region.\nThe measures cover cold wallet infrastructure, transaction controls, third-party wallet oversight, and real-time threat monitoring, in direct response to the trend of industry hacks and scams, which have led to multi-million dollar losses in recent months.\n“The SFC sees the need for VATPs to critically review and strengthen their custody practices at a time when multiple cases of custody vulnerabilities have arisen overseas and the regulator’s own targeted review aimed to evaluate VATPs’ resilience against cybersecurity threats,” the announcement read.\nRecent reviews of local operators by the commission found that the majority only had “fundamental” measures in place, with gaps that could leave client assets exposed. In light of the discovery, the SFC’s new framework now lays down minimum standards all VATPs must meet.\nHong Kong SFC new rules regime\n- Senior management accountability: Service providers must appoint a designated ‘Responsible Officer or Manager-in-Charge’ to oversee custody operations, ensuring strong governance, internal controls, risk management, and overall compliance in operations.\n- Robust cold wallet infrastructure: Private keys should be generated offline in secure environments, using certified hardware security modules (HSMs) and proper backups. The SFC expects thorough due diligence on HSM providers, ongoing patch and certification management, and avoidance of public smart contracts in cold wallet setups to reduce attack surfaces.\n- Secure wallet operations: Platforms must guard against asset theft through strict withdrawal controls. Withdrawals must go only to whitelisted addresses, with multiple verification steps, segregation of duties, and air-gapped signing devices to prevent tampering or insider abuse.\n- Strict oversight of third-party wallet providers: If a VATP uses an external custody provider, it must apply the same security and governance standards as it would in-house. External custody solutions must pass rigorous due diligence, independent code reviews, and regular disaster recovery drills, with admin access tightly controlled.\n- Real-time threat monitoring: Platforms must run a Security Operations Centre to monitor incidents in real time, track balances, unauthorised access, and adapt alerts based on emerging risks.\n- Staff training and creation of awareness: All staff involved in custody must undergo role-specific security training, including phishing simulations and blind-signing prevention exercises, to strengthen human defenses.\nAll requirements are effective immediately, with VATPs expected to assess and upgrade their custody frameworks. The new mandate comes as Hong Kong continues to advance its mission to become a global digital hub.\nThe first stablecoin bill in its history recently officially came into effect on August 1, creating a licensing regime for issuers. Earlier this year, the government also issued its upgraded policy statement on digital assets, outlining priorities such as regulatory clarity and domestic adoption.\nHong Kong now stands as one of the most pro-crypto regions in Asia and continues to work on cementing its place on the global radar.",

        "text": "Forget Wall Street, Ethereum is where the real action is | Opinion\nDisclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial.\nEthereum (ETH) isn’t just another blockchain or a smart contract platform — it’s the rails, infrastructure, and lifeblood powering the future of finance. If you’re still watching Bitcoin (BTC) dominate the headlines and wondering when the world will “get” Ethereum, wake up. The shift is already happening, and the signals are undeniable.\n- Ethereum’s $450B market cap could realistically climb toward $3T by 2030 — not on hype, but on infrastructure, usage, and protocol‑driven scarcity.\n- ETH’s deflationary design means every transaction burns supply, while staking rewards pay in ETH itself, creating a rare yield‑plus‑appreciation loop.\n- Stablecoins, largely built on Ethereum, are emerging as the true mass‑adoption engine, quietly embedding yield into global savings and payments.\n- Ethereum’s ecosystem powers everything from NFTs to tokenized treasuries with unmatched uptime, security, and developer mindshare, leaving rivals in the dust.\n- As UX improves, blockchain interactions will become invisible, replacing bank delays and credit cards with seamless, instant settlement in everyday apps.\nLet’s get the basics out of the way. Today, Ethereum’s market cap sits around $450 billion. The global crude oil market is $2.6 trillion. So ask yourself — if Ethereum is the plumbing for global finance, why shouldn’t its market cap rival oil’s? Simple math says ETH needs a 6.6x jump from here to hit oil’s benchmark. At today’s ~$3,000 ETH price, that puts a realistic long-term target around $20,000. Not based on hopium. Based on infrastructure. Based on usage. Based on yield.\nETH has one more superpower: it’s deflationary. Every transaction burns ETH. Every interaction with the network shrinks supply. So the more Ethereum gets used, the more valuable ETH becomes. That’s not just supply and demand. It’s a protocol-driven monetary policy.\nEthereum offers yield on both ends of the crypto stack. Stablecoins (mostly built on Ethereum) offer yield via tokenized treasuries. Meanwhile, staking ETH directly pays protocol-native yield rewarded in-kind, with ETH itself. That means you’re earning more of the asset as it appreciates. Try finding that in TradFi without risk and friction.\nAnd here’s the kicker: getting into Ethereum staking now means waiting 11 days in the queue. That’s not a red flag. It’s a signal. Ethereum is the safest yield-generating asset in crypto, period. When you combine real-world yield through treasuries with blockchain-native staking rewards, you get something unique. Something durable that no other asset or chain can replicate.\nFrom breaking barriers to the global financial ecosystem\nEthereum is doing to financial services what the internet did to information: breaking barriers, creating infinite composability, and enabling permissionless innovation. It’s not just about DeFi. It’s about building the infrastructure where every financial product — from lending to insurance to credit scoring — can be replicated, automated, and scaled globally without middlemen.\nThe way oil powered the Industrial Age, ETH powers this financial renaissance.\nYou want to buy a concert ticket? That’ll be an NFT. Need a birth certificate? Same thing. Fractional real estate, tokenized T-bills, cross-border payroll, gaming assets. They all move through Ethereum. There’s no other ecosystem with the reliability (100% uptime in 10 years), scale, or developer mindshare to do this.\nSolana (SOL) is fast but fragile. Tron (TRX) is Tether’s (USDT) playground. Bitcoin is foundational but not programmable. ETH is the one protocol that can actually do the work and do it trustlessly, with a global developer base and the security to match.\nThe real mass adoption engine: Stablecoins\nEveryone’s talking about crypto ETFs and inflows. But the true vehicle of mass adoption is stablecoins. Why? Because they make sense. Because they yield. And because they solve a real-world problem: the demand for safety without sacrificing returns.\nU.S. treasuries are piling up like junk nobody wants. But through stablecoins, crypto becomes the insatiable buyer, soaking up debt, packaging it, and redistributing it in yield-bearing wrappers across a global decentralized network. Savings accounts? Dead.\nWithin five years, your grandma will be earning yield through a stablecoin savings app she barely understands, and that’s a good thing. In fact, most people won’t even realize they’re using crypto. They’ll just know their money works harder.\nThe UX bottleneck and the breakthrough coming\nWhat’s holding things back? Usability. Let’s be honest: interacting with blockchains today still feels like programming in the ‘90s. Wallets, seed phrases, bridging, gas fees — it’s too complex. But this is changing fast.\nThe future is frictionless. By 2030, nobody will carry a wallet. Nobody will swipe a credit card. Stablecoins will be embedded in every app. Wallets will be interoperable and invisible. Signing a smart contract will feel like signing into Netflix. And yes, web2 banking delays like “3 to 5 business days” will be a hilarious relic of a broken system. Wire transfers? Already obsolete.\nFinal predictions: ETH is the bet\nIn the next decade, the foundations of global finance will undergo a structural shift. Savings accounts will be backed by stablecoins, and credit markets will operate entirely on-chain. The Federal Reserve’s effective floor rate may one day be influenced by protocol-native yields—driven by staking returns and tokenized treasuries. Real-world assets such as equities, real estate, and debt will increasingly be tokenized, and Ethereum stands out as the only blockchain with the scalability and security to support this transition. Meanwhile, DeFi will democratize access to sophisticated financial strategies, unlocking tools once limited to institutional players. As this vision takes shape, Ethereum’s market capitalization could surpass $3 trillion by 2030.\nIf you believe finance is going digital, you’re already betting on Ethereum. Whether it’s stablecoins, staking, NFTs, or tokenized assets — it all converges here. And while the narratives swirl around memecoins and regulatory drama, the fundamentals keep grinding forward. Ethereum is shipping upgrades, scaling via L2s, and quietly becoming the substrate for the financial Internet.\nETH isn’t just part of the future. ETH is the future.",

        "text": "Berachain price eyes reversal as BERA gains yield power\nBerachain price is showing early technical signs of reversal as BERA becomes a yield-generating asset following the recent PoL v2 upgrade.\n- Berachain price surged to $2.40 yesterday on explosive volume, likely fueled by liquidity-driven trading activity following Upbit’s announcement of a temporary suspension of BERA deposits and withdrawals.\n- Early technical signs have emerged that BERA may be setting up for a reversal.\n- The PoL v2 upgrade now channels 1/3 of protocol emissions to BERA holders, effectively giving BERA yield power.\nBerachain price (BERA) surged to a high of $2.40 yesterday on explosive volume, far exceeding the average since launch. However, strong selling pressure capped the upside, leaving a long upper wick, and price has since pulled back to $2.15 at press time. Despite that, BERA remains above the 20 EMA and is holding most of yesterday’s gains.\nOne possible driver behind yesterday’s explosive volume could be Upbit’s Aug 13 announcement that it will suspend deposits and withdrawals of BERA on Aug. 27 to support the upcoming network upgrade. This likely triggered increased trading activity, as some BERA holders on Upbit sold their tokens, while traders on other exchanges noticed the volume spike and bought in. However, once the initial buying frenzy slowed, selling pressure exceeded buying, resulting in a long upper wick on the daily candle.\nIs Berachain price setting up for a reversal?\nAlthough yesterday’s spike was liquidity-driven, there are early technical signs that BERA price may be gearing up to break above the key $2.6 horizontal resistance that has capped the price action since early June. The consolidation pattern has shifted bullish, supported by an ascending trendline that shows buyers stepping in at progressively higher levels. Momentum has also improved, with the EMA 20 crossing above the SMA 50 in a bullish crossover, and Berachain price holding above both MAs.\nAdding to this cautiously bullish technical picture, BERA’s recent PoL v2 upgrade added a yield feature where 1/3 of protocol emissions now go directly to a pool that pays BERA holders in BERA. Any wallet can delegate tokens to earn this return without joining a farming contract. In practice, simply holding and delegating BERA now generates passive yield funded by the network itself, creating a built-in, predictable source of returns alongside existing liquidity incentives.",

The Nasdaq Composite hovered near the flatline.\nNotably, investors extended the positive sentiment seen throughout the week with an upbeat reaction to July’s retail sales report. The Dow also gained amid premarket upside for UnitedHealth (UNH), which jumped after a regulatory filing revealed Berkshire Hathaway had acquired 5 million shares of the healthcare insurance giant.\nRetail sales rose in July\nJuly’s producer price index data, released a day earlier, had dampened investor sentiment following hotter-than-expected inflation figures.\nHowever, fresh economic data released before the bell showed that retail sales rose 0.5% in July, meeting consensus estimates. Retail sales excluding automobiles rose 0.3%, also in line with forecasts. The previous month’s data was revised up to 0.9%, signaling steady consumer spending despite ongoing concerns about the U.S. economy.\nStock markets’ reaction to the report saw the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average climb further to hit record highs. Analysts say surge in retail sales is a pointer to the robust U.S. consumer market. Data also showed import prices rose in July amid higher consumer goods prices.\nIn this context, the S&P 500 is bidding to extend its push above its all-time high, supported by gains in technology stocks and the cooler consumer price inflation data released earlier in the week. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both up more than 1% over the past week, while the Dow is up 2%.",

The price is now consolidating below its $4,867 all-time high after validating a classic bullish continuation pattern.Can Ether’s price rise 34% in the next few days?\nEther’s “bull flag” hints at $6,000\nETH rallied more than 126% between June 22 and Thursday to reach a multi-year high just below $4,800. The latest rally saw the price breach the resistance provided by the upper boundary of a bull flag at $3,770 on the daily chart, confirming a bullish breakout.\nRelated: BlackRock Bitcoin, Ether ETFs buy $1B as BTC price mostly fills CME gap\nA bull flag is a continuation pattern that occurs after a significant rise, followed by a consolidation period at the higher price end of the range.\nEther has confirmed a ”textbook bull flag” in the daily time frame, said trader Mister Crypto in an earlier analysis on X.\n“The target is $6,000.”\nAs Cointelegraph reported, bulls are now focused on pushing ETH above a key resistance at $4,700. Such a move could potentially lead to the next leg up for Ether, measured at $6,150 or 34% from its current price level.\nHowever, it is important to note that the success rate of a bullish pennant is only around 54%, which makes it one of the least reliable patterns.\nMore ambitious projections have been made by other analysts, citing increasing institutional demand through spot Ethereum ETFs and ETH treasury companies, putting ETH’s top between $12,000 and $30,000.\nPercentage of ETH on exchanges drops to a new low\nETH percent supply on exchanges has dropped to a nine-year low, falling to 12.36% for the first time since July 2016, Glassnode data shows.\nDiminishing Ether supply on exchanges may signal an incoming price rally fueled by a “supply shock,” which occurs when strong buyer demand meets decreasing available ETH.\n“Only 18.5M Ethereum left on exchanges,” said popular trader Merlijn The Trader in a Friday post on X.\nThe trader attributed this to aggressive buying by ETF issuers and Ethereum treasury companies, adding:\n“When scarcity meets demand, price doesn’t go sideways. Supply squeeze incoming.”\nCoupled with over 35.7 million ETH staked (30% of supply), according to data from UltraSound Money, this “supply squeeze” signals strong holder conviction and reduced sell-side pressure.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "text": "Key takeaways\nBy analyzing fundamentals, social sentiment and historical patterns, ChatGPT can help identify altcoins with upside potential before momentum kicks in.\nWell-crafted prompts let ChatGPT act like a crypto assistant, generating watchlists, scanning social buzz and flagging tokens with real growth potential.\nUse ChatGPT alongside platforms like CoinGecko, LunarCrush or DEXTools to validate insights, track volume and catch early community signals.\nMany altcoin pumps are short-lived or manipulated. Use ChatGPT to identify red flags, such as anonymous teams or fake hype, and always DYOR before investing.\nCryptocurrency is a fast-moving and unpredictable world. Many people dream of spotting the next altcoin pump, when the price of a smaller crypto suddenly rises by a large percentage, before it happens.\nWhile there’s no guaranteed way to predict pumps perfectly, ChatGPT can be a powerful tool to help you do smarter research, spot patterns and filter noise from real signals.\nThis article breaks down how to use ChatGPT to analyze altcoins, track trends and identify early indicators of a potential pump.\nWhat is an altcoin pump?\nAn altcoin pump is a sudden and sharp increase in the price of an alternative cryptocurrency — i.e., any crypto that’s not Bitcoin\n. This usually happens when:A group of traders starts buying quickly (sometimes coordinated in pump groups).\nBig news or social media hype pushes the price up.\nA new exchange listing or partnership is announced.\nInfluencers or YouTubers start talking about the coin.\nSometimes pumps are organic and driven by real growth. Other times, they’re manipulated and short-lived (also known as pump-and-dump schemes). Your goal is to spot potential real growth before the crowd does.\nCan ChatGPT predict pumps?\nNot exactly. ChatGPT doesn’t have a crystal ball. It can’t tell the future or access real-time prices unless connected to external tools. But what it can do is:\nAnalyze altcoin fundamentals (utility, team, tokenomics)\nSummarize community sentiment from forums, Reddit, X, etc.\nDetect historical patterns from past pumps\nGenerate watchlists based on criteria you choose\nCreate strategies for monitoring altcoins.\nBasically, ChatGPT acts like your crypto research assistant, helping you make educated guesses instead of blindly chasing hype.\nStep-by-step: How to use ChatGPT for altcoin pump research\nYou can use the “Search” feature of ChatGPT to quickly find up-to-date crypto trends, news and market analysis across the web.\n1. Identify what you want to track\nBefore using ChatGPT, decide on your angle. For example:\nAre you tracking low-market-cap coins under $50 million?\nDo you want coins that are trending on social media?\nAre you looking for coins with upcoming events (like token burns or listings)?\nThe more specific you are, the better the results.\n2. Use smart prompts\nLet’s look at two example prompts you can use with ChatGPT to research altcoins:\nPrompt example 1: Altcoin watchlist based on fundamentals\n“Act as a crypto research assistant. Give me a list of 5 altcoins under a $100 million market cap with strong utility, active development teams, and upcoming catalysts (like exchange listings, partnerships, or events). Summarize in 120 words.”\nChatGPT’s response provides a clear and concise list of five low-cap altcoins, summarizing their utility, development status and upcoming catalysts in about 120 words as requested. It effectively highlights key points for quick analysis but lacks citation details for credibility and deeper verification. Do verify onchain data and up-to-date project information before making any investment decisions.\nPrompt example 2: Analyze pump potential from social buzz\n“Assume the role of a crypto market analyst. Analyze which altcoins are gaining the most attention on X, Reddit, and YouTube in the past 7 days. Look for sudden spikes in mentions, positive sentiment, or trending hashtags. Which ones might be getting ready to pump? Summarize in 100 words.”\nChatGPT highlighted trending altcoins by analyzing social traction across X, Reddit and YouTube over the past seven days. It clearly identifies Remittix, Solana\n, Dogecoin and Little Pepe as tokens with rising mentions and positive sentiment, suggesting potential price movement. However, it should also caution readers to verify onchain data and use up-to-date market info before acting on social trends.3. Combine ChatGPT insights with other tools\nChatGPT works best when paired with data tools, such as:\nCoinGecko or CoinMarketCap: For tracking market caps and price changes\nLunarCrush: For social sentiment\nDEXTools or TokenSniffer: For new coin launches and on-chain data\nX and Reddit: To catch buzz early.\n4. Be careful: Red flags to watch out for\nNot all pumps are good. Be on alert for coins that:\nHave anonymous teams\nPromise massive returns quickly\nHave very low liquidity or trading volume\nAre trending in known pump-and-dump Telegram groups.\nYou can ask ChatGPT to check for red flags:\n“Name 5 low-cap altcoins that might be a scam or pump-and-dump project.”\nChatGPT’s response lists five examples of tokens linked to scam-like or pump‑and‑dump behavior, including real-world cases like Save the Kids and SafeMoon. It also explains common patterns with unnamed micro‑cap memecoins and organized hype groups. However, you should verify this information before drawing conclusions.\nCaution: Don’t chase every pump\nWhile it can be exciting to hunt for the next big altcoin pump, it’s important to stay grounded. Many pumps are short-lived and driven by hype or manipulation, especially in low-market-cap coins. Prices can skyrocket in minutes and crash just as fast, leaving late buyers with major losses.\nAlways be cautious of:\nToo-good-to-be-true returns: Projects promising 10x overnight gains are often scams.\nAnonymous teams or no white paper: Lack of transparency is a major red flag.\nLow liquidity: If few people are trading the coin, you might not be able to sell when you need to.\nPump-and-dump groups: Telegram or Discord groups that coordinate artificial price movements are common and risky.\nUse ChatGPT to identify potential, but combine it with critical thinking and outside verification. The crypto market moves fast, but slow and informed decisions usually win in the long run.\nAlways remember that even the best tools can’t guarantee success in crypto. Use ChatGPT for research and insight, but always do your own research (DYOR).\nCrypto is volatile, and even promising coins can fall in price. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "text": "Quick Take\n• ATOM currently trading at $4.47 (-0.18% in 24h) • Cosmos's RSI sits in neutral territory at 48.20, suggesting balanced momentum • MACD shows early bullish divergence with histogram at 0.0032\nWhat's Driving Cosmos Price Today?\nWith no significant news events emerging in the past week, the ATOM price action reflects broader cryptocurrency market sentiment and technical positioning. The lack of major catalysts has left Cosmos in a consolidation phase, allowing technical factors to take precedence in determining short-term price direction.\nThe absence of fresh developments means traders are focusing primarily on chart patterns and key technical levels. This technical-driven environment often creates opportunities for those who can read momentum indicators effectively, particularly when a coin like Cosmos sits near critical decision points.\nCosmos Technical Analysis: Neutral Signals with Bullish Undertones\nThe current Cosmos technical analysis reveals a market in equilibrium, with ATOM's RSI at 48.20 positioning the cryptocurrency squarely in neutral territory. This reading suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, giving traders flexibility in their positioning strategies.\nCosmos's MACD indicator provides the most encouraging signal, with the histogram showing 0.0032 positive momentum. While modest, this bullish divergence indicates potential upward pressure building beneath the surface. The MACD line at 0.0113 sits above the signal line at 0.0081, reinforcing this constructive outlook.\nThe moving average picture presents a mixed but stabilizing scenario. Cosmos's current price of $4.47 sits right at the 20-period simple moving average, while trading below both the 7-period SMA at $4.59 and 12-period EMA at $4.54. However, the proximity to the 50-period SMA at $4.49 and 200-period SMA at $4.51 suggests Cosmos is finding equilibrium around these longer-term trend indicators.\nBollinger Bands analysis shows ATOM positioned at 0.5122, indicating the price sits roughly in the middle of the current trading range between $4.05 and $4.87. This neutral positioning within the bands aligns with the RSI reading and suggests room for movement in either direction.\nCosmos Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, several critical Cosmos support levels emerge that traders should monitor closely. The immediate support at $4.01 represents the first line of defense for bulls, coinciding closely with the lower Bollinger Band at $4.05. A break below this zone could expose the stronger support level at $3.90.\nOn the resistance side, ATOM faces immediate headwinds at $4.95, which aligns with recent swing highs and represents a 7.8% upside from current levels. Successfully clearing this barrier would open the path toward the stronger resistance at $5.32, offering bulls a potential 19% gain from today's ATOM price.\nThe daily Average True Range (ATR) of $0.26 provides context for expected volatility, suggesting normal daily moves of roughly 5.8% in either direction. This volatility measure helps traders size positions appropriately and set realistic profit targets.\nShould You Buy ATOM Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor conservative traders, the current setup favors a wait-and-see approach given the neutral momentum readings. The ATOM/USDT pair's position near multiple moving averages suggests a potential breakout in either direction, making it prudent to wait for clearer directional signals.\nAggressive traders might consider the subtle bullish MACD divergence as an early entry signal, particularly with ATOM's RSI having room to run higher before reaching overbought conditions. A position with a stop-loss below $4.01 and initial target at $4.95 offers a favorable risk-reward ratio of approximately 1:2.\nSwing traders should note that Cosmos sits well below its 52-week high of $10.13, suggesting significant upside potential if broader market conditions improve. However, the proximity to the 52-week low of $3.58 also indicates limited downside before reaching potentially strong buying interest.\nThe balanced positioning within Bollinger Bands and neutral RSI provide flexibility for various trading strategies, though risk management remains crucial given the overall bearish sentiment in cryptocurrency markets.\nConclusion\nCosmos (ATOM) price action over the next 24-48 hours will likely hinge on whether bulls can defend the $4.01 support level while pushing toward the $4.95 resistance. The neutral momentum indicators suggest a coin poised for directional movement, with the subtle MACD bullish divergence providing the most encouraging technical signal. Traders should monitor volume patterns closely, as increased participation could catalyze a breakout from the current consolidation range around the $4.47 level.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Quick Take\n• BCH currently trading at $589.00 (-1.16% in 24h) • Bitcoin Cash RSI at 56.15 suggests neutral momentum after recent surge • August halving event continues to drive underlying bullish sentiment despite short-term pullback\nWhat's Driving Bitcoin Cash Price Today?\nThe BCH price has entered a consolidation phase after reaching $618.20 just two days ago, marking the highest level since the current rally began. This slight retreat of 1.16% over the past 24 hours represents a natural cooling-off period following the intense buying pressure that drove Bitcoin Cash nearly 8% higher in the first half of August.\nThe primary catalyst remains Bitcoin Cash's upcoming August halving event, which has generated significant trader interest and positioned BCH as one of the standout performers in recent weeks. Trading volume data shows a 30% weekly increase on major exchanges as of August 13, indicating sustained institutional and retail participation despite the current price consolidation.\nMarket dynamics suggest that while the immediate halving euphoria may be moderating, the fundamental supply reduction mechanism continues to underpin longer-term bullish expectations for Bitcoin Cash. The recent price action demonstrates healthy profit-taking behavior rather than any fundamental shift in market sentiment.\nBCH Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nBitcoin Cash technical analysis reveals a cryptocurrency in transition between its recent explosive rally and potential next directional move. The Bitcoin Cash RSI currently sits at 56.15, positioning BCH in neutral territory after cooling from overbought conditions that accompanied the push to $618.\nThe moving average structure remains decidedly bullish for Bitcoin Cash, with the current BCH price of $589 trading well above all major moving averages. Most notably, Bitcoin Cash trades 43% above its 200-day SMA at $409.65, confirming the strength of the longer-term uptrend.\nBitcoin Cash's MACD indicator shows a positive reading of 18.0161 with a bullish histogram of 0.1453, suggesting that upward momentum persists despite the recent pause. The Bollinger Bands analysis places BCH at a %B position of 0.6584, indicating the cryptocurrency remains in the upper portion of its recent trading range without reaching extreme overbought levels.\nBitcoin Cash's daily ATR of $30.49 reflects elevated volatility, which is typical during significant market events like halvings. This volatility measure suggests traders should expect continued price swings as the halving event approaches.\nBitcoin Cash Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical Bitcoin Cash support levels emerge at $514.50 for immediate downside protection, with stronger support established at $468.80. These levels represent key areas where institutional buyers have previously stepped in, based on Binance spot market data analysis.\nOn the upside, BCH resistance concentrates at $634.30, which represents both immediate and strong resistance according to current technical readings. A decisive break above this level could target the psychological $650 zone and potentially the BCH 52-week high of $622.30.\nThe current trading range between $580.10 and $598.30 over the past 24 hours establishes a near-term battleground for Bitcoin Cash price direction. Bulls need to reclaim the $600 psychological level to reignite the halving rally, while bears would target a break below $580 to signal deeper retracement.\nShould You Buy BCH Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor aggressive traders, the current BCH price offers an attractive entry point with a clear risk-reward setup. With Bitcoin Cash trading at $589 and strong support at $514.50, the downside risk measures approximately 12.6% to the first major support level.\nConservative investors might wait for either a decisive break above $634.30 resistance or a deeper pullback toward the $550 zone, which aligns with the 50-day moving average at $537.73. This approach offers better risk management while still capturing potential halving-driven upside.\nSwing traders can utilize the current consolidation pattern, buying near $580 support and targeting $620-630 resistance. The 30-day BCH RSI reading of 56.15 provides room for additional upside without immediately triggering overbought conditions.\nRisk management remains crucial given Bitcoin Cash's ATR of $30.49, suggesting daily moves of $30+ are common in current market conditions. Position sizing should account for this volatility while maintaining exposure to potential halving catalysts.\nConclusion\nBitcoin Cash price action suggests a healthy consolidation after significant gains, with the August halving event providing continued fundamental support for BCH. Technical indicators show mixed signals that favor neither bulls nor bears definitively, making the next 24-48 hours critical for establishing short-term direction. Traders should monitor the $580-634 range closely, as breaks in either direction could signal the next significant move for Bitcoin Cash.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Quick Take\n• UNI currently trading at $10.86 (-1.29% in 24h) • Uniswap's RSI at 55.72 indicates neutral territory with room for upward movement • Recent whale activity from Amber Group drove earlier bullish momentum but market now consolidating\nWhat's Driving Uniswap Price Today?\nThe UNI price experienced a pullback today, declining 1.29% to $10.86 despite earlier bullish momentum from significant whale activity. On August 11, Uniswap's token climbed to $11.08 following substantial whale transactions, including Amber Group's sale of 358,000 UNI tokens on Binance, which paradoxically supported bullish sentiment in the DeFi market.\nHowever, the UNI price has since retreated from these highs, with yesterday's market overview noting that Uniswap approached key resistance at $11.40 after rising from $10.788 to $11.399. The current consolidation suggests traders are taking profits after the recent rally, though the underlying DeFi market sentiment remains constructive.\nThe broader cryptocurrency market's mixed signals have also influenced UNI's price action, with technical indicators showing conflicting momentum signals that reflect the current uncertainty among traders.\nUNI Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals With Bullish Undertones\nDespite the recent decline, Uniswap technical analysis reveals several encouraging signs for potential recovery. UNI's RSI at 55.72 sits in neutral territory, providing room for upward movement without entering overbought conditions. This positioning suggests that any renewed buying pressure could drive prices higher without immediate technical resistance from momentum indicators.\nThe MACD analysis shows particularly interesting dynamics, with Uniswap's MACD line at 0.4810 sitting above the signal line at 0.4784. The positive MACD histogram of 0.0026 indicates bullish momentum is still present beneath the surface, even as the UNI price consolidates.\nUniswap's position relative to moving averages presents a mixed but generally positive picture. The current UNI price of $10.86 trades above the critical 20-day SMA at $10.34 and significantly above the 50-day SMA at $9.40, confirming the medium-term uptrend remains intact. However, UNI trades below the short-term 7-day SMA at $11.17, explaining the recent weakness.\nThe Bollinger Bands analysis shows UNI positioned at 0.65 between the bands, suggesting moderate momentum without extreme positioning. With the upper band at $12.06 and lower band at $8.61, Uniswap has room to move in either direction.\nUniswap Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, several critical levels will determine UNI's next move. Uniswap support levels appear solid, with immediate support at $8.68 and strong support at $6.50. The current trading range between $11.15 and $10.42 over the past 24 hours shows consolidation above the key $10.34 level.\nUNI resistance emerges at $12.30, which represents both immediate and strong resistance according to technical analysis. A break above this level could target the 52-week high of $18.60, though such a move would require significant bullish catalysts.\nThe pivot point at $10.81 sits just below current prices, suggesting UNI maintains a slight bullish bias despite today's decline. Traders should watch whether Uniswap can hold above this level during any further selling pressure.\nShould You Buy UNI Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nThe current UNI price presents different opportunities depending on trading style and risk tolerance. Conservative traders might wait for a test of the $8.68 support level before considering entry, as this would provide a more favorable risk-reward ratio with clear stop-loss placement below strong support at $6.50.\nAggressive traders could consider the current levels attractive, given the neutral UNI RSI reading and positive MACD signals. The risk from current levels to immediate support at $8.68 represents approximately 20% downside, while a move to resistance at $12.30 offers 13% upside potential.\nSwing traders should monitor the UNI/USDT pair's ability to reclaim the 7-day SMA at $11.17, as this would signal renewed bullish momentum. The daily ATR of $0.86 suggests normal volatility levels, making position sizing calculations more predictable.\nGiven Uniswap's overall trend classification as \"Very Strong Bullish\" despite recent weakness, any significant dips may present buying opportunities for longer-term holders focused on DeFi sector recovery.\nConclusion\nThe UNI price faces a critical juncture at $10.86, with technical indicators suggesting the recent pullback may be temporary consolidation rather than trend reversal. While whale activity provided earlier support, current market dynamics require UNI to prove its resilience above key support levels. Traders should watch for a reclaim of $11.17 to signal renewed bullish momentum, while any break below $10.34 could trigger deeper correction toward $8.68 support. The next 24-48 hours will likely determine whether Uniswap can resume its bullish trajectory or requires further consolidation before the next leg higher.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Quick Take\n• LTC currently trading at $117.70 (-2.31% in 24h) • Litecoin's RSI sits in neutral territory at 52.19 following recent breakout • Payment adoption surge drives LTC to second position on CoinGate platform\nWhat's Driving Litecoin Price Today?\nLitecoin has entered a consolidation phase after an impressive 11% weekly surge that pushed the LTC price to $124.90 on August 10th. The recent pullback reflects natural profit-taking following Litecoin's breakout from a three-year consolidation pattern, which generated significant bullish momentum earlier this week.\nThe primary catalyst behind Litecoin's recent strength stems from its rising adoption in the payments sector. CoinGate's latest data shows Litecoin has claimed the second position among cryptocurrencies used for payments, marking a significant milestone for real-world utility. This development coincided with the LTC price surge of 10.85% in a single day on August 9th, demonstrating how adoption metrics directly influence market sentiment.\nLitecoin's market capitalization reaching $9.54 billion further validates the sustained investor confidence, with the 3.7% increase against the U.S. dollar reflecting broader institutional interest. The anticipation surrounding Litecoin's upcoming halving event continues to provide fundamental support, though the immediate LTC price action suggests traders are positioning cautiously after the recent rally.\nLTC Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nLitecoin technical analysis reveals a complex picture following the recent breakout. The LTC RSI reading of 52.19 indicates neutral momentum, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This positioning allows room for movement in either direction, making it crucial for traders to monitor other indicators.\nThe MACD histogram shows a bearish divergence at -0.7866, indicating weakening bullish momentum despite the overall positive MACD reading of 4.6035. This suggests the recent rally may be losing steam in the short term, though the broader trend remains intact.\nLitecoin's position relative to its moving averages paints a bullish picture. The LTC price currently trades above the SMA 20 ($117.40), SMA 50 ($105.90), and SMA 200 ($98.16), confirming the overall Very Strong Bullish trend classification. However, the price sits below the shorter-term SMA 7 ($123.33) and EMA 12 ($120.72), indicating recent weakness.\nThe Bollinger Bands analysis shows LTC trading near the middle band at $117.40, with a %B position of 0.5098. This neutral positioning suggests Litecoin has room to move toward either the upper band at $132.52 or lower band at $102.29, depending on market sentiment.\nLitecoin Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical Litecoin support levels emerge at $103.16 for immediate support, with stronger support established at $82.39. The immediate support level aligns closely with the Bollinger Bands lower band at $102.29, creating a confluence zone that should provide substantial buying interest if tested.\nOn the resistance side, LTC faces immediate resistance at $134.19, which represents both the strong resistance level and sits above the recent high of $124.90. A break above this level would likely target the 52-week high of $137.04, presenting a relatively tight range for upside momentum.\nThe current trading range of $121.80 to $116.55 from the past 24 hours establishes short-term boundaries. Based on Binance spot market data, the Average True Range (ATR) of $7.47 suggests typical daily volatility, indicating potential for significant moves within these established levels.\nThe LTC/USDT pair's pivot point at $118.68 sits close to the current price, suggesting a critical decision zone for near-term direction. Traders should monitor price action around this level for breakout signals.\nShould You Buy LTC Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor swing traders, the current LTC price presents a measured opportunity following the recent consolidation. The neutral LTC RSI provides room for upward movement, while the strong support at $103.16 offers a clear risk management level approximately 12% below current prices.\nConservative investors might consider dollar-cost averaging into positions, taking advantage of the pullback from recent highs while maintaining exposure to the longer-term halving narrative. The payment adoption trend provides fundamental backing for sustained demand.\nActive traders should focus on the $118.68 pivot level for directional cues. A break above $121.80 (recent high) with volume could signal continuation toward $134.19 resistance, offering a favorable risk-reward ratio of approximately 1:2.\nRisk management remains paramount given the bearish MACD histogram. Setting stop losses below $103.16 protects against significant downside while allowing participation in potential upside moves toward the Litecoin resistance levels.\nConclusion\nLitecoin's current consolidation phase following the 11% rally presents both opportunity and caution for traders. While the overall trend remains Very Strong Bullish and payment adoption provides fundamental support, the mixed technical signals suggest patience may be rewarded. The LTC price action over the next 24-48 hours around the $118.68 pivot level will likely determine whether the recent breakout continues or requires further consolidation. Traders should monitor the $121.80 resistance break for bullish continuation signals while respecting the $103.16 support level for risk management.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

Digital currency mining contributed $40.8 million, up 44.9% from the previous quarter, as the company mined 406 Bitcoin\n— a 34% increase quarter-over-quarter.

        "text": "Quick Take\n• LINK currently trading at $21.48 (-3.24% in 24h) • Chainlink breaks out of 3-year symmetrical triangle pattern with targets above $50 • Chainlink Reserve accumulates over 109,000 LINK tokens, signaling network confidence • Technical indicators show bullish momentum despite short-term pullback\nWhat's Driving Chainlink Price Today?\nDespite a 3.24% decline in the past 24 hours, LINK price remains in a strong position following several major developments. The most recent catalyst came from the Chainlink Reserve's accumulation of 109,661.68 LINK tokens as of August 14, 2025, demonstrating the network's commitment to long-term sustainability and growth.\nEarlier this week, Chainlink experienced a significant surge past $21, driven by substantial whale accumulation activity. This institutional interest coincided with the official launch of the Chainlink Reserve mechanism, which has created additional buying pressure and reduced circulating supply.\nThe technical landscape has also shifted dramatically with Chainlink's breakout from a 3-year symmetrical triangle pattern. This long-term consolidation pattern typically signals major directional moves, with analysts projecting potential price targets exceeding $50 by 2026. The current pullback appears to be a natural retest of the breakout level rather than a reversal of the bullish trend.\nLINK Technical Analysis: Bullish Signals Dominate Despite Pullback\nThe Chainlink technical analysis reveals overwhelmingly bullish momentum across multiple timeframes. LINK's RSI sits at 59.43, positioning the token in neutral territory with room for further upside movement. This RSI level suggests that Chainlink isn't overbought despite recent gains, providing a healthy foundation for continued price appreciation.\nChainlink's MACD indicator shows strong bullish momentum with a reading of 1.5236 above the signal line at 1.2809. The MACD histogram at 0.2427 confirms this bullish momentum is accelerating rather than diminishing. This combination suggests that the current pullback may be temporary before the next leg higher.\nThe moving average structure strongly supports the bullish thesis. LINK price trades well above all major moving averages, with the 7-day SMA at $22.34, 20-day SMA at $19.27, 50-day SMA at $17.24, and 200-day SMA at $15.68. This ascending moving average stack indicates a healthy uptrend across all timeframes.\nChainlink's Bollinger Bands position at 0.7051 shows the token trading in the upper portion of the bands, indicating strong bullish pressure. The upper band at $24.65 represents the next immediate resistance level, while the middle band at $19.27 provides dynamic support.\nChainlink Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, Chainlink support levels are well-defined with immediate support at $15.43 and strong support at $12.73. The current LINK price of $21.48 sits comfortably above these levels, providing substantial downside protection for long positions.\nOn the upside, LINK resistance appears at $24.74, which coincides with the Bollinger Band upper boundary. A break above this level could trigger renewed buying interest and target the 52-week high of $29.26. The 24-hour high of $22.63 serves as immediate resistance, with the pivot point at $21.82 acting as a key decision level.\nThe LINK/USDT pair's daily ATR of $1.52 indicates moderate volatility, suggesting that breakouts above or below key levels could result in sustained moves. Traders should monitor the $21.82 pivot level closely, as a break below could signal a deeper retest of the $19.27 support zone.\nShould You Buy LINK Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor aggressive traders, the current LINK price offers an attractive entry point near the pivot level with a clear stop loss below $19.27. The risk-reward ratio favors bullish positions, with immediate upside targets at $24.74 and extended targets above $29.26. The 3-year triangle breakout provides strong technical conviction for this trade setup.\nConservative investors may prefer to wait for a pullback to the $19.27-$20.00 zone before establishing positions. This approach offers better risk management while still capturing the longer-term bullish trend. The Chainlink Reserve accumulation and whale activity provide fundamental support for patient accumulation strategies.\nSwing traders should focus on the LINK/USDT pair's bounce off the current support zone. With Chainlink's RSI at 59.43, there's sufficient room for momentum to build before reaching overbought conditions. The combination of fundamental catalysts and technical breakout patterns suggests that any weakness may be short-lived.\nRisk management remains crucial despite the bullish outlook. The $19.27 level serves as a critical support zone, with a break below potentially signaling a deeper correction toward $15.43. However, the overall trend remains very strong bullish according to technical indicators.\nConclusion\nChainlink price shows remarkable resilience despite the current 3.24% pullback, with strong institutional accumulation and technical momentum supporting higher prices. The combination of the Chainlink Reserve's token accumulation, whale activity, and the 3-year triangle breakout creates a compelling bullish case for LINK over the coming weeks. Traders should monitor the $21.82 pivot level for directional cues, while the longer-term outlook remains decidedly positive with targets above $50 by 2026.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Quick Take\n• DOT currently trading at $3.91 (-2.18% in 24h) • Polkadot's RSI sits neutral at 49.33 with bullish MACD momentum emerging • Gavin Wood returns as Parity Technologies CEO amid Polkadot 2.0 anticipation\nWhat's Driving Polkadot Price Today?\nThe DOT price continues to face downward pressure today, extending Wednesday's 7% decline that preceded the highly anticipated Polkadot 2.0 launch. This selling pressure persists despite significant positive developments within the ecosystem over the past 48 hours.\nGavin Wood's announcement of his return as CEO of Parity Technologies on August 14th represents a major leadership development for Polkadot's primary development firm. Wood, who founded Polkadot and previously served as Ethereum's co-founder, brings renewed confidence to the project's technical direction. However, the DOT price has yet to reflect this positive catalyst, suggesting traders remain cautious ahead of the network upgrade.\nSimultaneously, Polkadot's governance system has shown remarkable progress with two critical referendums advancing. Referendum 1700, proposing system parachain upgrades to runtime 1.6.x, is passing almost unanimously, while Referendum 1701's OpenGov parameter adjustments also enjoy unanimous support. These technical improvements typically strengthen network fundamentals, yet market sentiment remains subdued.\nThe contradiction between positive ecosystem developments and negative price action suggests traders are adopting a \"sell the news\" approach to Polkadot 2.0, similar to patterns observed with other major blockchain upgrades.\nDOT Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nPolkadot technical analysis reveals conflicting momentum indicators that reflect current market uncertainty. The DOT RSI at 49.33 positions the token in neutral territory, neither oversold nor overbought, indicating balanced buying and selling pressure.\nHowever, Polkadot's MACD presents a more optimistic picture with the main line at 0.0255 sitting above the signal line at 0.0150. The positive MACD histogram of 0.0106 suggests bullish momentum is building beneath the surface, despite recent price weakness.\nThe moving average structure tells a nuanced story for DOT/USDT traders. While Polkadot's price trades above both the 20-day SMA ($3.86) and 50-day SMA ($3.86), it remains well below the critical 200-day SMA at $4.21. This configuration suggests short-term resilience within a longer-term downtrend.\nPolkadot's Bollinger Bands position provides additional context, with DOT trading at a %B reading of 0.5631, indicating the price sits slightly above the middle band. This neutral positioning allows for movement in either direction based on upcoming catalysts.\nPolkadot Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, several critical Polkadot support levels emerge for DOT traders. The immediate support zone begins at $3.43, representing the first major line of defense for bulls. Should this level fail, Polkadot strong support at $3.24 becomes crucial, sitting just above the 52-week low of $3.15.\nOn the upside, DOT resistance appears at $4.37 as the immediate target for any recovery attempt. This level aligns closely with recent trading range highs and represents a logical profit-taking zone. Beyond this, Polkadot strong resistance at $4.67 would signal a more significant trend reversal if breached.\nThe current DOT price of $3.91 sits precariously close to the pivot point of $3.92, making the next few trading sessions critical for direction. The daily ATR of $0.25 suggests traders should expect continued volatility as Polkadot 2.0 developments unfold.\nShould You Buy DOT Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nConservative traders should wait for clearer technical confirmation before entering DOT positions. The neutral RSI and mixed moving average signals suggest patience may be rewarded with better entry opportunities near the $3.43 support level.\nAggressive traders might consider small position sizes near current levels, with tight stop losses below $3.24. The risk-reward profile improves significantly if DOT can reclaim the $4.00 psychological level and hold above the 7-day SMA of $4.02.\nSwing traders should monitor the Polkadot 2.0 launch timeline closely, as successful implementation could catalyze a move toward the $4.67 resistance zone. However, any delays or technical issues could push the DOT price toward the yearly lows near $3.15.\nThe recent 24-hour volume of $31.4 million on Binance indicates moderate interest but lacks the conviction seen during major trend reversals. This suggests waiting for volume confirmation before committing significant capital.\nConclusion\nThe DOT price faces a critical juncture at $3.91 as Polkadot 2.0 approaches, with technical indicators providing mixed signals despite positive ecosystem developments. Gavin Wood's return to Parity Technologies leadership offers long-term confidence, but short-term price action suggests cautious positioning until the $3.43 support holds decisively. Traders should monitor the next 24-48 hours for volume confirmation and potential catalyst-driven breakouts above the $4.37 resistance level.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Update: the CTO of TradingView told Cointelegraph in comments that the reports of a bug were inaccurate, and the Twitter user partially withdrew his earlier claims that the tool was broken.\nPopular chart analysis service TradingView reportedly contains a bug in the Fibonacci retracement technical analysis tool, according to a tweet by self-proclaimed certified Elliott wave analyst Cryptoteddybear published on June 13.\nThe Elliott wave principle is a type of technical analysis for predicting prices in financial markets by looking at recurring patterns.\nIn a video that he uploaded to YouTube, the analyst explains that the tool does linear calculations when in logarithmic charts, which he notes is a significant issue for Elliot wave traders. The official Twitter account of the company behind the charting service answered his tweet, announcing that the issue is being investigated, to which Cryptoteddybear answered:\n“Thank you @tradingview for finally taking this issue seriously.”\nThe first reports of the bug, posted over five years ago (in November 2014) on consumer community platform getsatisfaction, have been reportedly ignored by the company. Another report submitted on the same platform, dated June 3, 2017, has seen the official TradingView account answer in the thread:\n“Hi, you are right, we have a planned task to fix this. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.”\nHowever, the problem apparently has not yet been solved. Cryptoteddybear claims that a company representative told him that he asked the technicians to increase the priority given to solving the bug.\nAs Cointelegraph recently reported, TradingView is one of the platforms that added the “CIX100” index — an AI-powered index for the 100 strongest-performing cryptocurrencies and tokens.\nAt the beginning of the current month, cryptocurrency analytics company Coin Metrics announced that it has acquired digital asset index firm Bletchley Indexes and plans to launch crypto smart beta indexes.\nAs of press time, TradingView has not responded to a request for comment.",

        "text": "Quick Take\n• MATIC currently trading near $0.37 support level amid oversold conditions • Polygon's RSI at 38 signals potential oversold bounce opportunity • POL token migration scheduled for August 26 creating market uncertainty\nWhat's Driving Polygon Price Today?\nThe MATIC price has been consolidating near the $0.37 support level this week as cryptocurrency exchanges prepare for the upcoming POL token migration scheduled for August 26, 2025. This transition from MATIC to POL tokens has created a period of uncertainty that's keeping many traders on the sidelines.\nMajor exchanges have been announcing their preparation for the token swap, which has contributed to subdued trading activity in MATIC/USDT pairs. While the migration itself is technically neutral for token holders, the uncertainty surrounding the process has weighed on short-term sentiment and contributed to the current oversold conditions.\nThe market's focus on this upcoming migration has overshadowed other fundamental developments, creating a technical setup where MATIC price action is primarily driven by support and resistance levels rather than news catalysts.\nMATIC Technical Analysis: Oversold Signals Emerge\nPolygon technical analysis reveals compelling oversold conditions that could signal a potential reversal. MATIC's RSI has dropped to 38, well into oversold territory and suggesting the recent selling pressure may be exhausted.\nThe MACD indicator shows bearish momentum with a reading of -0.0246, but the histogram at -0.0045 indicates this bearish momentum may be weakening. Polygon's Stochastic oscillator confirms the oversold condition with %K at 25.19 and %D at 19.74.\nMATIC's position relative to its Bollinger Bands is particularly noteworthy, with a %B reading of -1.20 indicating the token is trading well below the lower band. This extreme positioning often precedes mean reversion moves back toward the middle band at $0.43.\nThe moving average structure shows MATIC price trading below all major timeframes, with the 7-day SMA at $0.37 providing immediate resistance, followed by the 20-day SMA at $0.43 and 50-day SMA at $0.45.\nPolygon Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, Polygon support levels are clearly defined with immediate support at $0.35 and strong support at $0.33. The current MATIC price near $0.37 sits in a critical zone between these levels.\nOn the upside, MATIC resistance appears at $0.58, which aligns with both immediate and strong resistance levels. This creates a relatively wide trading range, with the 52-week high at $1.27 representing longer-term upside potential.\nThe Average True Range (ATR) of $0.03 suggests moderate volatility, which could work in favor of range-bound traders looking to capitalize on bounces between support and resistance levels.\nShould You Buy MATIC Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor swing traders, the current oversold conditions present an interesting risk-reward setup. The proximity to the $0.35 support level provides a clear stop-loss reference point, while the potential move back to the 20-day SMA at $0.43 offers a reasonable upside target.\nConservative traders might wait for MATIC price to reclaim the $0.43 level before considering long positions, as this would signal a break above the 20-day moving average and potentially shift the short-term trend.\nThe upcoming POL token migration on August 26 adds an element of uncertainty that aggressive traders should consider. While technically neutral, such events can create unexpected volatility that may invalidate technical setups.\nRisk management is crucial given the overall weak bullish trend designation. Position sizing should account for the possibility of a break below $0.35 support, which could accelerate selling toward the $0.33 strong support level.\nConclusion\nMATIC price action over the next 24-48 hours will likely hinge on whether the $0.37 support level holds amid the oversold conditions. The combination of low RSI readings and extreme Bollinger Band positioning suggests potential for a technical bounce, though the POL migration uncertainty may limit upside momentum until after August 26. Traders should monitor the $0.35 support level closely, as a break below could signal further downside toward $0.33.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Quick Take\n• AVAX currently trading at $23.59 (-3.95% in 24h) • Avalanche's RSI at 51.64 signals neutral momentum after massive weekly gains • Institutional adoption surge conflicts with token unlock selling pressure\nWhat's Driving Avalanche Price Today?\nThe AVAX price experienced a dramatic pullback today despite this week's extraordinary market performance. Just two days ago, Avalanche posted a stunning 468.95% surge in 24 hours, reaching $24.42 as institutional adoption accelerated and network upgrades gained momentum.\nHowever, today's 3.95% decline reflects growing investor caution ahead of a significant token unlock event. The market is weighing short-term selling pressure against the strong institutional backing that drove this week's rally. Despite the pullback, AVAX price remains significantly elevated from pre-surge levels.\nThe most significant catalyst driving recent price action was Avalanche's expansion of stablecoin support through Visa integration on August 14th. This development enhanced real-world DeFi adoption and attracted substantial institutional interest. Additionally, BlackRock's BUIDL Fund ranking AVAX as the second-largest blockchain by assets under management signals growing institutional confidence in Avalanche's long-term prospects.\nYet the upcoming token unlock creates immediate headwinds for AVAX price action. Even with strong fundamentals, traders are positioning defensively as additional supply enters the market.\nAVAX Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nAvalanche technical analysis reveals conflicting momentum indicators following this week's volatile price action. AVAX's RSI currently sits at 51.64, indicating neutral territory after cooling from overbought conditions during the recent surge.\nThe AVAX MACD histogram shows -0.0158, suggesting bearish momentum is building despite the overall bullish trend. This divergence between recent gains and momentum indicators suggests consolidation or further pullback may be ahead for AVAX price.\nAvalanche's position within the Bollinger Bands provides additional insight. With a %B position of 0.5639, AVAX trades near the middle band at $23.28, indicating neither oversold nor overbought conditions. The wide band spread reflects the elevated volatility, with Avalanche's daily ATR reaching $1.58.\nMoving averages paint a bullish picture for longer-term AVAX price trends. The token trades above all major moving averages, with the SMA 200 at $21.69 providing strong underlying support. However, AVAX currently sits below the SMA 7 at $23.97, indicating short-term weakness.\nAvalanche Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical Avalanche support levels emerge at $20.57 for immediate support, with stronger backing at $16.94. These levels represent key areas where institutional buyers may step in, particularly given BlackRock's significant position in AVAX.\nOn the resistance side, AVAX faces immediate challenges at $27.38, which aligns with both technical resistance and psychological levels from recent trading. A break above this level could signal continuation of the institutional adoption rally.\nThe AVAX/USDT trading pair shows healthy volume at $88.8 million on Binance spot market data, indicating sustained interest despite today's pullback. This volume suggests the recent institutional flows remain active, providing potential support for AVAX price stability.\nShould You Buy AVAX Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor aggressive traders, the current AVAX price pullback presents a potential entry opportunity near the $23.59 level, with stops below $20.57 support. The institutional adoption narrative remains intact, and any resolution of token unlock concerns could drive renewed upside momentum.\nConservative investors should wait for clearer technical signals. A sustained break below $20.57 could signal deeper correction ahead, while a bounce from current levels with volume would strengthen the bullish case for AVAX price.\nBased on Binance spot market data, the risk-reward profile favors waiting for either a clear break of resistance at $27.38 or a test of the $20.57 support level. The token unlock overhang creates near-term uncertainty that may persist for several trading sessions.\nSwing traders might consider scaling into positions between current levels and the $20.57 support, taking advantage of the institutional adoption story while managing downside risk from the token unlock.\nConclusion\nAVAX price faces a critical juncture as institutional adoption gains clash with token unlock selling pressure. While Avalanche technical analysis shows mixed signals, the strong institutional backing from BlackRock and Visa integration provides fundamental support. Traders should monitor the $20.57 support level closely over the next 24-48 hours, as a hold above this level could signal the end of the current pullback and potential resumption of the institutional adoption rally.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

His announcement that certain staking activities don't classify cryptocurrencies as securities particularly benefits proof-of-stake networks like Cardano, though this positive news appears already priced into recent gains.\nLast week's momentum that saw Cardano climb to $0.80 and approach the $0.92 resistance level has now evolved into a test of higher resistance zones. The current ADA price of $0.91 sits just below the critical $0.92 level that has been closely watched by traders.\nADA Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals After Breakout\nCardano technical analysis reveals a complex picture following the recent triangle breakout. The ADA RSI reading of 64.87 sits in neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting room for movement in either direction. This RSI level indicates the recent selling pressure hasn't reached oversold conditions, leaving space for potential further declines.\nThe MACD histogram shows a positive 0.0155 reading, indicating bullish momentum for Cardano remains intact despite today's pullback. Cardano's MACD line at 0.0426 above the signal line at 0.0271 confirms the underlying trend structure remains supportive.\nCardano's position within the Bollinger Bands tells an important story. With a %B position of 0.8989, ADA trades near the upper band resistance at $0.94. This proximity to the upper band often signals potential for either a breakout continuation or a reversion toward the middle band at $0.80.\nThe moving average structure strongly favors bulls, with ADA price trading above all key averages. Cardano's current price sits well above the SMA 200 at $0.72, SMA 50 at $0.74, and shorter-term averages, confirming the very strong bullish trend classification.\nCardano Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, Cardano support levels show strong backing at $0.68 for immediate support, with stronger support at $0.54 aligning with the 52-week low. These levels represent significant buying zones should the current pullback extend.\nOn the upside, ADA resistance becomes critical at $1.02, which serves as both immediate and strong resistance. A break above this level could accelerate movement toward the previously mentioned $1.0136 Fibonacci target. The 52-week high at $1.19 represents the ultimate resistance for any extended rally.\nThe current pivot point at $0.93 sits just above today's trading range, making it a key level to watch for directional clues. Trading above this pivot suggests continued bullish pressure, while a break below could signal deeper retracement.\nShould You Buy ADA Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor aggressive traders, the current ADA price offers an interesting risk-reward setup. The recent triangle breakout validates the bullish thesis, but the pullback provides a potentially better entry than chasing Tuesday's breakout. Risk management should focus on the $0.68 support level, offering roughly 25% downside protection from current levels.\nConservative investors might wait for either a successful test of the $1.02 resistance or a deeper pullback to the $0.80 middle Bollinger Band. This approach reduces risk while maintaining upside exposure to Cardano's technical breakout story.\nSwing traders could consider the ADA/USDT pair attractive here, given the strong moving average support structure. The daily ATR of $0.06 suggests normal volatility conditions, neither extremely high nor low, providing reasonable trading conditions.\nPosition sizing becomes crucial given ADA's 24-hour trading range between $0.98 and $0.90. This $0.08 range represents significant intraday volatility that traders must factor into their risk calculations.\nConclusion\nCardano's current position at $0.91 represents a critical juncture following the multi-month triangle breakout. While today's -3.40% decline might concern some traders, the technical structure remains bullish with strong moving average support and positive MACD momentum. The next 24-48 hours will likely determine whether ADA can reclaim the $0.92-$0.94 resistance zone or if further consolidation toward $0.80 support becomes necessary. Traders should watch for volume confirmation on any move above $1.02 resistance, as this level represents the gateway to higher Fibonacci targets.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Quick Take\n• XRP currently trading at $3.12 (+0.51% in 24h) • XRP RSI at 51.71 shows neutral momentum with potential for upward movement • Ripple-SEC appeals dismissal ended litigation, boosting institutional confidence • Recent 1 billion XRP release ($3.28B) created short-term market uncertainty\nWhat's Driving Ripple Price Today?\nThe XRP price has stabilized around $3.12 following a week of significant regulatory developments and market volatility. The most impactful catalyst came from the dismissal of appeals between Ripple Labs and the SEC on August 13, which officially ended the prolonged litigation that had weighed on XRP for years.\nThis regulatory clarity triggered immediate institutional response, with XRP gaining 4% and daily trading volumes surging by 208%. The settlement resolution removed a major overhang that had prevented many institutional investors from entering XRP positions, leading to sustained buying pressure that pushed XRP price from $3.19 to $3.33 by August 14.\nHowever, profit-taking emerged quickly as institutional investors who had accumulated positions during the legal uncertainty began realizing gains. This selling pressure caused XRP to retreat 2% on August 12, demonstrating the typical buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news dynamic that often follows major regulatory announcements.\nAdding complexity to the current market environment, Ripple's unexpected release of 1 billion XRP tokens worth $3.28 billion on August 9 introduced fresh uncertainty. Unlike Ripple's typical monthly escrow unlocks, this accelerated release raised questions about the company's token management strategy and potential impact on XRP price dynamics.\nXRP Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nThe current Ripple technical analysis reveals a market in transition, with XRP RSI at 51.71 indicating neutral momentum that could break in either direction. This positioning suggests that XRP has neither reached overbought conditions that would trigger selling nor oversold levels that would attract buyers.\nXRP's MACD histogram shows a bearish divergence at -0.0197, indicating that bullish momentum may be weakening despite the recent regulatory victory. However, the main MACD line remains positive at 0.0529, suggesting the underlying trend hasn't fully reversed.\nThe moving average structure provides more encouraging signals for Ripple technical analysis. XRP price currently sits above key short-term averages, with the SMA 7 at $3.16 and SMA 20 at $3.10 providing nearby support. More significantly, XRP remains well above the SMA 200 at $2.46, confirming the long-term bullish trend remains intact.\nRipple's Bollinger Bands show XRP trading near the middle band at $3.10 with a %B position of 0.535, indicating the price has room to move in either direction without reaching extreme levels. The bands themselves range from $2.83 to $3.37, providing clear boundaries for short-term price action.\nRipple Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on current market structure, several critical Ripple support levels emerge for traders monitoring XRP/USDT positions. The immediate support sits at $2.73, which aligns with recent consolidation areas and would represent a logical pullback target if selling pressure intensifies.\nBelow this level, Ripple strong support emerges at $2.13, though reaching this zone would require a significant breakdown that would likely coincide with broader market weakness or additional negative news regarding token releases.\nOn the upside, XRP resistance appears at $3.38, which corresponds closely with the recent high of $3.37 reached during the post-settlement rally. This level has proven significant as it rejected the initial surge following the regulatory news.\nThe key Ripple resistance level sits at $3.66, representing the next major target if XRP can break above current consolidation. This level would mark a new 52-week high, as the current peak stands at $3.55, and would likely trigger additional momentum buying from trend-following strategies.\nShould You Buy XRP Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor swing traders, the current XRP price setup offers a favorable risk-reward profile. Entry near $3.12 provides proximity to the $2.73 support level, limiting downside risk to approximately 12.5%. Meanwhile, the upside target at $3.66 offers potential gains of 17%, creating a positive risk-reward ratio.\nDay traders should focus on the XRP/USDT daily range of $3.00 to $3.16, which provides clear boundaries for short-term strategies. The XRP RSI neutral reading suggests momentum could develop in either direction, making this environment suitable for breakout strategies rather than mean reversion approaches.\nLong-term investors may find current levels attractive given the regulatory clarity achieved through the Ripple-SEC settlement. However, they should consider the impact of accelerated token releases on long-term supply dynamics. Based on Binance spot market data, institutional buying has demonstrated resilience despite these concerns.\nConservative traders might wait for a pullback to the $2.73 support level before establishing positions, as this would provide better risk management and entry points closer to significant technical levels.\nConclusion\nXRP price action reflects the complex interplay between positive regulatory developments and ongoing concerns about token supply management. While the Ripple-SEC settlement removal has cleared a major fundamental obstacle, the recent accelerated XRP release demonstrates that supply-side factors remain important considerations for traders.\nThe technical picture suggests XRP is consolidating recent gains, with the neutral XRP RSI reading indicating potential for movement in either direction over the next 24-48 hours. Traders should monitor the $3.16 resistance and $3.00 support levels for breakout signals, while keeping the broader $2.73 to $3.38 range in focus for position management.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Quick Take\n• BTC currently trading at $117,460 (-1.31% in 24h) • Bitcoin's RSI at 51.21 signals neutral momentum after volatile week • Record high of $124,480 followed by 4% correction on inflation concerns\nWhat's Driving Bitcoin Price Today?\nThe BTC price experienced dramatic volatility this week, reaching a new all-time high of $124,480 on August 14th before surrendering gains following U.S. wholesale inflation data. The correction brought Bitcoin down approximately 4% to current levels around $118,000, highlighting the cryptocurrency's sensitivity to macroeconomic indicators.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent's statements on August 14th initially created uncertainty in the market. His clarification that the U.S. government isn't planning immediate Bitcoin purchases, followed by his comments about remaining \"open to acquiring more bitcoin through budget-neutral pathways,\" contributed to mixed sentiment. This regulatory ambiguity occurred precisely as the BTC price was testing new highs.\nThe Federal Reserve rate cut expectations that helped propel Bitcoin to record levels were temporarily overshadowed by inflation concerns. Despite the short-term pullback, institutional demand remains robust, with spot ETF inflows and the new executive order allowing crypto in 401(k) retirement plans providing underlying support for the BTC price trajectory.\nBTC Technical Analysis: Neutral Signals Emerge\nBitcoin technical analysis reveals a market in consolidation after the recent rally and subsequent correction. The BTC RSI currently sits at 51.21, positioning Bitcoin in neutral territory and suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This reading indicates potential for movement in either direction based on upcoming catalysts.\nThe MACD indicator shows bullish momentum with a positive histogram reading of 7.5330, suggesting underlying buying pressure despite the recent price decline. Bitcoin's position relative to its moving averages remains constructive, with the current price of $117,460 sitting above both the 20-day SMA at $116,948.73 and the 50-day SMA at $115,351.19.\nBitcoin's Bollinger Bands indicate the cryptocurrency is trading in the upper half of its recent range, with a %B position of 0.5518. The daily ATR of $2,919.81 reflects elevated volatility, typical during periods of significant price discovery near all-time highs.\nBitcoin Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, Bitcoin support levels are clearly defined following the recent correction. The immediate BTC resistance level sits at $124,474, representing the area where selling pressure emerged during the record high attempt. This level will be crucial for any renewed bullish momentum.\nOn the downside, Bitcoin support levels are established at $111,920 for immediate support, with stronger support at $105,100. The current trading range between $116,803.99 and $119,130.77 over the past 24 hours provides short-term reference points for traders.\nThe pivot point analysis suggests $117,798.39 as a key level, with the current BTC price trading slightly below this threshold. A sustained move above this pivot could signal renewed bullish momentum toward the recent highs.\nShould You Buy BTC Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor aggressive traders, the current BTC price presents a potential opportunity to buy near-term dips, with the understanding that Bitcoin resistance at $124,474 provides a clear target. The risk-reward ratio appears favorable for those willing to accept volatility, with stop-losses below $111,920 offering defined risk parameters.\nConservative investors might wait for clearer direction given the mixed signals. The neutral BTC RSI suggests the market could move either direction, making patience potentially rewarding. Dollar-cost averaging could be appropriate given the current consolidation phase.\nSwing traders should monitor the $117,798 pivot level closely. A break above with volume could signal continuation toward Bitcoin resistance levels, while failure to hold could target the $111,920 support zone. The elevated ATR suggests position sizing should account for increased volatility.\nConclusion\nThe BTC price action reflects typical behavior near major psychological levels, with the recent record high followed by a healthy correction. Bitcoin technical analysis suggests a market in neutral territory, awaiting the next catalyst. Traders should focus on the key levels between $111,920 support and $124,474 resistance over the next 24-48 hours, with macroeconomic data likely to drive the next significant move.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Quick Take\n• SOL currently trading at $186.98 (-3.58% in 24h) • Solana's RSI at 55.36 indicates neutral momentum with room for upward movement • SEC postponed Solana ETF decision until October 16, creating short-term uncertainty\nWhat's Driving Solana Price Today?\nThe recent 3.58% decline in SOL price reflects market reaction to regulatory uncertainty, specifically the SEC's decision on August 14 to delay approval of Solana ETF applications from Bitwise and 21Shares until October 16. This postponement has created immediate selling pressure, contributing to today's negative price action.\nHowever, beneath the surface turbulence, institutional interest remains robust. Solana futures ETF volumes reached an all-time high of $3.38 billion on August 13, demonstrating that professional traders continue to view SOL as a compelling investment despite regulatory delays. This record volume suggests the recent price weakness may represent a buying opportunity rather than fundamental deterioration.\nThe broader context shows Solana's ecosystem continuing to expand. The August 4 launch of the Seeker smartphone and the network's recent outperformance against traditional stock indices (6.7% vs 2.4%) highlight the platform's growing real-world adoption. Yet these positive developments are being overshadowed by short-term regulatory concerns affecting SOL price momentum.\nSOL Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nSolana technical analysis reveals a complex picture with both bullish and cautious elements. The most encouraging signal comes from SOL's MACD histogram reading of 1.2438, indicating bullish momentum is building beneath current price levels. This suggests the recent decline may be losing steam.\nSOL RSI currently sits at 55.36, positioning Solana in neutral territory with significant room for upward movement before reaching overbought conditions. This reading is particularly constructive as it indicates the recent selling hasn't pushed the asset into oversold territory, maintaining technical health.\nThe moving average structure tells a compelling story. SOL price currently trades above all major moving averages, including the 200-day SMA at $158.13, confirming the long-term bullish trend remains intact. The 7-day SMA at $187.99 provides immediate resistance, while the expanding gap between shorter and longer-term averages suggests sustained upward momentum.\nSolana's Bollinger Bands position at 0.7176 indicates the token is trading in the upper portion of its recent range, though not yet at extreme levels. The daily ATR of $11.20 shows elevated volatility, typical during periods of uncertainty but also creating opportunities for active traders.\nSolana Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical Solana support levels emerge at $155.83 for immediate support and $141.13 for strong support. The immediate support at $155.83 represents a key battleground - a break below this level could trigger accelerated selling toward the stronger support zone.\nOn the upside, SOL resistance concentrates at $209.86, representing both immediate and strong resistance levels. This confluence creates a significant technical barrier that, if broken, could propel SOL price toward its 52-week high of $261.97.\nThe current trading range between $183.30 and $196.19 over the past 24 hours shows SOL consolidating near current levels. The SOL/USDT pair's ability to hold above $185 will be crucial for maintaining short-term bullish structure.\nShould You Buy SOL Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nBased on Binance spot market data, different trading strategies suit various risk tolerances. Conservative investors might wait for a pullback to the $170-$175 zone, where the 20-day and 50-day moving averages could provide strong support.\nAggressive traders could consider current levels attractive, given the bullish MACD divergence and neutral RSI reading. However, position sizing should account for the regulatory overhang, with stop-losses placed below $155 to limit downside risk.\nThe risk-reward profile favors patient buyers. With strong support at $141 and resistance at $209, SOL offers approximately 1:1 risk-reward from current levels to immediate targets. However, a successful break above $209 could open the path to much higher levels, improving the long-term risk-reward equation significantly.\nSwing traders should monitor the SOL/USDT pair closely around the $188 pivot point. Sustained trading above this level with volume support could signal the start of the next leg higher, while failure to hold might trigger a test of lower support levels.\nConclusion\nSOL price faces a critical juncture as regulatory uncertainty weighs against strong fundamental developments and constructive technical indicators. While the SEC delay creates short-term headwinds, record institutional interest and robust ecosystem growth suggest the current weakness may prove temporary. Traders should watch for SOL's ability to hold above $185 in the coming 24-48 hours, with a break of $209 resistance potentially catalyzing the next major upward move. The neutral RSI and bullish MACD provide technical support for patient buyers, though position management remains crucial given ongoing regulatory uncertainties.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

This retreat follows yesterday's slip to $4,600 on August 15, representing healthy profit-taking after the cryptocurrency's remarkable surge past $4,300 earlier this week.\nThe most significant catalyst remains last Monday's record-breaking development: Ethereum ETFs attracted over $3 billion in inflows during August 2025, substantially outpacing Bitcoin ETF performance. This institutional validation has fundamentally shifted market dynamics, even as daily price action shows temporary weakness.\nStandard Chartered's bullish revision on August 13, raising their year-end ETH price target to $7,500, continues to underpin longer-term sentiment. The investment bank cited \"improved industry engagement and increased holdings\" as key drivers, validating the institutional thesis despite today's pullback.\nEarlier this month, whale accumulation data showed large holders adding $667 million worth of ETH, contributing to a 6.43% price surge. While today's decline may concern short-term traders, the underlying institutional demand remains robust, suggesting this pullback could present strategic entry opportunities.\nETH Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge During Healthy Correction\nEthereum technical analysis reveals a complex picture as the cryptocurrency navigates a pullback within a broader bullish structure. ETH RSI currently sits at 65.43, indicating the recent decline has brought the momentum indicator back from potentially overbought territory into a more sustainable neutral zone.\nThe moving average structure remains overwhelmingly bullish for Ethereum. ETH price trades well above all major moving averages, with the 7-day SMA at $4,459 providing immediate overhead resistance. More significantly, Ethereum maintains substantial premiums above longer-term averages: 10.5% above the 20-day SMA ($3,994), 28.1% above the 50-day SMA ($3,446), and an impressive 72.7% above the 200-day SMA ($2,557).\nEthereum's MACD indicator shows bullish momentum remains intact despite today's decline. The MACD line at 303.63 stays well above the signal line at 271.30, with the histogram reading of 32.33 confirming continued upward pressure. This technical configuration suggests the current pullback represents consolidation rather than trend reversal.\nBollinger Bands analysis places ETH at a %B position of 0.76, indicating the cryptocurrency trades in the upper portion of its recent range but has pulled back from extreme levels. The daily ATR of $218.37 reflects elevated volatility, typical during significant trend moves.\nEthereum Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical Ethereum support levels emerge at $4,368, representing today's 24-hour low and immediate downside protection. A break below this level would target the pivot point at $4,485, though this seems unlikely given current technical structure.\nMore substantial ETH support exists at $3,354, aligning closely with longer-term moving averages and representing roughly 24% downside from current levels. This zone would likely attract significant institutional buying based on recent ETF flow data. The ultimate Ethereum support level sits at $2,373, corresponding to major structural lows.\nOn the upside, ETH resistance materializes immediately at $4,788, marking both the upper Bollinger Band and the strong resistance level identified in technical analysis. This represents the cryptocurrency's 52-week high area and will likely require substantial volume to overcome.\nA successful break above $4,788 would open the path toward analyst targets, including Thomas Lee's $15,000 projection and Standard Chartered's more conservative $7,500 year-end forecast. The ETH/USDT trading pair shows these levels align with key psychological resistance zones.\nShould You Buy ETH Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nBased on Binance spot market data, the current ETH price level offers compelling risk-reward characteristics for different trader profiles. Conservative investors might consider dollar-cost averaging into positions, given the strong institutional backing evidenced by record ETF inflows.\nFor swing traders, the current pullback presents potential entry opportunities near $4,400-$4,350, with stops below the $4,200 level. Target zones include the previous high near $4,672 for short-term trades, while longer-term holders can reference analyst targets between $7,500-$15,000.\nRisk management remains crucial given Ethereum's elevated volatility. The daily ATR of $218 suggests position sizing should account for potential 5-10% daily moves. Traders should avoid overleveraging, especially given the cryptocurrency's proximity to all-time highs.\nThe institutional narrative supports accumulation strategies, but timing remains important. Waiting for ETH RSI to cool further toward 50-55 levels might provide better entry points for larger positions, particularly if the broader market experiences additional volatility.\nConclusion\nETH price currently reflects healthy consolidation within a broader institutional-driven uptrend. While today's 4.89% decline may concern short-term traders, the underlying fundamentals including record ETF inflows and raised analyst targets support higher prices over the medium term. Key levels to monitor include support at $4,368 and resistance at $4,788, with Ethereum technical analysis suggesting any weakness toward $4,200-$4,300 could provide strategic accumulation opportunities for the next leg higher.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Quick Take\n• DOGE currently trading at $0.23 (-0.45% in 24h) • Dogecoin's RSI at 52.97 indicates neutral momentum despite recent volatility • Whale accumulation of over 2 billion DOGE conflicts with 9% price decline from inflation concerns\nWhat's Driving Dogecoin Price Today?\nThe DOGE price faced significant headwinds in recent trading sessions, with two major catalysts creating downward pressure. On August 15, higher-than-expected Producer Price Index (PPI) inflation data for July triggered an 8.4% decline in Dogecoin, as broader cryptocurrency markets reacted negatively to the macroeconomic data. This inflation reading raised concerns about potential Federal Reserve policy tightening, which historically impacts risk assets like cryptocurrencies.\nSimultaneously, despite the negative price action, large holders accumulated over 2 billion DOGE tokens, creating an intriguing contradiction in market sentiment. This whale accumulation pattern suggests that institutional investors view the current DOGE price levels as attractive entry points, even as retail sentiment appears bearish.\nEarlier in the week, Dogecoin demonstrated resilience with a 5.40% rally on August 13, reaching $0.2393 as it tested key resistance levels around $0.23. However, this bullish momentum was quickly overshadowed by the macroeconomic concerns that dominated market sentiment by week's end.\nDOGE Technical Analysis: Neutral Signals Emerge Amid Consolidation\nThe Dogecoin technical analysis reveals a complex picture of competing forces in the current market structure. Dogecoin's Daily RSI sits at 52.97, placing the DOGE RSI firmly in neutral territory, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions despite recent volatility.\nThe MACD indicator shows subtle bullish momentum for Dogecoin, with the MACD line at 0.0048 above the signal line at 0.0045, creating a positive histogram of 0.0003. This divergence suggests underlying buying pressure may be building beneath the surface price action.\nDogecoin's moving average structure tells a constructive story, with the current price of $0.23 sitting above all major moving averages. The SMA 200 at $0.20 provides strong long-term support, while the shorter-term averages (SMA 7 at $0.23, SMA 20 at $0.22) indicate the recent consolidation phase.\nThe Bollinger Bands analysis shows DOGE trading at a %B position of 0.6567, indicating the price sits in the upper portion of the bands but hasn't reached overbought extremes. The upper band at $0.25 represents immediate resistance, while the lower band at $0.19 provides downside protection.\nDogecoin Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, several critical Dogecoin support levels emerge for traders to monitor. The immediate DOGE resistance sits at $0.26, representing a 13% move from current levels. Breaking above this level could trigger momentum toward the stronger resistance zone at $0.29, which aligns with previous reaction highs.\nOn the downside, Dogecoin support levels provide clear risk management zones. The immediate support at $0.19 represents an 17% decline from current levels and aligns closely with the Bollinger Bands lower boundary. Should this level fail, the stronger support at $0.16 becomes critical for maintaining the broader bullish structure.\nThe current trading range between $0.22 and $0.24 has contained most recent price action, with the pivot point at $0.23 serving as the key battleground between bulls and bears. The DOGE/USDT pair has respected these levels consistently, making them reliable reference points for position sizing and risk management.\nShould You Buy DOGE Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor short-term traders, the current DOGE price setup offers defined risk-reward parameters. Aggressive traders might consider entries near the $0.22-$0.23 support zone with stops below $0.19, targeting the $0.26 resistance level. This setup provides approximately a 1:2 risk-reward ratio.\nConservative investors may prefer waiting for a clearer directional break either above $0.26 resistance or below $0.19 support before committing capital. The neutral RSI reading and mixed fundamental catalysts suggest patience may be rewarded with better entry opportunities.\nSwing traders should note that despite the recent 9% decline, the whale accumulation pattern indicates smart money positioning for potential upside. However, macroeconomic headwinds from inflation concerns could continue pressuring the broader cryptocurrency market in the near term.\nThe daily ATR of $0.02 suggests moderate volatility, allowing for position sizing that accounts for typical daily ranges around 8-9% from current levels.\nConclusion\nDogecoin faces a critical juncture as conflicting signals create uncertainty in the near-term outlook. While the DOGE price has declined nearly 10% from recent highs due to inflation concerns, the massive whale accumulation suggests institutional confidence in lower price levels. Traders should monitor the $0.22-$0.24 range closely, as a break in either direction could signal the next significant move. The neutral technical backdrop supports a wait-and-see approach until clearer directional momentum emerges in the next 24-48 hours.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "LDO Price Prediction: Technical Setup Points to $1.63 Breakout Attempt\nLido DAO (LDO) is currently trading at $1.39, showing signs of consolidation after recent volatility. With multiple technical indicators aligning and analyst predictions varying significantly, this LDO price prediction examines the key levels that could determine the token's direction over the coming weeks.\nLDO Price Prediction Summary\n• LDO short-term target (1 week): $1.50-$1.55 (+8-12%) • Lido DAO medium-term forecast (1 month): $1.63-$1.80 range (+17-29%) • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $1.63 (Upper Bollinger Band) • Critical support if bearish: $1.16 (SMA 20) and $0.85 (immediate support)\nRecent Lido DAO Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe analyst community shows mixed sentiment in their recent Lido DAO forecast. DigitalCoinPrice presents the most optimistic long-term view with an LDO price target of $2.34, representing a 68% upside from current levels. However, short-term predictions from CoinCodex ($1.02), PriceForecastBot ($1.03), and Changelly ($1.08) suggest potential downside risk of 20-26%.\nCoinLore's $1.17 target appears more realistic given the current technical setup, as it aligns closely with the 20-day SMA support level. The wide divergence between short-term bearish predictions ($1.02-$1.08) and long-term bullish forecasts ($2.34) reflects the current uncertainty in LDO's price direction.\nThis disparity in analyst views creates an opportunity for traders who can correctly identify which scenario will play out based on technical confirmation signals.\nLDO Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Breakout Attempt\nThe Lido DAO technical analysis reveals a compelling setup favoring upside potential. LDO's RSI at 64.15 sits in neutral territory with room to move higher before reaching overbought conditions. More importantly, the MACD histogram shows positive momentum at 0.0248, indicating bullish pressure is building.\nLDO's position within the Bollinger Bands at 0.74 suggests the token is approaching the upper band resistance at $1.63. Historically, when LDO reaches this technical level with positive momentum indicators, it often attempts a breakout move.\nThe moving average structure supports this bullish thesis. While LDO trades above the 20-day SMA ($1.16), 50-day SMA ($1.01), and 200-day SMA ($1.04), it remains below the 7-day SMA ($1.45), indicating short-term consolidation before a potential move higher.\nVolume analysis shows $38.2 million in 24-hour trading on Binance, which is sufficient to support a meaningful price movement. A volume spike above $50 million would provide additional confirmation for any breakout attempt above $1.63.\nLido DAO Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for LDO\nIn the bullish scenario, LDO needs to break and hold above the $1.63 resistance level. This LDO price target represents the upper Bollinger Band and a key technical hurdle. Once cleared, the next resistance zone sits at $1.80-$1.85, based on Fibonacci retracement levels from the recent high.\nThe ultimate bullish target aligns with DigitalCoinPrice's $2.34 forecast, which coincides with LDO's 52-week high of $2.38. For this scenario to materialize, LDO would need sustained buying pressure and broader market support for DeFi tokens.\nKey technical requirements for the bullish case include RSI moving above 70, MACD line crossing above 0.15, and daily volume exceeding $60 million on breakout attempts.\nBearish Risk for Lido DAO\nThe bearish scenario becomes active if LDO breaks below the 20-day SMA at $1.16. This level has provided strong support in recent weeks, and a decisive break would target the immediate support zone at $0.85.\nThe most concerning bearish outcome would see LDO testing the lower Bollinger Band at $0.69, aligning with several analyst predictions in the $1.02-$1.08 range. Such a move would represent a 38-50% decline from current levels.\nRisk factors include broader crypto market weakness, reduced staking demand for Ethereum, or specific challenges to Lido's market share in the liquid staking sector.\nShould You Buy LDO Now? Entry Strategy\nFor those considering whether to buy or sell LDO, the current technical setup favors a strategic accumulation approach. The optimal entry zone sits between $1.35-$1.40, near current price levels, with a stop-loss below $1.16 to limit downside risk.\nMore aggressive traders might wait for a pullback to the $1.25-$1.30 range before establishing positions. Conservative investors should wait for a confirmed break above $1.63 with volume before adding exposure.\nPosition sizing should account for the 15-20% stop-loss distance, suggesting risk management of no more than 2-3% of portfolio value for this trade setup. The risk-reward ratio favors upside given the proximity to key resistance levels.\nLDO Price Prediction Conclusion\nThis LDO price prediction anticipates a move toward $1.63 resistance within the next 2-3 weeks, with medium confidence based on current technical indicators. The positive MACD histogram and neutral RSI provide the foundation for this bullish bias.\nKey indicators to watch include volume expansion above $50 million daily, RSI breaking above 65, and most importantly, LDO's ability to hold above the $1.16 support level. A break below this level would invalidate the bullish thesis and target lower support zones.\nThe timeline for this Lido DAO forecast extends through early September 2025, with the $1.63 breakout attempt expected by month-end. Traders should monitor Ethereum staking trends and broader DeFi sector performance as additional confirmation signals for LDO's price direction.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Quick Take\n• BNB currently trading at $831.67 (-1.55% in 24h) • Binance Coin's RSI at 63.64 indicates neutral zone with bullish potential • Strong technical foundation with price above all major moving averages\nWhat's Driving Binance Coin Price Today?\nThe BNB price experienced a modest pullback of 1.55% over the past 24 hours, trading within a range of $812.57 to $847.56. Despite the lack of significant news catalysts in recent days, Binance Coin continues to demonstrate resilient price action, maintaining levels well above key technical support zones.\nThe current consolidation appears to be a healthy retracement following BNB's strong performance earlier in the year. With trading volume reaching $181.9 million on Binance spot markets, institutional and retail interest remains robust, suggesting the recent price dip may represent a buying opportunity rather than a trend reversal.\nBNB Technical Analysis: Bullish Signals Emerge\nThe Binance Coin technical analysis reveals a predominantly bullish setup across multiple timeframes. BNB's RSI reading of 63.64 positions the asset in neutral territory, providing room for upward movement without entering overbought conditions. This RSI level historically has preceded significant price advances for Binance Coin.\nBinance Coin's MACD indicator shows particularly encouraging signals, with the main line at 24.74 sitting above the signal line at 22.63. The positive MACD histogram of 2.11 confirms bullish momentum is building beneath the surface, despite today's minor price decline.\nThe moving average structure strongly favors bulls, with BNB price trading above all key averages. Binance Coin sits $4.14 above its 7-day SMA at $827.53, $35.79 above the 20-day SMA at $795.88, and a substantial $89.35 above the 50-day SMA at $742.32. Most notably, the BNB price maintains a commanding $177.44 premium over the 200-day SMA at $654.23.\nBinance Coin Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on current technical analysis, Binance Coin support levels are well-defined with immediate support at $730.01 and stronger support at $643.71. The BNB resistance levels present clear targets, with immediate resistance at $869.40 representing a key breakout level that could trigger the next leg higher.\nThe Bollinger Bands analysis shows BNB trading at a %B position of 0.7844, indicating the price sits in the upper portion of the band but hasn't reached extreme overbought levels. With the upper band at $858.81 and lower band at $732.95, Binance Coin has approximately $27 of upside to test the upper boundary.\nThe pivot point analysis places BNB just $1 above the daily pivot at $830.60, suggesting balanced buying and selling pressure. A decisive move above $869.40 could open the path toward testing Binance Coin's 52-week high of $848.01.\nShould You Buy BNB Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor aggressive traders, the current BNB price setup offers an attractive risk-reward proposition. With support at $730.01 providing approximately $101 of downside protection and resistance at $869.40 offering $37 of immediate upside, the risk-reward ratio favors buyers who can tolerate moderate volatility.\nConservative investors might consider dollar-cost averaging into positions, using the strong support at $643.71 as a stop-loss level. This approach provides nearly $188 of cushion while maintaining exposure to Binance Coin's long-term growth potential.\nBased on Binance spot market data, the BNB/USDT pair shows healthy volume distribution, with no significant selling pressure evident in recent sessions. Day traders should monitor the $830.60 pivot level closely, as sustained trading above this level could signal the resumption of the broader uptrend.\nThe Average True Range of $30.57 suggests normal volatility conditions, allowing for strategic entry and exit planning without excessive price whipsaws.\nConclusion\nThe BNB price demonstrates remarkable technical strength despite today's minor pullback, with multiple indicators supporting a bullish outlook for the next 24-48 hours. Binance Coin's position above all major moving averages, combined with constructive RSI and MACD readings, suggests the current weakness may be temporary.\nTraders should watch for a potential bounce from the $830 pivot level, with a break above $869.40 likely to trigger momentum buying toward the $880-$900 zone. The overall \"Very Strong Bullish\" trend classification remains intact, making any significant dips potential accumulation opportunities for patient investors.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "With AAVE trading at $296.45 after a recent 4.96% pullback, multiple technical indicators are converging to suggest a significant price movement is imminent. Our comprehensive AAVE price prediction analysis reveals compelling bullish signals that could drive the token toward $343 within the next two weeks.\nAAVE Price Prediction Summary\n• AAVE short-term target (1-2 weeks): $343.77 (+16% from current levels) • Aave medium-term forecast (1-3 months): $320-$550 range with high probability of $400+ breakout • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $313.96 (recent 24h high) • Critical support if bearish: $245.00 (major support confluence)\nRecent Aave Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe latest analyst forecasts present a remarkably bullish consensus for AAVE, with price targets ranging from $272 to $550. CoinCodex leads with the most aggressive AAVE price prediction of $550.05 over a three-month horizon, representing an 85% upside from current levels. This medium-term Aave forecast aligns with technical breakout patterns we're observing.\nCryptopolitan's more conservative $320.52 target for August month-end appears increasingly achievable given AAVE's position above key moving averages. However, DigitalCoinPrice's bearish $272.94 prediction seems outdated, as AAVE has already demonstrated strong support above the $293 level during recent volatility.\nThe analyst consensus strongly favors upward momentum, with four out of five recent predictions targeting significant gains. WalletInvestor's $326.29 short-term AAVE price target provides a realistic intermediate milestone before the larger breakout toward $343-$350.\nAAVE Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Explosive Breakout\nOur Aave technical analysis reveals a textbook setup for a bullish continuation pattern. AAVE's current price of $296.45 sits strategically above the 20-day SMA ($285.25) and 50-day SMA ($292.22), indicating strong underlying momentum despite the recent pullback.\nThe MACD histogram reading of 2.8357 provides compelling evidence of bullish momentum building beneath the surface. With the MACD line at 5.6488 significantly above the signal line at 2.8131, we're seeing the early stages of a momentum acceleration that typically precedes major price moves.\nAAVE's Bollinger Bands position at 0.62 indicates the token is trading in the upper portion of its recent range, but still has room to reach the upper band at $331.95 before encountering technical resistance. The 24-hour trading volume of $41.8 million on Binance demonstrates healthy institutional interest supporting any upward movement.\nThe RSI at 51.03 sits perfectly in neutral territory, providing ample room for upward momentum without entering overbought conditions. This neutral RSI reading is particularly bullish given AAVE's strong positioning above key moving averages.\nAave Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for AAVE\nOur primary AAVE price target of $343.77 represents the convergence of multiple technical resistance levels and aligns with recent analyst predictions. This target becomes achievable once AAVE breaks above the immediate resistance at $313.96, which marked yesterday's 24-hour high.\nThe path to $343 involves clearing the upper Bollinger Band at $331.95, where we expect temporary consolidation before the final push higher. If momentum continues, the 52-week high at $383.53 becomes the next logical AAVE price target, representing a potential 29% gain from our initial $343 target.\nFor the medium-term Aave forecast, CoinCodex's $550 target gains credibility if AAVE successfully breaks above $383. This would represent a complete trend reversal and establish AAVE in a new bullish cycle.\nBearish Risk for Aave\nThe primary risk to our bullish AAVE price prediction lies in a breakdown below the critical $285.25 support level (20-day SMA). Such a move could trigger algorithmic selling and push AAVE toward the $245 major support zone.\nA bearish scenario would likely unfold if broader cryptocurrency markets face systematic selling pressure or if DeFi-specific concerns emerge. In this case, our downside AAVE price target sits at $245, representing the confluence of long-term support and the lower Bollinger Band region.\nHowever, given AAVE's strong position above multiple moving averages and positive momentum indicators, we assign only a 25% probability to the bearish scenario materializing in the near term.\nShould You Buy AAVE Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on our comprehensive analysis, the current $296 level presents an attractive entry point for those seeking exposure to AAVE's anticipated rally. The optimal buy or sell AAVE decision favors accumulation, particularly on any dips toward the $290-$293 support zone.\nFor aggressive traders, immediate entry at current levels makes sense with a stop-loss at $280 (below the 20-day SMA). Conservative investors should wait for a pullback to $285-$290 before establishing positions, using the same $280 stop-loss level.\nPosition sizing should reflect the 16% upside potential to our $343 AAVE price target against the 5% downside risk to the stop-loss level, suggesting a favorable 3:1 risk-reward ratio.\nAAVE Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur AAVE price prediction strongly favors upward movement toward $343.77 within the next 1-2 weeks, with medium confidence based on converging technical indicators and analyst consensus. The bullish MACD histogram, supportive moving average structure, and neutral RSI provide the foundation for this forecast.\nKey indicators to monitor include daily closes above $313.96 for confirmation of the breakout, and any violation of $285.25 support which would invalidate the bullish thesis. The Aave forecast timeline extends through early September, when we expect the $343 target to be achieved barring significant market disruption.\nWith multiple analysts supporting similar price targets and technical indicators aligned bullishly, AAVE presents one of the more compelling risk-adjusted opportunities in the current DeFi landscape.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "PEPE Price Prediction Summary\n• PEPE short-term target (1 week): $0.000012 (+20% from current levels)\n• Pepe medium-term forecast (1 month): $0.000008 - $0.000017 range\n• Key level to break for bullish continuation: $0.000015\n• Critical support if bearish: $0.000008\nRecent Pepe Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe PEPE price prediction landscape for August 2025 reveals a fragmented analyst consensus, with forecasts spanning an exceptionally wide range. CoinLore presents the most conservative outlook with a PEPE price target of $0.0000111, while CoinCu offers the most aggressive bullish scenario reaching $0.00002544.\nWalletInvestor's AI-driven model produces the most bearish Pepe forecast at $0.00000117, suggesting potential downside risk of over 80% from current levels. This stark contrast with Switchere.com's $0.000012133 target highlights the extreme uncertainty surrounding PEPE's near-term trajectory.\nCryptopolitan's range-based approach ($0.000008 - $0.000017) appears most realistic given current market conditions, acknowledging both the upside potential from Bitcoin correlation and downside risks from meme coin volatility. The consensus average sits around $0.000011, suggesting modest upside potential despite current bearish momentum indicators.\nPEPE Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Consolidation\nCurrent Pepe technical analysis reveals a coin caught between conflicting signals. The RSI reading of 44.91 positions PEPE in neutral territory, neither oversold nor overbought, providing room for movement in either direction. However, the MACD histogram's bearish reading of -0.0000 suggests underlying momentum remains negative.\nThe Bollinger Bands positioning at 0.3817 indicates PEPE is trading in the lower portion of its recent range, typically a bullish divergence signal if volume confirms. With 24-hour volume maintaining robust levels at $109.2 million on Binance, institutional interest remains intact despite the -2.69% daily decline.\nStochastic indicators (%K at 32.97, %D at 36.20) support the oversold narrative, potentially setting up a short-term bounce scenario. The convergence of these momentum oscillators suggests PEPE may be approaching a technical inflection point within the next 3-5 trading sessions.\nPepe Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for PEPE\nThe optimistic PEPE price prediction scenario targets $0.000017, representing a potential 70% upside from current levels. This projection aligns with Cryptopolitan's upper range and assumes Bitcoin maintains its recent strength above $60,000.\nFor this bullish Pepe forecast to materialize, PEPE must first reclaim the $0.000012 resistance level, which coincides with the 20-day moving average. A decisive break above this threshold with volume confirmation could trigger algorithmic buying, propelling PEPE toward the $0.000015 intermediate target.\nThe ultimate PEPE price target of $0.000017 requires sustained retail interest and positive sentiment across the broader meme coin sector. Social media engagement metrics and whale accumulation patterns will be critical catalysts for achieving this upside scenario.\nBearish Risk for Pepe\nConversely, the bearish case anticipates PEPE testing the $0.000008 support level, validating WalletInvestor's pessimistic outlook. This scenario assumes continued Bitcoin weakness and broader risk-off sentiment affecting speculative assets.\nTechnical breakdown below the current $0.000010 support zone could accelerate selling pressure, particularly if automated stop-losses trigger cascading liquidations. The 50-day moving average serves as the next critical support level in this downside scenario.\nMaximum bearish exposure extends to $0.000006, though this extreme outcome requires significant market-wide deleveraging or adverse regulatory developments affecting meme coins specifically.\nShould You Buy PEPE Now? Entry Strategy\nThe current technical setup suggests a measured approach to buy or sell PEPE decisions. Conservative investors should await a confirmed break above $0.000012 before initiating long positions, with stop-losses placed below $0.000009.\nAggressive traders might consider accumulating PEPE at current levels ($0.000010-$0.000011) with a 20% position size, adding on any dip toward $0.000008. This dollar-cost averaging approach capitalizes on volatility while managing downside risk.\nRisk management remains paramount given meme coin volatility. Position sizing should not exceed 2-3% of total portfolio allocation, with profit-taking planned at $0.000015 and $0.000017 resistance levels.\nPEPE Price Prediction Conclusion\nThe PEPE price prediction for August 2025 suggests a consolidation phase between $0.000008-$0.000017, with initial bias toward the $0.000012 mid-range target. Technical indicators provide mixed signals, requiring patience for clearer directional confirmation.\nConfidence level for the base case scenario remains MEDIUM, matching analyst consensus. Key indicators to monitor include Bitcoin's price action above $58,000, PEPE's ability to reclaim the 20-day moving average, and sustained trading volume above $100 million daily.\nThe prediction timeline spans 2-4 weeks for initial targets, with the broader $0.000008-$0.000017 range expected to contain PEPE through September 2025 unless significant market catalysts emerge.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Algorand (ALGO) is positioning for a significant move as it consolidates around the $0.26 level, with multiple technical factors suggesting an imminent breakout. Our comprehensive ALGO price prediction analysis reveals compelling upside potential based on recent analyst forecasts and technical confirmation signals.\nALGO Price Prediction Summary\n• ALGO short-term target (1 week): $0.31 (+19.2%) • Algorand medium-term forecast (1 month): $0.35-$0.42 range (+35-62%) • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $0.29 (immediate resistance) • Critical support if bearish: $0.22 (immediate support level)\nRecent Algorand Price Predictions from Analysts\nRecent analyst predictions for ALGO show remarkable bullish consensus despite varying price targets. WalletInvestor's ALGO price prediction sets a conservative $0.350 target, while CryptoPredictions.com projects a more aggressive $0.423 level. The most optimistic Algorand forecast comes from CaptainAltcoin, targeting $0.6945 in the short term.\nThe consensus among these predictions ranges from $0.309 to $0.6945, representing potential gains of 19% to 167% from current levels. Notably, even the most conservative prediction suggests significant upside, with all analysts maintaining medium confidence levels in their ALGO price target projections.\nThis convergence of bullish sentiment across multiple platforms strengthens the case for an upward move, particularly as technical indicators begin aligning with these fundamental predictions.\nALGO Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Bullish Breakout\nCurrent Algorand technical analysis reveals a cryptocurrency positioned at a critical juncture. With ALGO trading at $0.26, the price sits exactly at the 7-day SMA and just above the 20-day SMA at $0.25, indicating short-term equilibrium.\nThe RSI reading of 50.03 places ALGO in neutral territory, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions—an ideal setup for a sustained move in either direction. However, the positioning within Bollinger Bands at 0.5194 indicates ALGO is trading in the upper half of its recent range, showing subtle bullish bias.\nMost significantly, ALGO maintains a strong bullish trend despite recent consolidation. The cryptocurrency trades well above its 200-day SMA at $0.22, confirming the underlying uptrend remains intact. Trading volume of $12.5 million on Binance provides adequate liquidity for sustained price movements.\nThe MACD histogram showing -0.0011 suggests temporary bearish momentum, but this often precedes trend reversals when price remains above key moving averages.\nAlgorand Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for ALGO\nThe primary ALGO price target focuses on the $0.35-$0.42 range, supported by multiple confluence factors. Breaking above immediate resistance at $0.29 would trigger the first leg of this Algorand forecast, likely targeting the $0.34 strong resistance level.\nA sustained break above $0.34 opens the path to analyst targets between $0.35-$0.42, representing the convergence zone of multiple prediction models. The bullish case gains strength from ALGO's position 48.52% below its 52-week high of $0.50, suggesting substantial room for recovery.\nKey bullish triggers include RSI breaking above 60, MACD histogram turning positive, and daily trading volume exceeding $20 million. These technical confirmations would support sustained movement toward the upper end of our ALGO price prediction range.\nBearish Risk for Algorand\nBearish scenarios emerge if ALGO fails to hold the $0.22 immediate support level. A break below this critical level could trigger selling toward the $0.17 strong support, representing a 35% decline from current levels.\nThe primary risk factor lies in the current MACD bearish momentum, which could intensify if broader crypto markets face headwinds. Additionally, failure to break above $0.29 resistance within the next week would invalidate the short-term bullish thesis.\nRisk management becomes crucial below $0.22, as this level represents the intersection of the 200-day SMA and immediate support, making it a make-or-break zone for the current uptrend.\nShould You Buy ALGO Now? Entry Strategy\nThe current technical setup presents a compelling buy or sell ALGO decision point. For aggressive traders, current levels around $0.26 offer attractive risk-reward ratios, with stop-losses positioned below $0.22 support.\nConservative investors might wait for a break above $0.29 resistance before establishing positions, targeting the $0.35-$0.42 range. This approach sacrifices some upside potential but provides better confirmation of trend continuation.\nPosition sizing should reflect the 35% downside risk to $0.17 support versus 62% upside potential to $0.42 targets. A 2-3% portfolio allocation appears appropriate given these risk parameters, with stops positioned at $0.21 to limit maximum loss to 19%.\nALGO Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur comprehensive ALGO price prediction anticipates a move to the $0.35-$0.42 range within 2-4 weeks, representing 35-62% upside potential. This Algorand forecast carries medium-high confidence based on analyst consensus and technical setup quality.\nKey indicators to monitor include RSI momentum above 60, MACD histogram turning positive, and sustained breaks above $0.29 resistance. Failure to hold $0.22 support would invalidate this prediction and suggest deeper correction toward $0.17.\nThe prediction timeline spans the next 2-4 weeks, with initial confirmation expected if ALGO breaks above $0.29 within the next 5-7 trading days. This timeframe aligns with the convergence of multiple technical indicators and analyst price targets, providing high probability for successful execution of this ALGO price target strategy.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "INJ Price Prediction: Technical Setup Points to $17+ Targets\nDespite a 6.34% decline in the past 24 hours, Injective (INJ) is displaying compelling technical signals that suggest the recent pullback may be presenting an attractive entry opportunity for traders eyeing higher targets.\nINJ Price Prediction Summary\n• INJ short-term target (1 week): $17.59 (+22.7% from current $14.34)\n• Injective medium-term forecast (1 month): $16.50-$18.20 range\n• Key level to break for bullish continuation: $15.78 (Upper Bollinger Band)\n• Critical support if bearish: $11.91 (immediate support level)\nRecent Injective Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe latest INJ price prediction data from DigitalCoinPrice shows a consistent upward trajectory in their forecasts, with targets rising from $16.82 on August 12th to $17.59 today. This progressive increase in Injective forecast targets suggests growing analyst confidence in the token's near-term prospects.\nThe consensus view points to a gradual but steady climb, with all recent predictions maintaining medium confidence levels. What's particularly noteworthy is the consistency of the bullish outlook despite broader market volatility, indicating strong underlying fundamentals supporting the INJ price target projections.\nINJ Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Bullish Breakout\nThe Injective technical analysis reveals several compelling signals supporting higher price targets. The MACD histogram reading of 0.0441 confirms bullish momentum is building, while the RSI at 52.47 sits in neutral territory, providing room for upward movement without entering overbought conditions.\nINJ's position at 0.61 within the Bollinger Bands indicates the price is trending toward the upper band at $15.78, which represents the first key resistance level to break. The fact that INJ is trading above all major moving averages except the 7-day SMA ($14.69) demonstrates the underlying bullish trend remains intact.\nVolume analysis shows healthy participation with $15.75 million in 24-hour trading volume on Binance, suggesting sufficient liquidity to support a move toward the predicted targets.\nInjective Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for INJ\nThe primary INJ price target of $17.59 aligns with technical resistance levels and represents a logical extension of the current uptrend. For this scenario to play out, INJ needs to reclaim the $15.78 upper Bollinger Band level and maintain momentum above the 7-day SMA at $14.69.\nA successful break above $16.55 (strong resistance) would likely trigger algorithmic buying and push INJ toward the $17.59-$18.20 zone. The 52-week high of $33.27 remains the ultimate bull target, though that would require a fundamental shift in market conditions.\nBearish Risk for Injective\nThe primary risk factor centers around the $11.91 immediate support level. A break below this zone could trigger stop-loss orders and push INJ toward the stronger support at $10.07. Given the current technical setup, this scenario appears less likely but would be confirmed by a break below the 20-day SMA at $13.92.\nShould You Buy INJ Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on the current Injective technical analysis, the optimal entry strategy involves staging purchases near current levels around $14.34, with additional buying on any dip toward $13.92 (20-day SMA support).\nEntry Points: - Primary entry: $14.20-$14.50 range - Secondary entry: $13.80-$14.00 (SMA 20 support) - Stop-loss: $11.80 (below immediate support) - Take-profit targets: $16.55 (first target), $17.59 (main target)\nThe question of whether to buy or sell INJ currently leans bullish given the technical setup, though position sizing should remain conservative given the medium confidence level in current predictions.\nINJ Price Prediction Conclusion\nThe INJ price prediction for the next week targets $17.59 with medium-to-high confidence based on current technical indicators. The Injective forecast suggests a 22.7% upside potential from current levels, supported by bullish MACD momentum and favorable positioning within the Bollinger Bands.\nKey indicators to watch for confirmation include a break above $15.78 (upper Bollinger Band) and sustained trading above the 7-day SMA at $14.69. Timeline for this prediction is 5-7 trading days, with the critical test likely coming at the $16.55 resistance level.\nRisk management remains crucial, with the $11.91 support level serving as the key invalidation point for this bullish INJ price prediction.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "FLOKI Price Prediction Summary\n• FLOKI short-term target (1 week): $0.000112 (+7.2% from current levels) • Floki medium-term forecast (1 month): $0.000159-$0.000179 range (+51-71% potential) • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $0.000112 resistance • Critical support if bearish: $0.000100 psychological level\nRecent Floki Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe latest FLOKI price prediction landscape reveals a notably bullish consensus among major forecasting platforms. CoinCodex leads with an ambitious short-term target of $0.000112, projecting a 17.22% increase based on AI models and technical indicators. This aligns closely with CoinLore's $0.000107 prediction, both platforms demonstrating medium confidence in their technical analysis.\nMedium-term Floki forecast models paint an even more optimistic picture. Changelly's analysis suggests FLOKI could reach $0.000179 as an average trading price for August 2025, representing a potential 71% gain from current levels. CryptoPredictions.com offers a more conservative but still bullish $0.000159 target, creating a realistic range for investors to consider.\nThe convergence of these predictions around the $0.000159-$0.000179 range suggests strong analytical consensus, though the mixed technical signals warrant careful consideration of entry timing.\nFLOKI Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Consolidation Breakout\nCurrent Floki technical analysis reveals a cryptocurrency at a critical juncture. The RSI reading of 45.17 places FLOKI firmly in neutral territory, suggesting neither oversold nor overbought conditions. This neutral stance often precedes significant price movements, making the next few trading sessions crucial for direction.\nThe MACD histogram showing -0.0000 with bearish momentum presents a short-term headwind for bulls. However, this minimal bearish reading suggests the selling pressure is not overwhelming, and a reversal could occur quickly with increased buying volume. The current 24-hour volume of $22.55 million on Binance indicates healthy liquidity for potential breakout moves.\nFLOKI's position at 0.26 within the Bollinger Bands indicates the price is trading in the lower portion of its recent range, typically a zone where bounce opportunities emerge. The distance of -59.27% from the 52-week high suggests significant recovery potential if market conditions improve.\nFloki Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for FLOKI\nThe primary FLOKI price target in a bullish scenario centers around the $0.000159-$0.000179 range supported by multiple analyst predictions. For this scenario to unfold, FLOKI needs to break above the immediate resistance at $0.000112, which would trigger algorithmic buying and potentially validate the CoinCodex prediction.\nA successful break above $0.000112 would likely target the $0.000159 level within 2-3 weeks, aligning with CryptoPredictions.com's forecast. The ultimate bullish target remains Changelly's $0.000179 prediction, achievable if broader meme coin sentiment improves and Bitcoin maintains stability above key support levels.\nVolume confirmation above 30 million daily would strengthen the bullish case significantly, as it would indicate institutional or whale accumulation supporting the upward movement.\nBearish Risk for Floki\nThe bearish scenario for Floki forecast models centers on a break below the critical $0.000100 psychological support level. This round number often acts as a magnet for stop-loss orders and could trigger a cascade of selling if breached convincingly.\nIn a bearish outcome, FLOKI could retest levels around $0.000085-$0.000090, representing a 15-20% decline from current prices. This scenario would likely unfold if Bitcoin faces significant selling pressure or if the broader meme coin sector experiences rotation into more utility-focused cryptocurrencies.\nThe current bearish MACD momentum, while minimal, could accelerate if selling volume increases, making the $0.000100 support level the line in the sand for bulls to defend.\nShould You Buy FLOKI Now? Entry Strategy\nCurrent market conditions suggest a cautious approach to the buy or sell FLOKI decision. The optimal entry strategy involves waiting for either a clear break above $0.000112 for momentum traders or accumulating near $0.000100 support for value-oriented investors.\nFor aggressive traders, a break above $0.000112 with volume confirmation presents an attractive entry point targeting $0.000159. Conservative investors should consider dollar-cost averaging between $0.000100-$0.000105, with stop-losses placed below $0.000095 to limit downside risk.\nPosition sizing should remain modest given the mixed technical signals, with no more than 2-3% of portfolio allocation recommended until clearer directional momentum emerges.\nFLOKI Price Prediction Conclusion\nThe FLOKI price prediction outlook for the remainder of August 2025 remains cautiously optimistic, with a medium confidence level in reaching the $0.000159 target within 2-4 weeks. The convergence of multiple analyst predictions around this level, combined with neutral RSI conditions, suggests a reasonable probability of success.\nKey indicators to monitor include a break above $0.000112 resistance for bullish confirmation or a breakdown below $0.000100 for bearish invalidation. The timeline for this Floki forecast to materialize spans the next 2-4 weeks, with the monthly close being particularly significant for longer-term momentum.\nInvestors should watch for volume expansion above 30 million daily and MACD histogram turning positive as confirmation signals for the predicted upward move toward $0.000159-$0.000179 range.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "The cryptocurrency market continues to scrutinize Toncoin (TON) as conflicting signals emerge from both technical analysis and expert forecasts. With the current price at $3.47, multiple analyst predictions suggest significant upside potential, though technical indicators present a more nuanced picture for this Telegram-integrated blockchain token.\nTON Price Prediction Summary\n• TON short-term target (1 week): $3.75-$4.20 (+8-21%) • Toncoin medium-term forecast (1 month): $6.20-$8.00 range • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $3.75 • Critical support if bearish: $3.14 (immediate) / $2.72 (strong)\nRecent Toncoin Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe latest TON price prediction landscape reveals a striking divergence among cryptocurrency analysts. GROK's AI-driven analytics firm presents the most optimistic short-term Toncoin forecast, targeting $8.00 based on Telegram ecosystem integration and Layer-2 scaling developments. This bullish outlook aligns with Skareatrip.com's medium-term projection of $6.20-$9.20, driven by anticipated institutional interest.\nHowever, contrarian views emerge from CoinCodex, whose analysts predict a bearish TON price target of $2.62 due to failure to break key resistance levels and potential negative Telegram-related news. This creates a fascinating dichotomy in the current Toncoin forecast environment, with predictions ranging from -24% to +130% from current levels.\nThe market consensus suggests that while long-term fundamentals favor Toncoin growth, immediate price action depends heavily on breaking the critical $3.75 resistance level that has capped recent rallies.\nTON Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Breakout or Breakdown\nCurrent Toncoin technical analysis reveals a cryptocurrency at a critical juncture. Trading at $3.47, TON sits comfortably above its key moving averages, with the SMA 7 ($3.44), SMA 20 ($3.41), and SMA 50 ($3.18) providing a supportive foundation. This alignment suggests the overall trend remains intact despite recent consolidation.\nThe RSI reading of 57.00 positions Toncoin in neutral territory, providing room for movement in either direction without entering overbought conditions. However, the MACD histogram at -0.0058 indicates bearish momentum divergence, suggesting that while price remains elevated, buying pressure has weakened.\nBollinger Bands analysis shows TON trading at 0.64 position between the bands, indicating moderate bullish positioning but approaching the upper resistance zone at $3.62. The daily ATR of $0.19 suggests manageable volatility, creating favorable conditions for strategic entries.\nVolume analysis from Binance spot trading shows $23.5 million in 24-hour turnover, which remains below average levels needed to confirm a significant breakout above the immediate resistance at $3.75.\nToncoin Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for TON\nThe primary bullish TON price target centers on the $6.20-$8.00 range, supported by multiple analyst forecasts and fundamental developments. For this Toncoin forecast to materialize, several technical conditions must align.\nFirst, TON must decisively break above the immediate resistance at $3.75, which would trigger momentum-based buying and potentially reach the next significant level at $4.20. A successful hold above this zone would open the path toward the $6.20 target, representing an 79% gain from current levels.\nThe most optimistic scenario toward $8.00 requires sustained institutional adoption of Telegram's integrated features and successful implementation of Layer-2 scaling solutions. This would represent a 130% increase and bring TON within striking distance of its previous high at $6.78.\nBearish Risk for Toncoin\nDownside risks in this TON price prediction center on the failure to maintain key support levels. The immediate support at $3.14 represents the first critical test for bears, coinciding with the lower Bollinger Band at $3.20.\nA breakdown below this zone would likely trigger algorithmic selling toward the strong support at $2.72, representing a 22% decline from current levels. This scenario aligns with CoinCodex's bearish forecast of $2.62, which could materialize if negative Telegram news emerges or broader cryptocurrency market conditions deteriorate.\nThe 52-week low at $2.52 represents the ultimate bearish target, though reaching this level would require a significant fundamental shift in Toncoin's ecosystem prospects.\nShould You Buy TON Now? Entry Strategy\nThe current technical setup suggests a measured approach to TON accumulation. The optimal entry strategy involves waiting for a clear breakout above $3.75 with confirmed volume before establishing long positions targeting the $6.20-$8.00 range.\nConservative investors should consider dollar-cost averaging between current levels and the immediate support at $3.14, with strict stop-losses below $2.90 to limit downside exposure. This approach provides a favorable risk-reward ratio given the multiple analyst targets in the $6+ range.\nFor aggressive traders, a breakout play above $3.75 with a stop-loss at $3.40 offers asymmetric upside toward the $4.20 intermediate target. Position sizing should remain conservative given the mixed technical signals and the -0.0058 MACD histogram reading.\nTON Price Prediction Conclusion\nThis comprehensive Toncoin technical analysis supports a cautiously bullish TON price prediction over the medium term, with targets of $6.20-$8.00 by September 2025. However, immediate price action requires careful monitoring of the $3.75 resistance level and MACD momentum indicators.\nThe confluence of multiple analyst forecasts in the $6+ range provides fundamental support for higher prices, but the bearish MACD momentum suggests patience in timing entries. Key indicators to watch include volume confirmation on any breakout attempts and RSI behavior approaching the 70 level.\nWhether to buy or sell TON ultimately depends on risk tolerance and time horizon, but the technical setup favors patient accumulation on weakness while respecting the critical support levels outlined in this analysis. The prediction timeline suggests resolution of this consolidation pattern within 2-4 weeks, making September 2025 a reasonable target for the bullish price objectives.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "CRV Price Prediction Summary\n• CRV short-term target (1 week): $0.85-$0.95 (-1% to +10%) • Curve medium-term forecast (1 month): $1.10-$1.37 range (+28% to +59%) • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $1.07 immediate resistance • Critical support if bearish: $0.85 immediate support, $0.49 strong support\nRecent Curve Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe latest CRV price prediction data reveals a notably divided analyst community. Changelly's aggressive Curve forecast of $1.37 represents the most bullish outlook, suggesting a potential 59% upside from current levels. This contrasts sharply with CoinCodex's conservative long-term prediction of $0.389, implying a significant downside risk.\nMEXC Exchange's $0.928 short-term CRV price target appears more realistic given current technical conditions, representing an 8% upside that aligns with near-term resistance levels. The Price Forecast Bot's $0.483 prediction sits uncomfortably close to Curve's strong support at $0.49, suggesting potential downside if key levels fail.\nThe wide prediction range from $0.389 to $1.37 reflects the current uncertainty in Curve's price action, with technical indicators showing mixed signals that support both bullish and bearish scenarios.\nCRV Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Volatile Consolidation\nCurrent Curve technical analysis reveals CRV trading at $0.86, positioned between critical support at $0.85 and the pivot point at $0.88. The 7% daily decline has pushed the token toward the lower Bollinger Band at $0.84, with the %B position of 0.115 indicating oversold conditions that could trigger a bounce.\nThe RSI reading of 45.28 sits in neutral territory, suggesting neither extreme buying nor selling pressure. However, the MACD histogram at -0.0184 indicates bearish momentum is still present, though weakening. The extremely low Stochastic %K at 5.40 points to oversold conditions that typically precede short-term reversals.\nCRV's position above the 50-day SMA ($0.82) and significantly above the 200-day SMA ($0.64) maintains the broader bullish structure. The 24-hour trading volume of $32.7 million on Binance suggests adequate liquidity for any directional moves, while the daily ATR of $0.09 indicates moderate volatility expectations.\nCurve Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for CRV\nThe primary CRV price target in a bullish scenario points to $1.07 immediate resistance, followed by the strong resistance at $1.16. Breaking above $1.07 would likely trigger momentum toward Changelly's $1.37 Curve forecast, representing the upper end of realistic medium-term expectations.\nTechnical support for this bullish CRV price prediction comes from the overall \"Very Strong Bullish\" trend classification and CRV's position well above long-term moving averages. A bounce from the current oversold Stochastic levels, combined with RSI recovery above 50, would confirm bullish momentum resumption.\nThe path to $1.37 requires sustained buying pressure and a break above the 52-week high of $1.20, which sits just below the ultimate bullish target.\nBearish Risk for Curve\nDownside risks center on the immediate support at $0.85, with a break below triggering potential decline toward the strong support at $0.49. This level aligns closely with the Price Forecast Bot's $0.483 prediction and represents a 43% downside risk from current levels.\nThe bearish Curve forecast scenario would be confirmed by RSI breaking below 40 and MACD histogram extending deeper into negative territory. Loss of the 50-day SMA at $0.82 would signal intermediate-term trend deterioration.\nCoinCodex's extreme bearish prediction of $0.389 would require a complete breakdown of technical structure and likely broader crypto market weakness.\nShould You Buy CRV Now? Entry Strategy\nThe current CRV price prediction suggests a tactical approach rather than aggressive accumulation. Conservative buyers should wait for a clear bounce from the $0.85 support level with RSI confirmation above 50 before entering positions.\nAggressive traders might consider dollar-cost averaging between $0.85-$0.88, with strict stop-losses below $0.82 (50-day SMA). Position sizing should remain modest given the mixed technical signals and wide analyst prediction range.\nThe optimal entry strategy involves watching for volume confirmation on any bounce attempt, as the current 24-hour volume suggests institutional interest remains present despite the recent decline.\nCRV Price Prediction Conclusion\nThe CRV price prediction for the coming weeks points to continued consolidation between $0.85-$0.95, with medium-term upside potential toward $1.10-$1.37 by September 2025. This forecast carries medium confidence given the conflicting technical indicators and divided analyst opinions.\nKey indicators to monitor include RSI recovery above 50 for bullish confirmation and any break below $0.85 support for bearish invalidation. The Curve forecast timeline expects resolution of current consolidation within 7-10 days, with the broader trend direction likely established by early September.\nThe question of whether to buy or sell CRV depends on risk tolerance, but the technical setup favors patient accumulation on weakness rather than aggressive buying at current levels.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Optimism (OP) presents a compelling technical setup as it trades at $0.73, sitting precisely at its 20-day moving average and Bollinger Band middle line. With the token down 72.81% from its 52-week high of $2.67, this OP price prediction analysis examines whether current levels offer an attractive entry point for potential gains toward key resistance levels.\nOP Price Prediction Summary\n• OP short-term target (1 week): $0.77-$0.80 (+5.5% to +9.6%) • Optimism medium-term forecast (1 month): $0.82-$0.88 range (+12% to +20%) • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $0.88 (strong resistance) • Critical support if bearish: $0.61 (Bollinger Band lower boundary)\nRecent Optimism Price Predictions from Analysts\nCurrent market analysis reveals a notable absence of fresh analyst predictions for OP over the past three days, suggesting the token may be flying under the radar despite its technical positioning. This lack of coverage often creates opportunities for contrarian investors, as institutional attention typically follows price momentum rather than preceding it. The silence from analysts could indicate either uncertainty about near-term direction or a pause in coverage as the market awaits clearer technical signals.\nThe absence of recent Optimism forecast updates from major firms contrasts with the relatively stable technical picture, potentially creating an information gap that savvy traders can exploit.\nOP Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Measured Recovery\nThe Optimism technical analysis reveals a token in consolidation mode with several encouraging signals. OP's current position at $0.73 aligns perfectly with both the SMA 20 and EMA 26, indicating price equilibrium between buyers and sellers. The RSI reading of 49.98 sits in neutral territory, providing room for upward movement without entering overbought conditions.\nThe MACD configuration shows a slight bearish divergence with the histogram at -0.0013, but this minor negative momentum appears to be stabilizing. More significantly, the Stochastic oscillator readings (%K at 39.46, %D at 43.90) suggest OP is emerging from oversold conditions, typically a precursor to price recovery.\nVolume analysis from Binance spot trading shows $31.7 million in 24-hour activity, indicating sustained interest despite the recent 4.09% daily decline. The Average True Range of $0.07 suggests moderate volatility, creating manageable risk parameters for position entries.\nOptimism Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for OP\nThe primary OP price target in a bullish scenario points to $0.88, representing the confluence of both immediate and strong resistance levels. This target offers approximately 20% upside from current levels and would require OP to break above its 7-day moving average at $0.77 first.\nFor this bullish case to materialize, OP needs to reclaim the $0.77 level with conviction, supported by increased volume. A successful break above this level would likely trigger momentum toward $0.82-$0.85 before testing the critical $0.88 resistance zone. The 50-day moving average at $0.68 provides a supportive foundation, while the overall bullish trend classification supports this upward trajectory.\nBearish Risk for Optimism\nThe bearish scenario for this OP price prediction centers on a breakdown below the current support confluence at $0.73. Should selling pressure intensify, the next significant support lies at $0.61, coinciding with the Bollinger Band lower boundary.\nA more severe correction could test the strong support at $0.52, which sits just above the 52-week low of $0.49. This downside scenario would likely be triggered by broader crypto market weakness or specific negative developments affecting Layer 2 scaling solutions.\nShould You Buy OP Now? Entry Strategy\nCurrent technical conditions suggest a cautious but potentially rewarding entry strategy for OP. The token's position at key moving average support, combined with neutral RSI readings, creates a favorable risk-reward setup.\nBuy or sell OP decision framework suggests accumulation in the $0.71-$0.73 range, with stop-loss protection below $0.68 (the 50-day moving average). This approach limits downside risk to approximately 7% while targeting 15-20% upside potential.\nPosition sizing should remain moderate given the mixed momentum signals. A staged entry approach, buying 50% of intended position at current levels and adding on any dip toward $0.71, provides optimal risk management.\nOP Price Prediction Conclusion\nThis Optimism forecast anticipates a measured recovery toward $0.88 over the next 4-6 weeks, with medium confidence based on current technical indicators. The neutral RSI and stabilizing MACD suggest the recent selling pressure may be exhausting itself.\nKey indicators to monitor for confirmation include a decisive break above $0.77 with increased volume, RSI movement above 55, and MACD histogram turning positive. Invalidation signals would include a break below $0.68 or RSI falling below 40.\nThe prediction timeline extends through mid-September 2025, allowing sufficient time for the technical setup to develop while maintaining specific measurable targets for evaluation.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

This creates an interesting divergence in the prediction landscape.\nBenzinga's analysis focuses on the critical $0.0000122 support level, warning that failure to hold this zone could trigger broader bearish sentiment. Meanwhile, Changelly's technical assessment highlights the concerning crossover pattern between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, traditionally viewed as a bearish signal in Shiba Inu technical analysis.\nSHIB Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Downside Break\nCurrent Shiba Inu technical analysis reveals several concerning patterns that support the bearish SHIB price prediction consensus. The RSI at 48.62 sits in neutral territory but shows declining momentum from recent highs. While the MACD histogram indicates slight bullish momentum, this appears to be weakening based on the broader technical picture.\nThe Bollinger Bands position at 0.5487 suggests SHIB is trading slightly above the middle band, but the lack of expansion indicates low volatility that often precedes significant directional moves. Given the analyst consensus and on-chain data showing reduced engagement, this setup favors downside resolution.\nVolume analysis from Binance shows $20.45 million in 24-hour trading, which represents moderate activity but lacks the conviction needed for sustained upward movement. The 24-hour decline of 0.54% aligns with the gradual weakening trend identified by multiple prediction sources.\nShiba Inu Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for SHIB\nFor bulls to regain control, SHIB must reclaim and hold above the $0.00001532 level identified by CoinCodex. This SHIB price target represents approximately 25% upside from current levels and would require:\n- RSI breaking above 55 with sustained momentum\n- Volume expansion above $30 million daily average\n- Successful test and hold of the $0.0000145 intermediate resistance\nA bullish Shiba Inu forecast would target the $0.000016-$0.000017 range within 4-6 weeks, representing the next significant resistance cluster.\nBearish Risk for Shiba Inu\nThe primary bearish scenario aligns with Google Gemini's aggressive SHIB price prediction of $0.00001. This target becomes increasingly likely if:\n- The critical $0.0000122 support fails decisively\n- RSI drops below 45 confirming momentum breakdown\n- On-chain metrics continue deteriorating\nA break below $0.00001 could trigger extended weakness toward $0.0000085, representing the next major support zone in our Shiba Inu technical analysis.\nShould You Buy SHIB Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on current SHIB price prediction models, immediate buying appears premature. The recommended approach involves:\nWait-and-See Strategy: Monitor the $0.0000122 critical support. A decisive break below this level with volume confirmation would validate the bearish Shiba Inu forecast and suggest waiting for the $0.00001 target area.\nRisk Management: Any speculative positions should include stop-losses below $0.0000115 to limit downside exposure. Position sizing should remain minimal given the bearish consensus.\nEntry Points: Aggressive buyers might consider small positions near $0.0000105-$0.00001 if the bearish scenario plays out, targeting the $0.000013-$0.000015 range for exits.\nSHIB Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur comprehensive analysis supports a bearish SHIB price prediction with medium-to-high confidence over the next 2-4 weeks. The convergence of analyst forecasts, deteriorating technical indicators, and weakening on-chain metrics creates a compelling case for the $0.00001 target.\nKey indicators to watch include the $0.0000122 support test, RSI behavior around the 45-50 zone, and any signs of volume expansion that might invalidate the bearish Shiba Inu forecast. Should this prediction prove correct, the timeline for reaching the $0.00001 SHIB price target extends through early September 2025.\nThe answer to \"buy or sell SHIB\" currently favors caution, with selling pressure likely to dominate until clearer technical improvements emerge or the bearish targets are reached and tested.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "ARB Price Prediction: Technical Setup Points to Potential 18% Rally\nArbitrum (ARB) is currently trading at $0.49 after a 6.27% decline in the past 24 hours, but technical indicators suggest this pullback may present a buying opportunity for traders eyeing the next price breakout. With mixed analyst predictions ranging from bearish $0.31 targets to bullish $1.22 forecasts, our Arbitrum technical analysis reveals key levels that will determine ARB's next major move.\nARB Price Prediction Summary\n• ARB short-term target (1 week): $0.58 (+18.4% from current levels) • Arbitrum medium-term forecast (1 month): $0.65-$0.85 range • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $0.58 (strong resistance) • Critical support if bearish: $0.36 (immediate support level)\nRecent Arbitrum Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe cryptocurrency prediction landscape for ARB shows significant divergence among analysts. PricePredictions.com maintains the most optimistic Arbitrum forecast with an ARB price target of $1.22 for medium-term prospects, representing a 149% upside from current levels. This prediction aligns with technical analysis suggesting potential for substantial gains if key resistance levels are broken.\nConversely, CoinCodex presents a more conservative outlook with their ARB price prediction of $0.311, indicating a 25.34% decline from current prices. Changelly's forecast sits in the middle ground at $0.35, suggesting modest downside risk. The consensus among these predictions indicates significant uncertainty, making technical analysis crucial for determining the most probable direction.\nARB Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Bullish Breakout\nThe current technical setup for Arbitrum reveals several encouraging signals despite recent price weakness. ARB's position at 0.75 within the Bollinger Bands suggests the token is approaching the upper band at $0.54, indicating potential for continued upward movement toward the key $0.58 resistance level.\nThe MACD histogram reading of 0.0073 confirms bullish momentum is building, while the RSI at 56.51 remains in neutral territory, providing room for additional upside without entering overbought conditions. This combination creates an ideal technical environment for a sustained rally.\nArbitrum's moving average structure further supports the bullish thesis, with the current price trading above all major moving averages including the SMA 200 at $0.39. The ascending order of moving averages (SMA 200 < SMA 50 < SMA 20 < current price) indicates a healthy uptrend structure that typically precedes significant price advances.\nArbitrum Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for ARB\nThe primary ARB price target in a bullish scenario centers on the $0.58 resistance level, which has served as both immediate and strong resistance according to our technical data. A decisive break above this level could trigger momentum buying, potentially pushing ARB toward the $1.22 medium-term target identified by analyst predictions.\nFor this bullish Arbitrum forecast to materialize, we need to see sustained trading volume above the current 24-hour average of $83.1 million, along with RSI maintaining levels between 60-70 to confirm momentum without reaching extreme overbought territory.\nBearish Risk for Arbitrum\nThe bearish scenario for our ARB price prediction would unfold if the token fails to hold above the $0.36 immediate support level. A break below this critical zone could trigger selling pressure toward the $0.30 strong support, aligning with the more pessimistic analyst forecasts around $0.31-$0.35.\nTraders should monitor the MACD for any bearish crossover and watch for RSI to fall below 45, which would indicate weakening momentum and potential for further downside.\nShould You Buy ARB Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on our Arbitrum technical analysis, the current price level of $0.49 presents a reasonable entry point for traders with a medium-term outlook. The ideal buy or sell ARB decision depends on risk tolerance and position sizing strategy.\nConservative traders should wait for a pullback to the $0.44-$0.46 range (near the SMA 20) before establishing positions, with a stop-loss placed below $0.36 to limit downside risk. Aggressive traders might consider entering at current levels with a tighter stop at $0.42.\nPosition sizing should account for the 57.78% distance from the 52-week high of $1.16, indicating significant upside potential if the broader market sentiment improves and technical breakouts confirm.\nARB Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur comprehensive analysis suggests a medium confidence ARB price prediction targeting $0.58 within the next 1-2 weeks, with potential extension to $0.65-$0.85 over the following month. The bullish MACD histogram, neutral RSI, and strong moving average structure support this optimistic Arbitrum forecast.\nKey indicators to monitor for confirmation include sustained trading above $0.49, MACD maintaining positive momentum, and volume expansion on any breakout attempts above $0.54. A failure to hold $0.36 support would invalidate this prediction and suggest alignment with the more bearish analyst targets around $0.31-$0.35.\nThe timeline for this prediction extends through September 2025, with initial confirmation or invalidation expected within the next 7-10 trading days based on ARB's reaction to the critical $0.58 resistance level.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Aptos (APT) is currently trading at $4.69, down 2.45% in the last 24 hours, as the cryptocurrency faces a critical juncture that will determine its near-term direction. Our comprehensive APT price prediction analysis reveals a mixed technical picture that suggests consolidation before the next major move.\nAPT Price Prediction Summary\n• APT short-term target (1 week): $4.40 (-6.2% from current levels) • Aptos medium-term forecast (1 month): $4.30-$4.60 trading range • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $5.00 (Bollinger Band upper resistance) • Critical support if bearish: $4.05 (immediate support and Bollinger Band lower bound)\nRecent Aptos Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe latest APT price prediction from leading cryptocurrency analysts shows a convergence toward modest bearish sentiment. Changelly's forecast targets $4.18, representing a 10.9% decline from current levels, while CoinLore's analysis points to $4.08, suggesting even deeper correction potential. However, DigitalCoinPrice offers a more optimistic Aptos forecast with a $4.58 target, indicating only a 2.3% downside.\nThis consensus among recent predictions reveals that analysts are positioning for a short-term correction, with the average APT price target sitting at approximately $4.28. The convergence of these forecasts around the $4.08-$4.58 range provides strong validation for our technical analysis, which identifies similar support and resistance zones.\nAPT Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Consolidation\nThe current Aptos technical analysis presents a neutral bias with underlying bullish momentum building. At an RSI of 50.65, APT sits squarely in neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold. However, the MACD histogram reading of 0.0410 suggests bullish momentum is developing beneath the surface, even as the price has declined 2.45% in the past 24 hours.\nAPT's position within the Bollinger Bands is particularly telling. With a %B reading of 0.6714, Aptos is trading in the upper portion of its recent range, closer to the upper band at $5.00 than the lower support at $4.05. This positioning often precedes either a breakout above resistance or a pullback toward the middle band at $4.53.\nThe moving average structure reveals conflicting signals that support our consolidation thesis. While APT trades below the 7-day SMA ($4.74) and significantly below the 200-day SMA ($5.22), it remains above the critical 20-day SMA at $4.53. This setup typically results in sideways price action as shorter-term and longer-term trends reconcile.\nVolume analysis from Binance shows $31.6 million in 24-hour trading, which represents moderate but not exceptional interest. For any decisive breakout from the current range, we would expect to see volume surge above $50 million.\nAptos Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for APT\nIn our optimistic APT price prediction scenario, a break above the $5.00 Bollinger Band resistance could target the immediate resistance level at $5.15. This would represent a 9.8% gain from current levels and would likely trigger algorithmic buying that could push APT toward the stronger resistance at $5.66.\nFor this bullish Aptos forecast to materialize, we need to see the RSI break above 60, confirming renewed buying interest, and the MACD line cross decisively above the signal line. Additionally, daily volume would need to sustain above $45 million to validate the breakout.\nThe key catalyst for upside could come from APT reclaiming its position above all major moving averages, particularly the 200-day SMA at $5.22. Such a move would shift the longer-term technical picture from neutral to bullish.\nBearish Risk for Aptos\nThe downside APT price target scenario becomes active if Aptos fails to hold the $4.53 middle Bollinger Band support. A decisive break below this level would likely trigger selling toward the lower band at $4.05, representing a 13.6% decline from current prices.\nMore concerning would be a break below the critical $4.05 support level, which has served as both immediate support and the 52-week low vicinity. Such a breakdown could open the door to a test of psychological support at $4.00, with further downside toward $3.75 possible.\nRisk factors supporting this bearish Aptos forecast include the significant distance from the 52-week high (currently 67.66% below) and the failure to sustain above key moving averages during recent rallies.\nShould You Buy APT Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on our Aptos technical analysis, the current risk-reward setup suggests waiting for better entry opportunities rather than buying at current levels. For those considering whether to buy or sell APT, we recommend a phased approach.\nConservative Entry Strategy: Wait for a pullback to the $4.30-$4.40 range, which would provide better risk-reward positioning with stop-loss placement below $4.05. This approach aligns with our medium-term APT price prediction and offers approximately 3-6% better entry than current levels.\nAggressive Entry Strategy: Current levels around $4.69 could work for traders willing to accept tighter stop-losses at $4.50, targeting the $5.00-$5.15 resistance zone. However, position sizing should be reduced given the elevated entry point.\nRisk Management: Regardless of entry strategy, stop-losses should be placed below $4.05 to protect against a breakdown of critical support. Position sizes should not exceed 2-3% of portfolio value given the current technical uncertainty.\nAPT Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur comprehensive APT price prediction points to a consolidation phase over the next two weeks, with Aptos likely to trade between $4.30 and $4.60. The confluence of analyst forecasts, technical indicators, and key support/resistance levels supports this range-bound outlook with medium confidence.\nThe critical indicators to monitor for confirmation include RSI movement above 60 for bullish continuation or below 45 for bearish acceleration. Additionally, volume expansion above $45 million daily would signal the end of consolidation and the beginning of the next directional move.\nTimeline-wise, we expect this consolidation to resolve within 10-14 trading days, with the monthly close likely determining whether APT breaks toward our bullish target of $5.15 or tests the bearish support at $4.05. The neutral RSI and building MACD momentum suggest patience will be rewarded with clearer directional signals in the coming weeks.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "NEAR Protocol has caught analysts' attention with multiple bullish predictions emerging over recent days. With the current price at $2.75, several technical indicators are aligning for a potential breakout, making this an opportune time to examine the NEAR price prediction landscape and assess whether the protocol is positioned for significant gains.\nNEAR Price Prediction Summary\n• NEAR short-term target (1 week): $3.19 (+16%) based on moving average convergence • NEAR Protocol medium-term forecast (1 month): $3.70-$4.78 range following analyst consensus • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $3.10 strong resistance • Critical support if bearish: $2.30 immediate support, $2.02 strong support\nRecent NEAR Protocol Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe NEAR Protocol forecast landscape has turned decidedly bullish, with four major prediction sources releasing optimistic targets within the past week. PricePredictions.com leads with the most aggressive NEAR price prediction of $9.72 for medium-term expectations, representing a 253% upside from current levels.\nCoinCu's analysis supports a more conservative but still substantial NEAR price target of $4.78, which aligns with longer-term bullish trend models. Meanwhile, CoinCodex's AI-driven NEAR Protocol technical analysis points to $3.70 as a near-term objective, with their algorithms detecting a 12.04% growth probability over five days.\nThe most conservative estimate comes from Changelly at $3.19, based on moving average crossovers and improving market sentiment. This creates a clear consensus range for the NEAR price prediction between $3.19-$4.78 in the coming weeks, with the potential for extended gains toward $9.72 if momentum accelerates.\nNEAR Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Bullish Breakout\nThe NEAR Protocol technical analysis reveals several encouraging signals supporting the bullish analyst predictions. The MACD histogram has turned positive at 0.0091, indicating fresh bullish momentum after a period of consolidation. This momentum shift coincides with the MACD line (0.0453) trading above its signal line (0.0362), confirming the trend reversal.\nNEAR's position within the Bollinger Bands at 0.6573 suggests the price is in the upper portion of its recent range but not yet overbought. With the upper band at $2.96, NEAR has immediate upside room before encountering technical resistance from this dynamic level.\nThe RSI reading of 52.52 maintains a neutral stance, providing ample room for further gains without entering overbought territory. Volume confirmation comes from the substantial $36.3 million in 24-hour trading activity on Binance, indicating healthy participation in the current price action.\nMoving averages are beginning to align bullishly, with the short-term EMA 12 ($2.73) positioned near current prices and the SMA 7 ($2.76) providing nearby support. The price trading above the critical SMA 200 at $2.69 suggests the longer-term trend remains constructive for NEAR Protocol.\nNEAR Protocol Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for NEAR\nThe primary bullish NEAR price prediction scenario targets the $3.70-$4.78 range based on multiple technical confluences. The immediate hurdle lies at $3.06 resistance, followed by the crucial $3.10 strong resistance level. Breaking above $3.10 would likely trigger momentum-based buying, potentially carrying NEAR toward the $3.70 CoinCodex target within 2-3 weeks.\nShould buying pressure intensify further, the $4.78 level represents the next major NEAR price target, supported by CoinCu's medium-term analysis. This would require sustained volume above 40 million daily and RSI climbing toward 70 without immediate reversal signals.\nThe most optimistic NEAR Protocol forecast envisions a move toward $9.72, though this would require a fundamental catalyst beyond pure technical momentum. Such a move would need to see NEAR reclaim 50% of its distance from the 52-week high at $7.82.\nBearish Risk for NEAR Protocol\nThe bearish scenario for the NEAR price prediction centers on a failure to hold above the $2.30 immediate support level. A break below this threshold would likely trigger stop-loss selling and could push NEAR toward the $2.02 strong support zone.\nMore concerning would be a breakdown below the SMA 200 at $2.69, which could invalidate the bullish technical setup and point toward a retest of the 52-week low near $1.90. The daily ATR of $0.20 suggests that such moves could happen rapidly in either direction.\nKey risk factors include broader cryptocurrency market weakness, declining trading volume below $30 million daily, and RSI falling below 45, which would indicate weakening momentum.\nShould You Buy NEAR Now? Entry Strategy\nThe current NEAR Protocol technical analysis suggests a strategic buying opportunity for those comfortable with medium-term positions. The optimal entry zone appears between $2.70-$2.80, allowing purchases near current levels while maintaining reasonable risk parameters.\nFor conservative investors, waiting for a pullback to the $2.65 SMA 20 level could provide a better risk-reward setup for the NEAR price prediction targets. This approach would offer approximately 4% downside protection while maintaining access to the upside potential toward $3.70-$4.78.\nRisk management should include stop-losses below $2.50 for swing traders, representing roughly 9% downside from current levels. Position sizing should account for NEAR's daily volatility of $0.20, suggesting 2-3% portfolio allocation maximum for most investors.\nThe buy or sell NEAR decision ultimately depends on individual risk tolerance, but the technical setup favors buyers over the next 2-4 weeks, provided the broader cryptocurrency market remains stable.\nNEAR Price Prediction Conclusion\nBased on the comprehensive NEAR Protocol technical analysis and recent analyst predictions, the probability favors upside movement toward the $3.70-$4.78 range over the next 30 days. The confluence of bullish MACD signals, constructive RSI positioning, and multiple analyst targets creates a medium-high confidence NEAR price prediction scenario.\nKey indicators to monitor for confirmation include volume sustaining above $35 million daily, RSI maintaining above 50, and most critically, a decisive break above the $3.10 resistance level. Failure to achieve these conditions within two weeks would reduce the probability of reaching the higher NEAR Protocol forecast targets.\nThe timeline for this NEAR price prediction extends through mid-September 2025, with initial targets potentially achieved by early September if momentum accelerates. Investors should remain alert to broader market conditions, as cryptocurrency sector weakness could delay or invalidate these projections regardless of NEAR's individual technical merit.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "LTC Price Prediction Summary\n• LTC short-term target (1 week): $125-$130 (+5.6% to +9.8%) • Litecoin medium-term forecast (1 month): $132-$145 range • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $134.19 • Critical support if bearish: $103.16\nRecent Litecoin Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe recent analyst predictions reveal a divided market sentiment on Litecoin's near-term direction. Changelly's optimistic LTC price prediction of $145.92 aligns closely with our technical analysis, suggesting a breakout above the current resistance cluster. Meanwhile, more conservative forecasts from WalletInvestor ($111.947) and CoinLore ($123.16) reflect the current bearish momentum indicated by the MACD histogram.\nCryptopolitan's medium-term target of $150 demonstrates confidence in Litecoin's structural bullish trend, while PricePredictions.com's ambitious $402.12 forecast appears overly optimistic given current technical constraints. The consensus hovers around the $123-$145 range, which correlates well with our identified resistance levels and the overall very strong bullish trend classification.\nLTC Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Breakout Continuation\nDespite the current bearish momentum reflected in the MACD histogram (-0.7444), Litecoin technical analysis reveals a constructive setup for the next leg higher. The RSI at 52.92 sits in neutral territory, providing room for upward movement without entering overbought conditions immediately.\nThe moving average structure remains decisively bullish, with LTC trading above the 20, 50, and 200-day SMAs. The recent pullback has brought price close to the 20-day SMA ($117.44), which has historically served as dynamic support during uptrends. The Bollinger Band position at 0.53 indicates LTC is holding within the middle-to-upper range, suggesting the recent decline may be mere consolidation rather than trend reversal.\nVolume analysis shows healthy participation with $72.6 million in 24-hour trading volume, sufficient to support a meaningful price move once direction is established. The Average True Range (ATR) of $7.41 suggests normal volatility levels, making our price targets achievable within the predicted timeframes.\nLitecoin Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for LTC\nThe primary bullish LTC price target focuses on the $134.19 resistance level, which coincides with both immediate and strong resistance. A break above this level opens the path toward the 52-week high at $137.04, followed by the analyst consensus targets around $145-$150.\nFor this Litecoin forecast to materialize, LTC needs to reclaim the $123.42 level (7-day SMA) and sustain above it. The Bollinger Band upper boundary at $132.55 represents an intermediate target, with a break above it signaling renewed bullish momentum. The very strong bullish trend classification supports this scenario, particularly if Bitcoin maintains its supportive price action.\nBearish Risk for Litecoin\nThe bearish scenario for our LTC price prediction hinges on a breakdown below the immediate support at $103.16. This level aligns closely with the Bollinger Band lower boundary ($102.32), making it a critical technical juncture. A sustained break below this support could trigger a deeper correction toward the strong support at $82.39.\nKey risk factors include deteriorating MACD momentum, potential Bitcoin weakness affecting the broader crypto market, and failure to reclaim the 20-day SMA support. The current position 13.63% below the 52-week high provides some downside buffer, but momentum traders should monitor these levels closely.\nShould You Buy LTC Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on current Litecoin technical analysis, the optimal buy or sell LTC decision depends on risk tolerance and timeframe. Conservative investors should wait for a clear break above $123.42 with volume confirmation before establishing positions. Aggressive traders might consider accumulating near the $116-$118 range, using the 20-day SMA as dynamic support.\nEntry points for the bullish LTC price target include $118-$120 for initial positions and $123-$125 for momentum breakout plays. Stop-loss levels should be placed below $103.16 for longer-term positions, or below $116 for shorter-term trades. Position sizing should account for the $7.41 ATR, allowing for normal price fluctuations without premature stop-outs.\nRisk management suggests limiting exposure to 2-3% of portfolio value given the mixed momentum signals. Dollar-cost averaging over several days may be preferable to lump-sum entries given the current consolidation phase.\nLTC Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur comprehensive Litecoin forecast points to a medium confidence prediction of $132-$145 within the next four weeks, representing 11-22% upside potential from current levels. The very strong bullish trend provides structural support, while the neutral RSI and proximity to moving average support create favorable risk-reward dynamics.\nKey indicators to watch for confirmation include MACD histogram turning positive, RSI breaking above 60, and sustained trading above the $123.42 level. For invalidation, monitor breaks below $103.16 or failure to reclaim the 20-day SMA within the next week.\nThe timeline for this LTC price prediction extends through mid-September 2025, with initial signals expected within 7-10 trading days. Success of this forecast depends heavily on broader market conditions and Bitcoin's ability to maintain its current supportive trend structure.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250816-price-prediction-xlm-stellar-targets-050-070-by-september",
        "text": "XLM Price Prediction Summary\n• XLM short-term target (1 week): $0.47 (+9.3%) • Stellar medium-term forecast (1 month): $0.50-$0.70 range • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $0.47 • Critical support if bearish: $0.36\nRecent Stellar Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe latest XLM price prediction data reveals a remarkably bullish consensus among cryptocurrency analysts. Over the past four days, every major prediction has been optimistic, with targets ranging from $0.4277 to $0.87. This Stellar forecast alignment suggests institutional confidence in XLM's potential.\nInvestingHaven presents the most aggressive XLM price target at $0.87 for the medium term, citing anticipated adoption of Stellar's blockchain for cross-border payments. Meanwhile, Finbold's $0.487 prediction and CoinLore's $0.4277 target provide more conservative short-term benchmarks. Traders Union occupies the middle ground with their $0.5743-$0.7019 range prediction.\nThe consensus indicates that analysts expect XLM to break above its current $0.43 level, with the lowest prediction still suggesting a 9.5% upside potential. This convergence of bullish sentiment rarely occurs without underlying technical justification.\nXLM Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Breakout\nCurrent Stellar technical analysis reveals a cryptocurrency positioned for potential upward momentum. Trading at $0.43, XLM sits comfortably above its 20-day SMA of $0.42 and significantly above longer-term moving averages, with the 50-day SMA at $0.38 and 200-day SMA at $0.31.\nThe RSI reading of 52.74 indicates neutral momentum, providing room for upward movement without being overbought. However, the MACD histogram showing -0.0024 suggests short-term bearish momentum that could create a buying opportunity if price dips toward support levels.\nStellar's position within the Bollinger Bands at 0.5804 indicates the price is trading above the middle band but below the upper band at $0.47. This positioning suggests XLM has room to move toward the upper Bollinger Band, which aligns perfectly with the immediate resistance level.\nThe 24-hour trading volume of $35.89 million on Binance demonstrates healthy market participation, though not exceptionally high. This moderate volume suggests any breakout above $0.47 would need increased buying pressure for sustainability.\nStellar Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for XLM\nThe primary XLM price target focuses on the $0.47 immediate resistance level, representing the upper Bollinger Band. A decisive break above this level with increased volume could trigger a rapid move toward the strong resistance at $0.52, matching the 52-week high of $0.50.\nIf Stellar maintains momentum above $0.52, the next significant targets align with analyst predictions: $0.57-$0.70 range. The Traders Union forecast of $0.7019 becomes achievable if XLM can establish $0.52 as new support rather than resistance.\nTechnical conditions supporting this bullish Stellar forecast include the strong positioning above all major moving averages and the overall \"Very Strong Bullish\" trend classification. Additionally, XLM remains 14% below its 52-week high, suggesting room for recovery to previous levels.\nBearish Risk for Stellar\nThe primary risk to this optimistic XLM price prediction lies in the failure to break above $0.47 resistance. If Stellar fails to maintain its current level above the 20-day SMA at $0.42, a retreat toward $0.36 immediate support becomes likely.\nA break below $0.36 would invalidate the bullish thesis and could trigger a deeper correction toward the strong support at $0.22, which represents the 52-week low. This scenario aligns with InvestingHaven's bearish target, though they maintain medium-term bullishness.\nThe negative MACD histogram serves as an early warning signal that bearish momentum could accelerate if key support levels fail to hold.\nShould You Buy XLM Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on current Stellar technical analysis, the decision to buy or sell XLM depends on risk tolerance and timeframe. Conservative investors should wait for a clear break above $0.47 with strong volume before establishing positions, using $0.42 as a stop-loss level.\nMore aggressive traders could consider accumulating XLM near current levels around $0.43, with tight stops below $0.40. This strategy capitalizes on the potential bounce from the 20-day SMA while limiting downside risk.\nFor those asking whether to buy or sell XLM, the technical setup suggests buying on any dip toward $0.42 support, with initial targets at $0.47 and extended targets at $0.52-$0.57 range. Position sizing should remain modest given the mixed short-term signals from MACD.\nXLM Price Prediction Conclusion\nThis comprehensive XLM price prediction analysis suggests a 65% probability of reaching $0.50-$0.70 targets within 4-6 weeks, provided Stellar can break above the crucial $0.47 resistance level. The convergence of multiple analyst predictions in this range increases confidence in the forecast.\nKey indicators to monitor include RSI approaching 60+ levels for bullish confirmation, MACD histogram turning positive, and trading volume exceeding $50 million during any breakout attempt. Failure to hold $0.42 support would invalidate this bullish Stellar forecast and suggest a reassessment of the prediction timeline.\nThe technical foundation remains solid with XLM trading above all major moving averages, but the immediate challenge at $0.47 resistance will determine whether this prediction materializes within the projected timeframe.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Cosmos (ATOM) faces a critical juncture as technical indicators present mixed signals while recent analyst predictions suggest modest upside potential. With ATOM currently trading at $4.46, down 2.89% in the last 24 hours, our comprehensive ATOM price prediction analysis reveals both immediate challenges and medium-term opportunities for the interchain protocol token.\nATOM Price Prediction Summary\n• ATOM short-term target (1 week): $4.85 (+8.7%)\n• Cosmos medium-term forecast (1 month): $5.10-$5.30 range\n• Key level to break for bullish continuation: $4.95\n• Critical support if bearish: $4.01\nRecent Cosmos Price Predictions from Analysts\nRecent analyst coverage shows a consistent bullish bias in ATOM price prediction models. Changelly's progressive forecasts over the past five days demonstrate an ascending trajectory, with price targets climbing from $4.75 on August 12 to $4.91 by August 16. This represents a methodical 3.4% increase in target prices, suggesting analysts are gaining confidence in ATOM's near-term prospects.\nThe consensus Cosmos forecast among tracked analysts points to a modest but sustained upward trend, with all predictions maintaining medium confidence levels. This cautious optimism aligns with our technical analysis, which shows ATOM consolidating above key support levels while building momentum for a potential breakout.\nNotably, the $4.91 ATOM price target from the most recent prediction sits just below our identified immediate resistance at $4.95, creating a compelling technical confluence for bulls to target.\nATOM Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Gradual Recovery\nCurrent Cosmos technical analysis reveals a coin in transition, with several indicators pointing toward a potential shift from neutral to bullish territory. The RSI reading of 47.99 positions ATOM in neutral territory, providing room for upward movement without entering overbought conditions.\nThe MACD histogram shows a positive reading of 0.0028, indicating early bullish momentum development. This subtle but important signal suggests that buying pressure is beginning to outweigh selling pressure, supporting our optimistic ATOM price prediction outlook.\nVolume analysis shows $9.13 million in 24-hour trading volume on Binance, which while not exceptional, provides adequate liquidity for technical patterns to develop organically. The current price position at 50.41% of the Bollinger Bands range indicates ATOM is testing the middle band, a neutral position that could break either direction based on upcoming catalysts.\nCosmos Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for ATOM\nOur primary ATOM price target of $5.20 represents a 16.6% upside from current levels and aligns with historical resistance zones. This target becomes achievable if ATOM can break above the immediate resistance at $4.95, which coincides with recent analyst predictions.\nThe path to $5.20 requires ATOM to first reclaim the $4.87 upper Bollinger Band, followed by a sustained move above the psychological $5.00 level. Technical momentum supports this scenario, with the MACD showing early bullish divergence and moving averages beginning to align in a more favorable configuration.\nA break above $5.20 could trigger an extended rally toward the stronger resistance at $5.32, representing our maximum bullish ATOM price target for the next month.\nBearish Risk for Cosmos\nThe primary risk to our bullish Cosmos forecast lies in a breakdown below the critical $4.01 support level. This represents the immediate support identified in our technical analysis and aligns with the lower range of recent trading activity.\nA sustained break below $4.01 could trigger a deeper correction toward the $3.90 strong support level, representing a potential 12.6% downside from current prices. Bears would gain control if ATOM fails to hold above the $4.25 bearish target identified in recent analyst coverage.\nShould You Buy ATOM Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on our ATOM price prediction analysis, the current level presents a reasonable entry opportunity for medium-term holders. The optimal entry range sits between $4.40-$4.50, near current prices, with a stop-loss positioned below $4.01 to limit downside risk.\nFor risk-averse investors, waiting for a break above $4.95 provides confirmation of bullish momentum but reduces potential upside. Aggressive traders might consider accumulating on any dip toward $4.25, the identified bearish target that could present an attractive risk-reward opportunity.\nPosition sizing should remain conservative given the medium confidence level in current predictions. A 2-3% portfolio allocation allows participation in potential upside while limiting exposure to cryptocurrency volatility.\nATOM Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur comprehensive analysis supports a moderately bullish ATOM price prediction with a primary target of $5.20 within four weeks. This represents a 16.6% upside potential based on current technical setup and analyst consensus.\nThe prediction carries a medium confidence level, supported by bullish MACD momentum and recent analyst upgrades, but tempered by neutral RSI readings and mixed moving average signals. Key indicators to monitor include a break above $4.95 resistance for bullish confirmation or a breakdown below $4.01 support that would invalidate the upside scenario.\nInvestors should expect this Cosmos forecast to play out over the next 3-4 weeks, with initial confirmation needed within the next 7-10 trading days to maintain validity.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Bitcoin Cash has been demonstrating remarkable strength in recent weeks, trading at $593.00 with technical indicators pointing toward continued upside momentum. Our comprehensive BCH price prediction analysis suggests the cryptocurrency is well-positioned for further gains, with multiple analyst forecasts converging around the $600+ level.\nBCH Price Prediction Summary\n• BCH short-term target (1 week): $615-$625 (+3.7% to +5.4%) • Bitcoin Cash medium-term forecast (1 month): $580-$640 range with bias toward upper end • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $634.30 (immediate resistance) • Critical support if bearish: $514.50 (immediate support level)\nRecent Bitcoin Cash Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe latest BCH price prediction consensus from major analytical sources shows remarkable alignment around bullish targets. Changelly's aggressive forecast calls for $605.92 by August 16, 2025, representing a 2.2% upside from current levels. CoinCodex maintains a similar Bitcoin Cash forecast with a $600.94 target, while PriceForecastBot takes a slightly more conservative approach with $579.80 by September 14, 2025.\nThis convergence of predictions around the $580-$606 range demonstrates strong analytical consensus. The medium confidence levels across all forecasts suggest cautious optimism rather than speculative euphoria, which often precedes sustainable price movements in the cryptocurrency market.\nBCH Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Bullish Continuation\nThe current Bitcoin Cash technical analysis reveals a compelling setup for continued upside momentum. With BCH trading at $593.00, the cryptocurrency sits comfortably above all major moving averages, including the critical 200-day SMA at $409.67, indicating a strong long-term bullish trend.\nThe MACD histogram reading of 0.4006 confirms bullish momentum is building, while the RSI at 57.24 provides ample room for further upside before reaching overbought conditions. Perhaps most significantly, Bitcoin Cash's position at 0.70 within the Bollinger Bands suggests the recent rally has room to extend toward the upper band at $621.90.\nTrading volume of $18.9 million on Binance provides adequate liquidity support for the current price action, though increased volume would strengthen our BCH price prediction confidence. The daily ATR of $30.22 indicates healthy volatility that supports both risk management and profit potential.\nBitcoin Cash Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for BCH\nOur primary BCH price target focuses on the $634.30 resistance level, which represents both immediate and strong resistance according to technical analysis. A break above this level would likely trigger momentum toward the 52-week high of $622.30, followed by a potential extension to $650-$670.\nThe bullish Bitcoin Cash forecast requires sustained trading above the $600 psychological level and confirmation through increased buying volume. The alignment of moving averages in bullish formation provides strong technical foundation for this scenario.\nBearish Risk for Bitcoin Cash\nDownside risks to our BCH price prediction center around the $514.50 immediate support level. A break below this critical zone could trigger selling pressure toward the stronger support at $468.80, representing approximately 21% downside from current levels.\nThe primary risk factors include broader cryptocurrency market weakness, Bitcoin correlation dynamics, and potential profit-taking near resistance levels. However, the current technical setup suggests these bearish scenarios remain secondary probabilities.\nShould You Buy BCH Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on our Bitcoin Cash technical analysis, the current price level of $593.00 presents a reasonable entry opportunity for those seeking exposure to BCH. Conservative traders should consider scaling into positions between $580-$590, using the 20-day SMA at $574.17 as a backstop.\nFor the question of whether to buy or sell BCH, the technical evidence favors a buy recommendation with proper risk management. Set stop-losses below $570 to limit downside exposure while targeting the $625-$635 resistance zone for profit-taking.\nPosition sizing should remain conservative given the medium confidence level in current predictions, with maximum allocation of 2-3% of portfolio value for most retail investors.\nBCH Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur comprehensive analysis supports a bullish BCH price prediction through September 2025, with primary targets in the $615-$635 range. The confluence of technical indicators, analyst forecasts, and market structure provides medium-to-high confidence in continued upside momentum.\nKey indicators to watch for confirmation include sustained trading above $600, MACD signal line crossover, and volume expansion on breakout attempts. Invalidation of our Bitcoin Cash forecast would require a decisive break below $574 with accompanying volume.\nThe timeline for this prediction centers on the next 2-4 weeks, with the September 14 timeframe from PriceForecastBot providing a reasonable horizon for target achievement. Traders should monitor daily closes and adjust positions accordingly as the technical picture evolves.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "AVAX Price Prediction Summary\n• AVAX short-term target (1 week): $25.50 (+7.5%) • Avalanche medium-term forecast (1 month): $27-32 range (+14% to +35%) • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $27.38 • Critical support if bearish: $20.57\nRecent Avalanche Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe latest AVAX price prediction landscape reveals a striking divide among cryptocurrency analysts. While conservative forecasts from Changelly and CaptainAltcoin suggest modest targets around $21-24, more optimistic projections from PricePredictions.com and Switchere.com paint a dramatically different picture with targets reaching $75.97 and $64.40 respectively.\nThe wide spread in these Avalanche forecast predictions reflects the inherent uncertainty in cryptocurrency markets. Short-term predictions clustering around $23-25 appear more aligned with current technical realities, while the aggressive $75+ targets likely assume significant fundamental catalysts that haven't materialized yet. The median AVAX price target across all analysts sits around $32-35, which provides a reasonable middle ground for our analysis.\nMost analysts maintain medium confidence levels, indicating recognition of the volatile nature of cryptocurrency predictions. This consensus suggests cautious optimism rather than euphoric bullishness.\nAVAX Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Consolidation Breakout\nCurrent Avalanche technical analysis reveals a cryptocurrency caught between competing forces. Trading at $23.72, AVAX sits just above its 20-day SMA of $23.28 and well above longer-term moving averages, indicating underlying bullish structure despite recent weakness.\nThe RSI reading of 52.25 positions AVAX in neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold. This provides room for movement in either direction, making the next technical catalyst crucial for determining short-term direction. The MACD histogram showing -0.0075 suggests slight bearish momentum, but the shallow reading indicates this could easily reverse with positive price action.\nBollinger Bands analysis shows AVAX trading at 0.59 position between bands, slightly above the middle band. This positioning typically precedes either a move toward the upper band at $25.74 or a test of support near the lower band at $20.82. The 24-hour trading volume of $92.8 million on Binance provides adequate liquidity for institutional participation.\nAvalanche Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for AVAX\nThe bullish AVAX price prediction scenario targets the $27-32 range within the next month. The immediate resistance at $27.38 represents the first major hurdle, but successful clearance opens the door to the $30+ territory suggested by several analyst forecasts.\nKey technical factors supporting this Avalanche forecast include the strong bullish overall trend designation and AVAX trading 48% above its 52-week low of $16.04. The proximity to the 200-day SMA at $21.69 suggests any significant dip would likely find strong institutional support.\nFor the bullish case to materialize, AVAX needs to reclaim the $25.50 level and hold it as support. A break above $27.38 with strong volume would likely trigger algorithmic buying and push toward the $30-32 AVAX price target zone.\nBearish Risk for Avalanche\nThe bearish scenario for this AVAX price prediction involves a breakdown below the critical $20.57 support level. Such a move would invalidate the current bullish structure and potentially target the stronger support zone around $16.94.\nWarning signs to monitor include a break below the 20-day SMA with increasing volume, RSI dropping below 45, and MACD histogram expanding into negative territory. The cryptocurrency market's correlation with traditional risk assets means broader market weakness could pressure AVAX regardless of technical setup.\nA sustained move below $20.57 would suggest a retest of the $16-18 range, representing potential 25-30% downside from current levels.\nShould You Buy AVAX Now? Entry Strategy\nThe current technical setup suggests a measured approach to the buy or sell AVAX decision. Aggressive buyers might consider initial positions around current levels ($23.70), with the understanding that a test of $20.57 support remains possible.\nConservative entry points include a pullback to $21-22 range for better risk-reward ratio, or alternatively, a breakout confirmation above $25.50 for momentum buyers. Stop-loss placement below $20.50 provides defined risk management for long positions.\nPosition sizing should reflect the medium confidence level inherent in current AVAX price prediction models. Consider allocating 2-3% of portfolio to AVAX rather than making it a core holding given the technical uncertainty.\nAVAX Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur base case Avalanche forecast targets the $27-32 range over the next 4-6 weeks, representing 15-35% upside potential. This prediction carries medium confidence given the neutral RSI positioning and mixed momentum indicators.\nKey validation signals include a sustained break above $25.50 with volume, while invalidation would occur on a close below $20.57. The wide range of analyst predictions from $21 to $75 reflects the cryptocurrency's potential for both conservative gains and explosive moves depending on market conditions.\nTraders should monitor Bitcoin's price action closely, as AVAX typically correlates with broader cryptocurrency market sentiment. The September timeframe aligns with historical seasonal patterns that often favor cryptocurrency price appreciation, supporting the moderately bullish AVAX price prediction outlined above.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Polkadot (DOT) finds itself at a critical juncture as technical indicators present conflicting signals for the next price move. Trading at $3.90 after a 4.51% daily decline, our DOT price prediction analysis suggests the token is positioning for a potential breakout despite recent weakness.\nDOT Price Prediction Summary\n• DOT short-term target (1 week): $4.20-$4.50 (+8-15%) • Polkadot medium-term forecast (1 month): $5.50-$6.50 range (+41-67%) • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $4.67 (strong resistance) • Critical support if bearish: $3.24 (strong support level)\nRecent Polkadot Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe latest DOT price prediction landscape reveals stark disagreements among analysts. PricePredictions.com presents the most optimistic Polkadot forecast with a $13.50 target, representing a massive 246% upside from current levels. This bullish outlook contrasts sharply with more conservative predictions from CoinCodex ($3.89) and CoinLore ($3.71), which suggest limited upside or even slight declines.\nBlockchain.News offers a middle-ground DOT price target of $6.50-$7.00, citing bullish MACD momentum and oversold conditions. This aligns closely with our technical analysis showing DOT trading near 52-week lows with potential for mean reversion. The wide prediction range from $3.71 to $13.50 indicates high uncertainty, making technical analysis crucial for informed decision-making.\nDOT Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Bullish Reversal\nOur Polkadot technical analysis reveals several encouraging signals despite recent price weakness. The MACD histogram shows a positive 0.0098 reading, indicating bullish momentum building beneath the surface. DOT's position at 0.55 within the Bollinger Bands suggests the token has room to move higher toward the upper band at $4.27.\nThe RSI reading of 48.99 positions Polkadot in neutral territory, avoiding both overbought and oversold extremes. This neutral stance provides flexibility for movement in either direction, but combined with the bullish MACD, it suggests upward bias. Trading volume of $35.8 million on Binance indicates adequate liquidity for any potential breakout move.\nKey resistance at $4.37 represents the immediate hurdle, followed by the critical $4.67 level that has proven stubborn. A break above $4.67 would likely trigger the next leg higher toward our DOT price target range of $5.50-$6.50.\nPolkadot Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for DOT\nThe primary bullish scenario for our DOT price prediction centers on breaking the $4.67 resistance level within the next 7-10 days. Success here would open the path to $5.50-$6.50, representing the convergence zone where multiple technical factors align.\nThis Polkadot forecast requires sustained buying pressure above the 20-day EMA at $3.96 and maintaining positions above the pivot point at $3.93. The 50-day SMA at $3.86 has already been reclaimed, providing a foundation for further gains. Volume expansion beyond current levels would confirm institutional interest and support higher DOT price targets.\nBearish Risk for Polkadot\nThe bearish scenario emerges if DOT fails to hold the $3.93 pivot point, potentially triggering a decline toward $3.43 immediate support. A break below this level would expose the critical $3.24 strong support zone, representing a 17% downside risk from current levels.\nThis negative Polkadot forecast would be confirmed by RSI falling below 40 and MACD turning negative. The proximity to the 52-week low of $3.15 adds urgency to any bearish breakdown, as it could trigger panic selling and accelerate declines.\nShould You Buy DOT Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on our DOT price prediction analysis, the optimal entry strategy involves staged purchases rather than a single large position. Consider initial accumulation between $3.85-$3.95, with additional purchases on any dips toward $3.70-$3.80.\nFor those asking \"buy or sell DOT,\" the technical setup favors patient buyers willing to hold through potential short-term volatility. Set stop-losses below $3.50 to limit downside risk while targeting the $5.50-$6.50 range over the next 30 days.\nPosition sizing should remain conservative given the mixed analyst predictions and overall market uncertainty. Allocate no more than 2-3% of portfolio to DOT positions until the breakout above $4.67 confirms the bullish thesis.\nDOT Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur comprehensive analysis yields a cautiously optimistic DOT price prediction with medium confidence. The combination of bullish MACD momentum, neutral RSI positioning, and proximity to 52-week lows creates an asymmetric risk-reward setup favoring patient buyers.\nThe key indicators to monitor include the MACD maintaining positive momentum, RSI staying above 45, and most critically, price action around the $4.67 resistance level. A clean break above this zone within the next two weeks would validate our bullish Polkadot forecast and potentially accelerate moves toward $6.50-$7.00.\nTimeline for this DOT price prediction centers on the next 30 days, with the first confirmation signals expected within 7-10 days. Failure to break $4.67 by early September would necessitate a reassessment of the bullish thesis and potentially lower targets in the $4.00-$4.50 range.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "LINK Price Prediction: Chainlink Eyes $24-26 Target Despite Recent Pullback\nChainlink's recent 5% daily decline to $21.66 presents a compelling technical setup for traders seeking the next major price move. Our comprehensive LINK price prediction analysis reveals a mixed but ultimately bullish outlook, with key resistance levels poised to determine whether Chainlink can sustain its impressive run above the 200-day moving average.\nLINK Price Prediction Summary\n• LINK short-term target (1 week): $22.50-23.50 (+4% to +8%) • Chainlink medium-term forecast (1 month): $24.00-26.00 range • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $24.74 (immediate resistance) • Critical support if bearish: $19.28 (20-day SMA)\nRecent Chainlink Price Predictions from Analysts\nRecent analyst predictions from DigitalCoinPrice show remarkable consistency, with progressive LINK price targets climbing from $20.23 on August 12th to $21.00 on August 16th. This systematic upward revision of the Chainlink forecast reflects growing technical confidence as LINK has successfully maintained its position above key moving averages.\nThe consensus among technical analysts points to cautious optimism, with most maintaining medium confidence levels for their predictions. Notably, the $21.00 LINK price target established yesterday has already been surpassed, suggesting momentum may be stronger than initially anticipated. However, the 5% pullback today indicates profit-taking pressure near these elevated levels.\nLINK Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Breakout Confirmation\nChainlink technical analysis reveals a cryptocurrency positioned at a critical juncture. The current price of $21.66 sits comfortably above the 20-day SMA at $19.28, while the RSI reading of 60.36 indicates healthy momentum without overbought conditions. The MACD histogram's positive reading of 0.2542 confirms bullish momentum remains intact despite today's decline.\nThe Bollinger Bands analysis shows LINK trading at 0.72 position within the bands, approaching the upper boundary at $24.68. This positioning typically suggests either a breakout attempt or consolidation phase. Given the 24-hour volume of $110.16 million on Binance, institutional interest remains robust enough to support continued upward pressure.\nMoving average alignment strongly favors bulls, with LINK trading above all major timeframes: 7-day ($22.37), 20-day ($19.28), 50-day ($17.25), and 200-day ($15.68). This bullish configuration rarely reverses without significant fundamental catalysts.\nChainlink Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for LINK\nThe primary LINK price target of $24.74 represents immediate resistance that, once broken, could trigger rapid advancement toward the $26-28 zone. Technical factors supporting this Chainlink forecast include the sustained position above all moving averages and the MACD's continued bullish divergence.\nA successful break above $24.74 would establish a clear path toward retesting the 52-week high at $29.26, representing 35% upside potential from current levels. Volume confirmation above 150 million daily would validate this bullish thesis.\nBearish Risk for Chainlink\nDownside risks center around the $19.28 support level (20-day SMA). A decisive break below this critical support could trigger a retest of $17.25 (50-day SMA), representing 20% downside risk. The daily ATR of $1.51 suggests normal volatility could easily test these support zones.\nBears would target the $15.43 immediate support level, with a worst-case scenario pointing toward $12.73 strong support. However, such a decline would require significant market-wide cryptocurrency weakness.\nShould You Buy LINK Now? Entry Strategy\nCurrent technical conditions suggest a layered approach for those wondering whether to buy or sell LINK. Conservative traders should wait for a pullback to the $20.50-21.00 zone, which aligns with the EMA-12 at $21.06 and provides favorable risk-reward positioning.\nAggressive traders can consider entries above $22.00 with tight stop-losses at $20.80, targeting the $24.74 resistance level. This strategy offers a 2:1 risk-reward ratio, acceptable for short-term momentum plays.\nPosition sizing should remain conservative given cryptocurrency volatility, with stop-losses mandatory below the 20-day SMA at $19.28 for all timeframes longer than intraday trading.\nLINK Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur comprehensive analysis yields a medium-high confidence LINK price prediction targeting $24-26 within 30 days, contingent on maintaining support above $20.00. The Chainlink forecast remains constructively bullish despite near-term volatility, supported by strong technical indicators and analyst consensus.\nKey indicators to monitor include daily volume sustaining above $100 million, RSI remaining between 50-70, and most critically, LINK's ability to hold the 20-day SMA during any pullbacks. Invalidation of this bullish thesis would require a decisive break below $19.00, triggering a reassessment toward lower targets.\nThe prediction timeline suggests initial resistance testing within 7-10 days, with the full $24-26 target achievable within the next 20-30 days assuming broader cryptocurrency market stability.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Polygon's native token MATIC finds itself at a critical juncture as technical indicators paint a mixed picture for the coming weeks. While current momentum appears bearish, recent analyst forecasts suggest substantial upside potential remains for the remainder of August 2025.\nMATIC Price Prediction Summary\n• MATIC short-term target (1 week): $0.45-$0.50 (+15-25%) • Polygon medium-term forecast (1 month): $1.70-$2.10 range • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $0.58 resistance • Critical support if bearish: $0.33-$0.35 zone\nRecent Polygon Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe MATIC price prediction landscape shows remarkable consensus among analysts despite varying methodologies. CoinCodex provides the most conservative short-term outlook with a MATIC price target of $0.24, suggesting potential downside risk in the immediate term. However, this contrasts sharply with medium-term projections.\nMultiple sources including Finality X, CoinLore, Trader Fan, and The Crypto News converge on similar Polygon forecast targets between $1.70-$2.10 for August 2025. This consensus emerges from technical analysis patterns and historical bull market comparisons, with CoinLore specifically citing prior crypto market cycles as supporting evidence for their $1.91 target.\nThe spread between short-term bearish and medium-term bullish predictions suggests analysts expect significant volatility before any major upward movement materializes.\nMATIC Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Oversold Bounce\nCurrent Polygon technical analysis reveals MATIC trading in severely oversold territory. The RSI reading of 38.00 sits in neutral-to-bearish range, while the Bollinger Bands position of -1.20 indicates the token trades well below its 20-day moving average baseline.\nThe MACD histogram at -0.0045 confirms bearish momentum persists, though the magnitude suggests selling pressure may be diminishing. Price action has rejected the lower Bollinger Band at $0.31, creating potential for a mean reversion play toward the middle band at $0.43.\nMoving average structure presents a challenging technical picture, with price trading below all major timeframes. The SMA 200 at $0.69 represents the most significant resistance level, sitting roughly 75% above current theoretical price levels.\nVolume analysis shows muted participation, which often precedes significant directional moves. The daily ATR of $0.03 indicates compressed volatility that typically expands during breakout scenarios.\nPolygon Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for MATIC\nThe optimistic MATIC price prediction scenario targets the $1.70-$2.10 range based on several technical factors. First, the oversold Bollinger Bands position historically generates strong bounces in MATIC. A break above the immediate resistance at $0.58 would trigger the first leg of recovery.\nSequential targets include reclaiming the SMA 200 at $0.69, followed by a test of the 52-week high near $1.27. Extended targets align with analyst projections, requiring sustained buying pressure and broader crypto market strength.\nFor bulls to maintain control, MATIC needs to establish support above $0.45 and demonstrate follow-through volume on any breakout attempts.\nBearish Risk for Polygon\nThe bearish Polygon forecast warns of potential decline toward strong support at $0.33. A breakdown below this level could trigger accelerated selling toward the 52-week low region near $0.31.\nRisk factors include continued MACD divergence, failure to reclaim moving average resistance, and broader market weakness. The proximity to lower Bollinger Bands provides some technical cushion, but sustained breakdown would target deeper support levels.\nShould You Buy MATIC Now? Entry Strategy\nThe current risk-reward profile suggests a measured approach to buy or sell MATIC decisions. Conservative buyers should wait for confirmation above $0.45 before initiating positions, using the $0.35 support as a stop-loss reference.\nAggressive traders might consider scaling into positions near current support levels at $0.33-$0.35, targeting the $0.58 resistance for initial profit-taking. Position sizing should reflect the high volatility environment and uncertain short-term direction.\nRisk management remains paramount given the conflicting signals between short-term technical weakness and medium-term analyst optimism.\nMATIC Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur MATIC price prediction maintains a cautiously optimistic medium-term outlook despite current technical headwinds. The convergence of multiple analyst targets between $1.70-$2.10 provides compelling upside potential, representing 300-400% gains from current support levels.\nHowever, traders should monitor the $0.33-$0.35 support zone closely, as breakdown below these levels would invalidate the bullish thesis. The RSI and Bollinger Bands positioning suggest oversold conditions may soon reverse, providing the technical foundation for the predicted recovery.\nTimeline for this Polygon forecast extends through the remainder of August 2025, with initial confirmation signals expected if MATIC can establish support above $0.45 within the next 1-2 weeks. Confidence level: Medium, given the mixed technical signals but strong analyst consensus on medium-term targets.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Dogecoin has emerged from recent consolidation with renewed bullish momentum, setting the stage for a potential rally toward $0.30. Our comprehensive DOGE price prediction analysis reveals multiple technical catalysts aligning for an upward move, though key resistance levels must be conquered first.\nDOGE Price Prediction Summary\n• DOGE short-term target (1 week): $0.267 (+16.1%)\n• Dogecoin medium-term forecast (1 month): $0.28-$0.32 range\n• Key level to break for bullish continuation: $0.2455\n• Critical support if bearish: $0.2150\nRecent Dogecoin Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe latest Dogecoin forecast from leading analysts shows a convergent bullish bias, with CoinDesk delivering the most aggressive DOGE price prediction of $0.30 based on emerging golden cross patterns. This contrasts with more conservative AI-driven models from WalletInvestor ($0.246) and Changelly ($0.236), which rely heavily on historical price action.\nCoinEdition's technical-focused prediction of $0.2668 aligns closely with our analysis, identifying the critical Fibonacci rebound level that has provided strong support. The consensus among analysts suggests Dogecoin is positioned for modest gains, though the magnitude varies significantly based on methodology.\nThe divergence between traditional technical analysis (more bullish) and AI predictions (more conservative) creates an interesting dynamic, with the former showing higher confidence levels in their Dogecoin forecast.\nDOGE Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Bullish Breakout\nCurrent Dogecoin technical analysis reveals several compelling bullish indicators converging simultaneously. The MACD histogram showing 0.0005 positive momentum represents the first bullish crossover in three weeks, while the RSI at 53.63 provides ample room for upward movement without entering overbought territory.\nThe most significant development is DOGE's position within the Bollinger Bands at 0.6852, indicating the price has moved decisively above the middle band ($0.22) and is approaching the upper band at $0.25. This positioning typically precedes breakout moves when accompanied by volume expansion.\nTrading volume of $367.7 million represents a 23% increase from the weekly average, suggesting institutional accumulation behind the scenes. The moving average structure tells a bullish story, with DOGE trading above all major EMAs and SMAs, creating a classic bullish alignment that supports our upward DOGE price prediction.\nDogecoin Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for DOGE\nOur primary DOGE price target sequence begins with an initial move to $0.2668, representing the 0.618 Fibonacci extension level that has historically acted as magnetic resistance. Breaking this level with volume confirmation opens the path to $0.30, where the 200-day moving average convergence and psychological resistance create a natural profit-taking zone.\nThe ultimate bullish scenario sees Dogecoin reaching $0.32-$0.35 if broader crypto momentum accelerates. This would require sustaining above $0.30 for at least five trading days, establishing it as new support rather than temporary resistance.\nBearish Risk for Dogecoin\nDownside risks center around the critical $0.2455 resistance level, which has rejected three previous attempts since July. Failure to break this level could trigger profit-taking back to $0.2150 support, invalidating the near-term bullish thesis.\nA more severe correction would target the $0.19 Bollinger Band lower boundary, representing a 17% decline from current levels. This scenario becomes probable if Bitcoin experiences renewed selling pressure or if overall market risk sentiment deteriorates.\nShould You Buy DOGE Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on our Dogecoin technical analysis, the optimal entry strategy involves scaled purchases between current levels ($0.23) and $0.2350, with position sizing limited to 2-3% of portfolio allocation given cryptocurrency volatility.\nConservative traders should wait for a confirmed breakout above $0.2455 before initiating positions, accepting higher entry prices in exchange for reduced risk. This approach targets the $0.30 level while maintaining stop-loss protection at $0.2150.\nFor existing holders, the question of whether to buy or sell DOGE depends on risk tolerance and time horizon. Technical momentum supports holding through the anticipated breakout attempt, though taking partial profits at $0.2668 represents prudent risk management.\nDOGE Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur comprehensive analysis yields a bullish DOGE price prediction with medium-high confidence, targeting $0.30 within the next 4-6 weeks. The convergence of technical indicators, analyst forecasts, and improving market structure supports this upward thesis.\nKey confirmation signals include sustained trading above $0.2455, MACD momentum expansion, and daily volume exceeding $400 million. Invalidation occurs below $0.2150, which would reset the technical outlook and require reassessment of our Dogecoin forecast.\nThe predicted timeline allows for initial consolidation through late August before acceleration in early September, coinciding with typical seasonal crypto market strength. Traders should monitor Bitcoin correlation closely, as broader market leadership remains essential for sustained DOGE momentum.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

CoinEdition leads with the most bullish short-term Ripple forecast, targeting $3.26-$3.32 based on XRP's successful rebound from 200 EMA support and RSI recovery from oversold conditions. This aligns closely with Cryptonews' more conservative $3.16-$3.23 prediction range.\nNotably, Coinpedia presents the most ambitious medium-term outlook, projecting a potential surge to $4.00 if XRP successfully breaks above the $3.40-$3.66 resistance cluster. Their analysis centers on a developing bull flag pattern that could trigger significant upside momentum. Conversely, Finance Magnates strikes a more cautious tone, highlighting bearish pin bar formations and setting a $3.00 price target if XRP fails to overcome the critical $3.31 resistance level.\nThe analyst consensus suggests XRP price prediction models are converging around the $3.26-$3.48 range for the coming month, representing potential gains of 5-13% from current levels.\nXRP Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Measured Bullish Move\nRipple technical analysis reveals a mixed but increasingly constructive setup at current price levels of $3.09. The most significant positive factor supporting our XRP price prediction is the token's position above all major moving averages, including the critical 200 EMA at $2.46. This confirms the \"Very Strong Bullish\" overall trend classification.\nThe RSI reading of 50.59 provides optimal conditions for sustained upward movement, sitting in neutral territory with ample room before reaching overbought levels. However, the MACD histogram at -0.0214 indicates some near-term bearish momentum that could create short-term headwinds.\nXRP's position within the Bollinger Bands at 0.4868 suggests the price is slightly below the middle band ($3.10), indicating potential for mean reversion toward the upper band at $3.37. The daily ATR of $0.19 suggests moderate volatility, supporting controlled price movements rather than explosive breakouts.\nVolume analysis shows robust participation with $356 million in 24-hour Binance spot trading, providing sufficient liquidity to support our Ripple forecast targets.\nRipple Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for XRP\nThe primary bullish XRP price prediction scenario targets the $3.26-$3.32 range within 1-2 weeks, based on the successful defense of 200 EMA support and emerging bull flag pattern. If XRP breaks above the immediate resistance at $3.38, the next logical target becomes the Bollinger Band upper limit at $3.37, followed by the 52-week high area near $3.55.\nThe most optimistic Ripple forecast extends to $4.00 if XRP achieves a decisive break above the strong resistance cluster at $3.66. This scenario requires sustained buying pressure and broader cryptocurrency market support, with an estimated 30% probability of occurrence within the next month.\nKey bullish catalysts include RSI maintaining above 50, MACD histogram turning positive, and daily closes above $3.16 (7-day SMA).\nBearish Risk for Ripple\nThe primary downside risk for our XRP price prediction centers on a failure to hold the immediate support at $2.73. Such a breakdown could trigger a retreat toward the strong support zone at $2.13, representing a potential 31% decline from current levels.\nThe bearish case gains credibility if XRP fails to reclaim the $3.16 level (7-day SMA) within the next 3-5 trading sessions. Additional warning signs include RSI breaking below 45 and MACD histogram deepening into negative territory.\nA breakdown below the 20-day SMA at $3.10 would invalidate the near-term bullish Ripple forecast and suggest a test of the 50-day SMA at $2.91.\nShould You Buy XRP Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on current Ripple technical analysis, the optimal entry strategy involves scaling into positions on any weakness toward the $3.00-$3.05 range, representing the confluence of psychological support and the lower Bollinger Band at $2.83.\nRecommended Entry Points: - Primary Entry: $3.00-$3.05 (current support zone) - Secondary Entry: $2.90-$2.95 (50-day SMA retest) - Stop Loss: $2.70 (below immediate support) - Initial Target: $3.26 (analyst consensus) - Extended Target: $3.48 (medium-term projection)\nRisk management suggests limiting XRP exposure to 2-3% of total portfolio allocation, given the mixed technical signals and moderate confidence levels across analyst predictions.\nXRP Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur comprehensive XRP price prediction analysis supports a moderately bullish outlook targeting the $3.26-$3.48 range over the next 2-4 weeks. The combination of strong trend structure, neutral RSI conditions, and analyst consensus provides medium confidence in achieving these targets.\nConfidence Level: Medium (65%)\nKey indicators to monitor for prediction validation include XRP maintaining above $3.05 support, RSI holding above 50, and eventual MACD histogram recovery above zero. The prediction timeline suggests initial targets could be reached by early September 2025, with extended targets possible by month-end.\nThe critical decision point for this Ripple forecast lies at the $3.31-$3.38 resistance cluster, where successful breakouts could accelerate toward $4.00 targets, while rejections may trigger consolidation back toward $3.00 support levels.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "Cardano's recent price action has caught the attention of cryptocurrency analysts as ADA breaks above a critical multi-month triangle formation. With the token currently trading at $0.95, our comprehensive ADA price prediction analysis suggests significant upside potential in the coming weeks.\nADA Price Prediction Summary\n• ADA short-term target (1 week): $1.02 (+7.4%) • Cardano medium-term forecast (1 month): $1.05-$1.08 range • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $1.02 • Critical support if bearish: $0.88\nRecent Cardano Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe cryptocurrency community has shown remarkable consensus in their Cardano forecast, with multiple analysts targeting similar price levels. CoinEdition's recent analysis presents the most aggressive ADA price target of $1.0136, citing the successful breakout from a multi-month triangle structure combined with increased derivatives activity and a bullish Supertrend indicator.\nMeanwhile, CoinDo's analysis provides a more conservative but consistent ADA price prediction, targeting the $0.90-$0.95 range in the short term. Their reasoning centers on ADA testing resistance near $0.85-$0.86, supported by positive spot netflow and bullish structure breaks on shorter timeframes. The repeated emphasis on this price range across multiple publications suggests strong analyst confidence in this Cardano forecast.\nThe market consensus clearly favors an upward trajectory, with expectations of ADA testing and potentially surpassing the psychologically important $1.00 mark. This alignment between different analytical sources strengthens the overall bullish case for Cardano's near-term price action.\nADA Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Explosive Growth\nOur Cardano technical analysis reveals several compelling indicators supporting a bullish ADA price prediction. The current RSI reading of 71.96 indicates overbought conditions, but importantly, this level often precedes final upward pushes in strong trending markets rather than immediate reversals.\nThe MACD histogram at 0.0181 confirms bullish momentum is accelerating, with the MACD line at 0.0458 sitting well above the signal line at 0.0277. This divergence suggests buying pressure continues to build beneath ADA's current price level.\nPerhaps most significantly, Cardano's position relative to its Bollinger Bands shows a %B reading of 1.0050, meaning ADA is trading at the upper band resistance of $0.95. This technical setup often precedes breakout moves when accompanied by strong volume, which we're currently observing with 24-hour trading volume exceeding $364 million on Binance alone.\nThe moving average structure strongly supports the bullish Cardano forecast, with ADA trading above all major SMAs: the 7-period SMA at $0.88, 20-period at $0.80, 50-period at $0.74, and 200-period at $0.72. This alignment creates a powerful support foundation for any pullbacks.\nCardano Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for ADA\nThe primary ADA price target in our bullish scenario reaches $1.05-$1.08 within the next 2-3 weeks. This projection is based on the measured move from the triangle pattern breakout, which typically provides reliable price objectives. The key resistance level at $1.02 represents the immediate hurdle, but once cleared, minimal resistance exists until the $1.05 zone.\nFor this bullish Cardano forecast to materialize, ADA needs to maintain its current position above the $0.95 pivot point while demonstrating continued strength in derivatives markets. The successful hold above the triangle's upper boundary near $0.92 provides the technical foundation for this upward projection.\nA more aggressive scenario could see ADA challenge its 52-week high of $1.19 if broader cryptocurrency market conditions remain supportive and Cardano's ecosystem developments continue gaining traction.\nBearish Risk for Cardano\nDespite the predominantly bullish technical picture, our ADA price prediction acknowledges potential downside risks. The primary support level sits at $0.88, coinciding with the 7-period SMA and representing the triangle's breakout point.\nA failure to hold this level could trigger a deeper correction toward $0.80, where the 20-period SMA provides stronger support. In a more severe bearish scenario, ADA could retest the $0.74-$0.72 zone, encompassing both the 50-period and 200-period SMAs.\nThe overbought RSI condition at 71.96 warrants caution, as readings above 70 can sometimes precede short-term pullbacks even within longer-term uptrends.\nShould You Buy ADA Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on our Cardano technical analysis, the current price of $0.95 presents a reasonable entry point for investors with appropriate risk management. However, more conservative traders might wait for a slight pullback to the $0.92-$0.93 range, which would provide better risk-reward ratios.\nThe optimal buy or sell ADA strategy involves scaling into positions rather than committing full capital at current levels. Consider allocating 50% of intended position size at current prices, with the remainder reserved for potential dips toward the $0.90-$0.92 support zone.\nStop-loss levels should be placed below $0.88 for short-term trades, representing approximately 7% downside risk from current levels. This level corresponds with the triangle breakout point and provides logical invalidation of the bullish thesis.\nPosition sizing should reflect the elevated volatility indicated by the daily ATR of $0.06, suggesting potential daily moves of approximately 6-7% in either direction.\nADA Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur comprehensive analysis supports a bullish ADA price prediction targeting $1.05-$1.08 within the next 2-3 weeks, representing potential gains of 11-14% from current levels. This Cardano forecast carries medium-to-high confidence based on the convergence of technical indicators, analyst consensus, and successful triangle pattern breakout.\nKey indicators to monitor for confirmation include maintaining the RSI above 65, continued MACD histogram expansion, and most importantly, ADA's ability to establish $0.95 as support rather than resistance. A decisive break above $1.02 would validate the bullish scenario and likely accelerate movement toward our primary price targets.\nThe timeline for this prediction centers on the next 2-3 weeks, with interim confirmation expected if ADA can close above $1.00 on a daily basis within the next 5-7 trading days. Failure to achieve this milestone within the specified timeframe would necessitate reassessment of the bullish Cardano forecast and potentially more conservative price targets.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

This optimistic view stands in stark contrast to FinanceFeeds' more cautious $172 SOL price target, based on a bearish engulfing pattern formation at the $200 resistance level.\nAI-powered models show mixed signals, with WalletInvestor's algorithm suggesting a modest climb to $190.19, while CaptainAltcoin's model predicts a pullback to $175.78. The consensus among these predictions indicates significant uncertainty around the critical $200 level, which has emerged as the key battleground for Solana's near-term direction.\nMost analysts agree that the $200-$220 range represents a crucial resistance zone that will determine whether SOL can sustain its bullish momentum or face a deeper correction toward the $170s.\nSOL Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Potential Breakout\nCurrent Solana technical analysis reveals a cryptocurrency caught between competing forces. Trading at $186.81, SOL sits comfortably above all major moving averages, with the price positioned 71% up within the Bollinger Bands - indicating strong momentum but approaching overbought territory.\nThe MACD histogram reading of 1.2329 confirms bullish momentum remains intact, while the RSI at 55.27 sits in neutral territory, suggesting room for further upside movement without reaching overbought conditions. This technical setup supports the case for a continued rally toward the $200 resistance level.\nVolume analysis shows robust participation with $765 million in 24-hour trading volume on Binance spot markets alone. The Average True Range of $11.10 indicates healthy volatility that could facilitate a breakout move in either direction.\nThe key pattern to watch is the potential cup-and-handle formation that CoinEdition identified, which historically suggests continuation patterns when confirmed with volume expansion above the $200 handle resistance.\nSolana Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for SOL\nThe optimistic Solana forecast scenario targets $210-$218 within the next two weeks, representing a 12-17% upside from current levels. This SOL price target aligns with the technical resistance cluster identified by multiple analysts and represents the measured move from the cup-and-handle pattern.\nFor this bullish scenario to materialize, SOL needs to decisively break above $200 with strong volume confirmation. The next resistance levels sit at $209.86 (immediate) and $218-$220 (major), which coincides with previous swing highs and represents logical profit-taking zones.\nA successful break above $220 could open the door for a test of the $240-$250 zone, bringing SOL within striking distance of its 52-week high at $261.97.\nBearish Risk for Solana\nThe bearish scenario for this SOL price prediction centers around a failure to break the $200 resistance, potentially triggering a pullback toward $172-$176 support levels. This downside target represents a 8-12% decline from current prices and aligns with the lower end of recent analyst predictions.\nKey risk factors include broader cryptocurrency market weakness, profit-taking pressure near resistance, and the formation of bearish reversal patterns like the engulfing candle noted by FinanceFeeds. A break below $172 could accelerate selling toward the $155 strong support level, representing the lower Bollinger Band and a more significant 17% correction.\nShould You Buy SOL Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on current Solana technical analysis, a layered entry approach appears most prudent. For aggressive traders, buying near current levels around $185-$190 offers favorable risk-reward, with stops placed below $175 to limit downside exposure.\nConservative investors should wait for either a successful break above $200 with volume confirmation before entering, or alternatively, look for buying opportunities on any pullback toward the $175-$180 support zone.\nPosition sizing should reflect the medium confidence level of this SOL price prediction, with risk management paramount given the competing technical signals. A stop-loss below $172 represents logical risk management, as a break of this level would invalidate the bullish case and potentially trigger deeper selling.\nSOL Price Prediction Conclusion\nThis comprehensive Solana forecast suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook with a medium confidence level. The technical indicators support a potential move toward $210-$218 targets within the next 2-4 weeks, provided SOL can break decisively above the $200 resistance level.\nKey indicators to monitor include volume expansion on any breakout attempt, RSI behavior near resistance levels, and broader cryptocurrency market sentiment. A failure to break $200 within the next week could signal the need to reassess this bullish SOL price prediction.\nThe timeline for this prediction to materialize spans the next 2-4 weeks, with the critical $200 level serving as the ultimate determinant of whether Solana can achieve these upside targets or face a correction toward $172-$176 support levels.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "BNB Price Prediction Summary\n• BNB short-term target (1 week): $820-$860 (+1.5% to +3.3%) • Binance Coin medium-term forecast (1 month): $900-$950 range (+8.1% to +14.1%) • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $869.40 (strong resistance) • Critical support if bearish: $730.01 (immediate support level)\nRecent Binance Coin Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe latest BNB price prediction consensus from multiple analysts reveals a cautiously optimistic outlook for Binance Coin. CoinStats projects a BNB price target of $820-$860 in the short term, citing strong uptrend momentum but warning of overbought RSI conditions at 75.02. This aligns closely with our current RSI reading of 63.76, suggesting some cooling from extreme levels.\nCoinpedia presents the most bullish Binance Coin forecast, targeting $926-$1,000 based on sustained momentum above $750. Their analysis coincides with G9stock's prediction range of $865.25-$974.39, creating a strong consensus around the $900+ level for August-September 2025.\nHowever, contrarian views emerge from Price Forecast Bot's more conservative $658.12 target, suggesting potential downside risks. This creates a wide prediction range from $658 to $1,000, highlighting the current uncertainty in Binance Coin technical analysis.\nBNB Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Bullish Continuation\nCurrent Binance Coin technical analysis reveals a compelling setup for continued upside momentum. At $832.28, BNB trades well above all major moving averages, with the 7-day SMA at $827.62 providing immediate support. The ascending order of moving averages (SMA 7 > SMA 20 > SMA 50 > SMA 200) confirms the robust bullish trend structure.\nThe MACD histogram reading of 2.1478 indicates strengthening bullish momentum, while the current RSI of 63.76 sits in neutral territory, providing room for further upside without entering extremely overbought conditions. This contrasts favorably with the previously reported RSI of 75.02, suggesting healthy consolidation.\nBNB's position at 0.7887 within the Bollinger Bands indicates the price is trading in the upper portion of the recent range but hasn't reached the extreme upper band at $858.91. The 24-hour trading volume of $191.7 million on Binance provides adequate liquidity to support price movements in either direction.\nBinance Coin Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for BNB\nThe primary BNB price target for the bullish scenario centers on the $900-$950 range within 4-6 weeks. This projection stems from the current momentum structure and the need to clear the immediate resistance at $869.40. Once this level breaks, BNB could rapidly advance toward the psychological $900 level, with minimal resistance until $950.\nThe ascending triangle pattern formed by higher lows since the $531.49 yearly low and the resistance around $869 suggests a measured move target near $920. Strong fundamentals supporting Binance's ecosystem growth and recent regulatory clarity provide fundamental backing for this Binance Coin forecast.\nVolume confirmation will be crucial, requiring sustained daily volumes above $200 million to support breakout moves. The Average True Range of $30.57 suggests daily moves of this magnitude are well within normal volatility parameters.\nBearish Risk for Binance Coin\nDownside risks for BNB center on a break below the immediate support at $730.01, which would target the lower Bollinger Band at $732.91. A sustained breakdown below this level could trigger algorithmic selling toward the strong support zone at $643.71, representing a potential 22.6% decline from current levels.\nThe main risk factors include broader cryptocurrency market weakness, regulatory challenges for Binance, or a breakdown in the current bullish momentum structure. A reversal in the MACD from positive to negative territory would provide an early warning signal for such a scenario.\nShould You Buy BNB Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on current Binance Coin technical analysis, the optimal entry strategy involves scaling into positions on any dips toward the $820-$825 range, which aligns with the 7-day moving average support. This approach allows investors to buy or sell BNB with defined risk parameters.\nFor aggressive traders, buying at current levels around $832 with a stop-loss at $730 provides a favorable 3:1 risk-reward ratio targeting the $900-$950 zone. Conservative investors should wait for a pullback to the $800-$810 range near the 20-day moving average at $795.91.\nPosition sizing should account for BNB's daily volatility of approximately $30, suggesting allocation of no more than 2-3% of portfolio value per position to manage risk effectively.\nBNB Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur BNB price prediction anticipates a measured advance toward $900-$950 over the next 4-6 weeks, representing an 8-14% upside potential from current levels. This forecast carries a medium-to-high confidence level based on the convergence of technical indicators, analyst consensus, and fundamental support factors.\nKey indicators to monitor for confirmation include a decisive break above $869.40 resistance with volume expansion above $250 million daily. Invalidation signals would include a breakdown below $730 support or MACD histogram turning negative.\nThe timeline for this Binance Coin forecast extends through September 2025, with interim targets at $860 (1-2 weeks) and $900 (3-4 weeks) before reaching the upper target near $950. Traders should remain flexible and adjust positions based on momentum shifts and volume patterns as this prediction unfolds.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

The network's dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and emerging tokenized real-world assets provides substantial long-term support for these ambitious targets.\nBearish Risk for Ethereum\nDownside risks emerge if ETH fails to hold the $4,000 level, which multiple analysts have identified as critical support. A break below this zone could trigger selling toward the 20-day SMA at $3,994, with further support at $3,500.\nThe most bearish scenario in our ETH price prediction would see a decline to $3,000-$3,200, though this would require a significant shift in market sentiment and broader crypto weakness.\nShould You Buy ETH Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on current Ethereum technical analysis, the optimal buy or sell ETH decision depends on risk tolerance and timeframe. Conservative investors should wait for a pullback to $4,200-$4,300 levels for better risk-reward positioning.\nAggressive traders can consider entering near current levels with a stop-loss at $4,000, targeting the $4,800 resistance for a favorable 2:1 risk-reward ratio. This approach aligns with our short-term ETH price prediction while managing downside risk.\nPosition sizing should remain conservative given the 4.8% daily volatility (ATR), with recommended allocation not exceeding 5-10% of portfolio depending on individual risk parameters.\nETH Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur comprehensive Ethereum forecast maintains a bullish outlook with high confidence for the $4,800 target within one week. The combination of strong technical indicators, analyst consensus, and fundamental growth drivers supports this optimistic ETH price prediction.\nKey indicators to monitor include the RSI maintaining above 50, MACD histogram remaining positive, and most critically, a decisive break above $4,793 resistance. Failure to break this level within 7-10 days would warrant reassessing our bullish Ethereum forecast.\nThe timeline for our $4,800 prediction extends through August 23rd, with the broader $10,000+ targets expected to materialize in Q4 2025 as institutional adoption accelerates and Ethereum's ecosystem continues expanding.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/open-source-llms-surpass-proprietary-models-specialized-tasks",
        "text": "In a significant advancement for open-source language learning models (LLMs), Parsed has demonstrated that smaller, fine-tuned open-source models can outperform larger proprietary models in specific tasks, according to a report by Together AI. This revelation challenges the traditional view that open-source models are inferior to their proprietary counterparts.\nChallenging Conventional Wisdom\nThe belief that open-source LLMs inherently offer a tradeoff between performance and capability is being re-evaluated. Initial comparisons favored proprietary models, but advancements such as the Chinchilla scaling laws have shown that optimal training does not solely depend on parameter scaling. Instead, it involves a balanced parameter-to-token ratio, which can lead to smaller models outperforming larger ones in specialized tasks.\nEvaluation-First Methodology\nParsed employs a rigorous evaluation-first approach, focusing on creating programmatic, domain-aligned evaluation systems before model development. This methodology not only enhances model quality but also reduces inference costs significantly, offering potential savings of millions of dollars annually for some clients. This system allows for continual reinforcement learning, which is feasible with open weight models due to complete parameter access and algorithmic flexibility.\nTask-Specific Fine-Tuning\nBy fine-tuning a 27B parameter model for specific tasks, Parsed has been able to achieve significant performance improvements. For instance, their fine-tuned Gemma 3 27B model outperformed the Claude Sonnet 4 by 60% in a healthcare use case, all while operating at 10-100 times lower inference cost. This success is attributed to the model’s ability to optimize its representational capacity for a narrower probability space, enhancing efficiency and performance.\nHealthcare Use Case\nIn the healthcare sector, Parsed has collaborated with ambient scribes who transcribe clinician-patient interactions. The complexity of these tasks, which involve processing lengthy transcripts and handling intricate medical terminologies, often challenges larger models. However, with a well-optimized setup, Parsed's models can surpass the performance of larger proprietary models, offering reduced costs and improved reliability.\nAdvanced Evaluation Techniques\nIn healthcare applications, Parsed has developed sophisticated evaluation frameworks that assess clinical documentation across multiple dimensions, such as clinical soundness, source fidelity, and adherence to clinician’s style. These frameworks are critical in ensuring the models meet clinical-grade performance standards. The evaluation harness serves as a reward model for reinforcement learning, further enhancing model accuracy and efficiency.\nFinal Outcomes\nAfter fine-tuning, the Gemma 3 27B model showed transformative results, outperforming the Claude Sonnet 4 by 60%. This improvement not only demonstrates the potential of open-source models in specialized tasks but also highlights the cost-effectiveness and increased speed of smaller, fine-tuned models.\nThrough partnerships with specialized providers like Parsed, Together AI offers a comprehensive solution stack that combines reliable fine-tuning platforms with domain-specific expertise.

        "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/exploring-future-ai-infrastructure-decentralized-centralized",
        "text": "As the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape continues to evolve, the debate over cloud monopoly versus open infrastructure intensifies. Industry experts recently gathered to discuss the future of AI stacks, focusing on the potential of decentralized and centralized systems, according to Render Network.\nCentralized vs. Decentralized Compute\nThe centralized compute model is characterized by control over the entire stack, from hardware to user interface, allowing for price and access regulation. Danny Newman from RenderLabs highlighted that this control often results in a 'cloud tax' for AI developers, where unexpected charges can stifle innovation.\nConversely, decentralized networks offer a shared ecosystem where value is distributed across node operators, infrastructure networks, and app developers. Edward Katzin of Jember emphasized the benefits of token-based economics in these networks, which reward contributions and democratize access to compute resources. This model fosters innovation by providing small creators and startups with opportunities previously inaccessible due to cost barriers.\nInnovative Distribution Models\nDecentralized systems are poised to redefine distribution models for AI services. Katzin noted that projects like BitTensor and MIT’s Project Nanda aim to democratize AI service access, breaking the monopoly of centralized distribution. These initiatives could lead to the development of marketplaces for AI services, enabling global accessibility and fostering innovation.\nPaul Roales from RenderLabs suggested that decentralized ecosystems could facilitate the emergence of new microservices and plugins, akin to the early internet's evolution. This could lead to AI agents that autonomously seek out the best services, optimizing their operations based on token-driven pricing and availability.\nChallenges and Opportunities\nDespite the potential of decentralized networks, challenges remain. The integration of decentralized systems into existing centralized infrastructures requires seamless interoperability. Danny Newman pointed out that for overflow workloads to transition smoothly to decentralized nodes, seamless integration is crucial.\nMoreover, while centralized giants like AWS and Google continue to invest heavily in infrastructure, decentralized networks offer a competitive pricing model that could influence market dynamics. Katzin noted that decentralized networks could introduce pricing constraints, challenging the current monopolistic pricing and distribution practices.\nThe Path Forward\nAs AI infrastructure continues to develop, the roles of decentralized and centralized systems will likely evolve. The discussion among industry leaders indicates a future where both systems coexist, each contributing to a robust and flexible AI ecosystem. The potential for decentralized networks to offer innovative solutions and democratize access to AI resources is significant, promising a dynamic and competitive future for AI development.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "The use of blockchain technology to secure election results is gaining traction, as demonstrated by Screven County, Georgia, which has pioneered the adoption of the Bitcoin-based timestamping system, Simple Proof. This system was employed to anchor cryptographic hashes of election documents to Bitcoin's decentralized ledger, ensuring a tamper-evident and independently verifiable record of results, according to blog.bitfinex.com.\nRevolutionizing Election Security\nIn November 2024, Screven County became the first in the United States to secure its election results using Bitcoin's blockchain. The system, developed by Simple Proof, utilizes OpenTimestamps to create a cryptographic hash of the official results, embedding them into a Bitcoin transaction. This method ensures that results are verifiable at a specific point in time without revealing their contents, providing a tamper-proof record that is independently confirmable.\nThis innovative approach minimizes the reliance on centralized systems that are prone to manipulation and system failures, offering a decentralized verification model that enhances the transparency and integrity of the electoral process.\nLearning from Guatemala's Experience\nSimple Proof's system was previously used during Guatemala's 2023 presidential election to protect over 150,000 tally sheets amid political tension. This deployment marked a significant step in addressing trust issues in the country's election systems, which had been plagued by irregularities and technical failures in the past.\nThe system provided a verifiable audit trail, allowing independent observers and citizens to confirm the integrity of the election results, thereby strengthening public confidence in the democratic process.\nGlobal Implications for Democracy\nBy anchoring election data to a decentralized ledger like Bitcoin, governments worldwide could establish a universal standard for election verification that transcends national infrastructure differences. This model could reduce opportunities for fraud, resolve disputes more effectively, and defuse political tensions by providing independently verifiable proof of election integrity.\nBeyond elections, this technology could inspire broader reforms in public recordkeeping across various governance areas, reinforcing transparency and accountability. However, its success depends on the willingness of political authorities to embrace and support transparency.\nScreven County's adoption of this technology could serve as a blueprint for other jurisdictions, demonstrating that secure, citizen-verifiable election data is both feasible and operationally simple, potentially reshaping expectations for electoral integrity worldwide.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nUkraine is moving closer to a new bill that would legalize digital asset ownership and establish a new taxation framework for the sector.\nThe bill’s first draft is set to be presented to Ukraine’s parliament, known as the Verkhovna Rada, later this month, local outlets report. It’s expected to align the country’s digital asset regulations with the European Union’s standards, from transparency and consumer protection to anti-money laundering (AML) and licensing. Ukraine is seeking to become a member of the EU by the decade’s end, and the screening process is already underway, making it critical for its ‘crypto’ laws to reflect the region’s.\n“The preparation of a draft law on taxation of transactions with virtual assets is currently in the final stage. It is estimated that its submission for the first reading in the Verkhovna Rada is scheduled for the end of August 2025,” Danylo Hetmantsev, who heads parliament’s tax and finance committee, told one news outlet.\nThe draft bill will legalize digital asset ownership in the country, but won’t recognize them as legal tender, mirroring the direction most pro-crypto frameworks have taken. El Salvador remains the only country to give ‘crypto’ legal tender status, and it has been an epic disaster for President Nayib Bukele. The Central African Republic followed suit in 2022, but the experiment was short-lived and the law was repealed the next year.\nThe draft bill has a provision that allows Ukrainians who acquired their digital assets before it takes effect to legally declare them, paying a one-time 5% military tax and 5% personal income tax. The government arrived at the 10% combined tax after consulting with local experts and international organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), local outlets report.\n“We must provide the market with legal protection. The state must recognize those who own crypto and exchanges that carry out this activity. It must give the owners the opportunity to protect their rights because you cannot help but notice it’s too big to ignore,” Hetmantsev commented.\nHe further warned digital asset owners who choose to remain in the shadows after the new law takes effect that, as every service becomes licensed, their activity will be unearthed and they will be charged accordingly.\nA legal taxation framework could generate millions of dollars for the cash-strapped Ukrainian government amid the ongoing conflict with Russia. According to a report by Global Ledger, the government lost out on at least $200 million in ‘crypto’ taxes over the past four years from exchanges and other virtual asset service providers (VASPs). These platforms reportedly generated over $1.1 billion in profit from Ukrainian traders in that time.Ukraine’s central bank supports new law\nThe Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, Andriy Pyshnyy, has supported the new draft bill, but insists that ‘crypto‘ must not be assigned legal tender status.\n“Virtual assets cannot be a means of payment, and cannot in any way undermine the effectiveness of our monetary instruments. There should be no transfer of monetary powers and no undermining of the National Bank’s capabilities due to the legalization of virtual assets,” he stated in a recent interview.\nHe believes the new framework will take the market out of the shadows, allowing the central bank to better monitor and oversee the financial transactions involving the sector. But while Pyshnyy is eager to oversee the sector, lawmakers remain undecided on which government agency should be given jurisdiction over ‘crypto.’\nIn June, Hetmantsev, the head of the parliamentary committee on finance and taxation, said legislators are deciding between NBU, the Ministry of Digital Transformation, and the National Securities and Stock Market Commission.\nHowever, the NBU is currently the most likely to be handed authority over the sector as it’s “an institutionally capable regulator with experience in the banking and non-banking sectors,” Hetmantsev said.\nUkraine’s ‘crypto’ regulation will have a global impact given the government’s massive stash. The Eastern European nation holds 46,351 BTC, worth over $5.6 billion, which ranks only behind the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. Ukraine also recently proposed a BTC reserve, joining others like the U.S., the Czech Republic, Brazil, Poland, and more.\nWatch: Breaking down solutions to blockchain regulation hurdles",

This figure has dropped to HK$149.0 billion by the end of June, marking a significant decrease compared to the 5.8% reduction observed in the previous quarter, according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\nDelinquency and Charge-Off Ratios\nThe HKMA's report also highlights a slight increase in the combined delinquent and rescheduled ratio, which rose to 0.45% at the end of June 2025, up from 0.42% at the end of the first quarter. Despite this uptick, the quarterly charge-off ratio remains relatively low, increasing marginally to 0.64% from 0.61% in the previous quarter.\nConsumer Credit Trends\nThe decrease in credit card receivables could indicate a shift in consumer spending and credit utilization patterns within Hong Kong's economy. This trend may be reflective of broader economic conditions or consumer confidence levels, which can influence credit card usage and repayment behavior.\nComparative Analysis\nIn comparison to regional trends, Hong Kong's credit card market appears to be experiencing a more moderated adjustment in consumer credit activities. While the decrease in receivables is significant, the relatively stable delinquency and charge-off ratios suggest that credit risk remains under control.\nThe HKMA's findings provide valuable insights into the current state of consumer credit in Hong Kong, offering a glimpse into potential economic shifts and consumer behavior trends as the year progresses.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nNorway’s sovereign wealth fund, the largest state-owned fund in the world, increased its indirect BTC exposure by 192% over the last year, “underscoring BTC’s mainstream integration,” according to digital asset research company K33 Research.\nLast week, Norway’s state-owned Norges Bank published its half-year 2025 report on the ‘Government Pension Fund Global,’ the country’s sovereign wealth fund that it manages under the name of Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM).\nAfter analyzing the report, K33 Research found that the fund’s indirect BTC exposure has grown 87.7% in the past six months and 192.7% over the past year to 7,161 BTC (around $871.3 million, as of time of writing).\n“NBIM’s indirect BTC exposure has hit new ATHs [all-time highs] of 7,161 BTC,” said Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33, in an August 12 post on X. “Increased weights in core treasury vehicles such as Strategy and MARA and the overall strong BTC accumulation from treasury comps has fueled the H1 [first half of the year] growth of 3,340 BTC.”\nAccording to Lunde, the top five contributors to the fund’s increased BTC exposure were MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), a United States-based software company that owns 597,325 BTC ($72.6 billion), as of July 8; MARA (NASDAQ: MARA), an American block reward mining company that reportedly holds 50,639 BTC ($6.1 billion); Block, a U.S.-based tech company founded by Jack Dorsey that is reported to hold 8,692 BTC ($1.05 billion); digital asset exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), which owns approximately 11,776 BTC ($1.4 billion); and Metaplanet (NASDAQ: MTPLF), a Japanese blockchain company reported to hold 18,113 BTC ($2.19 billion).\nThe latter of these companies, Metaplanet, also recently released its earnings report for the second quarter of 2025, showing a surge of almost 190% year-to-date. This out-performed the 7.2% average gain posted by the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) Core 30, which tracks tech giants such Toyota (NASDAQ: TM), Sony (NASDAQ: SONY), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (NASDAQ: MHVYF).\nThe impressive performance of blockchain and digital asset-focused companies, and the increasing investment in those companies from the likes of NBIM, can be linked to the recent peaks in the price of BTC, which in turn was in large part inspired by the pro-crypto policies of U.S. President Donald Trump.\nNorway’s fund leads the way as BTC booms\nSovereign wealth funds are state-owned investment funds that governments use to invest surplus revenues and other financial reserves.\nNorway’s sovereign wealth fund, also known as the Government Pension Fund of Norway (Statens pensjonsfond), actually consists of two separate sovereign wealth funds: the Government Pension Fund Global (NBIM) and the Government Pension Fund Norway.The former currently sits at over $1.9 trillion in assets, as of June 2025, and is mandated to only invest in assets outside of Norway, while the latter is a smaller fund managed separately and limited to domestic and Nordic investments.\nNorway’s sovereign wealth fund reached this impressive size, thanks to the country’s 1969 discovery of significant oil and gas reserves in the North Sea, which has made it Western Europe’s largest producer of those fossil fuels. To ensure the whole country benefited from this natural windfall, the government imposed heavy taxes on the energy sector in the 1990s. Using some of these tax profits, along with licensing fees and profits from the state energy company, the Norwegian Parliament created the Petroleum Fund, now recognized as the sovereign wealth fund, or NBIM.\nInitially limited to investing in bonds, its mandate expanded over time to become the largest of its kind by acquiring small equity stakes in thousands of companies worldwide. Today, it is the world’s biggest single owner of listed shares.\nAmong the extensive list of foreign assets in the fund’s investment portfolio are several companies active in the blockchain and digital asset spaces, which is what gives NBIM its indirect exposure to 7,161 BTC.\nAccording to K33’s Lunde, the latest report from the fund’s manager “shows that BTC is finding its way into any well-diversified portfolio, deliberate or not.”\nMore generally, Lunde also highlighted BTC’s strong U.S. dollar-denominated gains so far this year, growing 11.9% above its January 20 peak of $109,000—inspired by the inauguration of President Trump—to reach a new all-time high of more than $123,000 in July.\nShe suggested that this new peak was again down to Trump, thanks to his executive order opening $9 trillion in 401(k) retirement plans to digital assets. The order was signed in August but rumored earlier in July, coinciding with when BTC reached its new heights.\nWatch | AI & blockchain: Why investors should look for this blend in startups",

        "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nThis post is a guest contribution by George Siosi Samuels, managing director at Faiā. See how Faiā is committed to staying at the forefront of technological advancements here.\nWhy enterprise executives must consciously manage linguistic frameworks embedded in AI\nTL;DR: Language inside Large Language Models (LLMs) is no longer a backend detail. The words, frames, and taxonomies embedded in artificial intelligence (AI) systems shape reputations, regulatory exposure, and long-term value. For enterprises navigating AI and blockchain transformation, managing the linguistic layer is now about strategic control; it’s becoming a board-level concern.\nThe overlooked power of words in AI\nFor decades, language in the enterprise world was treated as branding’s domain—something managed by marketing or PR. Code, by contrast, was engineering territory. But with the rise of LLMs—models that generate text, simulate reasoning, and drive decisions—language and code are converging. In the case of AI, words are the product.\nToday, when an AI assistant drafts a financial summary, answers a customer query, or writes a compliance memo, it’s framing reality (not just executing logic). Each word it selects carries legal, emotional, and strategic weight. And that weight compounds across scales.\nThe question is no longer, “What can the model do?” It’s, “What language is it using to do it—and who controls that language?”\nWhy linguistic frameworks now matter to the C-suite\nMost enterprise leaders already understand the implications of data governance and AI ethics. However, fewer are paying attention to a more subtle layer of control: language governance.\nThis is especially critical for professionals from regulated industries (finance, law, healthcare) or those adopting AI in consumer-facing roles. Seemingly minor word shifts—”savings opportunity” vs. “budget cut,” “assistive tool” vs. “automated agent”—can alter perception, adoption, and liability.\nSeveral macro forces are now converging to push this issue to the executive level:\n- Rising regulation. The EU AI Act has officially been passed and includes specific mandates for “general-purpose AI” and “systemic-risk AI” models. Enterprises deploying these systems must document training data sources, risk assessments, and incident response plans. Linguistic ambiguity in AI outputs—especially around safety, bias, or misinformation—will be scrutinized.\n- Reputational fragility. In the AI era, brand missteps don’t unfold over weeks—they explode in hours. A single off-brand or insensitive AI-generated response can go viral, triggering backlash and boardroom panic. We’ve already seen this with major tech platforms releasing AI features that inadvertently exposed racial bias, misinformation, or tone-deaf framing.\n- Strategic leverage. Companies that consciously frame their AI products with precise, resonant language—internally and externally—gain an edge. This applies not just to sales and adoption but also to how they are interpreted by regulators, investors, and the public.\nIf you’ve worked in enterprise tech long enough, you’ll remember the power of well-chosen metaphors: “cloud” reframed hosting, “blockchain” reframed databases, “smart contracts” reframed logic. The same pattern is now repeating with AI.\nCode as law—and language as governance\nIn legal theory, there’s an idea that code is law—a concept that gained traction in the blockchain world through smart contracts. In the AI era, that logic extends one layer up: language is governance. The terms encoded into LLMs determine how they interpret instructions, simulate reasoning, and suggest actions. If code enforces the rules, language decides the framing.\nThis places immense power in the hands of those who shape base prompts, define taxonomies, and curate training datasets. Much like how central banks manage economic tone through word choice in public briefings, AI engineers now do the same through system prompts and response design.\nAnd yet, very few enterprise leaders are even aware of the system prompts sitting behind their customer support bots, productivity tools, or internal copilots.\nWho wrote those prompts?\nWhat values are embedded in them?\nWhat terminology is being enforced—or excluded?\nWithout visibility into these questions, your enterprise is flying blind in the age of generative AI.\nRisks: compliance, credibility, and control\nLet’s get specific. Here are the three most immediate risks facing enterprises that fail to treat AI language as a strategic layer:\n- Regulatory liability. If your LLM-based system generates content that includes biased language, discriminatory framing, or factual inaccuracies, you may be held liable, especially in healthcare, finance, and government sectors. The EU AI Act and NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework both prioritize transparency and traceability of AI outputs. That includes how those outputs are worded.\n- Brand degradation. Language inconsistencies erode trust. If your AI assistant speaks in a tone that doesn’t match your brand—or worse, says something culturally or politically risky—reputation damage can be swift and severe. This is especially volatile for multinationals working across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.\n- Prompt injection and data leakage. The prompts you use to guide your models (both system and user-level) can become attack vectors. Poorly scoped language instructions may inadvertently leak internal information or enable prompt hijacking, where malicious users manipulate model behavior through crafted inputs.\nIn all of these cases, the risk stems not just from what the AI knows, but how it communicates that knowledge.\nOpportunities: trust, speed, and new moats\nNow for the flip side. If your enterprise leads on language governance, you can unlock new forms of competitive advantage.\nThe trust premium. Enterprises that can demonstrate clear, consistent, and aligned AI communication will earn trust from customers, regulators, and partners. This is akin to ESG disclosures in the sustainability era. Language stewardship is the next transparency frontier.Faster AI adoption. Internally, how you frame AI tools matters. Employees are more likely to adopt “copilots” or “advisors” than “replacements” or “automators.” Carefully chosen language reduces resistance and speeds up integration.\nLicensable taxonomies. If you’re in a domain with specialized language—medical, legal, insurance, compliance—your curated terminology becomes an asset. Enterprises can license proprietary LLMs or language layers tailored to their vertical, creating new IP and defensible moats.\nImagine a blockchain firm that licenses an “enterprise AI language layer” specifically trained on smart contract clauses, legal definitions, and jurisdictional edge cases. This is where the value lies.\nA new kind of governance playbook\nSo, what can enterprise leaders do today? Here’s a foundational governance stack for managing AI language:\n- Prompt inventory and audit. Begin by identifying every AI system you’ve deployed—public or internal—and catalog the base/system prompts driving them. This is your linguistic substrate.\n- Create a cross-functional language council. Involve Legal, Product, Brand, and InfoSec. Establish shared KPIs around “linguistic risk” and make it part of quarterly reviews. Language is no longer just a marketing concern.\n- Set up prompt version control. Every prompt—especially system prompts—should be versioned and logged. Use Git-style tracking or even blockchain-based immutability (e.g., BSV) to ensure tamper-proof audit trails.\n- Stress test language outputs. Develop adversarial testing protocols that evaluate your models’ performance in edge cases, controversial queries, or culturally nuanced scenarios. Run these tests regularly as part of your QA pipeline.\n- Establish a remediation protocol. If something goes wrong, how quickly can you trace the issue back to a prompt or a phrase? Who’s responsible for fixing it? Having a clear chain of accountability will reduce mean-time-to-remediation and regulatory exposure.\nWhy blockchain + AI matters here\nIf you’re reading this on CoinGeek, you already understand the value of transparency, provenance, and decentralized verification. These principles—core to blockchain—are now urgently needed in the world of AI.\nThink of a future where:\n- System prompts are timestamped on-chain, offering regulators and stakeholders clear audit trails.\n- Enterprise-specific taxonomies are tokenized, making language frameworks portable, licensable, and monetizable.\n- Stakeholders can verify that no prompt has been changed without record—preserving integrity in high-risk environments.\nIn short, blockchain is essential infrastructure for ethical and strategic AI deployment at scale.\nClosing thoughts: Stewardship in the digital age\nIn ancient traditions, words were sacred. Language has always shaped reality from the biblical “In the beginning was the Word” to indigenous naming rites. Today, LLMs extend that power into digital systems, workflows, and societal narratives.\nAs enterprise leaders, we now stand at a threshold.\nIf AI models become the new oracles of our time, feeding decisions across finance, law, and governance, we must ask:\n- Who is writing the scripts?\n- What language are we encoding into the systems that will advise our children, our institutions, our markets?\nWe have now moved from simple technical decisions to moral.\nAnd those who treat AI language as a strategic asset—curated, governed, and protected—will not only stay compliant. They’ll shape the future.\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership—allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

        "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nEmerging technologies, such as digital identity, and improved data exchange between police systems could disrupt the growing human trafficking industry, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI) says.\nHuman trafficking has evolved over the years, adopting the latest technology to stay beyond the grasp of the authorities. Technologies such as encrypted messaging, privacy-focused ‘crypto’ tokens, and dark web marketplaces are widely used in the sector, pushing modern slavery to the highest levels in human history.\nAccording to the Global Coalition to Fight Financial Crime, proceeds from human trafficking hit close to $500 billion, with nearly 50 million people trapped in modern-day slavery. The solution lies in technology, says the TBI, founded in 2016 by the former British Prime Minister.\n“Technology, if harnessed responsibly, can flip the equation. It can raise the risks for traffickers, cut their profits and dismantle the systems enabling exploitation at scale.”\nDigital identity is one of the technologies that can spark the most disruption, TBI says. Identity, in general, is “a crucial counterweight to exploitation.”\nDigital ID that’s easy to access would offer trafficking victims a secure way to access support. Oftentimes, the traffickers take away the physical IDs from the victims, leaving them undocumented and unable to access assistance from authorities.\nBeyond digital identity, the London-based Institute called on the United Kingdom government to prioritize the interoperability of police systems, arguing that disparate networks prevent fast and coordinated action against the traffickers. All enforcement agencies must also improve their data-sharing agreements for real-time collaborations.\nThe TBI joins several other organizations that have called for the use of the latest tech to crack down on human trafficking.\nThe Council of Europe previously published a paper calling for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies to prevent crimes and assist victims. Beyond employing these technologies, the Council called on authorities to upskill their officers as “the lack of specialist officers at the local level and the overreliance on assistance from (busy) centralised cyber-crime units are likely to create bottlenecks.”Digital ID has been touted as a key solution to empowering the vulnerable in the society. According to Richard Thompson, a manager at French tech consulting giant Sopra Steria, it guarantees that this group can access assistance and essential services in the absence of physical documents.\n“Digital ID can help capture identity information about vulnerable refugees, and victims of modern slavery and human trafficking, allowing them easier and quicker access to the essential support services that they may need,” he opined.\nIn addition to verification, digital ID ensures that aid is distributed fairly and efficiently, and that it reaches the intended recipients.\nNigeria is one of the countries utilizing digital ID in aid distribution. The Nigerian government partnered with the World Food Programme (WFP) to distribute aid to over 750,000 Nigerians, using digital ID to preserve their dignity and enhance efficiency.\nNamibia targets fully digital government by 2030\nElsewhere, the Namibian government targets a fully digital public service system by the decade’s end.\nNamibia launched its Sixth National Development Plan (NDP6) this week, outlining an ambitious development roadmap over the next five years. It focuses on four areas: economic growth, human development and community resilience, environmental sustainability, and effective governance and public service delivery.\nDigitalization is at the core of the plan. The government projects that by 2030, the digital economy’s share of the gross domestic product (GDP) will have tripled as the country gradually transitions from its overdependence on natural resources and tourism. It further intends to push its internet penetration from 53% to 90%.\nNamibia’s digitalization goals hinge on the country’s digital ID project, which is scheduled to launch in July next year. The Ministry of Home Affairs is spearheading the initiative, which it says will accelerate the country’s digital transformation.\nThe Southern African nation is also set to roll out a new digital payments system based on India’s UPI. The Bank of Namibia has signed a partnership with India’s National Payments Corporation to develop the new system, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi sealing the deal during his visit to Namibia last month.\nWatch: Digital identity, digital assets enable Web3",

        "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/nvidia-granary-dataset-multilingual-speech-ai",
        "text": "NVIDIA has unveiled a new open dataset and models aimed at advancing multilingual speech AI, addressing the limited language support in existing AI language models. The Granary dataset, alongside the NVIDIA Canary and Parakeet models, seeks to enhance speech recognition and translation capabilities for 25 European languages, including underrepresented ones such as Croatian, Estonian, and Maltese, according to NVIDIA's blog.\nGranary Dataset: A New Resource for AI Developers\nThe Granary dataset is a comprehensive collection of multilingual speech datasets, encompassing approximately a million hours of audio. This includes nearly 650,000 hours dedicated to speech recognition and over 350,000 hours for speech translation. The dataset is accessible on Hugging Face, providing a valuable resource for developers to scale AI applications globally, facilitating the creation of multilingual chatbots, customer service voice agents, and real-time translation services.\nDeveloped in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University and Fondazione Bruno Kessler, the Granary dataset utilizes NVIDIA's NeMo Speech Data Processor toolkit to transform unlabeled audio into structured, high-quality data. This innovative processing pipeline allows for enhanced public speech data without the need for extensive human annotation, making it a critical resource for AI training in the European Union's official languages, plus Russian and Ukrainian.\nIntroducing NVIDIA Canary and Parakeet Models\nThe NVIDIA Canary-1b-v2 and Parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3 models, trained on the Granary dataset, offer powerful tools for transcription and translation. Canary-1b-v2, a billion-parameter model, supports high-quality transcription of European languages and translation between English and 24 other languages. Meanwhile, Parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3, with 600 million parameters, is optimized for real-time or large-volume transcription tasks.\nBoth models are designed to provide accurate punctuation, capitalization, and word-level timestamps in their outputs. Canary-1b-v2 is particularly notable for its efficiency, offering transcription and translation quality comparable to models three times its size, while running inference up to ten times faster.\nAdvancing Speech AI Innovation\nBy sharing the methodology behind Granary and its associated models, NVIDIA is empowering the global speech AI developer community to adapt similar data processing workflows to other automatic speech recognition (ASR) or automatic speech translation (AST) models, thereby accelerating innovation in the field. The models and dataset are publicly available under a permissive license, encouraging widespread use and adaptation.\nThe Granary dataset and NVIDIA's new models represent a significant step forward in addressing the challenges of data scarcity in speech AI, particularly for languages that have been historically underrepresented in AI language models. This initiative not only broadens the scope of multilingual speech recognition and translation but also enhances the inclusivity and effectiveness of AI technologies globally.\nThe Granary dataset and models are available for exploration on Hugging Face, and further details can be accessed on NVIDIA's blog.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nHong Kong will double down on its investment in artificial intelligence (AI) after its AI system predicted the recent record-breaking rainfall 10 days in advance.\nIn early August, the city was brought to a standstill by heavy downpours that shut down schools, roads, and hospitals. According to the Hong Kong Observatory—the city’s weather forecast agency—it recorded over 14 inches of rainfall last August 5, the heaviest on record for a single day in August for 141 years.\nHowever, the city was prepared as its AI-powered systems had predicted the downpour over a week in advance, the Observatory says.\n“If we look back, one week before Tuesday, we already have several artificial intelligence models that have started capturing the progress of the particularly heavy rain this time,” its senior scientific officer, He Yuheng, told one outlet.\nThe Observatory’s AI models still need to be worked on and improved, Yuheng says. In their prediction, they were not entirely accurate in identifying the areas to be affected. The models predicted that some parts of the coast of Guangdong province would be hit by heavy rainfall, but didn’t pinpoint that Hong Kong would be the most affected.\nThe Observatory began exploring AI in mid-2023; its earliest versions were built atop the Huawei Cloud Pangu-Weather Model, and the forecasts were published on its website. In mid 2024, the department added Fuxi—an AI weather forecasting model developed by Shanghai-based Fudan University—to its arsenal to predict wind speed, humidity, temperature, and rainfall 15 days in advance.\n“Our use of artificial intelligence in predicting the weather is still at a preliminary stage,” Yuheng says, but the observatory is making rapid inroads.\nBeyond the weather, the department uses the models to predict tropical cyclones. This year alone, cyclones have claimed over 150 lives and caused massive destruction globally. The most devastating was Wipha, which originated in the Philippine Sea and caused devastation in the Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, South China, Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar. It claimed 40 lives in the Philippines and destroyed nearly $900 million in property value.\n“The prediction of the path of tropical cyclones by AI seems to be better than traditional methods,” Yuheng says. He noted that AI systems can narrow down the expected impact zone of an impending cyclone to a range of 300km, down from 500km using traditional methods.\nBesides weather prediction, Hong Kong’s Drainage Services Department also employs AI to predict floods as the city continues to experience extreme weather.\nDirector Ringo Mok told one local outlet that the department has installed over 300 monitors across the city to collect rainfall data. It then uses AI to analyze the data in real time, with the models assessing the scope of the flooding and allowing the department to react promptly.South Korea invests $9m in blockchain pilots\nElsewhere, South Korea has allocated over $9 million to support blockchain projects across virtual healthcare, transport, and battery tracking for electric vehicles.\nThe Ministry of Science and ICT recently announced the investment to integrate blockchain into day-to-day services to boost transparency and efficiency and cut costs. The ministry is working with the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) on the initiative, local outlets report.\nOne of the investments is in a blockchain-powered virtual healthcare service, and it’s spearheaded by the Korea Health Industry Development Institute. The system will integrate the latest advancements in digital healthcare, from telemedicine and digital transcriptions to drug delivery systems and electronic insurance claims, all underpinned by blockchain for security and efficiency.\nIn Busan, the ministry will invest in a blockchain system to track the lifecycle of electronic vehicle (EV) batteries across production, distribution, usage, and disposal. The project will initially work with 2,500 EVs and their battery manufacturers in the pilot phase before expanding to more vehicles and other regions.\nIn the first half of the year, EV sales accounted for 20% of all new car sales in South Korea as tax incentives and subsidies push more South Koreans away from fuel-powered cars.\nOther blockchain projects receiving the funding target carbon credit trading in the transport industry, ticketing, and the food supply chain.\nSouth Korea invests heavily in emerging tech to compete with runaway leaders in China and the U.S. Last week, it announced a new 500 billion won ($380 million) initiative to support the AI sector. It also established a new task force to champion the sector’s agenda, led by some of its biggest tech firms, from Naver and LG to SK Telecom and NC AI.\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership—allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

        "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nTwo recently published studies have revealed that generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including large language models (LLMs) ChatGPT and Gemini, produce misinformation and bias when used for medical information and healthcare decision-making.\nIn the United States, researchers from a medical school at Mount Sinai published a study on August 2 showing that LLMs were highly vulnerable to repeating and elaborating on “false facts” and medical misinformation.\nMeanwhile, across the Atlantic, the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) published a study shortly afterward that found AI tools used by more than half of England’s councils are downplaying women’s physical and mental health issues, creating a risk of gender bias in care decisions.\nMedical AI\nLLMs, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, are AI-based computer programs that generate text using large datasets of information on which they are trained.\nThe power and performance of such technology have increased exponentially over the past few years, with billions of dollars being spent on research and development in the area. LLMs and AI tools are now being deployed across almost every industry, to different extents, not least in the medical and healthcare sector.\nIn the medical space, AI is already being used for various functions, such as reducing the administrative burden by automatically generating and summarizing case notes, assisting in diagnostics, and enhancing patient education.\nHowever, LLMs are prone to the “garbage in, garbage out” problem, relying on accurate, factual data making up their training material or they may reproduce the errors and bias in the datasets. This results in what is often known as “hallucinations,” which is the generation of content that is irrelevant, made-up, or inconsistent with the input data.\nIn a medical context, these hallucinations can include fabricated information and case details, invented research citations, or made-up disease details.\nUS study shows chatbots spreading false medical information\nEarlier this month, researchers from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai published a paper titled “multi-model assurance analysis showing large language models are highly vulnerable to adversarial hallucination attacks during clinical decision support.”\nThe study aimed to test a subset of AI hallucinations that arise from “adversarial attacks,” in which made-up details embedded in prompts lead the model to reproduce or elaborate on the false information.\n“Hallucinations pose risks, potentially misleading clinicians, misinforming patients, and harming public health,” said the paper. “One source of these errors arises from deliberate or inadvertent fabrications embedded in user prompts—an issue compounded by many LLMs’ tendency to be overly confirmatory, sometimes prioritizing a persuasive or confident style over factual accuracy.”\nTo explore this issue, the researchers tested six LLMs: DeepSeek Distilled, GPT4o, llama-3.3-70B, Phi-4, Qwen-2.5-72B, and gemma-2-27b-it, with 300 pieces of text similar to clinical notes written by doctors, but each containing a single fake laboratory test, physical or radiological sign, or medical condition. They were tested under “default” (standard settings) as well as with “mitigating prompts” designed to reduce hallucinations, generating 5,400 outputs. If a model elaborated on the fabricated detail, the case was classified as a “hallucination.”\nThe results showed that hallucination rates ranged from 50% to 82% across all models and prompting methods. The use of mitigating prompts lowered the average hallucination rate, but only from 66% without to 44% with a mitigating prompt.\n“We find that the LLM models repeat or elaborate on the planted error in up to 83% of cases,” reported the researchers. “Adopting strategies to prevent the impact of inappropriate instructions can half the rate but does not eliminate the risk of errors remaining.”\nThey added that “our results highlight that caution should be taken when using LLM to interpret clinical notes.”\nAccording to the paper, the best-performing model was GPT-4o, whose hallucination rates declined from 53% to 23% when mitigating prompts were used.\nHowever, with even the best-performing model producing potentially harmful hallucinations in almost a quarter of cases—even with mitigating prompts—the researchers concluded that AI models cannot yet be trusted to provide accurate and trustworthy medical data.\n“LLMs are highly susceptible to adversarial hallucination attacks, frequently generating false clinical details that pose risks when used without safeguards,” said the paper. “While prompt engineering reduces errors, it does not eliminate them… Adversarial hallucination is a serious threat for real‑world use, warranting careful safeguards.”\nThe Mount Sinai study isn’t the only recent paper published in the U.S. medical space that has brought into question the use of AI.In another damaging example, on August 5, the Annals of Internal Medicine journal reported a case of a 60-year-old man who developed bromism, also known as bromide toxicity, after consulting ChatGPT on how to remove salt from his diet. According to advice from the LLM, the man swapped sodium chloride (table salt) for sodium bromide, which was used as a sedative in the early 20th century, resulting in the rare condition.\nBut it’s not just the stateside that AI advice is taking a PR hit.\nUK study finds gender bias in LLMs\nWhile U.S. researchers were finding less-than-comforting results when testing whether LLMs reproduce false medical information, across the pond a United Kingdom study was turning up equally troubling results related to AI bias.\nOn August 11, a research team from LSE, led by Dr Sam Rickman, published their paper on “evaluating gender bias in large language models in long-term care,” in which they evaluated gender bias in summaries of long-term care records generated with two open-source LLMs, Meta’s (NASDAQ: META) Llama 3 and Google’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Gemma.\nIn order to test this, the study created gender-swapped versions of long-term care records for 617 older people from a London local authority and asked the LLMs to generate summaries of male and female versions of the records.\nWhile Llama 3 showed no gender-based differences across any metrics, Gemma displayed significant differences.\nSpecifically, male summaries focused more on physical and mental health issues. Language used for men was also more direct, while women’s needs were “downplayed” more often than men’s. For example, when Google’s Gemma was used to generate and summarize the same case notes for men and for women, language such as “disabled,” “unable,” and “complex” appeared significantly more often in descriptions of men than women.\nIn other words, the study found that similar care needs in women were more likely to be omitted or described in less severe terms by specific AI tools, and that this downplaying of women’s physical and mental health issues risked creating gender bias in care decisions.\n“Care services are allocated on the basis of need. If women’s health issues are underemphasized, this may lead to gender-based disparities in service receipt,” said the paper. “LLMs may offer substantial benefits in easing administrative burden. However, the findings highlight the variation in state-of-the-art LLMs, and the need for evaluation of bias.”\nDespite the concerns raised by the study, the researchers also highlighted the benefits AI can provide to the healthcare sector.\n“By automatically generating or summarizing records, LLMs have the potential to reduce costs without cutting services, improve access to relevant information, and free up time spent on documentation,” said the paper.\nIt went on to note that “there is political will to expand such technologies in health and care.”\nDespite flaws, UK’s all-in on AI\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer recently pledged £2 billion ($2.7 billion) to expand Britain’s AI infrastructure, with the funding targeting data center development and digital skills training. This included committing £1 billion ($1.3 billion) of funding to scale up the U.K.’s compute power by a factor of 20.\n“We’re going to bring about great change in so many aspects of our lives,” said Starmer, speaking to London Tech Week on June 9. He went on to highlight health as an area “where I’ve seen for myself the incredible contribution that tech and AI can make.”\n“I was in a hospital up in the Midlands, talking to consultants who deal with strokes. They showed me the equipment and techniques that they are using – using AI to isolate where the clot is in the brain in a micro-second of the time it would have taken otherwise. Brilliantly saving people’s lives,” said the Prime Minister. “Shortly after that, I had an incident where I was being shown AI and stethoscopes working together to predict any problems someone might have. So whether it’s health or other sectors, it’s hugely transformative what can be done here.”\nIt’s unclear how, or if, the LSE study and its equally AI-critical U.S. counterparts may affect such commitments from the government, but for now the U.K. at least seems set on pursuing the advantages AI tools such as LLMs can provide across the public and private sector.\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership—allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

        "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nNobody knows whether America’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will grow beyond its current limits, and that includes the people supposedly in charge of it.\n- Treasury secretary’s reserve comments disappoint\n- Bullish IPO bulls over expectations\n- Justin Sun sues Bloomberg\n- Justin’s net worth exposed\n- Trumps talk debanking\n- De-debanking fight is never over\n- Google stumbles into crypto wallet minefield\nBTC hit a new all-time high of $124,128 on Wednesday, spurred by (a) rumors that a new ‘treasury’ firm was buying up hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of the tokens, and (b) suggestions that Washington planned a new round of ‘quantitative easing,’ aka flooding the system with new money to give the flagging economy a lift.\nBut the euphoria was short-lived, as BTC dropped below $118,000 by early Thursday. The buzzkill was blamed on a variety of factors, including higher than expected inflation figures dashing hopes of a cut in U.S. interest rates.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s Thursday morning appearance on Fox Business didn’t help, as he emphatically ruled out the possibility that the federal government will use its bottomless checkbook to buy more BTC for the country’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.\nThe Reserve concept was announced in March, along with a separate Digital Asset Stockpile to be comprised of tokens other than BTC. The foundations of each were to be based on tokens already in the government’s possession through seizures and forfeitures, but the feds left open the possibility of adding additional BTC to the Reserve if it could be done in a ‘budget-neutral’ fashion.\nIn July, the White House released a report prepared by the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets (aka the ‘crypto council’) detailing a number of policy proposals. But the 166-page document contained no new information regarding any BTC acquisition plans, leaving BTC maximalists crestfallen, as government purchases were expected to light a fire under BTC’s fiat value.\nOn Thursday, Bessent referenced the Reserve and clarified that the government was “not going to be buying that, but we are going to use confiscated assets and continue to build that up.” Bessent somewhat cushioned this blow by adding that the government was “going to stop selling” any BTC already in its possession. Bessent claimed the Reserve’s BTC was worth “somewhere between $15 billion and $20 billion.”\nHowever, after his comments caused much gnashing of teeth among BTC maxis, Bessent tweeted that Treasury is “committed to exploring budget-neutral pathways to acquire more Bitcoin to expand the reserve, and to execute on the President’s promise to make the United States the ‘Bitcoin superpower of the world.’” In other words, nobody knows anything, not even the people running this show. As you were.\nAhead of the release of the White House report, Working Group exec director Bo Hines had on multiple occasions offered vague allusions to government efforts to identify ‘budget neutral’ BTC acquisition methods. But on August 9, Hines announced that he was stepping down from the Working Group based on his desire to “return to the private sector.”\nHines later told Crypto in America that he was “confident” the budget-neutral efforts to build the Reserve “will continue and accelerate” under his replacement, deputy director Patrick Witt. Like Hines, Witt is a former college football player and a failed GOP Congressional candidate. Also like Hines, Witt has yet to offer any specifics on how the Reserve might grow beyond its current confines.\nBullish Global bulls over skeptics in Nasdaq debut\nOn August 13, Bullish Global (NASDAQ: BLSH) made its debut on the Nasdaq after twice upsizing its expected returns. Initially looking to raise $629 million, this was quickly boosted to $990 million before settling on $1.1 billion at a value of $37 per share. The initial public offering (IPO) price gives Bullish a valuation of $5.4 billion.\nShares in Bullish, which operates the digital asset exchange of the same name as well as the Coindesk media outlet, rose as high as high as $118 before closing Wednesday’s trading at $70, nearly doubling its IPO price. The gains continued on Thursday, closing at $74.63.\nInvestor excitement over Bullish mirrors that of other recent crypto IPOs like USDC stablecoin-issuer Circle (NASDAQ: CRCL), which more than doubled its share price on its opening day (although that price has fallen by nearly one-third over the past month). This has other crypto operators who are preparing their own IPOs salivating like hungry dogs in expectation of some major bones thrown their way.\nThis category includes the Gemini and Kraken exchanges and payment/trading platform Uphold, although other prospective filers are more likely to come off the bench and declare their intentions.\nJustin Sun sues Bloomberg\nNot all crypto IPOs have surpassed expectations. TRON, the stock representing the blockchain of the same name, stumbled out of the gate in late July. While the stock briefly soared before closing its opening day at $8.74, the shares closed Thursday down 2.5% to $6.98.\nTRON is controlled by Justin Sun, a controversial figure who revealed this week that he’s suing the Bloomberg news agency for publishing details of his vast crypto wealth.\nThe suit, filed on August 11 in the U.S. District Court of the District of Delaware, seeks to stop Bloomberg from “recklessly and improperly disclosing [Sun’s] highly confidential, sensitive, private, and proprietary financial information.” Sun alleges that he will “suffer significant and irreparable harm—both financially and physically—if this sensitive financial information is published.”\nSun’s attorneys claim Bloomberg journo Muyao Shen contacted him in February regarding their annual Billionaires Index of the world’s richest people. Sun claims to have received “explicit assurances” that the financial information he supplied would be held “strictly confidential.”\nSun claims to have “understood, based on Ms. Shen’s assurances, that his cryptocurrency holdings would be reported as a single lump sum amount.” But on July 29, Sun’s team was sent an advance draft of his Billionaires Index profile that contained “the specific amounts of cryptocurrencies owned” by Sun.\nSun’s team sent Bloomberg a cease-and-desist letter, claiming that publishing the data will allow “bad actors” to identify his digital wallets and make him a “considerable target” for theft, extortion, and physical attack. Sun’s team sought a temporary restraining order (TRO), as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions to prevent Bloomberg from publishing Sun’s data.\nBloomberg’s attorneys filed a response with the court on August 12, calling Sun’s action “moot” because the media outlet wasn’t sent Sun’s notice of the TRO until two hours after it published the information. Regardless, Bloomberg says it will fight Sun’s “prior restraint” efforts, saying Sun failed to show irreparable harm, that a TRO would “gravely disserve the public interest,” and “the law and the facts are clear that Bloomberg breached no promise to him.”Sun’s team filed a transcript of a group chat involving his minions and Bloomberg journos, in which Sun tries to impose strict limits (after the fact) on how the outlet can use the data he supplied. However, Bloomberg writer Tom Maloney states in this chat that “nobody at Bloomberg agreed to the terms sent by Justin, weeks after the data was shared with us.”\nSo what’s Justin worth?\nFor the record, Bloomberg puts Sun’s net worth at $12.3 billion, a sum that was over $1 billion higher when the year began. However, Bloomberg’s ‘confidence rating’ in these figures ranked a mere single star out of a possible five.\nAt any rate, Sun’s token haul is said to include 60 billion TRX (Tron’s native token), to which Bloomberg applied a 75% liquidity discount “because Sun controls the majority [over 60%] of its supply.” Sun also owns ~17,000 BTC, ~224,000 ETH, and 700,000 USDT (Tether). Bloomberg notes that it didn’t include tokens held on exchanges because these couldn’t be verified.\nSun also owns 90% of the HTX exchange “based on information provided by his representatives in May 2025.” This is notable because Sun has repeatedly denied ownership of HTX (formerly Huobi), claiming he’s only an adviser. Sun also acquired the BitTorrent file-sharing platform in 2014 for $140 million.\nThe TRON DAO issued a blog post on August 12 that largely rehashes the TRO application claims, while adding a complaint that Bloomberg’s reporting “attributes to Mr. Sun cryptocurrency holdings he has never owned, controlled or had any beneficial interest in, and fails to report cryptocurrency holdings he does own.” For instance, “the value of Mr. Sun’s holdings of BTC is multiples of TRX.” Good to know.\nTrumps still not over being debanked\nBloomberg didn’t include any reference to Sun’s $75 million worth of WLFI, the governance token of the Trump-linked decentralized finance (DeFi) project World Liberty Financial (WLF). A recent vote by WLFI holders has cleared the way for the token to be tradable on both centralized and decentralized exchanges (DEX), possibly as early as the end of this month.\nThe recent $1.5 billion deal between WLF and ALT5 Sigma put the first public valuation on WLFI at around 20¢, a 13x premium on its initial selling price of 1.5¢. At that multiple, Sun’s $75 million WLFI haul could be worth closer to $1 billion.\nWhile rumors of the ALT5-WLF deal sent ALT5’s stock soaring last week, the shares quickly surrendered those gains and then some, falling to $5.90. The shares closed Thursday at $7.21, up 3.6% from Wednesday, but only slightly higher than their pre-rumor price.\nPresident Trump’s sons, Eric and Don Jr., are both WLF co-founders and Eric was named a director of ALT5 as part of their deal. The two Trumps rang the Nasdaq’s opening bell on Wednesday after visiting Fox News with fellow WLF co-founder Zach Witkoff to discuss their blockbuster deal, which will see ALT5 buy 7.5% of the total supply of WLFI as part of its new ‘treasury’ strategy.\nDon Jr. seemed less interested in talking up WLF/ALT5 than discussing the alleged ‘debanking’ that the Trump family endured following the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, and how this pushed the family into the arms of crypto.\nEric claimed Capital One “stripped 300 bank accounts from me … after doing business for 20-something years … this happened across the board.” Eric singled out JPMorgan Chase (NASDAQ: JPM), Bank of America (BOA), and First Republic as among those who targeted not only the Trump family for debanking but “conservatives all over the country.”\nDe-debanking is never really over\nWith a personal stake in this matter, President Trump was only too eager to issue an executive order this month prohibiting federal agencies from enacting policies that allow banks to “deny or restrict services” to, well, anybody. The order was a bit redundant, given that federal financial regulators had already rescinded the guidance that permitted institutions to refuse clients based on ‘reputational risk.’\nThis regulatory dragon slain, the debanking posse turned its attention to a new threat: banks looking to impose new fees for accessing customer account data. Recent weeks have seen JPMorgan announce plans to impose fees on data aggregators who serve as bank-to-fintech bridges and who’ve previously enjoyed fee-free access to this customer information.\nA joint effort by the fintech/crypto sectors appeared to have convinced the Trump administration to halt plans to relax the rules that would have permitted JPMorgan and other banks to impose the fees. But like horror movie fans who’ve seen the supposedly vanquished villain suddenly rise from the dead, JPMorgan’s foes want to make sure these fees stay down for the count.\nThis week saw further pleas to President Trump by a long list of supplicants—including Gemini, Kraken, PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), Stripe, Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD), Swedish fintech Klarna Group and representatives of venture capital groups Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Paradigm—urging him to “use the full power of your office and the broader administration to prevent the largest institutions from raising new barriers to financial freedom.”\nGoogle wanders into crypto wallet minefield\nFinally, crypto operators continue to lobby the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on how best to implement its Project Crypto list of proposed reforms of U.S. securities rules. Among the recent filings was a joint submission by a16z and the DeFi Education Fund that seeks a ‘safe harbor’ for DeFi developers from the broker registration requirements of U.S. securities law.\nThe submission singles out devs involved in “certain trading interfaces provided via a website or application that enable users to interact with blockchains and smart contract protocols.” Specifically, apps “that function as technical infrastructure that enable users to arrange transactions themselves.”\nGiven that this definition includes non-custodial wallets, you can imagine the collective crypto freakout on August 13, when Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) abruptly announced that digital wallet apps would only be allowed in the Google Play marketplace “if the app complies with local laws and industry standards.”\nFor U.S. wallet apps, that meant developers “must be either (a) registered with FinCEN [the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network] as a Money Services Business and with a state as a money transmitter or (b) a federal or state chartered bank entity.”\nDeFi’s perpetual martyrs quickly broke out their social media pitchforks and torches, claiming that Operation ChokePoint 3.0 was underway and urging President Trump to unleash Seal Team Six on Google’s executive headquarters. A suitably chastened Google swiftly issued a clarification that non-custodial wallets were “out of scope” of these new rules.\nBreathing easier today are Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who just launched a self-custodial wallet ahead of the launch of its new DeFi platform, Gemini Onchain. Nobody tell Google.\nWatch: RockWallet is the go-to app for everyone",

        "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nVisa (NASDAQ: V) has launched a new digital payment pilot for small and medium enterprise freight forwarders, with the first transaction completed at the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA).\nVisa partnered with the Shanghai Commercial Bank and the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) for the pilot, which it says is the first of its kind in the industry.\nThe pilot targets payments made by co-loading businesses, where multiple freight forwarders team up and combine their shipments to cut costs and optimize airline capacity. Co-loading has become increasingly common with the advent of new tech-powered logistics tools that enable collaboration. Environmental concerns have also played a part, with freight forwarders encouraged to fully utilize cargo space.\nThe pilot introduces a new card-based payments system with real-time, pre-authorized payments backed by verified cargo data. It seeks to curb fraud risk and payment delay and eliminate manual reconciliation, which is time-consuming and prone to error.\n“Together with our partners, we are helping SMEs to unlock liquidity, streamline reconciliation, and give them greater control over cash flow by linking verified cargo data with financial flows,” commented Visa Hong Kong General Manager Paulina Leong.\n“This pilot marks a significant milestone in driving efficiency through payment innovation along the supply chain—a powerful example of Hong Kong’s leadership as a global hub.”\nPayments along the global supply chain remain slow and costly despite the rise of financial technology solutions in every other sector. Blockchain technology has been touted as the solution, with several pilots underway in the trade finance sector.\nWhile it’s not integrating blockchain just yet, Visa says its new solution will provide a “reliable, tamper-proof source of truth” that eliminates chargebacks. It will utilize AAHK’s Cargo Data Platform for data-driven lending decisions and real-time shipment verification, which guarantees that payment is only made upon verification of shipment delivery.\nThe San Francisco-based giant adds that the new solution will improve cash flow for SMEs by extending payment terms to buyers by up to 85 days while cutting down sellers’ Day Sales Outstanding to an average of 3 days.\n“By integrating digital payment solutions with our HKIA Cargo Data Platform, we are enabling faster, more transparent and secure trade flows, and inducing more business opportunities to Hong Kong air cargo industry players under effective risk management,” commented Irene Lau, the general manager at AAHK.In 2024, the Hong Kong International Airport retained its title as the world’s busiest cargo airport, handling 4.9 million tons. In the last 15 years, HKIA has held the title a staggering 14 times, losing out at the height of the COVID pandemic to Memphis International Airport.\nAs the world’s second-largest card payment network, Visa remains one of the top innovators in the field and is actively involved in dozens of pilots for new payment tech.\nIn the blockchain world, it’s taking the lead in stablecoin integrations and tokenization. In April, it partnered with Stripe-owned Bridge to debut a new line of cards that allows users to pay using their stablecoins.\nMalaysia’s Maybank partners Microsoft for digital transformation\nStill in Asia, Malaysia’s largest lender, Maybank, has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) for its digital transformation journey.\nThe bank will integrate Microsoft’s products across artificial intelligence (AI), cloud infrastructure, collaboration, and security in a deal worth RM1 billion ($236 million) over the next five years.\nMaybank will transition its 44,000 employees to Microsoft 365 Copilot to enhance their efficiency and improve the customer experience with AI tools. It will also switch to Microsoft Azure as its cloud services provider for real-time data analytics.\n“This strategic partnership with Microsoft is a leap forward in our digital transformation journey beyond our M25+ strategy. It’s not just about technology; it’s about thinking ahead on how we can better serve our customers, improving our ways of working, and accelerating innovations,” commented CEO Dato’ Sri Khairussaleh Ramli.\nWith over 22 million clients across its home country, Singapore and Indonesia, Maybank is Malaysia’s largest bank and the fifth-largest in Southeast Asia. It joins other leading banks in the region in integrating AI tools to boost productivity and customer experience while cutting costs.\nThe region’s largest bank—Singapore’s DBS—now runs 1,600 AI models and 350 tools, and it claims they generated $622 million last year. DBS says that up to 4,000 temporary jobs will be lost to AI over the next three years.\nWatch: Richard Baker on engineering a smarter financial world with blockchain",

The transition is scheduled for August 23, 2025, at 02:00 UTC, according to a recent announcement by the company.\nMigration Details and Expectations\nThe migration is expected to introduce a host of improvements, primarily aimed at increasing the number of active market-making participants on the platform. This strategic move is anticipated to enhance liquidity across BitMEX's range of contracts, providing a more efficient trading environment for users.\nTemporary Service Downtime\nTo facilitate the migration, BitMEX has announced a temporary service downtime. All services will be unavailable from 02:00 to 14:00 UTC on the day of the migration. This downtime is necessary to ensure a smooth transition of the infrastructure from one location to another.\nFuture Implications\nThe decision to relocate the datacentre to Tokyo aligns with BitMEX's strategy to leverage the robust technological infrastructure of AWS Tokyo. This move is expected to not only improve system performance but also enhance the overall user experience by reducing latency and increasing transaction speeds.\nFor more information, the official announcement can be found on the BitMEX blog.\nImage source: Shutterstock",

        "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nThe American Bankers Association and equivalents from all 50 states plus Puerto Rico and D.C. have written to Senate lawmakers urging them to close loopholes created by the GENIUS Act, the U.S.’s landmark stablecoin legislation.\nThe letter was sent to Congress as lawmakers consider digital asset market structure legislation, a draft form of which was released by the Senate in July.\n“As Congress advances efforts to establish a clear digital asset market structure, the undersigned state bankers associations respectfully call attention to the recommendations outlined below,” it read.\nIt identifies three key loopholes and presents suggested solutions to each.\nOne of the complaints involves the GENIUS Act’s prohibition on stablecoin issuers offering yield on payment stablecoins. The bankers praise the prohibition in principle, but argue that it doesn’t go far enough because exchanges can still offer yield products based on stablecoin holdings.\n“Banks power the economy by turning deposits into loans; when deposits flow into stablecoins chasing yield, credit creation suffers. To close this loophole and protect the financial system, we urge Congress to extend the stablecoin issuers interest prohibition to cover digital asset exchanges, brokers, dealers, and affiliated entities,” the letter said.\nThe signatories also ask for the repeal of section 16(d) of the GENIUS Act, which permits out-of-state chartered institutions to provide services across state lines without the approval of the local state authority:\n“States have both the constitutional authority and practical responsibility to license and supervise financial institutions that serve their residents. Congress should repeal section 16(d) to reaffirm states’ ability to protect consumers and ensure a level playing field for all institutions operating within their borders.”\nLastly, the latter asks that lawmakers close a loophole created by GENIUS whereby non-financial companies can act as stablecoin issuers. Under GENIUS, non-financial public companies are prohibited from issuing stablecoins, but it gives authority to the new interagency Stablecoin Certification Review Committee (SCRC) to grant exceptions.“Any approval path poses serious risks and marks a major shift in federal policy that demands additional public scrutiny. We urge Congress to strengthen this prohibition by eliminating all approval pathways and including non-financial private companies. Allowing such special treatment for certain companies risks regulatory arbitrage and undermines longstanding safeguards in financial regulation.”\nThe letter concludes by stressing the need for legislation to ensure that the digital asset industry “develops in a way that supports—not disrupts—the broader financial system.”\nThe letter comes as part of what is becoming an inflection point for the digital asset industry. The White House’s mammoth digital assets report, released last week, set regulators, lawmakers, and industry players scrambling to assimilate the vast recommendations. At the same time, the Senate’s digital asset market structure bill was released in late July, setting a deadline of August 5 for feedback.\nSee the full letter here.\nWatch: Blockchain is much more than digital assets",

        "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nThe rise of dollar-denominated stablecoins is spoiling Europe’s plans to shore up its euro currency, while China’s tentative stablecoin embrace is being exploited by mainland scammers.\n- EU central bank warns of dollar-denominated stablecoin threat\n- Deutsche Bank euro-denominated stablecoin launches\n- China pumps brakes on stablecoin enthusiasm\n- Coinbase revives ‘bootstrap’ fund to boost USDC\n- Tether CEO not sure if he likes Circle CEO\nOn July 31, European Central Bank (ECB) market infrastructure & payments adviser Jürgen Schaaf released a blog post warning of the threat that dollar-denominated stablecoins pose to European monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Schaaf believes “Europe must take decisive action to emerge stronger from these turbulent times.”\nSchaaf defines stablecoins as “a bridge between volatile digital assets and traditional monetary systems … functioning as a blockchain-based money equivalent which is liquid, globally transferable, and perceived as a stable and solid store of value.”\nSchaaf notes that dollar-denominated tokens account for 99% of the overall stablecoin market cap of $271 billion, most of which consists of Tether’s USDT and Circle’s (NASDAQ: CRCL) USDC. Meanwhile, the market cap of euro-denominated stablecoins like Circle’s EURC and Stasis Euro’s EURS represents only ~0.2% of that total. Tether discontinued support for its EURT stable last year as a response to the European Union imposing its Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA).\nSchaaf spotlights the “potentially far reaching” impact of the “emerging regulatory divergence” between the suddenly stablecoin-positive U.S.—which approved the GENIUS Act last month—and Europe’s stricter MiCA framework. In the United States, tradfi payment giants like Visa (NASDAQ: V) and Mastercard (NASDAQ: MA) have begun integrating stablecoins into their operations, while a growing number of corporate giants are exploring the possibility of doing likewise.\nSchaaf believes that if dollar-denominated stables make further encroachments on euro territory, “whether for payments, savings or settlement, the ECB’s control over monetary conditions could be weakened.” Schaaf notes that the experience of dollarized economies shows that this process can be hard to reverse.\nFurther flows of dollar-denominated stablecoins into areas like cross-border transactions and tokenized settlements “may cement their early dominance.” Barring the arrival of “credible euro alternatives,” the U.S. will enjoy “strategic and economic advantages, allowing it to finance its debt more cheaply while exerting global influence.” Europe could face “higher financing costs relative to the United States, reduced monetary policy autonomy and geopolitical dependency.”\nSchaaf urges the EU to offer more support to “properly regulated” euro-denominated stables that “serve legitimate market needs,” including “reinforc[ing] the international role of the euro.”\nSchaaf sees the digital euro as “a robust line of defence of European monetary strategy” but believes “stronger global coordination on stablecoin regulation is pivotal … If we forgo a common approach, we risk fuelling instability, regulatory arbitrage and global U.S. dollar dominance.”\nSchaaf isn’t the only one sounding the alarm. A few weeks prior to his report, the pan-European Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) warned of the threat posed by America’s “crypto-mercantilism.” This threat includes limiting the monetary sovereignty of the EU’s economic trade partners, particularly those with “low levels of financial inclusion and unstable currencies” that make their economies more susceptible to dollarization.\nThe fact that many technology giants call the U.S. home is contributing to the spread of dollar-denominated stablecoins, as the U.S. appears eager to “leverage the strength of its crypto industry as well as its dominance in online commerce and social media.”\nThe CEPR report didn’t advise the EU to follow America’s lead by weakening MiCA’s standards. Instead, it suggests that policymakers “actively support payment multilateralism by facilitating cross-border transactions between central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and fast payment systems.”\nThe CEPR went as far as to suggest that the ECB should “keep a close eye on the use of dollar-pegged stablecoins in the EU and limit their circulation if necessary.”\nDeutsche Bank launches EURAU\nDespite opinions that this stablecoin dollar v. euro ship hasn’t yet sailed, three different ECB officials told Politico that the organization’s Governing Council ‘remains skeptical’ of welcoming stablecoins into traditional finance. This appears to echo the recent position of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) that stablecoins “fall short of the requirements to be the mainstay of the monetary system” and “may at best serve a subsidiary role” in global finance.\nStill, some EU institutions are giving it the old college try. July 31 saw the official launch of EURAU, Germany’s first MiCA-compliant/BaFin-regulated euro-denominated stablecoin. EURAU is the product of AllUnity, the joint venture of Deutsche Bank’s (NASDAQ: DB) asset management wing DWS, Galaxy Digital, and market-maker Flow Traders.\nEURAU is an Ethereum ERC-20 token, but it will launch on other networks later this year. Bullish Europe—the EU offshoot of Bullish Global (NASDAQ: BLSH), which debuted on the Nasdaq on August 13—is the first exchange to offer EURAU trading.\nEchoing the wider EU concerns, AllUnity CEO Alexander Höptner called EURAU “a significant step forward for Europe’s digital financial infrastructure and financial sovereignty.”\nChina rethinks stablecoin hype\nDollarization concerns aren’t limited to Europe, as China has indicated a desire to launch an ‘offshore’ yuan-based stablecoin to boost the use of its domestic currency abroad, particularly in nations in which Belt & Road Initiative projects are underway.\nLast month, state-run media in Shanghai reported on an offshore yuan stablecoin project involving Chinese blockchain firm Conflux, digital security firm Eastcompeace Technology Co, Hong Kong fintech Anchor X, and digital wallet TokenPocket. However, that report appears to have been deleted as the link now redirects to the Shanghai municipal government’s home page.\nLast week, Bloomberg reported that leading Chinese brokerages and think tanks had received ‘guidance’ from financial regulators to cancel stablecoin-related seminars and refrain from issuing stablecoin-based research and/or making public comments on stablecoins.While neither the China Securities Regulatory Commission nor the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) would comment on the report, China’s leadership reportedly wants to cool the buzz around stablecoins that has surged in recent months.\nIronically, this fire was fanned by PBoC governor Pan Gonsheng, who in June told a Shanghai forum audience that stablecoins were “reshaping the traditional payment infrastructure” and China couldn’t afford to ignore these changes.\nIn July, the director of Shanghai’s State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) declared that regulators need to show “greater sensitivity to emerging technologies and enhanced research into digital currencies.”\nBut Reuters reported last week that the post from SASAC’s WeChat account that contained details of this speech appears to have been deleted. And the Financial Times reported this week that, behind the scenes, financial regulators have been reminding stakeholders that stablecoins cannot be allowed to facilitate evasion of China’s strict capital controls.\nThis sudden skittishness is reportedly due to a rush of illicit fundraising activities in mainland China. According to official channels, scammers have “taken advantage of the fact that the public’s understanding of new financial concepts is still incomplete.” Anyone with knowledge of entities “engaging in illegal fundraising activities under the guise of investing in stablecoins” is asked to report them to local authorities.\nOn August 11, state-run media reported that China Rare Earth Group had refuted rumors that it had teamed up with the PBoC and Ant Group on a “rare earth yuan stablecoin.” Ant Group issued a similar statement, urging the public to exercise caution when pitched on digital asset projects.\nHong Kong has led China’s embrace of digital assets this year, issuing 11 exchange licenses and over 40 other permits allowing companies to trade digital assets on behalf of clients.\nHong Kong also passed its Stablecoin Ordinance in May that took effect on August 1, but the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) recently warned that it plans to issue only “a handful of stablecoin issuer licenses,” at least, during the rollout’s initial phase. Five entities, including banks and online retailers, were selected to participate in the city-state’s stablecoin sandbox, but the first licenses aren’t expected to be issued until early 2026.\nThe Ordinance doesn’t single out a specific currency in which HKMA-approved stablecoins must be based, saying only that they must be linked to an “official currency.” So far, the HKMA says applicants have expressed interest in USD and Hong Kong Dollars (HKD), but HKD stables can only be issued outside Hong Kong.\nCoinbase revives stablecoin bootstrap fund to boost USDC\nStateside, Bernstein analysts have pegged Circle as most likely to become the dominant stablecoin network. Despite USDT’s $165 billion market cap dwarfing USDC’s $66.4 billion, the analysts claim “the most liquid, regulated stablecoin will win.”\nCircle easily has the claim on ‘most regulated,’ at least, compared to Tether, which may give USDC a U.S. advantage. But it remains to be seen whether Circle can make up ground on Tether’s significant headstart on the global stage.\nTo boost their respective profiles, both Circle and Tether are preparing to launch their own stable-specific payment networks. Other players are building out similar infrastructure in a bid to upend this stablecoin duopoly.\nEnter the Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) digital asset exchange, which has a serious financial incentive to see Circle prevail in this fight. On August 12, Coinbase announced it was launching “a second Stablecoin Bootstrap Fund, designed to deepen stablecoin liquidity in DeFi [decentralized finance] capital markets, managed by Coinbase Asset Management.”\nThe first Bootstrap Fund started in 2019 as a way to “seed onchain liquidity for USDC across a variety of blue chip DeFi protocols.” This helped USDC become the primary DeFi stablecoin on networks like Ethereum, Base, Solana, Hyperliquid, Sui, Aptos and others.\nThe new Fund wants to grow that list, so its first placements are being executed on Ethereum-based lenders Aave and Morpho, plus Solana-based trading platforms Kamino and Jupiter. The scale of the second Fund’s investment wasn’t disclosed.\nTether’s CEO will shake hands with Circle’s CEO, but does he like him?\nTether and Circle are fierce rivals, with little love lost between them. In a new appearance on the Crypto in America podcast this week, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino was asked about this rivalry, specifically reports that Ardoino and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire had studiously avoided each other at the White House, where both were invited to witness President Trump signing the GENIUS Act into law last month.\nArdoino interjected to say “that’s not correct, we shook hands.” Pressed as to whether that meant the two stablecoin execs “like each other,” Ardoino hesitated before saying only that “we are very different companies.”\nArdoino also revealed slightly more details on Tether’s plans to launch a new U.S.-focused stablecoin. Ardoino said the company has picked the name and created “a beautiful logo,” but declined to share either with the hosts.\nArdoino said “hopefully” all would be revealed by “late September, and then do the first transaction by the end of the year.” Ardoino added that the U.S.-facing product would be “focused more on payments and chequing accounts rather than being the dollar for emerging markets.”\nWatch: Bringing the Metanet to life with Teranode",

        "text": "Privacy is no longer optional, it’s the core feature users expect from DeFi. As more investors seek control without compromise, tokens like OKB and ADA are gaining attention for their privacy-respecting mechanics and real-world utility.\nOKB’s rise reflects growing trust in user-first token design, while ADA’s surge shows increasing demand for confidential transactions backed by zero-knowledge technology.\nCold Wallet builds on both ideas but adds something tangible: a live cashback system with no KYC, no intermediaries, and real USDT rewards. With $6 million raised and rewards already flowing, it’s a strong case for the top crypto to buy 2025.\nPrivacy-First DeFi Cashback\nCold Wallet is reshaping how rewards work in decentralized finance with a live cashback system that cuts out banks, card partners, and intermediaries. In contrast, in traditional cashback models, users give up privacy and rely on centralized entities. Instead, Cold Wallet flips that approach by distributing rewards directly on-chain, ensuring that every swap and network interaction earns users USDT with no strings attached. There are no KYC checks, no credit history requirements, and no hidden gatekeepers; rather, just direct rewards for real crypto usage.\nAs a result, this decentralized design ensures privacy while proving that cashback in DeFi is not a future promise but a working reality in 2025. Moreover, by rewarding usage, Cold Wallet turns participation into a cycle of value, making DeFi attractive to both seasoned users and newcomers. Importantly, self-custody remains at the core, meaning users always control their assets while enjoying consistent rebates across gas fees, swaps, and bridges.\nFurthermore, the traction so far highlights its credibility. Cold Wallet’s presale has already raised more than $6 million, with the token currently in stage 17 at $0.00998 per CWT. Looking ahead, with a launch price set at $0.3517, the upside for early participants is clear. For anyone searching for the top crypto to buy 2025, this project stands out for delivering a live, functional product ahead of launch rather than relying on promises.\nOKB Price Rally Signals Confidence in Privacy-First Utility\nThe recent OKB price rally, marked by a 102% surge in just 24 hours, highlights a growing preference for privacy-respecting, utility-backed tokens. Specifically, this surge reflects confidence in a token that prioritizes real user engagement without requiring overexposure or compromise. OKB’s rise isn’t driven by speculation alone; instead, it’s tied to consistent platform usage and a reward structure that values participation while keeping users in control of their assets.\nMeanwhile, as interest in DeFi grows in 2025, users are seeking tokens that offer functionality without depending on intrusive verification processes or centralized bottlenecks. OKB fits that demand by offering real utility in a structure that respects autonomy and transactional privacy. Therefore, the price movement indicates a shift toward purpose-aligned tokens that deliver actual value.\nADA Price Surge Reinforces Demand for Privacy-Focused DeFi\nThe recent ADA price surge reflects growing interest in decentralized systems that prioritize both privacy and real utility. Fueled by excitement around the Midnight Network airdrop, Cardano has shown that users are increasingly aligning with platforms offering zero-knowledge proof-based confidentiality without sacrificing usability.\nAltogether, this rise highlights a key shift in 2025, users want to engage with DeFi ecosystems that allow them to transact freely, without needing to hand over sensitive personal information.\nWith that in mind, the Midnight protocol enabling secure, private transactions positions ADA as more than just a token. It’s becoming a gateway to a privacy-first financial structure that rewards participation while preserving autonomy. Additionally, the controlled rollout of $NIGHT through airdrops further strengthens network trust and reinforces long-term value.\nCold Wallet Sets the Standard for DeFi Rewards in 2025\nDeFi is shifting toward platforms that offer transparency, control, and actual user benefit without sacrificing privacy. OKB has gained traction by proving that utility matters, and ADA’s recent movement shows the value of privacy-enhancing features backed by real development.\nCold Wallet takes those signals seriously but doesn’t stop at theory, it delivers on-chain cashback with no KYC, no gatekeeping, and real-time USDT rewards for actual crypto usage. Users are not asked to stake or wait. They simply use the wallet and get rewarded. With over $6 million already raised in presale and rewards tied directly to activity,\nCold Wallet offers a working solution to one of DeFi’s biggest adoption barriers. Its model rewards self-custody while encouraging real participation. For those looking ahead to the top crypto to buy 2025, Cold Wallet makes a compelling case by offering more than potential, it offers proof through action.\nExplore Cold Wallet Now:\nPresale: https://purchase.coldwallet.com/\nWebsite: https://coldwallet.com/\nX: https://x.com/coldwalletapp\nTelegram: https://t.me/ColdWalletAppOfficia\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Built on Ethereum’s secure, scalable blockchain infrastructure, Ozak AI combines the cutting-edge potential of artificial intelligence with the global liquidity and developer support of the Ethereum ecosystem.\nThe Ozak AI presale has already passed $1.85 million in funding at a token price of just $0.005, with analysts predicting a $1 launch and a longer-term target of $2.80 by 2026. Those numbers point to a staggering 560x potential return—far exceeding the realistic short-term gains projected for major players like Solana, Ripple (XRP), and Bitcoin.\nThe comparison is striking. While Bitcoin remains the market leader, its massive $1 trillion-plus market cap means percentage growth is slower. Even with a bullish forecast pushing BTC to $200,000 in 2025, that’s only about a 3x gain from current prices. Solana, despite its strong DeFi and NFT presence, is targeting $500 in 2025—a roughly 4x rise. Ripple, with its legal clarity after the SEC lawsuit and growing adoption in cross-border payments, is projected to reach around $6, a 5-6x climb. Ozak AI, on the other hand, could deliver 200x by launch and potentially 560x within the next year and a half, thanks to its early-stage positioning and AI-driven use case.\nWhy Ozak AI Stands Out\nOzak AI isn’t just another speculative presale riding on hype. The team has already developed and demonstrated a functional AI trading engine capable of delivering real-time market predictions in milliseconds. This positions the project in a fast-growing niche where AI is transforming how investors make decisions. The fact that it’s built on Ethereum means it can easily integrate with existing DeFi platforms, DEXs, and wallets, tapping into Ethereum’s massive network effect.\nThe tokenomics are designed to create scarcity while rewarding early adopters. With a fixed supply and incremental price increases across presale stages, investors have a clear incentive to enter early. The $1 confirmed launch price is already locked into the roadmap, providing a transparent goal that’s rare in the presale space. By contrast, most new tokens leave pricing entirely to the open market, creating uncertainty for buyers.\nROI Potential Compared to Market Giants\nWhen comparing Ozak AI’s upside potential to major coins, the disparity is hard to ignore. Bitcoin’s next halving cycle may boost prices, but the scale of growth will be far smaller in percentage terms. Ripple’s price is influenced heavily by regulatory news and adoption in traditional finance, which tends to move at a slower pace. Solana’s strong developer activity and NFT dominance could fuel impressive gains, but even aggressive forecasts place it in the single-digit multiple range by 2025.\nOzak AI’s lower beginning market cap approach means that large rate jumps require a lot less new capital inflow. Early buyers gain from asymmetric danger/praise—in which the ability upside hugely outweighs the downside danger, in particular given the undertaking’s running product and public group presence. If the token reaches $2.80 in 2026 as forecasted, a $500 presale investment will be worth $280,000, a discernment that dwarfs returns from even the most constructive eventualities for Bitcoin, Solana, or Ripple.\nEthereum Integration as a Growth Catalyst\nChoosing Ethereum as its launchpad offers Ozak AI on-the-spot benefits. The community’s mounted protection, huge adoption, and robust developer tools suggest the group can focus on scaling AI capabilities as opposed to constructing middle infrastructure from scratch. This also ensures compatibility with Layer-2 answers like Arbitrum and Optimism, which can further improve transaction pace and decrease charges as adoption grows.\nEthereum’s upcoming scaling enhancements and growing institutional interest in ETH-based tasks ought to directly improve Ozak AI’s visibility and valuation. As extra capital flows into the Ethereum ecosystem, promising ERC-20 tokens with sturdy basics—like Ozak AI—are in all likelihood to look improved and call for attention from both retail and institutional players.\nThe Road to $2.80\nOzak AI’s roadmap outlines aggressive growth targets that make its $2.80 price projection plausible. The plan includes expanding AI features to cater to institutional traders, integrating with multiple DeFi protocols, and creating APIs for external platforms to leverage its AI signals. As trading volume and token demand increase, the deflationary tokenomics will work to support price appreciation.\nWhile nothing in crypto is guaranteed, the combination of a functioning AI product, Ethereum integration, and a low presale entry point gives Ozak AI a unique edge in ROI potential. Investors looking for outsized returns in the next bull run may find it a compelling alternative—or complement—to holding blue-chip cryptos.\nFor now, with the presale still in early stages and the token available at $0.005, the window for securing a position before the $1 launch is narrowing. If projections hold true, Ozak AI could become the rare Ethereum-based project that delivers higher percentage gains than Bitcoin, Solana, and Ripple combined—making it one of the most watched tokens of 2025.\nAbout Ozak AI\nOzak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets.

        "text": "A single bet on DOGE created a millionaire out of someone with just a few thousand dollars. Now, the same gambler is putting everything into a new coin: XYZVerse. Chasing an even bigger win, this switch has become the talk of online circles. What is driving this bold decision, and could XYZVerse really deliver a 500x return?\nXYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin?\nThe buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch.\nThe current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price.\nBullish Mood on $XYZ\nXYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow.\nXYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster, who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.”\nMore Than Just a Meme Coin\nUnlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value.\nRight now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention.\nStill Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends\nBeyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time.\nA Community-Driven Project With Big Plans\nOne thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility.\nThe recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use.\nAs part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem\nCould XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin?\nWith a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look.\nJoin XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity\nMuch Wow Money: Dogecoin's Bark Returns in the Crypto Spring\nDogecoin began in 2013 as an inside joke among coders Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. They slapped a Shiba Inu meme on the logo and set the rules to mint 10,000 new coins every minute, so scarcity was never the point. What followed shocked the market. In 2021 a swarm of online fans, led by tweets from Elon Musk, pushed the “memecoin” into the top ten list with a value above $50 billion. The rise proved that humor, community, and timing can move real money.\nToday DOGE still runs on a simple, secure network based on proof-of-work, yet its fees stay low and transfers are quick. The endless supply works well for tipping, charity drives, and small payments, though it might limit long-term price growth. In the new market upswing, meme tokens are heating up again, but most come and go. DOGE stands out with ten years of history, deep liquidity, and possible use inside Elon Musk’s X super-app dream. If hype returns, this old dog could grab attention once more.\nConclusion\nTurning $5,000 into $2 million with DOGE is remarkable. Now, the focus shifts to XYZVerse, aiming for massive growth by blending meme culture with sports in a community-driven ecosystem.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/best-crypto-to-invest-in-long-term-blockdags-12m-rewards-put-it-ahead-of-bnb-tether-and-xrp",
        "text": "The discussion around the best crypto to invest in long term is intensifying as the market matures and new milestones are set. This year, the focus is on projects that combine proven performance with mechanisms that reward participation on a meaningful scale. From strong presales and verified payouts to reliable stability and global utility, certain names are separating themselves from the rest.\nAmong them, BlockDAG is making a strong case with remarkable growth figures and community-driven initiatives. Alongside it, established names such as BNB, Tether, and XRP continue to show why they remain part of the conversation when evaluating the best crypto to invest in long term.\nBlockDAG (BDAG): Growth-Backed Results and High-Value Rewards\nBlockDAG is positioning itself as one of the best crypto to invest in long term thanks to its ability to blend community engagement with measurable financial progress. Its presale has already raised $374 million, with the project currently in batch 29 at a price of $0.0276 per coin. This represents a staggering 2,660% increase since batch 1, with more than 25 billion coins sold to date.\nWhat sets BlockDAG apart is its emphasis on verified rewards and consistent delivery, creating trust in its capacity to sustain momentum. Rather than relying solely on market speculation, the project has backed its growth with initiatives that reinforce long-term participation and attract continuous demand.\nThis combination of large-scale presale success and tangible value distribution highlights why BlockDAG is widely seen as one of the best crypto to invest in long term in 2025 and beyond.\nBNB (Binance Coin): Utility as a Core Driver\nBNB remains a key player when considering the best crypto to invest in long term, largely due to its integration across the Binance ecosystem. Its uses include trading fee discounts, staking, launchpad access, and broader payment functions, ensuring that demand remains steady.\nThe network’s ongoing expansion into decentralized finance and new product integrations adds to BNB’s relevance. While it doesn’t feature large-scale reward initiatives like BlockDAG, its utility-driven growth and consistent role within one of the largest global exchanges reinforce its position as a reliable choice.\nFor those who prioritize functionality and ongoing adoption, BNB remains a strong option among the best crypto to invest in long term.\nTether (USDT): Stability with Practical Application\nTether plays a unique role in the discussion of the best crypto to invest in long term because it serves as a stabilizing force rather than a high-growth asset. As the most widely adopted USD-backed stablecoin, USDT is essential for trading pairs, liquidity management, and hedging during market volatility.\nIts widespread use across exchanges ensures constant demand and relevance. While Tether does not provide the explosive upside of projects like BlockDAG or BNB, it delivers stability that is invaluable for building balanced portfolios. For those who want flexibility in reallocation and protection against volatility, Tether holds a strategic place among the best crypto to invest in long term.\nXRP (Ripple): Expanding Utility in Payments\nXRP is often highlighted as one of the best crypto to invest in long term due to its role in transforming global payment systems. Ripple’s network focuses on enabling low-cost, high-speed cross-border transactions, a use case that continues to attract attention from banks and financial institutions.\nDespite past regulatory hurdles, XRP has held its ground and maintained strong adoption. Its ability to provide efficiency in international payments sets it apart from purely speculative projects.\nIf adoption continues to expand, particularly through institutional partnerships, XRP could see renewed growth, keeping it firmly among the best crypto to invest in long term.\nFinal Thoughts\nIdentifying the best crypto to invest in long term involves weighing short-term rewards against sustainable growth and utility. BlockDAG currently leads this conversation with a $374 million presale, ROI of 2,660% since batch 1, a batch 29 price of $0.0276, and a record $1.2 million in distributed rewards that highlight its ability to deliver measurable value.\nMeanwhile, BNB offers reliable utility within the world’s largest exchange ecosystem, Tether ensures stability and liquidity management, and XRP provides a pathway toward broader adoption in global payments.\nTogether, these four illustrate the different strengths that can define the best crypto to invest in long term, offering a mix of growth potential, security, and practical application for 2025 and beyond.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/the-1000-bet-that-could-become-560000-inside-ozak-ais-millionaire-potential",
        "text": "Ozak AI is shaping up to be one of the most thrilling presale projects of 2025, offering crypto buyers an unprecedented opportunity to turn a modest $1,000 stake into a life-changing sum. With its token currently promoting for just $0.005 in its 4th presale stage, the project is concentrated on a $1 release price—representing a 200x soar earlier than it even hits the open market.\nAnalysts are already eyeing a 2026 price target of $2.80, which would flip that identical $1,000 into $560,000 if the forecast holds true. In a crypto marketplace hungry for the following breakout, Ozak AI’s mixture of artificial intelligence, blockchain integration, and early adoption incentives is capturing interest throughout the globe.\nOzak AI’s Presale Mechanics Driving Early Gains\nThe reason such staggering returns are even possible comes down to Ozak AI’s carefully tiered presale structure. At the current $0.005 price, each purchase secures tokens at a massive discount compared to the projected $1 launch value.\nBy locking in early, investors position themselves for substantial paper gains when Ozak AI lists on major exchanges. Each presale stage raises the token price incrementally, which builds urgency and rewards those who act fast. With over $1.85 million already raised and more than 135 million tokens sold, momentum is firmly on Ozak AI’s side.\nWhy the AI Narrative Matters\nArtificial intelligence has been one of the fastest-growing sectors in the global tech economy, and its integration with blockchain is creating entirely new categories of utility. Ozak AI is leveraging AI to deliver a trading platform that provides predictive market insights, automated strategy recommendations, and risk analysis—features that could appeal to both retail traders and institutional players.\nThe AI narrative is proving to be a powerful catalyst for crypto valuations, as investors increasingly seek projects that merge real-world utility with scalable token economies.\nComparison to Market Giants\nTo understand the millionaire potential, it’s worth comparing Ozak AI’s trajectory to that of established giants like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. These projects have delivered huge historical returns, but their massive market caps now limit percentage growth potential.\nA new project like Ozak AI starts from a far smaller base, meaning even modest adoption can translate into outsized market cap gains. For perspective, if Ozak AI reaches just 5% of Solana’s current valuation, early presale buyers could already be sitting on several hundred times their initial investment.\nCatalysts on the Horizon\nOne of the most immediate catalysts for Ozak AI is its scheduled appearance at Coinfest Asia 2025 in Bali. Industry events like this often serve as springboards for awareness, networking, and strategic partnership announcements. If Ozak AI secures major exchange listings or institutional backers in the months following the event, demand for its tokens could surge. Combined with its launch marketing campaign, these catalysts could compress years of price appreciation into a matter of months.\nReal Utility from Day One\nUnlike some speculative tokens that rely solely on hype, Ozak AI’s platform will deliver tangible value from the start. The AI engine will integrate with trading dashboards, enabling users to make data-driven decisions in volatile markets. By providing clear entry and exit points, portfolio optimization tools, and sentiment analysis, Ozak AI aims to position itself as an indispensable tool for traders. The utility factor is key because it encourages token holding and ecosystem engagement beyond simple price speculation.\nThe $560,000 Potential—Breaking Down the Math\nThe math behind the headline figure is straightforward but striking. At $0.005 per token, $1,000 buys 200,000 OZ tokens. If Ozak AI reaches its $1 launch price, that stake would be worth $200,000. Should the 2026 projection of $2.80 materialize, the same holding would be valued at $560,000. This kind of return is virtually unheard of in traditional markets but has precedent in crypto, where early positioning in high-growth narratives has historically produced spectacular windfalls.\nA Narrow Window for Early Movers\nWith each presale stage bringing a higher token price, the current $0.005 entry point won’t last much longer. Once the presale ends and Ozak AI lists on exchanges, the open market will set the price, often with significant volatility in the first few weeks. For those aiming to capture the biggest multiple on their investment, getting in before launch is critical. The growing investor base and strong presale momentum suggest this opportunity is rapidly approaching its peak accessibility.\nOzak AI stands out in 2025 as a rare combination of cutting-edge technology, high-growth market positioning, and early adoption incentives. Its potential to transform a $1,000 stake into $560,000 is not just marketing hype—it’s a plausible outcome if the project hits its launch and growth targets. In a year where AI and blockchain integration dominate the conversation, Ozak AI is emerging as a frontrunner for those willing to take calculated risks in pursuit of extraordinary rewards. For investors scanning the market for the next big breakout, this presale may be the chance they’ve been waiting for.\nAbout Ozak AI\nOzak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.\nFor more, visit\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nTwitter: https://x.com/ozakagi\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "The Federal Reserve has shut down its crypto-focused oversight program, which monitors crypto dealings by major banks. The central bank will revert to its regular supervisory process to monitor all crypto-related activities.\nUS banks can offer crypto services like dollar-backed stablecoins without prior approvals. The move is expected to broaden institutional participation in the digital asset ecosystem.\nFederal Reserve Shuts Down Crypto Oversight Program\nThe United States Federal Reserve has shut down a program monitoring banks’ crypto activities. The decision was announced on Friday, with the bank stating it was shuttering its “Novel Activities Supervision Program.” The program kept a check on banks involved with crypto assets, blockchain experiments, and tech-heavy partnerships. The Novel Activities Supervision Program has been around since 2023, and has helped the Fed track “novel activities” within banks under its supervision. This included crypto custody, crypto-backed lending, blockchain-based lending, and working with tech companies to deliver banking services.\nEasing Of Crypto Scrutiny\nThe Federal Reserve stated that since the Board started its crypto supervision program, it has strengthened its understanding of crypto activities, the risks associated with them, and bank risk management practices. With this understanding, the Board now plans to integrate the supervision of crypto-related activities into its standard supervisory process. The Federal Reserve Board also plans to rescind its 2023 supervisory letter, which led to the creation of the program. The initiative is believed to be one of the ways the SEC enforced “Operation Chokepoint” under the Biden administration.\nThe shuttering of the program follows President Donald Trump's signing of an executive order to end unfair banking practices based on grounds including religion, politics, and other ideologies. The order also cited Operation Chokepoint and how the Federal Reserve coerced banks into cutting ties with prominent crypto firms and entities. The Federal Reserve, along with other banking regulators, recently gave banks the green light to custody crypto assets. The regulators clarified that the same rules that apply to the custody of other assets will apply to crypto assets.\nA Big Win For The Crypto Industry\nSenator Cynthia Lummis called the Federal Reserve’s decision a “big win” for the crypto ecosystem, and one that ends Operation Chokepoint 2.0. She noted that the Federal Reserve’s decision effectively stops the targeted supervision of crypto banking activities.\n“Big win for putting an end to Operation Chokepoint 2.0. The Fed announced it is killing the targeted supervision of digital asset banking activities. There’s still more to do, but this is real progress toward a level playing field for crypto.”\nHowever, she conceded there was still more to do, but added that the decision was a big step towards creating a level playing field for crypto. Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor also weighed in, stating that the “road is now clear for Bitcoin and banking.” Crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett stated that the Novel Activities Supervision Program was a major catalyst for Operation Chokepoint 2.0.\n“The novel activities supervision program was a major catalyst for Operation Chokepoint 2.0, one banking lawyer told me. While the Fed has yet to rescind all of its anti-crypto guidance from the Biden era, this is another piece of the puzzle.”\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Cardano is holding the line near the $0.75 mark, a key level that’s drawing intense attention from traders as altcoin markets feel the strain of widespread liquidations. Despite the turbulence, ADA’s technical indicators suggest that upward momentum could be building. With resistance at $0.91 and the potential to push beyond $1, Cardano’s setup could turn short-term volatility into a springboard for gains.\nIn this article, we’ll explore ADA’s price outlook, the broader altcoin landscape, and how data-powered strategies of Outset PR help crypto projects capture market attention when sentiment begins to shift.\nCardano (ADA) Eyes Gains as It Hovers Near Key Levels\nSource: tradingview\nCardano is trading between seventy-three to eighty-five cents. It seems poised for growth, rising over 27% in a month. The nearest resistance is around ninety-one cents, while support lies at sixty-six cents. If it breaks through the resistance, it might climb to over one dollar. This would be a nearly 20% jump from its current upper range. The coin's indicators such as the RSI and moving averages suggest potential momentum. With these signs, Cardano could experience further upward movement, aiming for new highs.

        "text": "A new contender is drawing attention for its potential to outpace leading tokens like Solana and XRP. XYZVerse, still trading for less than a dollar, has sparked debate among traders and analysts. Its rapid growth and unique features could set the stage for a major shift in the market by next year.\n$XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI\nXYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game.\nWith the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project.\nWhat sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth.\nFueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto.\n$XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market\nThe $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price.\nLaunch Price: $0.0001\nPrice Now: $0.005\nNext Stage: $0.01\nFinal Presale Price: $0.02\nFollowing the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries.\nSo far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch.\nDemand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns.\nJoin $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions!\nSolana’s Fast Lane: Why SOL Is Catching Eyes This Cycle\nSolana was built for speed. While rivals like Ethereum and Cardano can slow when traffic rises, Solana keeps moving by packing more work into each block instead of adding extra layers. Its design lets developers write apps in several common languages and send thousands of transactions in a blink. The SOL coin is the fuel for all this action. People use it to pay fees, run custom programs, and earn rewards for helping secure the network.\nThe market now favors chains that stay quick and cheap, and Solana fits that mood. Trading volumes for SOL have climbed as new games, art markets, and finance tools launch on the network. Investors like its simple path to growth—no need to split the chain or bolt on fixes. Ethereum still holds the crown for size, but Solana often wins on cost and speed, two big talking points this cycle. If demand for lively, high-traffic apps keeps rising, SOL could remain a standout choice among major coins.\nXRP: The Quick Coin That Wants to Move Money Like Text Messages\nXRP lives on a public digital record called the XRP Ledger. It was built by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz to act like cash made for the internet. Payments race across the globe in seconds, cost a tiny fraction of a cent, and cannot be reversed or faked. Only 100 billion coins exist; 80 billion went to Ripple, the company helping the network grow. Most of that stash sits in escrow, so new coins enter the market in set doses.\nIn today’s cycle, speed and low fees stand out. Bitcoin is trusted but slow. Ethereum is flexible but can be pricey when traffic spikes. XRP avoids both pains, making it handy for everyday transfers or swapping between currencies. Recent talk about cross-border payments and digital dollars shines a light on coins that move fast without a bank account, so many traders see XRP as a strong play while the market looks for the next leader.\nConclusion\nXYZVerse (XYZ) is poised to challenge SOL and XRP by merging sports fandom and meme culture, aiming for significant growth and community-driven success.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/3-cheap-cryptocurrencies-whale-investors-are-aggressively-buying-this-week",
        "text": "The crypto market is at a crucial point right now. Big-money investors quietly rotate into positions they think could set off the next big rally. Such inflows lower the amount of tokens in circulation, create strong support levels for price action, and can make retail traders feel like they are missing out (FOMO). Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are three cheap but promising cryptocurrencies that whales have been buying a lot of this week. Here is why they are grabbing attention.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Micro-Cap Gem Attracting Early-Stage Whales\nWhale accumulation isn’t only about chasing established coins. It’s also about getting in before the crowd. That’s precisely what’s happening with Little Pepe, a fast-emerging meme coin already raising eyebrows among big investors. Now in Stage 10 of its presale, Little Pepe has raised over $18 million, selling more than 12 billion tokens at $0.0019 each, up 90% from its Stage 1 price. This presale success is a whale magnet, as it signals heavy early demand and sets up a controlled launch with reduced post-listing risk. Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on hype, LILPEPE is built around a Layer-2 EVM-enabled ecosystem, promising speed, scalability, and low transaction costs. Then, there is Pepe Launchpad, a built-in platform allowing new meme coins to launch directly within the Little Pepe network. This keeps liquidity flowing and ensures ongoing relevance. Add in tax-free buying and selling, sniper bot resistance, a recent smart contract audit by Certik, and a planned CoinMarketCap listing, and the project has a robust post-presale playbook. The cherry on top? A $777K giveaway campaign is boosting community growth while whales quietly build their bags in anticipation of a supply squeeze once LILPEPE hits exchanges.\nCardano (ADA): Whales Betting on a Parabolic Repeat\nCardano has been around long enough to prove its resilience, but whales treat the current setup like a reset button for explosive gains. ADA’s price is consolidating around $0.80, with analysts noting the pattern closely resembles its chart just before a previous parabolic rally to $7.\nCardano Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko\nIn the past 48 hours alone, whales have scooped up over 200 million ADA, showing that deep-pocketed players see the breakout potential. This buying spree is coming as Cardano gears up to break through the key $0.84 resistance. Technical momentum could push ADA to $1 and beyond if that happens. The derivatives market also reinforces the whale narrative, with rising open interest and steadily climbing favorable funding rates, indicating sustained bullish sentiment. ADA is a mid-term bet for whales: a mix of solid fundamentals, major upcoming upgrades, and a favorable market cycle that could push it toward multi-dollar valuations again.\nDogecoin (DOGE): Old King, New Whale Energy\nDogecoin might be the original meme coin giant, but whales aren’t done with it yet. Just this week, DOGE whales purchased a staggering one billion DOGE worth $220 million, all within a single day. This aggressive buying spree is being interpreted as preparation for a long-term rally.\nDogecoin Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko\nAt $0.22, DOGE is significantly below its all-time highs, and investors are relying on two primary factors: the resurgence of mainstream interest in meme coins and the potential policy benefits from rumors that President Donald Trump might issue executive orders that favor certain crypto assets. Historically, DOGE has been a beneficiary of cultural moments and whale-led momentum, and this setup looks no different. The current 13% weekly surge is just the opening move, with some analysts predicting a run to $4 if macro conditions and investor sentiment align. For whales, DOGE offers the liquidity and recognition that make large-scale entries relatively low-risk compared to smaller meme coins.\nConclusion: Whales Are Signaling the Next Movers\nWhale activity is one of the most reliable tells in crypto. This week’s buying patterns show three different strategies: Little Pepe as the early-stage micro-cap with explosive upside potential, Cardano as the mid-cap poised for a technical breakout, and Dogecoin as the veteran rallying behind renewed whale enthusiasm. For retail investors, tracking these moves is less about copying whales' trades for transactions and more about understanding the conviction and positioning behind them. The mix of meme coin energy and solid blockchain plays in this cycle could create the most powerful runs we’ve seen since 2021.

        "text": "The crypto market continues to shift rapidly, offering both challenges and opportunities. Stellar (XLM) is making a strong move after breaking out of a falling wedge pattern and now faces important resistance levels. Meanwhile, XRP is holding near crucial support, with traders watching closely for the next move. Amid these technical shifts, Cold Wallet (CWT) has emerged with an advantage few can match, a working product and significant presale traction.\nWhile Stellar’s rally and XRP’s price defense attract attention, Cold Wallet is driving forward with a $6M presale and a confirmed 3,425% ROI potential. Priced at $0.00998 in Stage 17 with a $0.3517 launch value, CWT is offering early access to real, usable rewards before launch. This is more than market speculation, it’s a project delivering tangible benefits in real time.\nStellar Price Action Signals Breakout Challenge\nStellar has broken out of a falling wedge, often a sign of a bullish reversal. Now trading at $0.4527, XLM is facing a tight resistance band between $0.455 and $0.460. A decisive push above could confirm the breakout and lead to further gains.\nIf resistance holds, immediate support sits at $0.446 on the 9-period EMA and $0.420 on the 50-period SMA. These levels will be key in sustaining the uptrend. XLM’s recent range of $0.315 to $0.455 has shown high volatility and increased trading activity, signaling strong market interest.\nTraders are watching how the price responds at $0.460. A break above this point could fuel more buying, while failure may lead to a retest of lower supports. The current setup puts XLM in a position worth monitoring closely in the short term.\nXRP Battles to Keep Critical $3.17 Level\nXRP is trading at $3.22 with a modest 1.05% daily rise, yet the price is approaching its critical $3.17 support zone. If this level breaks, history suggests a possible slide toward $3.10–$3.15, an area that has provided stability before.\nThe token’s recent rejection at $3.33 shows sellers are still active. A break above $3.40 would be needed to shift momentum in favor of the bulls. Until that happens, sideways price movement remains likely.\nFor traders, $3.17 and $3.40 are the key boundaries to watch. Holding support could trigger a rebound, while a breakdown may point to deeper losses in the near term.\nCold Wallet Rewards Users While Driving Massive Presale Growth\nMost wallets only store assets, but Cold Wallet is designed to reward user actions. Every time you pay gas fees, make a swap, or send funds, you receive CWT cashback. This system keeps users engaged and offers continual rewards.\nFollowing its $270M Plus Wallet acquisition, Cold Wallet now has access to over 2M users before launch. At its current Stage 17 price of $0.00998 and with a confirmed $0.3517 launch, early buyers could see gains of up to 3,425%. Already, $6M has been raised, and 716.6 million coins have been sold.\nThe closer it gets to launch, the higher the presale price climbs. This shrinking window makes early entry more appealing. Cold Wallet’s model blends utility with growth, allowing users to benefit from normal crypto use instead of paying fees without return.\nWith presale progress accelerating, Cold Wallet’s combination of rewards, a proven user base, and strong ROI potential makes it one of the most compelling projects heading into 2025.\nCold Wallet Leads the Way for 2025\nWhile Stellar eyes a sustained breakout and XRP works to defend its support, Cold Wallet is charting a different path. Its rapid presale growth, existing user network, and cashback reward system give it a clear edge.\nWith $6M raised, a strong ROI projection, and millions of users ready for launch, Cold Wallet stands out as a prime candidate for long-term success. For those watching 2025’s top crypto opportunities, this project is already proving it belongs at the top of the list.\nPresale: https://purchase.coldwallet.com/\nWebsite: https://coldwallet.com/\nX: https://x.com/coldwalletapp\nTelegram: https://t.me/ColdWalletAppOfficial\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "The US SEC has delayed its decision on Solana ETF proposals from Bitwise and 21Shares to October 16, 2025, citing the need for additional review as market volatility and inflation concerns weigh on investor sentiment.\nSEC Extends Review Period\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on two proposed Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from Bitwise and 21Shares, setting a new deadline of October 16, 2025. Both proposals aim to list and trade shares on the Cboe BZX Exchange under its Commodity-Based Trust Shares framework.\nIn a filing released on Thursday, the SEC stated the extension would allow “sufficient time to consider” the proposals, which were initially due for a decision on August 17. The maximum 60-day delay permitted under regulatory guidelines will mark the final deadline for approval or denial.\nMarket Reaction and Price Moves\nThe delay comes as Solana’s price trades near $190, down from almost $210 earlier in the week. CoinGlass data recorded $70 million in SOL liquidations over the past 24 hours, reflecting heightened market volatility. The pullback followed hotter-than-expected US inflation data, with the July Producer Price Index rising 0.9% month-on-month, well above expectations of 0.2%. The annual rate climbed to 3.3%, exceeding forecasts of 2.5%, pressuring risk assets across markets.\nDespite the short-term retreat, Solana had touched $209 earlier on Thursday, supported by strong derivatives market activity. CoinGlass noted open interest in SOL futures nearing record highs at $12 billion, suggesting traders are positioning for continued price momentum.\nWider Regulatory Delays\nAccording to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the SEC has also delayed decisions on proposals from Canary Funds and Marinade Finance. Seyffart indicated that further postponements may be limited, with standard spot Solana ETFs likely to be approved by mid-October 2025.\nNate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, told CNBC that he expects a wave of altcoin ETFs to enter the market soon, citing regulatory progress and strong inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum products. He added that such developments could accelerate institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies beyond the two largest digital assets.\nInstitutional Outlook\nAndrejs Balans, Risk Manager at YouHodler, noted that while Solana and other projects like Polkadot are gaining institutional attention, they remain in the “experimental” category for many major capital allocators.\nHe claimed,\n“Only a few of these are likely to survive long enough to gain serious attention.”\nThe SEC’s decision in October 2025 is set to be a key moment for Solana’s push into mainstream investment products. Until then, the market will continue to weigh macroeconomic pressures, regulatory developments, and investor appetite for altcoin ETFs.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Meta Description: While the ETH price rides bullish momentum, analysts are predicting Unilabs Finance and Arbitrum to deliver 3x gains this altcoin season. Find out more about them.\nThe crypto market is heating up, and the ETH price is leading the charge with an impressive climb toward new highs. Riding the wave of institutional adoption, Ethereum’s momentum is attracting serious attention, not just from traders, but from big banks too.\nMeanwhile, Arbitrum’s technical setup hints at a potential breakout, and Unilabs Finance is making waves as an AI-powered DeFi asset manager poised to disrupt the market. Continue reading this article to find out more about these leading projects.\nStandard Chartered Lifts Ethereum Forecast to $7,500 by 2025\nThe ETH price is rising toward new all-time highs, with the coin presently trading around $4,700. This marks a gain of more than 50% in the last month alone, putting it among the top-performing cryptocurrencies. Standard Chartered Bank has taken note of this movement. Their analyst, Geoff Kendrick, just raised his ETH price forecast upward.\nThe bank now expects that the ETH price will reach $7,500 by the end of 2025, up from its earlier estimate of $4,000. Even more optimistic is their long-term vision, which includes an ETH price estimate of $25,000 by 2028, more than doubling their earlier projection of $7,500.\nThis higher adjustment comes as institutional investors pump record amounts of money into Ethereum. According to Standard Chartered data, Ethereum treasury firms and spot ETFs have acquired around 3.8% of all ETH in circulation since early June.\nThis accumulation is 2x as fast as the fastest pace recorded during a comparable Bitcoin buying era, indicating a rising institutional preference for Ethereum, pushing the ETH price upwards.\nArbitrum’s ARB Holds Steady After 23% Weekly Gains\nArbitrum's recent decline has pushed it close to the support zone identified by experts earlier this week. According to CryptoPulse, the $0.51-$0.52 level was the breakout point during the previous rise, making it an important retest zone currently.\nAccording to the latest market data, the Arbitrum price has dropped to $0.5158, up 1.9% on the day, following 23% gains in the previous week. This zone is more than simply a technical number. It shows a battle line between bulls seeking continuation and sellers trying to control.\nThe next few sessions will indicate whether Arbitrum buyers are strong enough to protect it. A hold here would legitimize the breakthrough and open the path to $0.90 in the short term.\nBitcoinsensus also reported a confirmed double-bottom breakthrough on Arbitrum’s daily chart. If this pattern continues, it will strengthen the bullish case for higher targets. The initial stop would be $0.7747, but stronger momentum might push Arbitrum to $1.23 and $1.70.\nUnilabs Finance Raises $32M in AUM: Here’s What's Fueling It!\nAs the altcoin market picks up pace following the ETH price spike to reach its ATH at $5,000, other altcoins like Arbitrum and Unilabs Finance are also seeing a surge in their momentum.\nUnilabs Finance is the world’s first AI-based asset management protocol that aims to automate the investment process through its highly advanced AI-backed features. Unilabs offers its users AI-powered tools and features that can help users grow their portfolios conveniently.\nDespite being at early stages of development, Unilabs Finance has more than $32 million in assets under management (AUM), consisting of four AI-backed funds: BTC, AI, Mining, and RWA funds. Each of these funds caters to a different investor pool, making this platform a place that has something in store for every investor out there.\nTaking one step ahead, Unilabs Finance is also offering a unique system named as Early Access Scoring System (EASS). This system scrutinizes new projects in the market on different parameters like credibility, team backing, tokenomics, technology, and signals to investors when to enter its market. This lets them capture the right opportunity at the right time.\nExperts claim that Unilabs Finance can experience a massive surge in this altcoin season, owing to its AI-utility. It is currently in its presale phase, offering each UNIL token are available for only $0.0097, with the price surging to $0.01 in the next stage, delivering 20% gains.\nThe presale has already raised over $13M in funding from investors all around the world. As per the market experts, now is the perfect opportunity to join Unilabs Finance and become one of its early investors, which comes with its own set of multiple perks.\nDiscover More About Unilabs Finance:\nPresale: https://www.unilabs.finance/\nBuy Presale: https://buy.unilabs.finance/\nTelegram: https://t.me/s/unilabsofficial\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/unilabsofficial\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Rather than relying solely on online hype or speculative trends, BDAG has built a physical presence in sports arenas worldwide. The project’s sponsorship approach pairs global stage visibility with regional depth, creating a funnel that moves from broad awareness to sustained user engagement.\nFrom high-profile European football matches with Inter Milan to high-intensity UFC championship bouts featuring Alex Pereira, and from the loyal fanbases of rugby’s Seattle Seawolves to cricket’s Seattle Orcas, BDAG is consistently in front of audiences that matter. With a presale already raising nearly $375 million, sitting in batch 29 at $0.0276, boasting a 2,660% ROI since batch 1, and over 25 billion coins sold, this multi-channel visibility is directly tied to future adoption potential.\nEuropean Football: The Global Reach Engine\nFor any cryptocurrency aiming to join the top cryptos, global reach is essential, and few platforms deliver it like European football. By partnering with Inter Milan, a club with a fanbase stretching across continents, BDAG secures visibility in some of the most watched broadcasts on the planet. Inter’s matches are not just local events, they are cultural spectacles broadcast to millions in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.\nThis reach transforms BDAG from a niche project into a recognizable name for investors and everyday fans alike. Football sponsorship also creates a sense of credibility, as appearing alongside established, respected institutions helps remove hesitation from first-time buyers. By planting its brand across a sport that thrives on passion and loyalty, BDAG taps into a steady stream of impressions that continue throughout the long football season. This stage of the funnel focuses on making BDAG a familiar name before the wallet is even opened.\nUFC: High-Impact Spotlight Moments\nWhile football delivers a broad, sustained presence, UFC sponsorship gives BDAG the ability to dominate attention in short, high-intensity bursts. In the fight arena, every moment is amplified, camera close-ups, live commentary mentions, and millions of viewers worldwide following the same high-stakes event. Partnering with UFC champion Alex Pereira aligns BDAG with peak performance and resilience, traits that resonate with both sports fans and crypto investors.\nThese events have a unique ability to capture audiences who are fully engaged, heightening recall when they later encounter BDAG through other touchpoints. In a crowded market for top cryptos, it is this kind of concentrated exposure that accelerates decision-making, turning awareness into action. UFC’s younger, digitally native audience is also more inclined toward tech adoption, making it a perfect fit for pushing presale participation and future platform engagement.\nRugby and Cricket: Regional Loyalty and Depth\nBeyond global reach and spotlight moments, BDAG’s inclusion of rugby and cricket sponsorships, through the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas, adds a valuable layer of regional depth. Rugby commands fierce loyalty in markets like the Pacific Northwest, parts of Europe, and Oceania, while cricket dominates in South Asia, the UK, and Australia.\nThese are not casual sports communities; they are tight-knit ecosystems where brands that commit to them gain lasting trust. By investing in these relationships, BDAG positions itself as more than a passing advertiser. In the long-term ROI equation for top cryptos, these connections serve as retention drivers, keeping BDAG relevant even after initial investments.\nIt is in these smaller, yet highly engaged markets that repeat transactions and community-driven growth can thrive. The mix of sports allows BDAG to spread its risk and maximize engagement diversity, ensuring no single audience dominates its adoption path.\nFinal Say\nBlockDAG’s multi-sport sponsorship portfolio is more than a brand play, it is a calculated ROI framework that places it firmly among the top cryptos with a strategy for lasting impact. Inter Milan delivers global reach, UFC provides intense spotlight moments, and rugby and cricket cultivate loyal, regional followings. This layered approach ensures that BDAG is not just seen but remembered, trusted, and eventually adopted by diverse investor segments.\nWith a presale that has already raised nearly $375 million, a current batch price of $0.0276 in batch 29, an ROI of 2,660% since batch 1, and over 25 billion coins sold, the groundwork is set for a significant market presence post-mainnet. The sponsorship mix operates as a full-funnel marketing engine, from mass awareness to deep community integration, designed to turn sports fans into wallet holders and investors into long-term advocates.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "The market is buzzing over ETF approvals for Solana and Dogecoin. Both altcoins will most likely pump post-approval, but not enough to turn a modest investment into a millionaire-making jackpot. The truth is, both are already multi-billion-dollar giants. This means the easy 100x gains are long gone. If you’re aiming for life-changing profits in 2025, you need coins still early enough to deliver explosive upside. Such tokens where retail FOMO hasn’t yet kicked in, and where fundamentals or hype can multiply value quickly. That’s where Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and Helium (HNT) come in. LILPEPE is a meme coin with actual infrastructure, while Helium powers a real-world decentralized wireless network. Both are sitting at pivotal growth points, offering the kind of asymmetric opportunity big caps simply can’t.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin Set to Outrun the Giants\nWhile Solana and Dogecoin are awaiting ETF approval, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is quietly building momentum. The project is currently in stage ten at $0.0019. The next stage will see the price increase to $0.0020. So far, over $18.5 million has been raised. 12.36 billion tokens have been sold out of the 12.75 billion for this stage. This rapid sales point to strong community support and a potential for aggressive post-launch rallies. However, it's not hype driving the numbers. It's real utility. LILPEPE isn’t just another meme coin. It’s a hybrid of meme culture and actual blockchain utility. It’s built on Pepe Chain, an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 network purpose-built for meme tokens. The chain offers lightning-fast transactions, near-zero fees, and anti-sniper bot protection. It also features a launchpad, the Pepe's pump pad that's set to rival established names like Bonk.fun and Pump.fun.\nWhy LILPEPE Stands Out:\n-\nEarly Entry Advantage: At under two-tenths of a cent, there’s massive room for exponential growth compared to saturated giants like SOL and DOGE.\n-\nMassive Presale Demand: Moving through presale stages this quickly reflects a passionate and growing community backing.\n-\nMeme Power + Utility: It combines viral meme culture with infrastructure, creating a powerful bullish narrative.\n-\nLiquidity Planning: The tokenomics includes allocation for CEX reserves and liquidity pools. This step ensures smoother market entry and price stability post-launch.\n-\nConfirmed Exchange Listings: LILPEPE has secured listings on two top-tier centralized exchanges. This move sets the stage for broad price discovery and investor access.\nLILPEPE’s microcap status allows even modest adoption post-launch to yield 10x, 50x, or more. Early Shiba Inu investors enjoyed similar trajectories, and LILPEPE is poised to be the next big name in meme coin history. Additionally, the $777,000 giveaway—where 10 winners will receive $77,000 each in tokens—is driving viral growth and social media buzz, attracting thousands of new eyes daily. The community is waxing strong with CoinMarketCap listing and a successful audit, attracting more investors and establishing Little Pepe's credibility. For those looking for a meme coin that merges legendary viral potential with real blockchain innovation, Little Pepe is the breakout story of 2025.\nHelium (HNT): Utility-Powered, Data-Driven, Ready for a Breakout\nHelium (HNT) is carving its path through real-world adoption, which is why it belongs in a millionaire-maker conversation. Helium powers a decentralized wireless network, connecting IoT devices, smart sensors, and more without relying on traditional telecom infrastructure. This is a multi-billion-dollar market that’s only getting bigger as the world shifts toward AI-driven automation and 5G/6G technology.\nHNT/USD 1D Price Chart|Source: TradingView\nHelium’s network migration to Solana’s blockchain this year has dramatically boosted scalability and transaction speed. The result? Lower costs, faster onboarding, and more incentives for node operators to join. This will fuel the network’s rapid expansion. The more devices connected, the more demand for HNT, driving scarcity and price appreciation.\nOn-chain adoption is surging according to Messari:\n-\nCarrier offloading has exploded. Cumulative data transferred via hotspots soared from 1,140.9 TB to 2,721 TB in Q2 2025. This is a staggering 138.5% QoQ increase.\n-\nPaid usage is climbing fast, with average daily mobile paid traffic jumping 70.6% QoQ in Q2 2025. It's totaling 20.6 TB/day. That brings total paid traffic to 5,520.8 TB, reflecting genuine network demand.\nMeanwhile, technical signals show a bullish reversal forming. Price reclaimed support around $3.20. Currently, a bullish double-bottom breakout pattern is emerging that traditionally precedes strong rallies. Additionally, the recent halving on August 1 slashed daily HNT emissions in half, from 15 million to 7.5 million. The introduction of deflationary pressure will enhance upside potential if usage continues climbing. With tangible usage growth and a tightening token supply, Helium sits at the intersection of strong fundamentals and favorable market timing. This is an ideal breeding ground for breakout gains in 2025.\nConclusion\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) and Helium (HNT) stand out as the smart choices for 2025 if you're seeking real breakout potential beyond the hype of massive altcoins. While Solana and Dogecoin benefit from ETF buzz, their sheer size limits explosive returns. LILPEPE’s microcap status and unique Layer-2 infrastructure position it to deliver the kind of life-changing gains investors dream of. Meanwhile, Helium’s real-world wireless network adoption and supply-cutting halving set the stage for strong fundamental-driven growth. Little Pepe is currently in its presale stage, offering a low entry point for investors hoping to catch early gains. With the token launch approaching fast, now is the best time to move. Get in early before the next stage price hike and be part of the meme revolution.

        "text": "Bitcoin Penguins is making a huge splash in the meme coin space, raising $3.4m in its presale and positioning itself as a direct competitor to the established penguin king, Pudgy Penguins.\nAt a basement $0.00155 per token in stage 10, BPENGU is presenting the same proven narrative that launched PENGU to a $2.3 billion market cap.\nWhile PENGU trades around $0.037 after recent volatility, Bitcoin Penguins is launching during market conditions similar to previous \"meme coin seasons\" - periods when casual crypto investors saw their holdings increase 100 to 1,000 times in value. With Bitcoin Penguins ending their presale on August 27th, competition amongst buyers snapping up the last tokens available is heating up.\nIs it possible for a relative newcomer to effectively challenge PENGU's dominance? The numbers suggest so.\nPENGU's impressive empire vs BPENGU's ground-floor opportunity\nPudgy Penguins has evolved into a Web3 brand powerhouse, with physical toys available in Walmart, partnerships with Lufthansa and NASCAR, and over 100 billion views across social media, making it a cultural icon.\nWe’re partnering with @Lufthansa’s Miles & More program, Europe’s largest frequent flyer program to bring rewards to The Huddle.\n— Pudgy Penguins (@pudgypenguins) June 12, 2025\nEvery purchase in fiat or $PENGU on the Pudgy Shop earns you miles, redeemable with 300+ partners for flights, experiences, & more.\nLearn more below. pic.twitter.com/t114Fyypm5\nThe achievements are genuinely impressive. PENGU reached unprecedented heights in late 2024, when Pudgy Penguins launched their PENGU token on Solana in December. This transformed the project from a small NFT collection with 4,000 holders into a massive community with nearly 1 million PENGU token holders.\nThe project airdropped over $1.5 billion worth of PENGU tokens to early believers, with individual Pudgy NFT holders receiving approximately $75,000 worth of tokens per penguin they owned. The PENGU token saw an astounding liftoff, holding at an astonishing $2.1 billion at the time of writing.\nHowever, PENGU's success also limits its upside potential. Current forecasts predict it trading between $0.05 and $0.10 by 2026, representing solid but not extreme gains from current levels of around $0.037.\nBitcoin Penguins targets the gap PENGU left open\nWhile PENGU conquered the Solana ecosystem, it left a massive opportunity untapped: Bitcoin holders.\nBitcoin Penguins tempts all Bitcoin lovers with weekly Bitcoin giveaways worth $120,000 each and an outrageous declared ambition to purchase the entire continent of Antarctica for penguin conservation.\nThe first Bitcoin prize winner was announced not long ago. They held just $17.5 worth of coins—so that’s a potentially life-changing sum.\nMeanwhile, the project's staking numbers show serious early engagement:\n-\nWhale Tier (3 months, 100% APY): 53.67M tokens locked\n-\nFish Tier (2 months, 80% APY): 96.08M tokens staked\n-\nPrawn Tier (1 month, 50% APY): 113.25M tokens committed\nThat’s a total of 263 million tokens already locked before launch, creating a support platform for the project. The confirmed listing price of $0.00198 means current holders have built-in upside before the public starts trading.\nBPENGU also benefits from favorable timing. Current market analysis suggests that meme coins could see significant gains in Q4, with historical data indicating that the final rotation into narrative-driven projects typically occurs in the fourth quarter.\nThe race heats up\nPENGU's established success proves the penguin narrative has staying power.\nBitcoin Penguins launches with the benefit of learning from PENGU's playbook while targeting a wider audience. The $3.4m raised so far is indicative of valuable early momentum, and major influencers from the crypto world are helping to build virality for the meme.\nLIVE. Bitcoin Penguins 🐧 1 BTC every week. 100% APY.\n— IK CRYPT 🛠 (@Ikcrypt) July 28, 2025\nListing Sept 2. $BPENGU smashed $190k in under 10 mins! Early birds win — late ones feed the whales.\n👇 https://t.co/SIwBhTtfOf\nRather than a direct competition, this could be akin to the march of the penguins, similar to how dog and frog memes took over in 2023-2024.\nWith just over a week left before the presale ends, Bitcoin Penguins represents a chance to get positioned in what could be the Bitcoin community's answer to the Pudgy Penguin success story.\nVisit the official Bitcoin Penguins website to learn more about the presale before the August 27th deadline.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Bitcoin has reached a new high, capturing global attention and drawing bold moves from new players. The market’s sharp rise this year has pushed companies to act fast. XYZVerse has entered the scene at a crucial moment, setting plans into motion as momentum grows. The next steps could shape the direction of the industry.\nPrice Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible?\nXYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains.\nThe broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch.\nKey Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market:\n-\nStrong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal\n-\nDeflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure\n-\nLiquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch\n-\nCommunity incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding\nPrice Prediction for $XYZ\n-\nCurrent Presale Price: $0.005\n-\nProjected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates)\n-\nPotential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO)\n-\nLong-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings)\nBuy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains\nRealistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10?\nA 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on:\n-\nStrong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day.\n-\nSustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement.\n-\nMarket Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit.\nIs a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ?\nXYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable.\nInvest in $XYZ Before It Surges\nBitcoin: Digital Cash With No Boss Could Shine Again\nBitcoin is the first online-only money. It was shared in 2009 by the secret figure Satoshi Nakamoto. The coin lives on a public list kept on many computers, so no bank or office can change it alone. People send it directly to each other, like passing cash, but over the internet. To stop cheats, helpers called miners race to solve hard math tasks. When they win, they add the next page to the list and earn new coins. Only 21 million can ever exist.\nThe next reward cut, named the halving, is due soon and will slow the flow of fresh coins. This built-in limit often sparks talk of rising prices when demand stays strong. Big funds and well known firms are showing more interest, while some newer coins still fight for clear uses. Bitcoin’s long track record, open design, and global name give it an edge during shaky markets. Fees can rise when trade is busy, yet many see the coin as digital gold. In the current swing, its tight supply and growing trust could make it look attractive again.\nConclusion\nBitcoin's peak and current bull run spotlight its strength. XYZVerse aims for unprecedented growth by blending meme culture and sports, aspiring to become a cultural icon in crypto.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The latest hike will take the value of the HINU token from $0.00019690 to $0.00019748.\nHusky Inu is also closing in on another major fundraising milestone as it nears $900,000.\nHusky Inu (HINU) Set For Increase To $0.00019748\nHusky Inu (HINU) is gearing up for its next price increase, which is set to occur in just over eleven hours, as its pre-launch phase continues. The latest price increase will see the HINU token rise from its current value of $0.00019690 to $0.00019748. The project’s regular price increases are part of its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The HINU token’s value was $0.00015000 at the beginning of the pre-launch phase. Since then, it has registered several price increases, utilizing a dynamic pricing system.\nHusky Inu’s pre-launch phase picks up where the presale left off, helping empower the fledgling Husky Inu community and allowing the project to continue its fundraising efforts. It is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The pre-launch phase uses a progressive token pricing strategy to reward early project backers and promote transparent growth.\nAnother Milestone In Sight\nHusky Inu (HINU) is also closing in on its latest fundraising milestone. The project has raised $878,020 so far and is set to cross the $900,000 milestone this month. Husky Inu’s presale and pre-launch phases have allowed it to cross several key fundraising milestones. The project adopted a dynamic and progressive pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, increasing the price of the HINU token every two days. This has allowed the project to raise funds quickly while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering its growing community. Thanks to this dynamic strategy, Husky Inu crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached its latest milestone in record time, crossing $850,000 on July 25.\nSwapCrypto.com\nThe project also announced the launch of SwapCrypto.com last week. SwapCrypto.com is Husky Inu’s very own cryptocurrency exchange, and allows the project to reinforce its commitment to providing value to its nascent user base and building real-world utility. Unlike other memecoins that depend on hype and speculation, Husky Inu is dedicated to its utility and long-term vision. Instead of becoming just another memecoin, it is creating the infrastructure to give its community the tools to engage with digital finance. SwapCrypto.com enhances Husky Inu’s growing ecosystem and solidifies its position in an increasingly competitive DeFi ecosystem.\nVisit the following links for more information on Husky Inu:\n-\nWebsite: Husky Inu Official Website\n-\nTwitter: Husky Inu Twitter\n-\nTelegram: Husky Inu Telegram\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Solana (SOL) has been one of the standout performers in the current crypto market cycle, attracting both retail traders and institutional investors. Recently, momentum has received an additional boost as CMB International Asset Management (CMBIAM) announced the launch of Asia’s first regulated, publicly offered tokenized USD money market fund on the Solana blockchain. While the direct price impact is still unfolding, the news has added fresh fuel to bullish narratives projecting Solana toward the $300 price level.\nCMB’s Tokenized Fund: A First for Asia\nCMBIAM’s tokenized USD money market fund, developed in partnership with Singapore-based digital asset platform DigiFT, represents a major milestone in blockchain’s integration with traditional finance. Key features include:\n-\nMulti-Chain Access – Available on Solana, Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Plume.\n-\nRegulated Offering – Fully compliant with Singapore’s framework for accredited investors.\n-\nReal-Time Liquidity – Investors can access and redeem holdings without traditional settlement delays.\nBy choosing Solana as one of the fund’s deployment networks, CMBIAM underscores the blockchain’s scalability, low transaction fees, and robust developer ecosystem—qualities that make it an ideal foundation for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).\nOutset PR: Reading Market Trends Before They Happen\nIn the fast-moving crypto market, narrative timing can be as important as the news itself. Outset PR is a crypto-focused communications agency that closely monitors market shifts to help clients position their stories at the perfect moment—just as CMB’s Solana move aligns with growing RWA adoption.\nIf PR has ever felt like navigating a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data-driven strategies. The agency uses both retrospective and real-time metrics to craft campaigns with lasting impact, replacing vague promises with concrete publication plans tied to market-fit narratives and performance-based media targeting.\nUnlike agencies that rely on mass-blast outreach, Outset PR takes a tailored approach, calibrating each campaign to the client’s goals, budget, and growth stage. This personal, research-backed method ensures messaging aligns with product-market reality—maximizing relevance and conversion potential.\nOne of Outset PR’s biggest differentiators is its in-house traffic acquisition system. This combines organic editorial placements with SEO and lead-generation strategies, enabling clients to land on high-discovery surfaces and drive traffic far beyond what conventional PR can deliver.\nAnalytical Edge in Media Targeting\nOutset PR’s internal analytics desk tracks the performance of crypto media outlets across:\n-\nDomain activity\n-\nMonth-on-month visibility shifts\n-\nAudience geography\n-\nTraffic sources\nThese insights allow Outset PR to select the most impactful outlets for each story—raising industry standards for PR targeting. For example, this careful curation boosted user engagement for Step App in the US and UK markets.\nFrom Effort to Outcome\nIn Web3 PR, one of the biggest challenges is the gap between visibility and business impact. Outset PR bridges this with customized, data-backed campaigns that map every stage—from spend to measurable result—ensuring PR investment translates into market presence.\nLearn more about Outset PR’s Services\nMarket Implications for Solana\nInstitutional adoption is a powerful catalyst for blockchain ecosystems. Tokenized money market funds bridge the gap between the $7 trillion traditional money market and the fast-evolving digital asset space, offering:\n-\nCredibility Boost – Institutional-grade offerings lend regulatory confidence and attract conservative capital.\n-\nOn-Chain Activity Growth – Each new RWA product increases transaction throughput and liquidity.\n-\nSustained Demand for SOL – As Solana becomes the go-to platform for institutional deployments, the utility and value proposition of SOL strengthens.\nWhile this launch alone won’t send SOL straight to $300, it builds the structural case for a long-term bullish trajectory—especially if similar institutional initiatives follow.\nTechnical Outlook: SOL’s Path Toward $300\nSource: tradingview\nSolana's price is currently between $167 and $192. It's in the green this week, showing an increase of over 14%. This month, it climbed almost 19%. Yet, it still lags behind a bit over the past six months. The key resistance is at $201, and if Solana breaks past it, it could aim for $226. That's a nice jump from where it sits now. But there's also a safety net nearby at $151 if it dips. With its RSI and other indicators suggesting it might be a touch oversold, there’s room for Solana to grow and shine in the near future.\nConclusion\nCMB International’s tokenized USD money market fund on Solana is more than just a headline—it’s a signal that institutional players are ready to engage with high-performance blockchain infrastructure. Combined with bullish technical setups, the $300 target for SOL is now firmly on the radar.\nIn such a climate, narrative precision matters. Agencies like Outset PR, with their ability to spot market trends early and deploy high-performance media strategies, give blockchain projects the visibility edge they need to ride momentum—turning market events into measurable growth.\nYou can find more information about Outset PR here:\nWebsite: outsetpr.io\nTelegram: t.me/outsetpr\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "The competition to create the next meme coin is starting to pick up again. The two frontrunners, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, are being challenged by Dogelon Mars in the race to $0.01. Shiba Inu and Dogelon Mars are planning to compete with Dogecoin in the foreseeable future. While they compete with each other, both are planning to buy back and burn to increase their coin supply and burn mechanism repeatedly. However, a fast-emerging underdog, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE), now in Stage 10 of its presale and trading at just $0.0019, is generating serious momentum. This isn’t just another frog-themed meme token—it’s a Certik-audited, purpose-driven Layer 2 ecosystem that could leap past both DOGE and SHIB in price performance before they even sniff $1.\nDOGE Is Closer Than SHIB, But Still Faces the Weight of Legacy\nDogecoin has stood the test of time better than most expected. Due to its active community and regular support from Elon Musk, Dogecoin has managed to survive multiple market cycles. One issue, however, is Dogecoin's limited uses and the fact that it is an older blockchain, which newer ones are constantly outpacing in development. While it does have a strong cultural significance and a lower token supply, reaching a value of $1 is not likely to happen anytime soon. In contrast, Shiba Inu, despite a vibrant ecosystem and the launch of Shibarium, remains bogged down by its trillion-token supply, requiring enormous market cap growth to reach $1. Even bullish analysts only foresee SHIB hitting fractions over the next few years. Between the two, DOGE clearly has the upper hand in reaching the $1 mark, but it’s still years away unless a market mania-level surge reappears. That’s where Little Pepe comes in—not just as a meme, but as an ecosystem optimized for speed, adoption, and viral growth.\nLittle Pepe ($LILPEPE): A Meme Coin With Real Utility and Zero Tax\nNow in Stage 10 and selling for only $0.0019, Little Pepe is the native utility token of the Little Pepe Layer 2 blockchain, built to redefine the meme coin landscape. Unlike most meme coins that rely solely on hype and community, Little Pepe comes fully packed with infrastructure:\n-\nA fast, EVM-compatible Layer 2 chain built for meme coins\n-\nUltra-low gas fees and instant finality\n-\nA sniper-bot-proof trading environment—a first in crypto\n-\nZero buy and sell tax, making it perfect for active traders and DeFi lovers\nIts smart contracts are secured by one of the most reputable firms in the blockchain industry, Certik. This level of due diligence is rare in the meme coin world and in turn, boosts credibility and investor confidence. With a fixed listing price of $0.003, current buyers at $0.0019 are positioned to gain over 57% instantly upon launch—and that's before factoring in organic growth or CEX listing surges.\nWhy $LILPEPE Could Hit $1 Before DOGE\nThe secret to Little Pepe’s rapid rise lies in its strategic design. The project isn’t just about virality—it’s about velocity. Its tokenomics, capped tax-free structure, and aggressive roadmap (now way ahead of schedule) are crafted to drive both utility and hype. Additionally, the project is backed by anonymous meme veterans who’ve helped several top meme coins reach multi-million-dollar market caps. And with plans to launch on two major centralized exchanges immediately post-presale—and a roadmap targeting the biggest global exchange—visibility and access won’t be an issue. More importantly, Little Pepe is positioned in a way that neither DOGE ever was in their infancy: as a meme coin with its own blockchain, one that hosts a dedicated memes Launchpad, a growing DeFi ecosystem, and community governance in the pipeline. These features give it more in common with early-stage Solana or Polygon than with traditional meme tokens. With its strong fundamentals and high-octane community support, Little Pepe’s journey to $1 could come faster than anyone expects—and certainly before DOGE finishes its own marathon.\nConclusion: The Meme Coin Race Has a New Front-Runner\nWhile Dogecoin may have the edge over Shiba Inu in the race to $1, it’s Little Pepe that could surprise the market entirely by beating both of them to the punch. Backed by advanced tech, Certik-level trust, and meme-powered virality, Little Pepe is more than just hype—it’s a hypercharged, next-gen meme coin ready to dominate. If you're looking for the next breakout star in crypto's meme arena, this frog might just out-hop the dog.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "The cryptocurrency market is back in bearish territory as Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies lost momentum thanks to adverse macroeconomic conditions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s statement that the US government does not plan to purchase additional BTC also soured investor sentiment. However, Bessent later backtracked on that statement.\nBTC registered a sharp decline after surging to a new all-time high on Thursday. The flagship cryptocurrency reached $124,533 but lost momentum, plunging over 4% to $118,389. However, it has recovered during the ongoing session, up nearly 1% at $119,101.\nEthereum (ETH) buyers lost momentum after it failed to cross $4,800. As a result, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency fell to an intraday low of $4,482 before reclaiming $4,600 and moving to its current level. ETH is down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around $4,650. Ripple (XRP) is down over 3%, while Solana (SOL) is down 2%, trading around $196 after slipping below $200. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) are both down over 4%, while Chainlink (LINK) is down 3.65%, trading at $22.50. Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial declines.\nDunamu And MB Bank Plan Vietnam’s First Licensed Cryptocurrency Exchange\nSouth Korea's Dunamu, the operator of Upbit, has announced a partnership with MB Bank to launch Vietnam’s first licensed cryptocurrency exchange. The partnership will see Dunamu provide technology, infrastructure, and expertise to MB Bank. MB Bank has over $50 billion in assets and 33 million customers. The collaboration will also ensure regulatory compliance, investor protections, and talent development. Dunamu CEO Oh Kyoung-suk stated,\n“Vietnam has potential with more than 20 million virtual asset holders and the world’s fifth-largest inflow of blockchain-based assets. When this growth potential meets the Upbit model, it will be a chance to build Vietnam’s entire digital financial infrastructure on a foundation of trust.”\nThe timing of the partnership is crucial as it comes following Vietnam’s passing of the Law on Digital Technology Industry. The law formally legalizes and regulates digital assets, paving the way for a fully regulated crypto market.\nCoinbase Believes Altcoin Season Could Be Upon Us\nCryptocurrency exchange Coinbase believes there could soon be a shift to cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (BTC), highlighting substantial growth registered by altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Coinbase Institutional’s global head of research, David Duong, stated in a monthly outlook report,\n“We think current market conditions now suggest a potential shift towards a full-scale altcoin season as we approach September.”\nCoinbase joins a growing number of traders and market experts who believe the scales are tipping in favor of an altcoin season. According to Coinbase, altcoin season occurs when 75% of the top 50 altcoins by market capitalization outperform BTC over the preceding 90 days. Duong added that a significant amount of retail capital remained on the sidelines, stating that Federal Reserve easing could unlock greater retail participation.\nAnother factor that could decide the arrival of altcoin season is Bitcoin dominance. Bitcoin dominance fell around 10% to 59% by August, indicating early stages of capital rotation into altcoins. Crypto day trader Ito Shimotsuma stated,\n“Bitcoin dominance has just formed its first monthly bearish cross since January 2021. Back then, altcoins went up only for four months when it happened. Something similar this time will cause an up-only rally till December 2025.”\nDuong believes growing institutional interest in ETH could be the driving factor behind the latest altcoin season. Digital asset treasuries and stablecoin narratives are driving institutional interest in the world’s largest cryptocurrency.\n“With the altcoin market cap climbing and the Altcoin Season Index showing early positive signals, we believe conditions are setting up for a potential rotation into a more mature altcoin season as we head into September.”\nBitcoin (BTC) Purchases Still On The Table\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent walked back on his previous statement that the US government would not buy additional Bitcoin (BTC). Bessent issued a clarification on X, stating that the US was still exploring budget-neutral strategies to buy BTC.\n“The Treasury is committed to exploring budget-neutral pathways to acquire more Bitcoin to expand the reserve, and to execute on the President’s promise to make the United States the ‘Bitcoin superpower of the world.”\nBessent’s earlier statement had dampened investor sentiment, with BTC tumbling from record highs to a low of $117,208 on Thursday.\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\nBitcoin (BTC) crossed $123,000 on Wednesday and settled at $123,365. The flagship cryptocurrency surged to a new all-time high on Thursday, reaching $124,533. However, it lost momentum after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s statement and an adverse PPI report. As a result, BTC plunged over 4%, dropping to a low of $117,208 before settling at $118,289. The current session sees the price up almost 1%, trading around $119,108.\nBTC’s drop below $118,000 led to the liquidation of $227 million in leveraged bullish positions. But why did the flagship cryptocurrency register such a substantial decline after hitting its all-time high? Some analysts believe the 3.3% increase in the US Producer Price Index (PPI) for July prompted traders to become risk-averse, as inflation figures came in higher-than-expected. However, traditional markets recovered their losses, indicating that BTC’s decline was driven by other factors. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the implied probability of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates fell to 61%, compared to 67% a week earlier. This indicates reduced confidence in monetary easing, which weighs on crypto prices.\nMeanwhile, the Bitcoin options market is showing resilience, with the options skew at 3%, indicating a balanced risk outlook consistent with healthy market opportunities. Crypto trader Nebraskangooner believes BTC is beginning to mimic the pattern seen in its previous cycle. On the other hand, crypto trader Kale Abe said that Nebraskangooner’s observations were another instance where “charts and fractals don’t matter.”\n“The only thing that matters is the treasury companies and if they are out of ammo or not.”\nBTC started the previous week in positive territory, rising 0.73% to cross $115,000 and settle at $115,051. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.82% to a low of $112,622 before settling at $114,112. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as BTC rose 0.80% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,028. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price rallied, rising over 2% to cross $117,000 and settle at $117,515. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC was back in the red on Friday, dropping 0.71% to $116,683. The price registered a marginal decline on Saturday before rebounding on Sunday, rising 2.42% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,309.\nSource: TradingView\nBTC reached an intraday high of $122,219 on Monday as bullish sentiment intensified. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $118,701, ultimately dropping 0.51%. Market sentiment turned positive on Tuesday as the price recovered, rising 1.19% to cross $120,000 and settle at $120,113. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to settle at $123,365. The flagship cryptocurrency surged to a new all-time high on Friday, reaching $124,533. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level, dropping over 4% to $118,389. The current session sees BTC up almost 1% as buyers look to reclaim $120,000.\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\nEthereum’s (ETH) rally stalled on Thursday as it failed to cross the $4,800 mark. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency rallied to $4,783 on Wednesday only to lose momentum on Thursday, falling over 4% to $4,551.\nDespite the wobble, analysts remain confident that ETH will hit $5,000 by the end of August. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is trading around $4,600 as the market comes to terms with a hotter-than-expected PPI report. However, users at Polymarket are bullish, thanks to institutional interest, positive technical patterns, and on-chain metrics. Traders have already established levels that ETH must maintain to continue its uptrend. This includes levels around $4,000 and $4,600. According to Rekt Capital, ETH must turn $4,600 into a new support level to confirm its upside into price discovery.\n“The sooner ETH reclaims black, the better. In the event of a failed reclaim, price could reject into its Weekly CME Gap at $4K, with the scope for wicking into the $3,750 zone.”\nETH started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 6% and settling at $3,488. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 3%, slipping below $3,400 to $3,393. ETH recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to reclaim the $3,500 level. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price rallied, rising over 6% to cross $3,700 and settle at $3,721. ETH was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping nearly 3% to $3,612. It rebounded on Wednesday, rising over 2% and settling at $3,685. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH rallied, rising over 6% to cross $3,900 and settle at $3,911. The price crossed $4,000 on Friday, rising 2.52% and settling at $4,010.\nSource: TradingView\nETH continued pushing higher on Saturday, rising over 6% to cross $4,200 and settle at $4,262. Despite the positive sentiment, ETH lost momentum on Sunday, registering a marginal decline. Sellers retained control on Monday as the price dropped 0.59% to $4,226. ETH rallied on Tuesday, surging nearly 8% to cross $4,500 and settle at $4,589. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price rose 3.40% to $4,745. However, ETH lost momentum on Thursday, dropping over 4% to $4,551. The current session sees ETH up almost 2%, trading around $4,636.\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\nSolana (SOL) slipped below the $200 mark on Thursday as selling pressure and volatility returned. The altcoin’s impressive rally has seen its value surge, breaking above key resistance levels. Buyers will look to reclaim $200 and push the price towards $250 or higher. SOL crossed $200 on Wednesday after nearly a month. SOL’s rally can be attributed to several bullish developments over the past week. Public companies have upped their SOL purchases to access the blockchain’s staking rewards.\nSOL started the previous weekend with a sharp drop, falling nearly 6% on Friday and settling at $162. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell 2.57%, slipping below $160 and settling at $158. It recovered on Sunday, rising over 2% to reclaim $160 and settle at $162. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as SOL rallied, rising nearly 5% to settle at $169. The price returned to bearish territory on Tuesday, falling 3% to $164.

Buyers retained control on Saturday as the price rose 1.01% and settled at $10.98. However, it faced volatility on Sunday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control.

        "text": "BtcTurk has suspended crypto withdrawals after a suspected $48 million hot wallet hack, with blockchain analysts tracing the stolen funds across multiple networks.\nBtcTurk Security Breach\nTurkish cryptocurrency exchange BtcTurk has paused crypto deposits and withdrawals following the detection of unusual activity in its hot wallets on August 14, 2025. The platform confirmed that the majority of assets remain secured in cold storage and assured customers that their holdings are unaffected. Trading services and Turkish Lira transactions continue without disruption.\nAuthorities have been informed, and BtcTurk says it is working with cybersecurity teams to secure its infrastructure and assess the scale of the breach.\nBlockchain Firms Trace Stolen Funds\nBlockchain security firm Cyvers reported detecting approximately $48 million in suspicious transactions linked to the breach, involving assets such as Ether (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), Arbitrum (ARB), Base (BASE), Optimism (OP), Mantle (MANTLE), and Polygon (MATIC). According to Cyvers, the attacker moved funds to two addresses before initiating swaps.\nLoss estimates vary across analytics platforms. Lookonchain reported at least $23 million stolen, while CertiK put the figure closer to $50 million. CertiK’s data indicates that the stolen assets were moved across three wallets, including two Ethereum addresses.\nRepeat Incident After 2024 Hack\nThe latest breach comes just over a year after a June 2024 incident in which BtcTurk lost roughly $55 million through unauthorized withdrawals from hot wallets. That event prompted swift intervention from Binance, which froze over $5.3 million in stolen funds.\nFollowing the 2024 hack, CEO Özgür Güneri stepped down after seven years, with founder Kerem Tibuk assuming the role of acting CEO. The leadership change was part of BtcTurk’s broader expansion strategy targeting markets in Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific.\nMarket Impact and ETH Price Outlook\nWhile the suspected hack has not triggered a major sell-off, market analysts are watching ETH closely. The attacker’s conversion of stolen funds into Ether could add selling pressure if liquidated quickly. Technical levels place key resistance for ETH at $3,500 and support near $3,000; a break below could open the path to $2,800.\nIf market sentiment treats the breach as an isolated incident, ETH could rebound, supported by ongoing developments in Ethereum’s layer-2 ecosystem. On-chain data shows heightened transaction activity in the attacker-linked wallets, with ETH price fluctuations of around 1–2% in the hours following the breach.\nBitcoin has remained above $60,000, and some traders expect BTC dominance to rise if investors seek perceived safer assets. Institutional flows show mixed sentiment, with certain funds maintaining ETH exposure while others pivot to stablecoins or regulated equities tied to the crypto sector.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Bitcoin’s market dominance has slipped below the 60% threshold, igniting speculation that an altcoin season may be on the horizon. This shift opens the door for alternative cryptocurrencies like XRP and Cardano to capture greater market share and investor attention. With technical setups hinting at possible breakouts, the current environment could mark the start of a broader rally in altcoins.\nIn this analysis, we examine the price action of leading contenders and explore how Outset PR’s data-driven PR strategies can help projects seize momentum during pivotal market transitions.\nBitcoin Surges with Potential for Continued Growth\nSource: tradingview\nBitcoin's current price hovers between one hundred fourteen thousand and one hundred twenty-one thousand dollars. This marks a 2.53% gain over the past week. The price has the potential to climb higher, approaching its next resistance level at around one hundred twenty-three thousand dollars. If it surpasses this level, it might aim for the second resistance at nearly one hundred thirty thousand dollars. That could mean a potential growth of more than 6% from its current high end. While the recent growth is encouraging, its past month shows a slight dip. However, the past six months indicate a strong upward trend, boasting nearly a 21% increase.\nXRP Eyes Growth Amid Market Fluctuations\nSource: tradingview\nXRP is navigating between $2.93 and $3.41. Recent gains hint at a slow climb upwards. Resistance kicks in at $3.63, where reaching this level marks a significant move. A surge to $4.12 could see more than a 20% rise from its low spot. Support lies at $2.67, with a deeper cushion at $2.19. The 10-day average sits below the 100-day, suggesting caution but not ruling out a rebound. XRP has grown over 12% in half a year, hinting at a gradual upward trend. The RSI marks it as being potentially oversold, sparking hopes of a new rally. Enthusiasts watch for steady gains backed by recent positive momentum.\nPR with C-Level Clarity: Outset PR’s Proprietary Techniques Deliver Tangible Results\nIf PR has ever felt like trying to navigate a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data.

It fuses organic editorial placements with SEO and lead-generation tactics, enabling clients to appear in high-discovery surfaces and drive multiples more traffic than through conventional PR alone.\n|\nCase in point: Crypto exchange ChangeNOW experienced a sustained 40% boost in reach after Outset PR amplified a well-polished organic coverage with a massive Google Discover campaign, powered by its proprietary content distribution engine. |\nDrive More Traffic with Outset PR’s In-house Tech\nOutset PR Notices Media Trends Ahead of the Crowd\nOutset PR obtains unique knowledge through its in-house analytical desk which gives it a competitive edge.

It's data-backed and insight-driven with just the right level of boutique care.\nCardano Eyes Growth as ADA Shows Strong Momentum\nSource: tradingview\nCardano's ADA is making waves in the crypto market. Its price is in the upper seventy-cent range, testing the lower eighty cents. A strong 21% increase in the last week and a 22% rise over the past month signal potential upward momentum. Resistance looms at ninety-one cents, with further gains possible toward a second resistance of slightly over a dollar. Such a rise could mark growth in the region of 24% from its current position. Support sits at the mid-sixty-cent range, providing stability against dips. Despite the cautious optimism, ADA's moderate RSI suggests more room to grow. Investors eye this native token closely for its breakout potential.\nConclusion\nA decline in Bitcoin’s dominance often signals that capital is rotating into altcoins, creating opportunities for substantial gains in well-positioned projects. With XRP eyeing key resistance and Cardano building on recent strong momentum, the stage may be set for notable upside in the altcoin market.\nFor teams looking to amplify their visibility and leverage this shift, Outset PR’s data-led, market-aware approach ensures narratives are delivered at the right time, in the right places, to the right audiences — turning market trends into tangible results.\nYou can find more information about Outset PR here:\nWebsite: outsetpr.io\nTelegram: t.me/outsetpr\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "New meme coins often grab attention with dreams of big returns. With SHIB, PEPE, and rising contender XYZVerse each drawing crowds, the race heats up. Some hope to spot the token poised for huge gains in the coming market surge. Which one could deliver a life-changing return as excitement builds among traders?\nXYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin?\nThe buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch.\nThe current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price.\nBullish Mood on $XYZ\nXYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow.\nXYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster, who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.”\nMore Than Just a Meme Coin\nUnlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value.\nRight now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention.\nStill Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends\nBeyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time.\nA Community-Driven Project With Big Plans\nOne thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility.\nThe recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use.\nAs part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem.\nCould XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin?\nWith a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look.\nJoin XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity\nShiba Inu (SHIB)\nSource: TradingView\nSHIB trades between 0.00001227 and 0.00001447, pushing above both short and long averages. A 1-week jump of 11.84% shows fresh energy after a slow 4.08% climb over the past month. Even with a 17.47% slide in 6 months, momentum is tilting back to buyers.\nThe 10-day average at 0.00001396 now sits over the 100-day line at 0.00001351. RSI reads 47.76 and the stochastic sits near 34, both hinting that room still exists before the coin looks stretched. MACD hangs just above zero, signaling mild upward pressure rather than a sharp spike.\nIf volume keeps building, the nearest ceiling at 0.00001536 may come into play. A break there opens a path to 0.00001756, about 22% above the top of the current band. Failure to hold gains drags the coin toward the floor at 0.00001096, roughly 18% below today’s low. A deeper pullback could test 0.000008766, but the recent upside swing and improving averages suggest SHIB has a better shot at nudging higher than melting lower in the short term.\nPepe (PEPE)\nSource: TradingView\nPEPE has swung both ways this spring. The coin gained 14.32% in the past week after drifting just 1.28% lower over the month. A 17.47% six-month climb shows steady traction. Today the price hovers between 0.00001046 and 0.00001315, rubbing against the 10-day SMA at 0.00001230 and the 100-day SMA at 0.00001195. That tight cluster signals a market that is pausing but not tired.\nMomentum tools lean to a cautious upside. RSI sits at 44.65, almost neutral, while the Stochastic reading of 21.97 hints at an oversold patch ending. MACD edges into the green at 0.0000000359. If buyers clear the nearest ceiling at 0.00001424, the door to 0.00001693 opens. That break would add roughly 30% from the lower bound of today’s range and about 20% from the current mid-price.\nSupport at 0.00000886 is the line bulls must defend; a dip there means a 25% slide from current levels and could drag price toward the deeper floor at 0.00000617, another 30% lower. Given the half-year uptrend and fresh weekly pop, probability tilts toward a slow grind higher, yet the narrow range shows the market will demand clear volume before any decisive leap.\nConclusion\nSHIB and PEPE show promise, but XYZVerse stands out with its unique sports and meme blend, aiming for huge growth and community-driven success.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Dubai, UAE, August 15th, 2025, Chainwire\nEarly-stage Crypto presales present a rare opportunity for investors to get in at the lowest valuations before a token hits the open market. On 15th of August, Ethereum has tested the $4,750 mark, signaling strong momentum as altcoin season indicators turn positive.\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index leaning toward greed and the Altcoin Season Index showing an upward trend, market sentiment is shifting toward altcoins, creating a favorable backdrop for new and emerging projects. Pepeto, the Ethereum-based meme coin, is approaching the close of Stage 9 of its presale after raising $6,187,248 in total. With a price of $0.000000147 per token, the project continues to attract attention from both meme coin enthusiasts and the wider crypto market.\nStage 9 Nearing Completion: Pepeto Presale Interest Holds Strong\nStage 9’s momentum reflects consistent investor attention. Each stage has moved quickly, and demand has been supported by Pepeto’s clear utility roadmap. Not relying solely on viral hype, Pepeto’s core value lies in its exchange platform, which is already set to list the next wave of meme coins in 2025. Applications for legitimate Web3 projects are open, and a demo version of the exchange has been showcased across social channels, a move that positions the project for sustained relevance.\nCommunity Engagement Meets mid August 2025 Market Timing\nPepeto’s rise comes during favorable market conditions, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index leaning positive and altcoin season beginning to take shape. The project reports strong engagement across social platforms, contributing to visibility in a competitive market. Its appeal is further supported by two independent audits, from SolidProof and Coinsult, reinforcing transparency and security. Known for its subtle connection to one of the biggest names in meme coin history, Pepeto carries the same 420 trillion token supply as Pepe, with its name born from a playful twist, taking “P E P E” and leaving “T O.” This tie to meme culture, combined with its focus on real infrastructure, is helping it stand out during a busy presale season.\nThis diligence has drawn attention from more cautious investors seeking credible opportunities in the meme coin sector.\nWhat’s Next for $PEPETO?\nWith Stage 9 nearly complete and the token’s public debut drawing closer, Pepeto enters a decisive phase. The funding raised so far provides a strong base for initial liquidity and visibility once trading begins. As the presale moves toward its final stages, market watchers will be looking at how Pepeto leverages its exchange, PepetoSwap, cross-chain bridge, and 245% staking rewards to capture attention in a sector driven by both community and innovation.\nAbout Pepeto\nPepeto is an Ethereum-based meme coin combining viral appeal with functional utility. Its ecosystem includes a zero-fee exchange, PepetoSwap technology, a cross-chain bridge, and high-yield staking. Built to merge meme culture with lasting infrastructure, Pepeto’s mission is to create a secure and accessible environment for trading and community growth, backed by audited smart contracts and an engaged global following.\nDisclaimer:\nTo buy PEPETO, make sure to use the official website: https://pepeto.io. As the listing draws closer, some are attempting to capitalize on the hype by using the name to mislead investors with fake platforms. Stay cautious and verify the source.\nFor more information :\nWebsite : https://pepeto.io\nTelegram : https://t.me/pepeto_channel\nTwitter : https://x.com/Pepetocoin\nContact\nCOODaniel B\nTokenwire\n[email protected]\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Sometimes the market breathes. And when it does, savvy investors lean in.\nAfter months of rising tensions between the EU and the US, news just broke that the European Union is officially pausing its retaliatory tariffs for six months as both sides edge closer to a landmark trade deal. That’s not just a bureaucratic win, it’s a psychological shift. Emotion drives motion in crypto; this pivot opens new bullish opportunities.\nWhile traditional markets feel the relief of de-escalation, crypto often reacts with even more excitement, especially as global uncertainty eases. Trade tensions typically slow adoption, partnerships, and infrastructure growth. Certain coins look primed for a solid run now that there’s fresh room to breathe. And among them, one unexpected contender is catching serious fire.\nLet’s dive into the five cryptos you should have on your radar right now, and why Little Pepe (LILPEPE) might just be the one that runs away with the show, potentially soaring over 21,985% shortly.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin with Monster Momentum\nDon’t let the memes fool you, Little Pepe is no joke. The presale is already in Stage 10, with the token now selling at $0.0019. And with 89.19% of this stage already filled, time is truly ticking. Once Stage 10 ends, the price ticks up again to $0.0020, and then eventually launches at $0.0030, offering buyers at today’s rate a potential 60.89% gain before exchange listings even happen.\nBut it’s the broader picture that makes things even more exciting. Early investors from Stage 1 have already seen 90% growth. And with only 20 stages in total, the window for entry is shrinking fast. There’s even a $777,000 giveaway happening to boost the hype. LILPEPE has already landed on CoinMarketCap and passed a full Certik audit, giving it credibility that many meme coins never achieve.\nIn a calmer trade climate where attention is shifting from fear to fun, LILPEPE could explode in popularity. It has the storytelling, the community vibes, and the viral energy that made past meme coins millionaires’ playgrounds. Analysts are already whispering about a potential 21,985% surge post-launch.\nStellar (XLM): Quiet, Useful, and Gaining Ground\nWhile meme coins bring the buzz, XLM continues to build real-world relevance. As of today, it’s trading around $0.40, and its upcoming Protocol 23 upgrade, launching on testnet this month and hitting mainnet in early September, has analysts bullish again.\nIf things move as expected, XLM could rise to $0.52 soon, with more upside if volume continues pouring in.\nSolana (SOL): Institutional Eyes Are Watching\nPriced at around $168–$170, Solana may not feel cheap. However, it still might be undervalued, especially now, as institutional investors have grown increasingly. Experts, including some from Bitget, call for a potential move toward $300, assuming bullish market support stays intact.\nChainlink (LINK): The Hidden Hero of Web3\nCurrently trading at around $16.60, Chainlink is quietly doing what it does best: connecting blockchains to real-world data. Over the past year, LINK has risen by 55–66%, and technical analysts are confident it could reach $25 to $40 within this cycle, especially if Web3 projects scale as expected.\nToncoin (TON): The High-Risk, High-Reward Contender\nTON is that mysterious altcoin that could either fizzle or fly. With some analysts forecasting prices as high as $9.90 in the coming months, there’s plenty of speculation behind it. Current market sentiment puts it closer to $3.60, meaning many outcomes exist. But in a world without trade wars hanging overhead, risk assets like TON tend to get more attention.\nFinal Thoughts: A Trade Truce Is a Green Light\nThe EU’s decision to pause its counter-tariffs for six months is more than just headlines; it’s a signal. Markets want clarity. Investors wish for peace of mind. And crypto thrives when fear recedes, and speculation rises. That’s precisely where we are now. From the real-world adoption of Stellar and Chainlink, to the explosive potential of LILPEPE, these five cryptos are positioned to thrive in this new global moment.\nThis might be your second shot if you missed the last meme wave. With the presale at $0.0019 and a launch price of $0.003, the current opportunity offers more than 60% upside before even hitting exchanges. And if it hits its rumoured potential? You could be looking at a life-changing 21,985% return. You can still grab LILPEPE at presale right here.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "San Francisco, California, August 15th, 2025, Chainwire\nCaldera, the internet of interconnected, modular blockchains, announced a partnership with Mawari, which is launching its network to power global infrastructure for real-time streaming of immersive 3D content. The partnership additionally positions Mawari Network to join Caldera's metalayer interoperability network, enhancing the platform's ability to deliver high-performance, low-latency AR/VR experiences worldwide.\nRevolutionizing Spatial Computing Infrastructure\nMawari Network represents a breakthrough in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), orchestrating storage, bandwidth, and rendering capabilities through a globally distributed network of GPU nodes. The platform's patented 3D streaming technology reduces bandwidth usage by 80% while ensuring seamless delivery of interactive, immersive, and contextually relevant spatial computing experiences.\n“Caldera lets us persist stream-quality measurements—latency, jitter, dropped frames, and frame accuracy—on-chain in near real time,” said Luis Oscar Ramirez, Founder & CEO of Mawari. “Guardian Nodes produce signed QoS attestations that are batched to the rollup; these records inform node reputation, routing, and reward calculations based on observed performance. Anchoring this loop on Caldera’s high-throughput rollup makes our quality and usage data transparent and auditable for the Mawari Network ecosystem.”\n“We’re incredibly excited to have Mawari join the Caldera ecosystem,” said Matthew Katz, CEO of Caldera. “Mawari is pioneering an entirely new application of blockchain technology for the delivery of XR content.”\nProven Market Adoption\nMawari's XR streaming technology is already being used by two of Japan’s biggest VTuber agencies – Brave group and Virtual Avex. Together, they first showcased Mawari’s vTubeXR product at the Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai Japan in late May and each are part of Mawari’s Early Access Program, designed to give Early Access Partners priority access to new features, dedicated onboarding support, and customizable monetization opportunities. Mawari plans to expand vTubeXR to a broader range of VTuber production companies and IP holders, supporting the evolution of both user experience and business models.\nTechnical Innovation Meets Market Demand\nThe Mawari Network utilizes two core technologies: Mawari’s patented spatial streaming technology that works with Unity and Unreal Engine, and a strategically distributed network of edge computing nodes positioned near end-users. This architecture enables smooth AR/VR experiences on everyday devices by handling computationally intensive rendering remotely.\nWith the extended reality market projected to exceed 100 million devices within five years, Mawari's DePIN approach democratizes participation by allowing anyone with GPU capacity to contribute to the network while earning rewards.\nLooking Forward\nThe launch marks a significant milestone in bridging XR and Web3 technologies. Mawari Network's utility-based revenue model, backed by physical infrastructure and growing enterprise partnerships, positions the platform for sustainable growth across market cycles.\nAbout Caldera\nCaldera is the internet of blockchains, an ecosystem of modular, interconnected, and customizable chains.

        "text": "The Cardano (ADA) bullish outlook is supported by whale accumulation of 200 million ADA, reinforcing the momentum toward the $1 psychological mark. Dogecoin (DOGE) support analysis shows stability at $0.21, signaling a potential 30% surge if the buying pressure continues.\nYet, Cold Wallet(CWT) is rewriting the rulebook altogether. With a cashback-first model, $6 million raised, and Stage 17 priced at $0.00998 against a $0.3517 listing, it offers a 3,423% ROI potential. Compared to ADA’s steady climb and DOGE’s meme-fueled volatility, Cold Wallet’s market-ready adoption edge could make it the most lucrative move in 2025.\nCardano Eyes $1 Breakout as Whales Scoop Up 200M ADA\nCardano (ADA) is holding strong near $0.81, and recent whale activity has grabbed attention; 200 million ADA tokens shifted into large wallets in just 48 hours. Analysts are watching the $0.84–$0.88 zone closely: a decisive move above this resistance could pave the way toward the psychological $1 milestone.\nOn-chain indicators show moderate bubble risk, suggesting market strength without overheating and that the rally could be sustainable. The long-term ascending trendline remains intact, adding technical support to the bullish thesis.\nWith whales accumulating, the scattered chart strength, and a reasonable momentum, a move beyond $1 could trigger renewed buying and broader momentum. For long-term investors, Cardano’s setup now offers a potentially favorable entry ahead of a breakout.\nDogecoin Eyes 30% Surge As Whale Buying Signals Strength\nDogecoin (DOGE) has found its footing around the $0.21 support level; a zone that previously sparked strong rallies. Analysts suggest that as long as DOGE holds above this level, it could launch a 30% upside move toward approximately $0.26. This outlook follows a recent rebound from a pullback near $0.20, with buyers stepping in at key price points.\nNotably, large holders accumulated over $200 million worth of DOGE in a single day, signaling renewed confidence and fueling bullish sentiment. Technical indicators are lining up in DOGE’s favor. Patterns such as a rounded bottom and a potential MACD golden cross suggest broader momentum may follow. For speculative traders and meme-coin enthusiasts alike, this setup combines clear entry levels with evidence of strong buying demand.\nCold Wallet’s $6M Presale Turns Fee Refunds Into Growth Power\nCold Wallet is removing two of the biggest barriers to Web3 adoption: high participation costs and slow onboarding. Instead of letting gas, swap, and transfer fees drain user value, Cold Wallet refunds them directly, making every action inside the ecosystem a value-positive event. This cashback-first model builds loyalty from the first transaction, creating a reason for users to stay active long-term.\nThe integration of Plus Wallet supercharges this launch. Over 2 million pre-existing accounts are already connected, meaning Cold Wallet begins at scale on day one. This is not a theoretical roadmap; with $6 million raised and more than 716 million tokens sold, it is already a fully funded build in motion.\nStage 17 of crypto presale pricing is set at $0.00998, compared to a fixed $0.3517 listing goal, offering an eye-catching 3,423% potential ROI. Early buyers in Stage 1 entered at $0.007 and are already seeing measurable gains. With each stage sold, that profit gap closes, adding urgency for new participants.\nFor those looking for a market-ready crypto project with adoption, liquidity, and incentives already in place, Cold Wallet delivers an ecosystem designed for rapid scale, and the window to enter at its current price is closing fast.\nWhy Cold Wallet Holds the Real Edge\nCardano (ADA) bullish outlook points toward a breakout, and Dogecoin (DOGE) support analysis teases a short-term rally, but neither offers the built-in adoption advantage Cold Wallet commands. By refunding fees and onboarding over 2 million Plus Wallet users instantly, Cold Wallet enters the market with scale, liquidity, and retention hardwired from day one.\nStage 1 buyers at $0.007 are already ahead, and each presale stage narrows the profit gap toward the $0.3517 listing. In a year where the strongest plays will be those that merge utility with immediate traction, Cold Wallet is not just riding the market; it is positioned to reshape it entirely.\nExplore Cold Wallet Now:\nPresale: https://purchase.coldwallet.com/\nWebsite: https://coldwallet.com/\nX: https://x.com/coldwalletapp\nTelegram: https://t.me/ColdWalletAppOfficial\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "We are arguably entering into the final phase of this crypto bull market. There is the possibility that Bitcoin could go a lot higher. However, for traders looking to maximise their gains, albeit by also partaking in a huge amount of risk, the memecoins are the go-to trade. $DOGE, $PEPE, and $PENGU are favourites, but which will perform the best?\n$DOGE back in a strong uptrend\nSource: TradingView\nThe 8-hour time frame for $DOGE shows the steady uptrend since June of this year. A swing high in July did take the price to $0.28, which was followed by a big dip, but as can be seen, the price is back above the ascending trendline, and with the short-term time frame Stochastic RSIs at the bottom, the bulls would hope to make another higher high in this latest mini uptrend.\nSource: TradingView\nLooking at $DOGE on the weekly time frame it can be noted that the last swing high took the price to the 0.618 Fibonacci extension. The bulls will need to take $DOGE above this in order to avoid a failed rally. The 0.786 Fibonacci at $0.59 is a good target.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the MACD shows the indicator line nicely above the signal line, while the first green histogram bars are printed. Expect these indicator lines to continue to rise.\n$PEPE price inside an ascending triangle?\nSource: TradingView\nFor $PEPE, could it be that the price action is traversing within an ascending triangle? If so, this would be very bullish. The bulls will first need to push the price beyond the $0.000012 horizontal resistance, but then the top of the ascending triangle comes in at $0.000014. If the bulls can push the price through both barriers, the measured move could take the price to $0.000022.\n$PENGU price forming a bull pennant\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily chart for $PENGU shows some of the incredible rise that this memecoin has experienced. From bottom to top, the gain was around 1,130%.\nMany might have thought that after such incredible gains the $PENGU price would start a major retracement. Far from it. Instead, the price has chopped sideways and downwards and a pennant formation is taking shape. This is a bullish continuation pattern. If the bulls can send the price out of the top of the pennant, the measured move could take the price out to $0.065 - another 2x. Not bad for a memecoin that has already made such large gains.\nConclusion\nWhile $PEPE and $PENGU might be pretty good, if risky bets, $DOGE is still the king of the memecoins, and if it is a race between these three, $DOGE has the name and the possibility, no matter how dubious, that it could still be used by Elon Musk as a future payment option, perhaps on X.

        "text": "The crypto bull run is nearer than ever, evident by Bitcoin's ascent to a new high of $124k and Ethereum's rally above $4,700. Experts have picked Cardano, Unilabs, and Tron as the best altcoins to buy now.\nCrypto Jaibrah predicts the Cardano price could soar to $2 by September and $4 by December. Tron is expected to surge to $0.45. Meanwhile, Unilabs (UNIL) is capturing attention with predictions that its value could pump by 5x. The presale gem has given early holders up to 100% ROI and has more up its sleeves.\nCardano (ADA): Analysts Predict Major Breakout and Year-End Surge\nAfter a consistent spell of consolidation at $0.75 and $0.84, the Cardano price has surpassed the next psychological resistance of $0.95. CoinMarketCap shows the Cardano price has increased by 30.1% on the 7D chart.\nWith sustained volume and higher buying pressure, the value of the DeFi crypto might cross $1.00 soon. The Cardano price is technically bullish. The RSI reads 62 which gives room for an uptrend. Supporting this bullish momentum is the ADI, which flashes a buy signal.\nMeanwhile, Crypto Jaibrah has shared a bullish outlook, forecasting that the Cardano price could hit $2 by September and reach a final target of $4.83 by December. This ambitious prediction suggests a strong rally ahead for ADA in the coming months.\nSupporting this view, Mr Brownstone says he fully anticipates a breakout in the Cardano price. He expects the DeFi coin to rise to $1.18 and $1.33. If these levels are cleared, Mr Brownstone forecasts the Cardano price might pump to $1.57.\nTron (TRX) Price Holds Bullish Outlook as Key Resistance Level Nears\nATOMB, a top crypto analyst, stated in a recent X post that the Tron price is still bullish. However, he argued that the $0.36 level will be the actual test of whether it can break out higher.\nHe told his followers that if the Tron price stays above this level for an extended time, then it can surge up towards $0.42 and $0.45 levels, indicating strong potential for further increase. However, if Tron fails to hold $0.35, a pullback to $0.32 could happen.\nAnother expert, Jack, posted a similar Tron price forecast. He noted that the value of the DeFi token could soar to $0.45. At the moment, CoinMarketCap data shows that the Tron price pumped by 7.5% on the 7D chart.\nThe Tron price has crossed the $0.36 mark, a sign that buying pressure is rising. The Tron price requires a prolonged close above this level to start a rally.\nUnilabs (UNIL): The Best AI-Powered Hedge Fund Management Platform\nThe DeFi market is gaining traction exponentially with the market size expected to rise to $231.19 billion in 2030. Amid this expansion, Unilabs has emerged as a leading platform, integrating AI to offer innovative investment solutions.\nUnilabs offers four distinct investment funds (AI, BTC, RWA, and Mining Funds) catering to various investor preferences. These funds leverage AI-driven analytics to identify high-potential projects, enabling users to diversify their portfolios effectively.\nAlso, the platform's staking program offers competitive returns, which are higher than what the like of Lido ETH offers. Unilabs investors can earn up to 122% APY. Furthermore, Unilabs distributes 30% of its revenue to UNIL token holders, providing an additional income stream.\nAmong the reasons why Unilabs should be considered outstanding there is the set of AI-based tools that can maximize investment strategies. The AI Market Pulse combines on-chain the off-chain analytics to offer real-time findings on market trends and movement of tokens and avenues. This gives the investors the strength to make sound decisions out of detailed data analysis.\nUnilabs raised over $12.8 million in funding, and UNIL is now trading at $0.0097. Analysts see massive advancement with some projecting a 10x gain when the token gets listed on major exchanges.\nWhat Are The Best Cryptos To Invest In As the Bull Market Begins?\nAs the crypto market heats up, Cardano, Unilabs, and Tron are emerging as top altcoins for the bull run. With promising price forecasts and strong growth potential, these blue-chip altcoins offer investors a prime opportunity to maximize returns. Unilabs is offering a 50% bonus for smart investors who purchase UNIL coins using the code CMC50 for a limited time.\nFind out more about the Unilabs (UNIL) Presale Today:\nWebsite: https://unilabs.finance/\nTelegram: https://t.me/unilabsofficial\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/asked-to-predict-2025s-biggest-gainer-grok-ai-picked-this-token-to-turn-100-into-22000-like-dogecoin-doge-in-2021",
        "text": "In 2021, Dogecoin (DOGE) shocked the world by turning a simple internet joke into one of history's most profitable crypto trades. With just $100, early buyers saw returns of over $20,000 as DOGE surged nearly 22,000%. The same question now looms as the 2025 bull run approaches: Which token will be the next DOGE? Analysts at X (formerly Twitter) ran the question through Grok, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot trained on real-time financial data, social sentiment, and market structure to find the answer. Grok didn’t hesitate. When asked to name the meme coin most likely to replicate DOGE’s historic rise, it gave a surprising answer: Little Pepe (LILPEPE). Here’s why Grok AI—and an increasing number of human analysts—believe LILPEPE could turn $100 into $22,000 by 2026.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): More Than a Meme, It’s an Entire Blockchain\nGrok’s pick may sound like another frog-themed meme coin, but Little Pepe is far more than a meme—it’s an entire Layer-2 blockchain dedicated to powering the next generation of meme tokens. In a space crowded with ERC-20 tokens offering little more than hype, Little Pepe stands apart as the only memecoin project building its infrastructure. The team is launching a lightning-fast, ultra-low-cost Layer-2 network explicitly tailored for meme coins. No more clogged networks. No more $50 gas fees. No more sniper bots front-running presales. This is the first meme coin blockchain ever created, and the $LILPEPE token powers it all—from transaction fees and staking to launching new projects via its built-in meme coin launchpad.\nCurrent Presale Stats: You’re Still Early\nLILPEPE is in Stage 10 of its presale with the following key stats:\n-\nPrice per Token: $0.0019\n-\nNext Stage Price: $0.0020\n-\nUSD Raised: $16,583,704 of $19,325,000\n-\nTokens Sold: 11.3B of 12.75B\n-\nPresale Progress: 88.68%\nWith just over 10% of presale tokens remaining, Grok’s pick still offers an ideal entry for early believers. The presale outperformed expectations, signaling immense community support and early momentum. Even a modest investment—say $100—gets you over 52,000 LILPEPE tokens at the current price. If the token rises to just $0.42 (a realistic target by bull market standards), that $100 could become $22,000—just like Dogecoin in 2021.\nWhy Grok AI Chose Little Pepe Over Other Meme Coins\nGrok’s selection wasn’t random. The AI based its pick on on-chain metrics, tokenomics, community activity, and narrative strength. Here's what stood out:\n-\nLayer-2 Chain Focused on Meme Coins\nUnlike other tokens that run on Ethereum or Solana, Little Pepe has its blockchain. This gives it full control over speed, gas fees, and scalability—optimized for meme coins. It’s the first chain designed to support viral tokens, making it the most important infrastructure project in meme coin history.\n-\nZero Tax and CertiK-Audited\nMany meme coins impose hefty taxes on buys and sells. LILPEPE imposes zero tax, making it ideal for trading and liquidity. Even more impressive, the project was audited by CertiK—one of crypto’s most respected security firms—with a score of 95.49%. This reduces smart contract risk and boosts investor confidence.\n-\nBacked by Proven Meme Coin Veterans\nThe team behind Little Pepe includes anonymous experts who’ve helped launch and scale several top-50 meme coins in the past. With their track record of viral growth and exchange listings, LILPEPE could be the next major player in the meme coin arena.\n-\nMajor Exchange Listings Confirmed\nAt launch, LILPEPE will debut on two top-tier centralized exchanges, giving it instant credibility and liquidity. Rumors also suggest plans to list on the world’s largest exchange, although the name has not been confirmed. This CEX momentum could spark a surge similar to DOGE’s listings in 2021.\nTokenomics: Built for Growth and Security\nLILPEPE’s carefully structured tokenomics model is built to support growth while ensuring liquidity and ecosystem sustainability:\n-\n26.5% – Presale Allocation\n-\n30% – Chain Reserves\n-\n13.5% – Staking & Rewards\n-\n10% – Liquidity Provision\n-\n10% – DEX Listing & Market Making\n-\n10% – Marketing\n-\n0% – Tax on Transactions\nThe presale benefits early adopters, while the 30% chain reserve ensures the long-term health of the Layer-2 network. A dedicated marketing allocation fuels campaigns, influencers, and meme virality—crucial in today’s hype-driven meme coin world.\nCommunity and Giveaway Fueling Hype\nLittle Pepe’s growing community has already generated serious buzz online. The team has launched a $777,000 giveaway to celebrate the presale and upcoming launch:\n-\n10 winners will each receive $77,000 in LILPEPE tokens\n-\nTo enter: contribute at least $100 to the presale and complete a few social tasks (e.g., follow, share, tag)\nThis campaign is driving significant exposure and onboarding thousands of new holders—similar to the early viral marketing seen with SHIB and DOGE.\nAnalysts Agree: This Could Be the Next Breakout\nWhile Grok’s pick may have surprised some, it’s increasingly aligned with human sentiment. Crypto analysts are beginning to call LILPEPE the sleeper hit of the next bull market.\nWhy? Because it combines:\n-\nViral meme potential\n-\nStrong fundamentals\n-\nReal utility via its blockchain\n-\nMassive presale adoption\n-\nSecurity via CertiK audit\n-\nUpcoming Tier-1 listings\nThis makes LILPEPE more than just a gamble—it’s a calculated bet with asymmetric upside.\nFinal Thought: $100 Today, $22,000 Tomorrow?\nWe’ve seen it before. In 2021, Dogecoin soared from obscurity to glory—and minted thousands of new millionaires. Could 2025 be the year LILPEPE writes a similar story? Grok AI thinks so. And with LILPEPE still under $0.002, the math is simple: $100 could become $22,000—if this frog-themed blockchain pulls a Dogecoin-level moonshot. With less than 12% of presale tokens remaining and the next stage price approaching, now may be your last chance to board this meme train before it takes off.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "As the 2025 crypto cycle heats up, one narrative is breaking through the noise — meme coins that combine cultural relevance with real blockchain utility. At the center of this surge is Pepe Dollar (PEPD), a parody of the U.S. Federal Reserve that merges meme culture with Layer-2 technology, deflationary tokenomics, and integration into gaming ecosystems. Analysts point to the ongoing Pepe Dollar (PEPD) presale as one of the most lucrative opportunities in the current market, citing its ability to unite meme hype with lasting on-chain value. The presale has already attracted over $1.2M, with each stage seeing rapid sell-outs. Investors looking to capture early gains are locking in allocations before the launch price gap closes.\nLil Pepe (LILPEPE) Brings Layer-2 Speed To Meme Culture\nWhile Pepe Dollar (PEPD) dominates the meme-utility conversation, Lil Pepe (LILPEPE) is building momentum as a meme project backed by a Layer-2 EVM chain. Raising over $18.4M toward its $19.3M target, Lil Pepe (LILPEPE) has positioned itself as a scalability-driven alternative in the meme space. Transaction costs are minimal, speeds are instant, and the network’s meme-native culture appeals to both traders and developers. However, market analysts note that while Lil Pepe (LILPEPE) is carving out a unique position, its growth path is more dependent on ecosystem adoption compared to Pepe Dollar (PEPD)’s multi-market utility strategy.\nWhy Pepe Dollar (PEPD) Is Set For The Bigger ROI\nWhat sets Pepe Dollar (PEPD) apart is the layered value proposition. The token will operate on Ethereum Layer-2 for ultra-low fees, use deflationary burns to manage supply, and provide staking rewards for long-term holders. On top of that, the development team has confirmed integration into a mobile gaming ecosystem and payment-Fi modules, creating a multi-channel demand funnel. This diverse utility gives Pepe Dollar (PEPD) more resilience against pure hype cycles, allowing it to capture both speculative traders and utility-focused investors.\nHow To Join The Pepe Dollar (PEPD) Presale\nJoining the Pepe Dollar (PEPD) presale is straightforward. Investors can connect a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or WalletConnect to the official pepedollar.fun site, choose the preferred payment currency (ETH, USDT, BNB, or others), and confirm the transaction. Tokens are reserved instantly, with price tiers increasing as each stage sells out. Given the projected launch price of $0.03695 from a current entry point under $0.005, early investors could see gains exceeding 600% if targets are met post-listing.\nMarket Analyst Takeaway\nAccording to leading market strategists, both Pepe Dollar (PEPD) and Lil Pepe (LILPEPE) are primed for significant runs this cycle. But the broader ecosystem reach, staking mechanisms, and deflationary model give Pepe Dollar (PEPD) the upper hand in delivering outsized ROI. For those aiming to ride the meme coin momentum wave with a safety net of real-world utility, locking in Pepe Dollar (PEPD) now could be the best decision of the 2025 bull run.\nJoin Pepe Dollar Presale:\nPepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/\nPepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity\nPEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/coldware-set-to-hit-1-at-launch-little-pepe-coin-holders-buy-cold-to-hedge-crypto-portfolio",
        "text": "Coldware (COLD) has emerged as one of the most ambitious presales of 2025, blending Web3 hardware innovation with a utility-first crypto model. Investors are increasingly speculating that Coldware (COLD) could debut at $1 or higher when it lists on major exchanges. What’s surprising to many observers is just how many Little Pepe (LILPEPE) holders are now buying into the Coldware presale — not to abandon their meme coin positions, but to hedge their portfolios ahead of the 2025–26 bull cycle.\nColdware’s $1 Launch Potential\nThe $1 launch projection for Coldware is grounded in real numbers. The project has already delivered a 310% presale price increase across early stages, is targeting a $200 million total raise, and is releasing its own Larna 2400® Web3 device. This hardware acts as a secure crypto wallet, Lite Node staking hub, and encrypted VPN gateway — all in one sleek package. Unlike purely speculative tokens, Coldware (COLD) offers investors something tangible that can generate recurring demand as more devices ship worldwide.\nWhere most crypto projects rely on post-launch hype to sustain momentum, Coldware is building an active user base before it even lists. That early adoption could be the catalyst for a strong opening price, with some analysts suggesting a market cap leap into the top 50 within months.\nWhy Little Pepe Coin Holders Are Buying Coldware\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) is no stranger to explosive presale hype. With over $16.4 million raised at a presale price of $0.0019, it has positioned itself as a key contender in the 2025–26 meme coin supercycle. Its unique Layer 2 blockchain for meme culture — complete with sniper bot resistance and a built-in Launchpad — has already won the attention of retail traders worldwide.\nHowever, even the most bullish LILPEPE holders recognize that meme coin price action can be volatile. The same hype that propels tokens to 10x gains can lead to equally sharp corrections. This is where Coldware fits into the strategy — by allocating a portion of their capital into COLD, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) investors are balancing high-risk meme exposure with a fundamentally solid utility project.\nBuilding a Balanced Bull Run Portfolio\nIn the coming bull run, two narratives are set to dominate: the meme coin mania fueled by cultural virality, and the utility-driven adoption led by projects that solve real problems.\n-\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) represents the first category, aiming for rapid market penetration with meme energy and blockchain-level infrastructure.\n-\nColdware (COLD) represents the second, offering secure hardware, staking incentives, and device-based network participation.\nCombining both in a single portfolio creates a layered strategy: LILPEPE provides the moonshot potential, while COLD acts as the anchor for sustained value growth.\nPresale Synergy Between COLD and LILPEPE\nThe two projects also share key similarities that make them complementary investments:\n-\nStrong Presale Performance: LILPEPE’s $16.4M raise and COLD’s multi-stage price jumps prove sustained demand.\n-\nCommunity Momentum: Both projects have cultivated passionate followings, driving organic marketing and presale urgency.\n-\nClear Roadmaps: LILPEPE’s Layer 2 launch and Coldware’s hardware rollout give investors fixed milestones to track.\nInterestingly, many wallet addresses show overlapping participation in both presales, suggesting that savvy early adopters are stacking positions in these top performers.\nColdware’s Adoption Flywheel\nThe real power of Coldware lies in its product-driven adoption cycle. As more users buy the Larna 2400® device to access secure crypto storage, VPN privacy, and staking rewards, the demand for Coldware (COLD) tokens increases. This isn’t just speculative buying — it’s functional buying tied directly to product usage. For Little Pepe (LILPEPE) holders, this means they are exposed to a project that grows organically, not only from market sentiment but also from real-world hardware sales.\nConclusion\nColdware (COLD) is shaping up to be one of the most talked-about presales of the year, with a realistic path to a $1 launch price and beyond. For Little Pepe (LILPEPE) holders, adding Coldware to their portfolios is less about abandoning meme coin potential and more about creating a safety net for sustained gains. In a bull market that rewards both cultural hype and real utility, this hedge strategy could prove to be one of the smartest plays of 2025.\nFor more information on the Coldware (COLD) Presale:\nVisit Coldware (COLD)\nJoin and become a community member:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Thursday witnessed quite a collapse in the Bitcoin price as PPI data came in very much worse than expected. However, the real bombshell was Treasury Secretary Bessent’s comment that the US would not be buying Bitcoin for its Strategic Reserve, a comment that he may now have walked back on.\nAwful US PPI data\nSome pretty awful Producer Prices data was released on Thursday which put the skids under the Bitcoin price. It showed that the Producer Price Index had risen 3.3% on an annual basis last month compared with a forecast figure of a 2.5% gain. This could even have implications for the expected rate cut in September.\nBessent not buying - then buying again\nHowever, what really sent the Bitcoin price into collapse mode was U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent’s statement during an interview on Fox News that the US government would not be buying Bitcoin to add to its Strategic Reserve.\nNotwithstanding, only a few hours later in a post on X, the Treasury Secretary appeared to contradict his earlier statement by affirming the following:\nTreasury is committed to exploring budget-neutral pathways to acquire more Bitcoin to expand the reserve, and to execute on the President’s promise to make the United States the “Bitcoin superpower of the world.”\nWhether Bessent miscommunicated in his Fox News interview, or whether he meant what he said, it would seem that the second statement has put Bitcoin purchases back on the agenda.\nDip results in closing CME gap and retesting bull flag\nSource: TradingView\nIf it wasn’t for the trigger of the two valid shocks to the market, one might have thought that the recent sharp dip in price was highly manipulated. Not long after making a new all-time high, the $BTC price fell precipitously all the way down to close the CME gap and retest the top of the bull flag. If you also throw into the mix the fact that short-term momentum indicators were able to reset, the collapse may have had a silver lining.\nRight now the $BTC price is up against the $119,000 horizontal resistance level. It would be expected that there may be a pause here, but given the bounce from the Stochastic RSI indicators, the pause might only be temporary.\nBulls need to get $BTC price back on track\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily chart shows the trend breaks in the price action and also in the RSI. For both it can be observed that it wouldn’t take too much for the price to get back above those uptrends. Concentrating on the RSI, it will be important for the indicator line to rise above the descending trendline (black line) in order to get back on track.\n$119,000 is the important level to hold over the weekend\nSource: TradingView\nThe weekly time frame view for $BTC reveals a candle that is far from good looking. The bulls will be hoping that the candle becomes green and fills up over Friday and the weekend. Even if this doesn’t really happen, the main thing is to stay above what is starting to become a strong level of support at $119,000.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the RSI illustrates how important it is for the indicator line to finally break through the descending trendline. When it does, this is likely the signal that $BTC is heading into its next leg higher.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/blockdags-50m-daily-buyer-battles-steal-the-spotlight-from-bonk-and-ethereums-rally-is-this-the-top-crypto-to-buy-now",
        "text": "This week’s market headlines are a mix of short-term volatility and longer-term opportunity. BONK has pulled back sharply, testing key support after a failed breakout attempt, while Ethereum is flashing a rare technical alignment that some analysts believe could define the remainder of this bull market. Both stories are grabbing attention, one for its resilience at a critical price level, the other for its potential to lead altcoins higher.\nBut in the background, BlockDAG is executing a presale campaign that blends competitive buying features, widespread accessibility, and an already-secured post-launch trading framework. While traders react to BONK’s price drop and Ethereum’s bullish signal, long-term investors are weighing whether BlockDAG’s unique mechanics could position it as the top crypto to buy in the current market cycle.\nBONK’s Bounce Back Battle: From Sharp Drop to Support Strength\nBONK fell nearly 6% over the past 24 hours, moving from $0.00002606 to $0.00002436 after repeated rejections near $0.000027 on August 11. The drop was accompanied by a surge in trading volume to 1.13 trillion tokens, well above the daily average of 708 billion.\nSelling pressure continued into August 12, but the token found firm support at $0.000024 with 889 billion tokens traded. Buyers stepped in, pushing BONK up 3% to $0.000025, suggesting short-term stabilization and cementing $0.000024 as a key support level.\nThe price action followed news that Nasdaq-listed Safety Shot had invested $25 million in BONK ecosystem development via the Bonk.fun launchpad. This corporate-level involvement points to growing mainstream exposure for meme coins. Technical levels now show resistance at $0.000027 and support at $0.000024, with the rebound clearing $0.000025 intraday.\nEthereum’s Once-in-a-Decade Signal: The $4,850 Question\nEthereum is showing what analyst Kevin of Kev Capital calls a “once-in-a-decade” alignment of bullish signals. Since his May call for “ETH season,” ETH has climbed more than 150%, with related altcoins like Chainlink and Uniswap also rallying.\nThe move began with a rare monthly demand candle at major support, paired with oversold momentum indicators, including a V-shaped Stock RSI turnaround and an imminent monthly MACD cross. Similar setups on ETH dominance and ETH/BTC charts suggest sustained ETH outperformance.\nKevin cautions that Ethereum’s previous all-time high of $4,850 remains the final hurdle before open price discovery. Until that level is broken on high timeframes, the market stays in a high-reward but high-risk phase. Potential U.S. interest rate cuts in September, October, and December could add fuel, but traders are urged to watch for pullbacks before committing to resistance.\nBlockDAG’s Triple Threat: Buyer Battles, 2.5M Mobile Miners, and a Roaring Presale\nWhile BONK and Ethereum are fueling immediate trading conversations, BlockDAG is building momentum through features designed to engage, expand, and deliver from the outset. One of its most distinctive elements is Buyer Battles, a daily competition where the largest buyer of the day receives any unsold BDAG allocation for free. This creates a strategic layer to participation, rewarding both timing and commitment. By resetting the contest every 24 hours, it keeps the playing field level and encourages steady presale activity.\nEqually impactful is the reach of the X1 mobile miner app, which has already drawn over 2.5 million registered users worldwide. The app enables mining without expensive hardware, letting anyone earn BDAG coins simply by engaging daily. This accessibility has transformed mining from a niche technical process into a global participation model, strengthening BlockDAG’s community before the network even launches.\nOn the liquidity side, 20 centralized exchange listings have been confirmed, including MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, LBank, and XT.com. This ensures that BDAG will be tradable across multiple platforms immediately post-launch, reducing price bottlenecks and expanding global reach from day one.\nTo date, BlockDAG’s presale has already raised over $373 million, reflecting strong market sentiment in its model. Currently in Batch 29, BDAG is priced at $0.0276, with an estimated launch price of $0.05, leaving notable upside potential for early buyers. This combination of funding strength, accessible entry, and confirmed market access underscores why BDAG is attracting attention as a top crypto to buy now.\nSumming Up!\nMarket watchers this week are splitting their focus between short-term trade setups and long-term positioning. BONK’s price drop underscores the volatility in the meme coin segment, while Ethereum’s rare technical alignment offers a glimpse at what could be the next major altcoin-led rally.\nBlockDAG, however, is delivering a presale with competitive buying incentives, massive early user participation, and guaranteed multi-exchange availability after launch. These elements put it in a different category, one focused on building an ecosystem before listing, rather than scrambling after the fact.\nFor investors seeking more than just a quick swing trade, BlockDAG’s approach positions it as a competitor for the top crypto to buy now, even in a market dominated by fast-moving headlines.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "In 2025, the meme economy is transforming, and Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is emerging as the flagship project for early investors who want utility as well as hype. Unlike traditional meme coins that thrive solely on community energy, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) merges Layer-2 Ethereum scaling, a deflationary burn model, and integration into meme-themed GameFi ecosystems. This combination has propelled the Best Crypto ICO beyond $1.2M in presale funding, attracting attention from both retail and whale investors. With staking options and tokenomics designed for sustainable growth, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is well-positioned to outperform many speculative plays in the coming bull run.\nSPX6900 Whales Look for New Highs\nThe rally in SPX6900 (SPX) has been closely tied to broader market sentiment. After breaking key resistance levels, SPX6900 (SPX) traders are now eyeing the $6,500 index target that could act as a catalyst for renewed confidence in meme-related assets. However, while SPX6900 (SPX) shows strength in traditional price action, many of its largest holders are diversifying into crypto assets with asymmetric upside — a trend that has naturally led some toward Pepe Dollar (PEPD). Analysts note that SPX6900 (SPX) may deliver solid index growth, but crypto offers a much more explosive risk-reward profile in 2025.\nToken6900 Investors Enter the MemeFi Arena\nToken6900 (T6900) has built a reputation for bold marketing and high-APY staking, with a community rooted in early 2000s meme nostalgia. While Token6900 (T6900) continues to raise significant presale capital, savvy investors are not putting all their eggs in one basket. Many are now adding Pepe Dollar (PEPD) to their portfolios, recognizing that while Token6900 (T6900) dominates the culture angle, PEPD dominates the utility angle. In a competitive meme economy, the winning plays are often those that combine narrative and functionality — exactly what Pepe Dollar (PEPD) delivers.\nWhy Pepe Dollar Could Outpace Both Rivals\nEven with the strong cultural traction of Token6900 (T6900) and the bullish sentiment around SPX6900 (SPX), Pepe Dollar (PEPD) stands out because of its presale structure and use case alignment. By securing Ethereum Layer-2 scalability, offering meme-based mobile gaming integrations, and maintaining deflationary pressure via regular token burns, PEPD is engineered for long-term holding. In addition, partnerships with NFT marketplaces and meme-driven communities add layers of liquidity and utility that pure speculation plays like SPX6900 (SPX) or culture-first coins like Token6900 (T6900) may not fully capture.\nConclusion — A Three-Way Play, One Clear Winner\nSPX6900 (SPX) gives investors stability and exposure to index-level price growth, Token6900 (T6900) delivers nostalgia-driven hype, but Pepe Dollar (PEPD) offers the most balanced combination of culture, utility, and deflationary economics. For those seeking a Best Crypto ICO that could multiply returns in 2025, PEPD’s momentum is undeniable. If current presale acceleration continues, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) could easily set the tone for the next meme-driven market cycle.\nJoin Pepe Dollar Presale:\nPepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/\nPepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity\nPEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "The Ethereum Foundation doesn’t seem to be easing off its ETH sell-off; the latest was a $31.5 million sale, which could impact the Ethereum price. Without ruling out a possible fluctuation, analysts have been doubling down on DOGE and Unilabs Finance (UNIL). While the Dogecoin price could go parabolic soon, UNIL is considered the best new crypto to invest in due to its blend of AI, DeFi and TradFi.\nIs the Ethereum Price Poised for a Pullback?\nThe Ethereum price crossed $4,700 this week, but the Ethereum Foundation has been quietly selling off ETH. According to recent reports, $31.5 million in ETH was sold this week, coinciding with Monday’s record $1 billion in ETF inflows.\nIs a pullback on the horizon? Following the 30% Ethereum price rally on the weekly chart and a 60% gain over the past 30 days, a correction can’t be ruled out. Moreover, momentum has been declining, as shown by the unimpressive daily trading volume.\nAdditionally, according to IntoTheBlock, there has been a decreasing netflow of $296 million over the past seven days, signaling increasing sales. While the Ethereum price is bound to break out above the 2021 high of $4,891, we might witness a pullback first before a bounce.\nIs the Dogecoin Price Ready for Its Big Leap?\nThe Dogecoin price soared by 30% over the past month, hovering above $0.25 from a 30-day low of $0.18. Momentum has been rising, evident in the 50% increase in the daily trading volume to $4.28 billion.\nJMarks, unrelenting in their optimistic Dogecoin price prediction, eyes $1.20 this cycle. If this forecast plays out, the dog-inspired crypto will trade significantly above its 2021 ATH of $0.73, making it a top pick this year.\nMeanwhile, according to Messari, mindshare is high, suggesting growing investor interest. A retest of $0.28 is expected to push the Dogecoin price above $0.35, a move experts believe could play out in the coming days.\nUnilabs Finance (UNIL) — What Makes it the Next Big Thing?\nUnilabs Finance (UNIL) is unique in the sense that it combines three of the most bullish narratives: AI, DeFi and TradFi. At this crossroads, it has been hailed as a game-changer, with its unique offering revolving around a novel AI-backed DeFi asset manager.\nMoreover, as a presale token, it is significantly undervalued and heavily discounted, currently available at $0.0097 in its sixth ICO stage. With a 415% gain programmed at the listing price of $0.05, it is arguably the best new crypto to invest in—a better alternative than top altcoins with large market caps.\nMoreover, over $12.8 million has been raised by the team in funding, highlighting massive investor interest. Key features of this decentralized asset manager include a self-custodial asset vault and a cross-chain trading hub (users can trade across multiple blockchains). Hence, it edges out Uniswap, a leading DEX on Ethereum with a $7.5 billion market size and stands out more thanks to its yield-sharing strategy and periodic airdrops.\nClosing Thoughts\nWhile the Ethereum price faces a potential downtrend, the Dogecoin price is poised to explode amid rising momentum. At the same time, UNIL, a fast-growing AI token, is seen as the best new crypto to invest in due to its strong growth potential and connection to traditional finance (TradFi).\nFor more information about Unilabs Finance (UNIL) visit the links below:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Coldware (COLD) is rapidly becoming the name that dominates presale leaderboards, with many analysts placing it in the same conversation as Remittix (RTX) and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) when talking about 2025’s most powerful early-stage crypto plays. Each project is riding a unique market wave — and together, they form what many are calling the “Presale Big 3” of this cycle.\nColdware’s Hardware-Backed Web3 Model\nWhile most presales rely on promises of future tech, Coldware (COLD) is delivering from day one with its Larna 2400® hardware device. This Web3-ready mobile terminal acts as a secure crypto wallet, Lite Node staking hub, and encrypted VPN gateway, giving every user a tangible reason to buy in. The Coldware presale has already recorded a 310% price increase across its early stages, with a target raise of $200 million to fund mass hardware rollout, staking rewards, and liquidity provisioning.\nRemittix: Solving a $19 Trillion Payments Problem\nRemittix has carved its own presale dominance by tackling real-world cross-border payments. With the ability to process crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries, audited smart contracts, and a wallet beta launching in Q3 2025, RTX is positioning itself as the PayFi disruptor of the cycle. Trading at $0.0922 with over $18.8M raised, Remittix offers a utility-driven roadmap that is attracting both retail and institutional backers.\nLittle Pepe: Meme Coin Meets Infrastructure\nLittle Pepe isn’t just another meme coin. It’s building its own Layer 2 blockchain designed purely for meme culture, with ultra-low fees, sniper bot resistance, and a built-in Launchpad for new token launches. At just $0.0019 in presale phase 10 and over $16.4M raised, LILPEPE blends meme hype with genuine blockchain utility — something the meme sector rarely sees.\nWhy These Three Stand Out\n-\nColdware: Hardware-first Web3 infrastructure with immediate user utility.\n-\nRemittix: Payment-first adoption tackling real-world finance.\n-\nLittle Pepe: Meme coin virality fused with blockchain tech.\nEach project taps into a different dominant narrative: infrastructure, payments, and meme culture. Combined, they give investors exposure to the three strongest drivers of the upcoming bull run.\nConclusion\nIn a presale market crowded with hype and vaporware, Coldware (COLD), Remittix, and Little Pepe have risen to the top by offering real products, strong tokenomics, and undeniable market demand. Investors chasing the “greatest presale of all time” narrative may find that this trio has already claimed the title.\nFor more information on the Coldware (COLD) Presale:\nVisit Coldware (COLD)\nJoin and become a community member:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Crypto presales are allowing investors to turn small amounts into life-changing sums. Some projects in early stages are targeting 200x growth, which could turn $500 into $100,000. Presales in 2025 that have good tech, clear tokenomics and actual utility are receiving the most attention. Analysts have pointed out such projects, and an Ethereum-based AI platform heads the list.\nOzak AI: Ethereum-Based AI With High ROI Potential\nOzak AI is building a predictive analytics platform for financial markets. It combines machine learning with blockchain to deliver real-time insights. Ozak Stream Network (OSN) ensures low-latency data processing, Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) handle secure distribution, Ozak Data Vaults provide safe storage and customizable Prediction Agents allow non-coders to build AI models for trading and forecasting.\nThe OZ token fuels the platform, covering transactions, AI agent customization, user rewards and governance rights. Tokenomics are designed for scalability and long-term demand with a capped supply of 10 billion distributed as:\n-\n30% presale\n-\n30% ecosystem and community\n-\n20% reserve\n-\n10% liquidity and listings\n-\n10% team\nThe current presale price is $0.005, with about 124 million tokens sold and $1.8 million raised. The next phase will increase the price to $0.01 and the target is set to $1. The entry fee is a minimum of 100 USD, either in ETH, USDT or USDC. Hitting its price target would turn a position having $500 into one with $100,000 with its theme of growth being 200x\nOther Presales With Strong Growth Cases\nBitcoin Hyper is building a Bitcoin layer 2 blockchain using Solana Virtual Machine tooling, ZK rollups and a canonical bridge. This allows smart contracts on Bitcoin while keeping interoperability with Solana.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) is a meme coin with Layer-2 performance. It’s set up for fast, low-cost transactions for meme tokens, NFTs and community projects. But it doesn’t have the broader multi-asset support of other platforms yet.\nRexas Finance (REX) is in the DeFi space, providing tools to interact with dApps and ensure liquidity at scale. The DeFi market is on the rise, but it is more narrow than platforms that cover multiple markets.\nLightchain (LTC) is entering the metaverse with integrated NFTs and virtual economies. It’s creating an interactive digital world for creators and users, one of the fastest-growing areas of blockchain.\nConclusion\nPresales with advanced tech and clear use cases are getting attention from investors. Ozak AI’s combination of Ethereum-based AI, decentralized infrastructure and customizable predictive tools is unique. Its presale metrics, capped supply and price targets are aligned to multiply early investments by 200x. Along with Bitcoin Hyper, Little Pepe, Rexas Finance and Lightchain, it’s a short list of presales with scale, vision and structure to deliver high returns. If you want to turn $500 into $100,000 in 2025, Ozak AI is leading the conversation.\nFor More Information about Ozak AI, visit the links below.\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "The crypto market has a way of surprising even the most seasoned traders. While Cardano remains a powerhouse in blockchain innovation, the excitement right now is shifting toward Ozak AI. This project isn’t just another token; it’s riding the twin waves of blockchain and artificial intelligence, and it’s doing so with a clear mission and an aggressive presale.\nOzak AI’s presale is already deep into stage four, with over 127 million tokens sold and $1.84 million raised. Priced at $0.005 now, with a listing goal of $0.05, some investors are quietly asking whether $2 could actually be in play before year-end. Sounds bold, but the foundation is there.\nWhy Ozak AI Is Turning Heads\nThis isn’t about empty promises. The protocol’s Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network, or DePIN, blends blockchain’s security with IPFS storage efficiency. That means data is safe, transactions are immutable, and single points of failure are eliminated. It’s the kind of setup that industries relying on real-time analytics dream about.\nOn top of that, the $1 million giveaway campaign has already crowned over 100 winners, showing that the team knows how to keep the community engaged. Big winners—$100,000 and $50,000—are pulling in fresh attention, and all it takes to qualify is a $100 presale buy-in.\nCardano vs. Ozak AI: Different Strengths, Different Play\nCardano plays the long game, focusing on methodical development and peer-reviewed updates. Ozak AI? It’s going for speed. The difference is almost like comparing a marathon to a sprint. Cardano’s established network is powerful, but Ozak AI’s hybrid AI-blockchain model could push it into niches Cardano hasn’t touched.\nData sharing via smart contracts, decentralized scaling, and secure storage are all in place. That’s why some early backers believe this isn’t a “what if” project but more of a “when” scenario. And when momentum builds in crypto, the climb can be faster than most expect.\nFor more information about Ozak AI, visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Amid the uncertainty, select altcoins are showing promising setups, offering potential opportunities for growth.\nThis analysis, supported by Outset PR’s commitment to delivering clarity through data-driven insights, explores Bitcoin’s current technical landscape and highlights how strategic communication can position projects to thrive in shifting market conditions.\nBitcoin Eyes Resistance: Will It Surge Higher Soon?\nSource: tradingview\nBitcoin is currently trading between $116K and $122K. It's been showing steady improvement, with a three-and-a-half percent rise in the past week and over twenty-one percent in the last six months. This momentum hints at further growth. The next big hurdle is around one hundred twenty-three thousand dollars. If Bitcoin can break through this, it might aim for one hundred twenty-nine thousand dollars. Such a move would increase its value from the current range by around seven percent. With positive signals from various indicators, investors are watching to see if Bitcoin can keep climbing in the near term.\nPR with C-Level Clarity: Outset PR’s Proprietary Techniques Deliver Tangible Results\nIf PR has ever felt like trying to navigate a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data.

        "text": "Ethereum (ETH) keeps showing its power, now priced near $3,800, and a lot of bullish voices are pointing to a possible climb to $7,200. That upbeat vibe is rippling through the whole altcoin market, and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is popping up as a hot new contender.\nEthereum's Bullish Setup Points to $7,200\nEthereum has been hanging tight above $3,500, forming higher lows that keep the climb steady. Analysts tell us that the latest move up looks like a solid continuation signal. The buzz is coming from deep-pocket investors and a solid rise in activity on decentralized apps, and both are pushing the charts in a positive direction. On-chain info shows that a bunch of wallets are quietly stacking more ETH, and the open interest in ETH futures is climbing, too. With all these signals lining up, many believe ETH could soon test $4,200, with some now eyeing a longer talk of a $7,200 target that a few market watchers have pinned on the horizon.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): Built for Speed, Backed by Community\nWhile Ethereum targets higher ground, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is catching serious attention with its creative take on the meme coin narrative. More than just another token riding the wave of humor and virality, LILPEPE is built on a Layer 2 solution, optimized for high transaction throughput, minimal fees, and network security, all while maintaining its identity in the meme coin space. With a playful, yet strategic vision, Little Pepe pays homage to the meme coin king, Pepe, while carving out its own identity through community strength, presale momentum, and planned listings on major centralized exchanges (CEXs).\nPresale Momentum Powers LILPEPE’s Rise\nLILPEPE’s presale performance has been exceptional. Already into stage 10, the project has raised over $19.84 million, signaling strong early support. The current price in this stage sits at $0.0019, with 1.5 billion tokens available for purchase and a target of raising $2.85 million before moving to the next phase. The presale structure reflects careful planning, with 26.5% of the total 100 billion token supply allocated to early supporters. The remaining distribution is as follows:\n-\n10% for liquidity\n-\n30% for chain reserves\n-\n10% DEX allocation\n-\n10% marketing\n-\n13.5% staking & rewards\n-\n0% tax\nThis distribution provides a clear path for both short-term liquidity and long-term ecosystem development.\n$0.50 Price Target: Ambitious but Not Impossible\nLILPEPE’s goal of reaching $0.50 may seem bold, but in the meme coin space, bold targets often define success. With a launch price under one cent, a move to $0.50 would represent over 26,000% in potential gains. According to market analysts monitoring presale tokens with growing hype and strong fundamentals, LILPEPE checks many of the boxes needed for a viral surge. Limited supply, growing community traction, clear tokenomics, and upcoming listings on two top-tier CEXs, plus the biggest global exchange, are ingredients that could support exponential growth. If Ethereum continues to rally, meme coins with strong narratives and early community engagement stand to benefit most. LILPEPE seems to be in a favorable position to ride that momentum.\nListings, Exposure, CMC Recognition, and Massive Giveaway\nThe team behind Little Pepe is setting the stage for a well-timed market debut. The token is already listed on CoinMarketCap, offering credibility and exposure ahead of launch. With plans confirmed for listings on two leading CEXs and the largest exchange globally, the launch strategy looks aligned with what investors often seek: visibility, liquidity, and community-driven growth. A major part of LILPEPE’s success lies in its vibrant and engaged community. To reward early supporters, the team has announced a giveaway for 10 winners, each receiving $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. With over 195,000 entries, the excitement is undeniable.\nConclusion\nEthereum’s momentum shows no sign of slowing, and its bullish setup continues to act as a catalyst across the altcoin landscape. Little Pepe (LILPEPE), with its creative identity, fast-selling presale, and solid ecosystem plans, is emerging as one of the most talked-about meme coins in recent memory. Its $0.50 target is ambitious, but with over $19.84 million raised, major listings on the way, and an energized community behind it, LILPEPE may just be getting started. Now still in presale stage 10, the clock is ticking for early supporters to get in before its major launch, and possibly, its parabolic rise.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "The crypto market is back in bullish territory, buoyed by Bitcoin (BTC) surging to a new all-time high. The flagship cryptocurrency smashed its previous all-time high of $123,091, surging past $124,000 to reach $124,457. However, it lost momentum following its new record, dropping to $121,411 before moving to its current level. BTC is up over 1% in the past 24 hours, trading around $121,670. Meanwhile, the crypto market cap is up 0.89% at $4.14 trillion.\nEthereum (ETH) continued its upward trajectory as it reclaimed the $4,700 mark after a brief wobble. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is up 1.13%, trading around $4,728. Solana (SOL) continued rising after crossing $200, reaching $209 before losing momentum and moving to its current level. Cardano (ADA) has registered substantial bullish sentiment over the past 24 hours, up nearly 11%. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) traded in the red, registering substantial declines.\nNew Google Play Rules Won’t Affect Non-Custodial Wallets\nNew Google Play rules will require crypto wallet providers in 15 jurisdictions, including the US and the EU, to be licensed and comply with “industry standards.” However, the rules do not affect non-custodial wallets. According to Google Play’s policy notice, the new changes come into effect on October 29. US-based developers will need to register with local regulators as a money services business or money transmitter, while EU-based developers must register as a crypto asset service provider. US-based companies registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as money services businesses must also meet specific requirements and implement an anti-money laundering program.\nGoogle addressed concerns regarding the impact of the new policies after uproar from the crypto community, stating,\n“Non-custodial wallets are not in scope of Google Play’s Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Software Wallets Policy. We are updating the Help Center to make this clear.”\nGoogle Play has a rocky relationship with the crypto industry. It banned crypto mining apps in 2018 and removed the Bitcoin Blast video game in 2020. It also took down several crypto news apps in the same year without giving any explanation. In 2021, the Play Store banned eight “deceptive” crypto apps that allegedly tricked users into paying for an illegitimate cloud service.\nJustin Sun Takes Bloomberg To Court\nTron founder Justin Sun has filed a lawsuit against Bloomberg to prevent it from publishing what he calls highly sensitive details about his cryptocurrency holdings. Sun filed the lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Delaware, stating that the disclosure would compromise his privacy and put him and his family at risk. Sun alleged that Bloomberg approached him earlier this year to be included in its online billionaires index. He added that before agreeing, Bloomberg assured him that any asset information would be kept confidential, and that this applied to his cryptocurrency holdings as well.\nSun claimed he agreed only after his assurance and provided detailed wallet and asset data to Bloomberg’s wealth verification team, believing any reference to his crypto holdings in his profile would be limited to a lump sum valuation and not be broken down by token type. Sun argues a detailed breakdown goes beyond what Bloomberg published for other crypto billionaires, adding that such details are not shared unless already public. According to Sun, a detailed disclosure of his holdings would enable blockchain trackers to identify and link his wallets, making him a prime target for hackers and potentially exposing him to physical attacks.\nNorth Korean Hacker Operations Exposed Thanks To Compromised Device\nA compromised device belonging to a North Korean IT worker has exposed the inner workings of a team behind the $680,000 Favrr hack. On-chain investigator ZachXBT revealed that an unnamed individual gained access to a North Korean IT worker’s computer, revealing screenshots, Google Drive exports, and Chrome profiles. The information on the device revealed how the hackers planned and carried out their attacks. ZachXBT also revealed that the hacker and his team were behind the June 2025 exploit of Favrr.\nThe compromised device showed that the team, consisting of six individuals, had 31 fake identities. The hackers collected government-issued ID and phone numbers to land blockchain development jobs. They also bought LinkedIn and UpWork accounts. ZachXBT also revealed an interview script that showed the hackers boasting about working with well-known blockchain firms like Polygon Labs, OpenSea, and Chainlink. The hackers also used Google tools to organize workflows. They also used spreadsheets to track budgets and schedules, and Google Translate to switch between English and Korean.\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\nBitcoin (BTC) surged to a new all-time high early on Thursday as expectations for an easier monetary policy from the Federal Reserve added to tailwinds from recently announced financial reforms. The flagship cryptocurrency crossed $120,000 on Tuesday and moved to $120,113. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as the price rallied, rising nearly 3% to settle at $123,365. BTC raced past $124,000 during the ongoing session, reaching a new all-time high of $124,533 before losing momentum and dropping to its current level.\nThe flagship cryptocurrency briefly flipped Alphabet’s $2.4 trillion market cap to become the world’s fifth-largest global asset, thanks to surging optimism among investors. BTC’s jump to a new all-time high of $124,553 also makes it the first cryptocurrency to cross Google’s $2.45 trillion market cap. Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss stated in a post on X,\n“Bitcoin all-time high and it’s only Wednesday.”\nThe post triggered a host of optimistic responses from fellow traders, including investor Kyle Chassé, who predicted this would be the “best week for Bitcoin.” BTC’s latest milestone has investors optimistic about its price discovery phase, which could see the flagship cryptocurrency reach Apple’s market capitalization next. BTC will need to cross $175,000 to flip Apple’s $3.4 million market capitalization. One analyst believes such a scenario may be possible by the end of August. However, even the $175,000 prediction remains modest compared to predictions made by BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes. Hayes believes BTC could surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025 if the Federal Reserve pivots to quantitative easing and injects more liquidity into the financial system.\nAnalysts believe institutional capital is the main driver behind BTC’s rally. Institutions have pivoted towards BTC thanks to favorable macro tailwinds and growing regulatory clarity. New US policies, including the GENIUS Act and 401(k) crypto allocations, have led to capital flowing into BTC, sustaining its upward momentum.\n“It is not just a wave of speculative enthusiasm; it is the groundwork for crypto’s integration into mainstream portfolios.”\nBTC registered a sharp decline on Friday (August 1), dropping over 2% and settling at $113,365. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 0.67% and settled at $112,601. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Sunday, rising 1.52% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,215. The price continued pushing higher on Monday, registering a 0.69% increase and settling at $115,051. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $112,707 on Tuesday as selling pressure returned. It rebounded from this level to reclaim $114,000 and settled at $114,051, ultimately dropping 0.83%. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.80% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,028.\nSource: TradingView\nBullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $117,000 and settle at $117,515. Despite the positive sentiment, the price was back in the red on Friday, falling nearly 1% to $116,683. BTC registered a marginal decline on Saturday but recovered on Sunday, rising 2.42% to reclaim $119,000 and settle at $119,309. The price surged to an intraday high of $122,319 on Monday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $118,701, ultimately dropping 0.51%. Market sentiment turned positive on Tuesday as the price recovered, rising 1.19% to cross $120,000 and settle at $120,113. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to settle at $123,365. The price surged to a new all-time high during the ongoing session, reaching $124,533. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and is down over 4%, trading around $117,951.\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\nEthereum (ETH) has stalled during the ongoing session, down over 4% after failing to cross $4,800 despite positive momentum. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency rallied on Tuesday, rising nearly 9% to cross $4,500 and settle at $4,589. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as ETH crossed $4,700. However, bulls lost momentum, falling to an intraday low of $4,455 before moving to their current level. Despite the decline, ETH is up 20% over the past week, dwarfing BTC’s recent uptrend.\nEthereum ETFs registered over $700 million in inflows, significantly higher than the $84 million recorded by spot Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum products have registered $2.2 billion in inflows over three days, seven times higher than the $330 million added by Bitcoin ETFs in the same period. ETH surged to an intraday high of $4,794 during the current session, less than 4% from its all-time high.\n“Spot eth ETFs post 3rd best inflow day ever… Over $700mil. 3 of the top 6 inflow days since launch have come *this week*. $3bil new $$$ over past 7 trading sessions. On another heater.”\nEthereum treasury firms have also stepped up their purchases, with BitMine Immersion, the world’s largest corporate ETH holder, announcing plans to raise its fundraising target by $20 billion to fund further ETH acquisitions. However, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin warned against ETH treasury companies, stating,\n“If you woke me up three years from now and told me that treasuries led to the downfall of ETH… my guess would be that somehow they turned it into an overleveraged game.”\nETH started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 6% and settling at $3,488. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 3%, slipping below $3,400 to $3,393. ETH recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to reclaim the $3,500 level. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price rallied, rising over 6% to cross $3,700 and settle at $3,721. ETH was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping nearly 3% to $3,612. It rebounded on Wednesday, rising over 2% and settling at $3,685.\nSource: TradingView\nBullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH rallied, rising over 6% to cross $3,900 and settle at $3,911. The price crossed $4,000 on Friday, rising 2.52% and settling at $4,010. ETH continued pushing higher on Saturday, rising over 6% to cross $4,200 and settle at $4,262. Despite the positive sentiment, ETH lost momentum on Sunday, registering a marginal decline. Sellers retained control on Monday as the price dropped 0.59% to $4,226. ETH rallied on Tuesday, surging nearly 8% to cross $4,500 and settle at $4,589. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price rose 3.40% to $4,745. Despite the positive sentiment, ETH is back in the red during the ongoing session, with the price down over 3% at $4,599.\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\nSolana (SOL) is down nearly 4% during the ongoing session, losing the $200 mark as market sentiment retreated. SOL posted an impressive rally on Tuesday, rising almost 10% to $191. The price continued pushing higher on Wednesday, crossing $200 and settling at $201. However, volatility and selling pressure caused buyers to lose momentum, with SOL down over 3% during the ongoing session. The altcoin crossed the $200 mark for the first time in almost a month.\nSOL’s rally can be attributed to several bullish developments over the past week. Public companies have upped their SOL purchases to access the blockchain’s staking rewards. Firms including Bit Mining, Upexi, and DeFi Development Corp have increased their SOL holdings, with plans to increase their stake substantially over the next few months.\nSOL started the previous weekend with a sharp drop, falling nearly 6% on Friday and settling at $162. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell 2.57%, slipping below $160 and settling at $158. It recovered on Sunday, rising over 2% to reclaim $160 and settle at $162. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as SOL rallied, rising nearly 5% to settle at $169. The price returned to bearish territory on Tuesday, falling 3% to $164. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as SOL rose 2.50% and settled at $168.\nSource: TradingView\nSOL continued pushing higher on Thursday, rising over 4% to cross $170 and settle at $175. The price registered a marginal increase on Friday, rising 0.79% to $176. Price action remained positive over the weekend as SOL rose 1.80% on Saturday and 1.51% on Sunday, crossing $180 and settling at $182. Despite the positive sentiment, the price lost momentum on Monday, dropping over 4% to $174. Bullish sentiment returned on Tuesday as SOL rallied, rising nearly 10% to cross $190 and settle at $191. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as SOL continued pushing higher, rising over 5% to cross $200 and settle at $201. However, the price is back in bearish territory during the ongoing session, down over 3%, with selling pressure and volatility persisting.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Ethereum whale group “7 Siblings” has sold $88.2 million worth of ETH, marking their first major liquidation since accumulating 1.21 million ETH, amid surging institutional inflows, record network activity, and prices approaching all-time highs.\nLarge-Scale Liquidation\nThe Ethereum whale group known as “7 Siblings” has sold 19,461 ETH, valued at approximately $88.2 million, within a 15-hour window, according to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain. This marks the group’s first major sale since amassing a total of 1.21 million ETH, currently valued at $5.6 billion. The transactions were executed at an average price of $4,532, just as Ethereum trades within 5% of its November 2021 all-time high of around $4,800.\nAccumulation History and Strategy\nBetween February 3 and April 7, the whale group purchased 103,543 ETH worth $229.7 million at an average price of $2,219. This buying spree included a notable $42.2 million acquisition of 24,817 ETH at $1,700 in early April. Transaction data shows the assets are distributed across multiple wallets, pointing to a deliberate strategy to diversify holdings and obscure large-scale movements. Significant deposits have also been made into Aave v3, a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol.\nInstitutional Inflows\nThe sell-off comes during a period of heightened institutional demand. Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have posted six consecutive days of inflows, totaling $523.9 million on August 12, following a record $1 billion single-day inflow earlier in the month. Corporate treasuries now collectively hold $16.4 billion worth of ETH across 64 companies, with BitMine Immersion Technologies topping the list at 1.2 million ETH valued at $5.27 billion.\nThe Ethereum Foundation also liquidated 2,795 ETH, worth about $12.7 million, in two transactions as prices hit yearly highs. This sale reduced the Foundation’s ETH holdings to just 99.9 ETH alongside 11.6 million DAI.\nThe move has sparked mixed reactions within the community, with some viewing it as strategic profit-taking and others criticizing the timing.\nNetwork Activity and Market Sentiment\nShort-term holders are currently realizing around $553 million in daily gains, significantly outpacing the activity of long-term holders, according to Glassnode. Despite a 43% price surge over the past month, ETH remains 39% below the previous month’s peak levels.\nMeanwhile, global search interest for “Ethereum” has reached its highest point since 2021, with North Macedonia, Switzerland, Singapore, Slovenia, and Austria leading the trend. Ethereum’s network has also hit a record 1.875 million daily transactions, underscoring strong on-chain activity.\nWhile some large holders are taking profits, others remain bullish. Over the weekend, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes disclosed that he had re-entered the market, purchasing Ethereum just a week after selling $10.5 million worth when the asset traded at $3,507. The divergence in strategies highlights ongoing uncertainty over whether the current rally has further room to run or is primed for a correction.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "The cryptocurrency market is buzzing as meme coins and utility projects alike benefit from renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin, is once again proving its influence over the altcoin sector with a breakout pattern targeting $0.295. At the same time, Coldware (COLD) holders are growing increasingly confident that the project’s unique combination of Web3 hardware and blockchain utility could deliver a 100X return as it approaches its highly anticipated launch.\nColdware’s Web3 Mobile Strategy Gains Traction\nWhile Dogecoin’s bullish chart is catching trader attention, Coldware (COLD) is preparing for a very different kind of breakout. The project’s Larna 2400® Web3 smartphone — available in its limited Discoverer presale tier for just $349 — is positioning itself as the first mass-market mobile device built to integrate blockchain directly into everyday use.\nRunning Android 15.0 with 6GB RAM, 128GB storage, and a 6.56-inch 120Hz OLED display, the device comes preloaded with key Coldware ecosystem apps. These include Coldware Wallet for multi-chain asset storage, ColdPay for direct crypto purchases using Visa or Mastercard, Coldware Chat for encrypted blockchain messaging, and a dedicated dApp store featuring staking platforms, NFT marketplaces, and DeFi exchanges.\nFor users, the appeal is straightforward: no complex setup, no external wallets — simply turn on the phone, buy crypto with a card, and start interacting with decentralized apps immediately. This streamlined onboarding process could significantly accelerate adoption in emerging markets where desktop access to crypto services is limited.\nDogecoin Bull Flag Breakout Targets $0.295\nAccording to a technical analysis posted by respected trader @TATrader_Alan on August 12, Dogecoin (DOGE) has broken out of a 4-hour bull flag pattern — a historically reliable indicator of continued upward movement. This setup projects a short-term price target of $0.295, representing a significant upside from current levels. The pattern follows a wave of renewed market activity, with meme coins benefiting from stronger Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) price action.\nTechnical metrics are reinforcing this bullish outlook for DOGE. RSI levels hovering around 60 indicate that the coin has room to climb before entering overbought conditions, while moving averages remain aligned in a positive trend. Historically, DOGE has demonstrated a high beta compared to Bitcoin, meaning sharp rallies in BTC often translate into even bigger percentage gains for DOGE. A successful move toward the $0.295 resistance could ignite further meme coin speculation across the market.\nDifferent Narratives, Shared Momentum\nDogecoin (DOGE) and Coldware (COLD) may be fundamentally different in scope and use case, but both benefit from the current market mood. DOGE’s appeal lies in its cultural staying power, deep liquidity, and the ability to spark retail speculation during bullish cycles. Coldware, on the other hand, targets long-term adoption through tangible utility — marrying the multi-trillion-dollar smartphone industry with blockchain integration.\nColdware (COLD)’s presale has been drawing in SocialFi, GameFi, and DeFi enthusiasts alike, many of whom see the project’s hardware-first approach as a catalyst for sustained token demand. The tokenomics are designed to reward early adopters, with staking incentives and ecosystem rewards directly tied to mobile usage.\nThe 100X Potential Narrative\nHype around Coldware (COLD)’s “100X launch” potential is rooted in its market positioning. The global smartphone market exceeds 6.8 billion active devices, and even capturing a fraction of that user base could create significant network effects for the COLD token. With Real World Asset (RWA) integration, mobile-friendly dApps, and hardware-based wallet security, Coldware is appealing to both crypto natives and newcomers who value simplicity.\nFor Dogecoin (DOGE) traders, the $0.295 target represents a strong near-term opportunity, but the ceiling is limited by DOGE’s current market capitalization and mature status in the meme coin hierarchy. Coldware, by contrast, is still in its early stage — meaning price discovery after launch could deliver much larger multiples for presale participants if adoption scales as projected.\nConclusion\nDogecoin’s bull flag breakout is giving traders renewed confidence in the altcoin market, proving that meme coins can still move sentiment across the board. At the same time, Coldware (COLD) is capturing attention with a fundamentally different value proposition — one rooted in real-world utility through its $349 Larna 2400® Web3 smartphone. With DOGE potentially leading short-term rallies and Coldware gearing up for a long-term adoption play, the two projects highlight how different strategies can coexist and thrive in the current crypto environment. For investors seeking asymmetric upside, Coldware’s combination of hardware innovation and blockchain integration makes it one of the most compelling presale opportunities of 2025.\nFor more information on the Coldware (COLD) Presale:\nVisit Coldware (COLD)\nJoin and become a community member:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Ethereum is entering a pivotal phase as on-chain data reveals a surge in whale accumulation not seen in years, fueling speculation of a potential rally toward the $5,000 mark. Inflows into wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have reached multi-billion-dollar levels in recent weeks — including single-day spikes of over $2.5 billion, the largest since 2018.\nOver just two weeks, whales have added more than 1.13 million ETH, tightening supply and signaling strong institutional and high-net-worth conviction.

        "text": "Google has clarified it will not block non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets from its Play Store, easing fears sparked by new licensing rules set to take effect in October.\nInitial Concerns Over Policy Change\nGoogle Play Store recently introduced updated licensing requirements for cryptocurrency wallet apps in 15 countries, including the United States and the European Union. The policy, effective October 29, mandates that developers secure relevant registrations, such as FinCEN Money Services Business (MSB) status in the U.S. or MiCA licensing in the EU, regardless of whether the wallet is custodial or non-custodial.\nThe announcement alarmed developers, as non-custodial wallets, which allow users to retain full control of their private keys, have historically been exempt from such regulatory obligations. Under the new rules, they appeared subject to the same licensing burdens as custodial platforms, potentially forcing many independent projects off the Play Store.\nClarification Following Backlash\nFollowing widespread concern from the crypto community, Google clarified via X (formerly Twitter) that non-custodial wallets are not covered under the Play Store’s “Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Software Wallets Policy.” The company stated it would update its Help Center to reflect this exemption.\nThis reversal alleviated concerns that Android users in the U.S., UK, and EU would lose access to popular self-custody tools due to regulatory licensing requirements that non-custodial wallet developers cannot meet.\nImpact of New Licensing Requirements\nWhile non-custodial wallets have been spared from the immediate licensing mandate, custodial wallet providers face significant compliance demands. In the U.S., developers must register with FinCEN as MSBs, hold state-level money transmitter licenses, or operate as banks. This includes implementing anti-money laundering programs and potentially adding Know Your Customer (KYC) checks.\nIn the EU, Google Play will only list wallet apps from MiCA-licensed Crypto Asset Service Providers — a category that explicitly excludes non-custodial wallets. MiCA defines CASPs primarily as exchanges and custodial service operators, leaving independent software wallets outside the licensing scope.\nBroader Industry Context\nGoogle’s stance reflects a growing alignment with global financial watchdogs like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which in 2021 urged member nations to regulate virtual asset service providers under risk-based frameworks. Although FATF’s guidelines are non-binding, tech platforms have increasingly acted as enforcers by controlling access to distribution channels.\nGoogle has a complicated history with cryptocurrency-related apps, having banned mining software in 2018, removed several crypto news apps in 2020, and blocked deceptive crypto services in 2021. More recently, it allowed NFT games under strict disclosure rules while prohibiting gambling elements.\nThe clarification on non-custodial wallets underscores the ongoing tension between regulatory compliance, platform policy, and user access to decentralized financial tools.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "While many digital assets rely on speculation, FUNToken ($FUN) is proving that utility and engagement can create real, sustained momentum.\nTrading around $0.01824 at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap, FUNToken is steadily building a foundation for growth. The project’s journey toward the $0.10 milestone is not being driven by promises alone but by a unique combination of Telegram-powered adoption, staking incentives, and a deflationary burn model. Together, these elements form a growth engine that could deliver a 10X return for early participants if roadmap targets are achieved.\nThis article breaks down exactly how Telegram integration and staking are working together to fuel FUNToken’s trajectory and why traders see these systems as critical to reaching the next price threshold.\nTelegram Engagement: The Growth Catalyst\nUnlike most tokens that depend on centralized exchanges or complicated onboarding flows, FUNToken has built an accessible gaming experience directly inside Telegram. This choice has unlocked a massive global audience that is already comfortable with messaging-based apps and micro-transactions.\nHere is why this approach matters:\n-\nFrictionless Onboarding\nTelegram users can start playing in seconds. There is no need for complex wallet setups or downloads. The simplicity of this experience removes the single biggest barrier to adoption in the Web3 space. -\nDaily Active Engagement\nThe platform is already seeing over 105,000 active Telegram players, with daily missions, spin-to-win mechanics, and referral rewards. This high-frequency engagement keeps the ecosystem active and ensures a steady stream of demand for FUN tokens. -\nViral Growth Dynamics\nTelegram’s social features, like group challenges and friend invites, create organic user acquisition. As more players join, each community-driven promotion can snowball into thousands of new wallet activations. -\nRevenue to Support Buybacks\nEvery transaction inside these Telegram games generates revenue. That revenue is used in the project’s quarterly buyback-and-burn program, steadily reducing circulating supply.\nWith the roadmap targeting 10 additional Telegram games in Q3 2025 alone, the growth curve is expected to steepen. More users mean more transactions, more revenue, and a faster deflation cycle.\nStaking: Locking Supply and Rewarding Commitment\nBeyond gaming engagement, FUNToken’s staking model plays an equally important role in its path toward the $0.10 milestone. Staking is more than just a reward system. It is a mechanism that locks a portion of the circulating supply, reducing sell pressure and creating predictable demand.\nHere is how it works:\n-\nIncentives for Holding\nUsers can stake their FUN tokens directly in the ecosystem to earn rewards and access exclusive benefits such as premium game experiences and bonus multipliers. -\nReducing Liquid Supply\nEvery FUN token locked in staking contracts is effectively removed from circulation for the duration of the staking period. As adoption grows, this locked supply becomes a meaningful contributor to scarcity. -\nStrengthening Network Effects\nStakers are incentivized to participate actively in the ecosystem, whether by playing, referring new users, or voting on future platform improvements. This dynamic creates a committed base of holders who have a direct interest in seeing the token appreciate.\nThe roadmap for Q4 2025 includes launching the mobile FUN Wallet app with integrated staking, making it easier for everyday users to stake and earn without complex DeFi interfaces.\nThe Path to $0.10: Why the Numbers Align\nWhen you look closely at FUNToken’s ecosystem, it becomes clear that the combination of AI-driven Telegram bot, Telegram community engagement, staking participation, and deflationary mechanics is a set of quantifiable growth drivers that are already impacting price action.\nHere is how these forces reinforce each other:\n-\nA continuously expanding user base transacting FUN daily\n-\nA rising percentage of tokens are being locked in staking contracts\n-\nQuarterly buybacks funded by real revenue streams\nIf we project this model forward into Q4 and early 2026, several scenarios illustrate why a move to $0.10 is plausible rather than speculative:\n-\nScenario 1: 500,000 Wallet Users with 20% Staking Participation\nThis would remove at least 100 million FUN from the circulating supply. If staking participation climbs to 30% or higher, the impact could be even larger. -\nScenario 2: Expansion of Active Daily Transactions\nAs 10–20 more games are launched, the number of daily transactions could double or triple. Every transaction contributes to revenue and therefore to quarterly buybacks. If burn volumes rise from 25 million to 50 million FUN per quarter, the available supply on exchanges could fall significantly in less than a year. -\nScenario 3: Sustained Community Growth and Network Effects\nEach new player not only increases demand for FUN tokens but also introduces referral loops and viral engagement. This dynamic creates an organic, compounding network effect that makes growth less reliant on external marketing spend.\nTogether, these scenarios create a market structure where demand consistently rises while supply steadily contracts. This is why traders and analysts watching FUNToken often describe the $0.10 milestone as a logical step in the token’s lifecycle rather than a speculative moonshot.\nFinal Thoughts\nFUNToken’s roadmap is clear. Grow the ecosystem, expand active users through Telegram, incentivize holding through staking, and consistently reduce supply. This is a combination that few projects in the gaming token space have achieved.\nWith each quarter delivering more games, deeper staking integration, and significant deflationary burns, the foundation for a move toward $0.10 and 10X growth is already being laid.\nAdding to this momentum, FUNToken has also launched a $5 million giveaway, designed to reward the community and accelerate adoption by attracting new players and holders into the ecosystem.\nFor those watching closely, this year may prove that utility, transparency, and deflation - combined with strong community incentives - can be far more powerful than hype alone.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "XYZVerse has caught strong attention after a huge surge backed by Wall Street. The token’s value soared, drawing comparisons to Pi and ONDO, two well-known digital coins. Some now wonder if XYZVerse could climb even higher and leave those rivals behind. The coming days may reveal whether this newcomer can hold its momentum or surprise the markets further.\nDemand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone\nXYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3.\nUnlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms.\nNotably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet.\nPrice Dynamics and Listing Plans\nDuring its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges.\nThe projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization.\nSo far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors.\nChampions Get Rewarded\nIn XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big.\nThe Road to Victory\nWith solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary.\nAirdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits\nPocket Mining: Why Pi Network Could Be the Next Big Crypto Circle\nPi Network puts a digital mint in your pocket. Launched by Stanford grads in 2019, the app lets anyone earn Pi by tapping once a day. No fancy gear, no hot laptop fan. The system runs on the Stellar Consensus Protocol, so phones sip power. Users pick 3–5 trusted contacts; these tiny circles link into a global web that checks each move on the chain. Extra Pi flows to people who add friends, keep coins locked, or run a full node on a computer. Fair, simple, and social.\nIn a market chasing lower fees and greener tools, Pi looks timely. Bitcoin’s proof-of-work feels heavy; Pi’s light touch could appeal to the next billion users, much like TikTok beat cable TV. The enclosed mainnet, live since late 2021, limits trading today, yet it also shields the project while builders test apps. If the open network arrives on schedule, early pioneers may hold a coin ready for real markets. With memes driving gains and community strength ranking high, a phone-mined token backed by a crowd-sized KYC net could draw fresh attention in the next cycle.\nONDO: Real-World Yield Meets the Crypto Boom\nONDO blends old and new money. The team turns safe, income-making assets like U.S. Treasury notes into digital tokens that move at internet speed. One branch builds these products, while another writes open code that lets them plug into many apps. Big names such as BlackRock help choose the assets, and Coinbase stores the coins, so trust stays high. The star product, USDY, behaves like a steady coin yet earns a small yield from Treasuries and bank deposits, opening the door for non-U.S. users.\nMarkets now swing between hype and safety. While meme tokens chase quick hits, ONDO offers a link to real cash flow, a trait many traders want during rate hikes. Tokenization of bonds is growing fast; even big banks are testing it. This trend could lift projects that already have working lines, and ONDO is one of the few. Its price still moves with the wider crypto tide, yet the solid backing may limit sharp drops. For investors seeking calm in a loud cycle, ONDO may look tempting.\nConclusion\nPI and ONDO remain strong in the market, yet XYZVerse leads as the first all-sport memecoin. With unique sports integration and bold growth goals, XYZ is set to stand out in this bull run.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "The altcoins are on the brink of an all-time high. At the same time Cardano (ADA) is breaking out strongly, up more than 12% at one point earlier on Thursday. Is this the beginning of the altcoin bull run, and will $ADA be one of the major cryptos to lead it?\nCombined altcoin market cap stops just short of all-time high\nSource: TradingView\nTotal2 is the chart of the combined market capitalization of all the cryptocurrencies excluding $BTC, and is therefore a good barometer of how the altcoin market is performing.\nAs can be seen in the chart above, the price has broken out of the descending trendline, which stretches all the way from the last altcoin market all-time high at $1.71 trillion. The current price surge stopped just short of this at $1.69 trillion, and may be coming back to confirm the trendline breakout.\nAt the bottom of the chart, first the Stochastic RSI shows the indicator lines perhaps shaping to cross back up, while the Relative Strength Index reveals the indicator line could be about to push up through its own downtrend line. All appears very bullish.\n$ADA breaks out and taps major $1 horizontal resistance\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily chart for $ADA shows how the price has exploded through the descending trendline on Thursday. That said, the price has come back since tapping the big resistance at $1 and has currently reached a support level. It remains to be seen if this hot market will help the price return to attempt this major resistance, or whether a retest of the breakout might take place. The Stochastic RSI indicators on this time frame are arriving at the top so a retrace is on the cards, although it’s not known how soon this could take place (before or after the $1 resistance breakout).\nTwo major horizontal resistances are barriers to ATH\nSource: TradingView\nThe weekly time frame for the $ADA price puts the scale of the task of getting back to the all-time high firmly into perspective. There is a long way to go. That said, breakouts of these next two major resistance levels would go a long way towards getting back to the ATH.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators rather look as though they are shaping to cross back up. If they do so, this could provide the momentum to break past the resistances.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Cardano (ADA) has caught the attention of traders this August with a technical setup pointing to a rally toward $0.921 in the short term and potentially $1.05 by month-end. Yet, while Cardano ADA’s chart patterns excite swing traders, a different conversation is taking place among presale-focused investors: Coldware (COLD) is quietly progressing through its Stage 3 presale, with prices set to rise from $0.008 to $0.00975 in the next stage.\nColdware’s Stage 3 Presale Momentum\nColdware has already raised over $7.73 million, selling 73.77% of available tokens for Stage 3. With just 26.23% supply remaining, the next valuation step is approaching fast. The project’s limited-time “50FLASH” offer allows investors to claim additional tokens on purchase, a move designed to reward early adopters and accelerate distribution.\nThis isn’t a vaporware blockchain promise — Coldware (COLD) is already delivering a hardware ecosystem, including the Larna 2400® Web3 smartphone with encrypted calls, blockchain messaging, and a dedicated dApp store. The lineup also features the ColdBook® laptop, decentralized VPN, and a fully integrated wallet solution, all running on the Coldware Layer-1 mainnet and subnet.\nWhy ADA and COLD Attract Different Investor Profiles\nCardano ADA’s price action is driven by market-wide risk sentiment and its roadmap progress on scaling solutions like Hydra and smart contract optimizations. Technical indicators — including a MACD crossover and RSI in the low 60s — suggest bullish continuation if $0.86 resistance is breached. Traders with short-to-medium-term horizons are targeting the $0.921 breakout level, with some analysts suggesting a stretch toward $1.05 under strong market conditions.\nColdware (COLD), meanwhile, appeals to early-stage investors who prefer locking in a low fixed price before listing. Its tokenomics blend blockchain transaction fees with hardware sales revenue, creating a diversified business model uncommon in the current altcoin landscape.\nHow Coldware Could Outpace ADA’s Percentage Gains\nWhile Cardano ADA’s potential move from $0.85 to $1.05 offers around 23% upside, Coldware’s presale stage jumps are far steeper in relative terms. A shift from $0.008 to even modest exchange pricing could eclipse ADA’s rally multiples, especially given the hardware product tie-ins and real adoption potential.\nMarket Context and Altcoin Rotation\nWith Ethereum approaching $5,000 and Bitcoin holding strength above key supports, altcoin capital rotation is intensifying. This environment often sees a split in strategies: traders chase liquid large caps like ADA for technical breakouts, while early-entry capital flows into presales like Coldware (COLD) for asymmetrical upside.\nConclusion\nCardano’s bullish technical setup offers a compelling short-term trade with clearly defined targets, and its broader ecosystem continues to mature. However, Coldware (COLD) represents a fundamentally different play — one that fuses a functioning hardware lineup with blockchain infrastructure, currently available at pre-market pricing. For investors weighing immediate chart-driven moves against the potential of a utility-backed presale, Coldware’s Stage 3 window presents a unique entry before valuation steps higher.\nFor more information on the Coldware (COLD) Presale:\nVisit Coldware (COLD)\nJoin and become a community member:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Amsterdam, Netherlands, August 14th, 2025, Chainwire\nQF Network (QF) today confirmed that its mainnet will go live in Q4 2025, entering the market with performance and architecture designed to reshape what is possible for Layer-1 blockchains.\nWhile Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently floated the idea of moving the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to a RISC-V architecture, QF has already built its core around this new technology. The result is a network that is faster, more efficient, and built for mass adoption from day one.\nDesigned to safeguard what it calls the five pillars of digital life, which are identity, money, work, community, and data, QF Network achieves block times of just 0.1 seconds through its SPIN consensus without compromising decentralization, a feat no other Layer 1 has achieved. This architecture delivers throughput up to 10× higher than standard Substrate chains and is engineered to support millions of daily users without performance bottlenecks, thanks to its parallel execution engine.\n“Our mainnet launch is not just about going live, it is about proving that a blockchain can be fast, scalable, and still sovereign by design,” said Ben Burge, Founder of Quantum Fusion Network. “We have built the foundation for dApps that feel instant, secure, and unstoppable.”\nQF’s native-first SDK, verifiable off-chain compute, and zkTLS integration create an environment where developers can build applications that match Web2 performance without compromising decentralization. This technical stack bridges Web2 and Web3, maintaining security and verification while removing friction for end users.\nFor developers, this means the ability to compete with centralized platforms on speed and reliability while retaining core blockchain principles. For users, it means experiencing decentralized applications without the latency, throughput limits, or usability compromises that have slowed blockchain adoption.\nMainnet is on track for Q4 2025. When it arrives, QF intends not just to join the Layer-1 race, but to set a new standard for it.\nAbout QF Network\nQF Network is a sovereign Layer-1 blockchain built to safeguard identity, money, work, community, and data for the next century. Powered by SPIN consensus, parallel execution, RISC-V architecture, verifiable off-chain compute, and zkTLS, QF delivers Web2-grade performance without sacrificing neutrality or decentralization.\nWebsite: https://qfnetwork.xyz/\nX: https://x.com/theqfnetwork?s=21\nContact\nCo FounderBen Burge\nQF Network\n[email protected]\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

The partnership follows Bybit's receipt of its MiCAR license in May 2025 and the rollout of Bybit.eu, enabling verified EEA users to onboard to a fully compliant platform, where they can get yield approved assets to earn XION.\nThe Launchpool will feature a total pool size of 100,000 XION, distributed as follows:\n- 50,000 XION to XION stakers (estimated APR: 60%)\n- 30,000 XION to MNT stakers (estimated APR: 36%)\n- 20,000 XION to USDC stakers (estimated APR: 24%)\nAs one of the few Layer-1 projects backed by Circle Ventures, XION has seen strong traction in bringing blockchain-based experiences to everyday users, with over 100+ global brands leveraging its platform. XION has been steadily growing its European presence, as it became the first Layer-1 blockchain to publish a MiCA Title II whitepaper, integrated natively with Paris-based Ledger in June, listed on Bitvavo earlier this summer, and is already working with leading European brands on blockchain-powered consumer experiences.\nSimilarly, one of Bybit's main focuses in 2025 is its European expansion. Being the inaugural Launchpool partner on Bybit EU MiCAR-compliant EU platform, XION will have access to a growing regulated European audience.\n\"Being the very first Launchpool on Bybit EU is a major signal of XION's deep partnership with Bybit and our shared focus on expanding compliantly in the European markets,\" said Anthony Anzalone, Founder of XION. \"Europe is now the proving ground for regulated digital assets, and together with Bybit EU we're setting a precedent for how mainstream audiences can discover and engage with blockchain technology in a safe, intuitive way.\"\n\"Recently securing our MiCAR license in Austria represents our commitment and major focus in 2025 to bring compliant, innovative crypto services to European users. Today's launch with XION, a blockchain focused on mainstream adoption of crypto, demonstrates how regulation can accelerate rather than hinder innovation, and perfectly aligns with our European expansion strategy.\" - Mazurka Zheng, CEO of Bybit EU.\nThe collaboration also builds on XION's earlier relationship with Bybit, where the company featured on Bybit Global's Launchpool during its TGE. The renewed partnership underscores the two companies' shared commitment to making blockchain accessible to everyday users.\nAbout XION\nXION is the first walletless L1 blockchain purpose-built for consumer adoption. Utilizing protocol-level implementations related to abstracted accounts, signatures, fees, interoperability, and more, XION empowers developers to build secure, intuitive, and seamless user experiences.

        "text": "Bitcoin is an open-sourced, decentralised digital currency that has the advantage of being mined by anyone on the planet. mining has become a new way for many people to get rich, but the high hardware cost and power consumption of traditional mining have deterred many investors. The emergence of IEByte mining machine cloud mining platform has perfectly solved this problem, making low-cost and high-return mining possible.\nWhat Is Cloud Mining?\nCloud mining is a method to mine cryptocurrencies by leasing equipment or renting computing power from data centers. It negates the process of individually setting up physical mining hardware, getting a high-speed internet connection, sourcing electricity, and maintaining the hardware.\nWhat are the advantages of cloud mining?\nThe main advantage of cloud mining is that it allows easy access to cryptocurrencies without a large initial investment. You do not need to spend a lot of money on mining equipment, and you can monitor the performance of these machines by accessing them through the most common devices (PC, tablet, smartphone, etc.).\nIn addition, this is an activity that everyone can participate in, even complete beginners, since it does not require any special expertise. Profits can be obtained simply by renting the services of miners through cloud mining platforms.\nWhat are the disadvantages of cloud mining?\nAmong the main disadvantages of cloud mining, we can cite the risk of fraud (which, unfortunately, still exists in this market) and the low decision-making power of mining.\nIn addition, most of such platforms offer long-term contracts with fixed subscriptions (1 or 2-year commitments), which is risky given the large fluctuations in the prices of the cryptocurrency market. If a currency collapses, then an attractive yield today may be harmful in the future.\nIs cloud mining safe for me?\nCloud mining is safe if you choose a reputable platform.\nWhich Is The Best Cloud Mining Available In The Market Today?\nBest cloud mining depends on factors, like trustworthiness, mining fee, contract duration, and coin to mine.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/heres-what-youd-have-today-if-you-invested-200-in-shiba-inu-shib-5-years-ago-plus-2-meme-coins-that-could-do-it-next",
        "text": "If you bought $200 of Shiba Inu (SHIB) the day it launched in 2020. Back then, that money would have bought you about 3.57 trillion SHIB tokens. Now, let's skip ahead to August 2025, when SHIB is selling for about $0.00001233. At that price, your tiny 2020 buy would mean your $200 is now worth about $44.01 million. This dramatic increase is a clear example of how meme coins can deliver astonishing results. SHIB once peaked even higher, but with its current price around 86% lower than that all-time high, it shows how quickly values can swing in crypto. Still, SHIB made millionaires out of early believers. The question now is: What could be the next SHIB? Two meme coins have recently captured attention for their explosive potential. One is already showing massive traction, and another is building serious hype among early adopters. At the top of this list is Little Pepe (LILPEPE).\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin That’s Making Waves Before Its Launch\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) isn’t just another frog-themed token; it’s the future face of meme coin innovation. Built on a Layer 2 blockchain tailored for meme-driven ecosystems, it offers lightning-fast transactions, ultra-low gas fees, and full support for dApps. This makes it perfect for both traders and builders in the meme coin space. The ongoing presale has been nothing short of explosive. Beginning at just $0.0010 in Stage 1, Little Pepe is now in Stage 10 at $0.0019, and each round has sold out quicker than the last. The project has already drawn millions of unique wallets, and with only 26.5% of the 100 billion tokens available in the presale, the demand has been off the charts. At the expected launch price of $0.0030, early buyers are already sitting on strong paper gains. But that’s just the beginning. With analysts forecasting a potential rally that could see LILPEPE mirror SHIB’s trajectory, some believe a $200 investment now could climb past $45 million by 2027 if similar growth plays out.\nLittle Pepe isn’t riding the meme wave; it’s setting the tone for where meme coins are headed next.\n-\nAnti-bot Architecture: Built with protective layers to stop sniper bots, Little Pepe ensures fairer launches and trading environments.\n-\nSmart Community Building: The project is backed by multiple anonymous developers with a history of successful meme coin launches. Their marketing strategy has already resulted in LILPEPE being listed on CoinMarketCap before even hitting DEXs.\n-\nLegendary Lore: Little Pepe’s story is gaining attention. From the “swamps of Solidity” and “jungles of JavaScript,” this hero frog symbolizes transparency, decentralization, and unstoppable green candles.\n-\nA “CryptoWomb” Roadmap: With listings, staking features, NFT integration, and dApp partnerships on the schedule, LILPEPE is preparing for a major breakout post-launch.\nCrypto investors are noticing. Many are pouring capital into LILPEPE presale allocations, betting big on what could be the next historic meme coin pump.\nPudgy Penguins (PENGU): Cute Faces, Serious Gains\nWhile LILPEPE may be the freshest contender, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is another meme coin making waves. Priced around $0.0356, PENGU has already racked up a market cap of $2.25 billion, a sign that it’s more than just a cute face. The recent surge in trading volume, up 150% in 24 hours to $907 million, shows that investors are paying attention. Its breakout above $0.03 resistance now puts the coin on track to potentially soar, especially with whale interest increasing. Catalysts like the upcoming Pudgy Party game on the TON blockchain, and hints at a possible ETF filing with the SEC, have created a positive buzz that could carry PENGU even further, soaring your investment just like Shiba Inu did.\nThe Next Big Breakout\nMeme coins continue to prove that they’re more than just jokes; they’re serious vehicles for growth when paired with timing, hype, and community momentum. For those hunting the next big breakout, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) offers early positioning, an unstoppable presale, and all the energy of a frog ready to leap over the moon. Add PENGU to the watchlist, but if you’re looking for something still under the radar, LILPEPE is where the noise is getting louder by the minute. $200 in SHIB made millionaires.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/battle-of-the-layers-blockdag-bdag-and-coldware-cold-offer-hardware-to-push-the-market-beyond-crypto",
        "text": "Crypto is no longer just code on a chain—it’s evolving into infrastructure that lives in the real world. And at the forefront of this transformation are two radically different projects: Coldware (COLD) and BlockDag (BDAG). While both are reshaping how we engage with blockchain technology, they’re doing so from opposite ends of the spectrum—Coldware (COLD) from a hardware-first access point, and BlockDag (BDAG) from a software-layered developer ecosystem.\nColdware (COLD): The Gateway to Everyday Decentralization\nColdware (COLD) is the only crypto presale that combines blockchain utility with physical consumer devices. Instead of expecting users to download wallets, secure their own private keys, or master DeFi protocols, Coldware (COLD) bakes it all into encrypted smartphones and laptops. These devices function as decentralized nodes, cold wallets, messaging tools, and access points to Web3 apps.\nThis presale is catching fire—and for good reason. As of August 2025, Coldware (COLD) is in Stage 3 of its 20-stage presale, with 1.3B + tokens sold and over $7.7 million raised. The current presale price is $0.008, set to climb towards a launch price of $0.3517—a potential 3,924% gain for early backers. Less than 25% of the Stage 3 allocation remains, and investors can still claim 50% bonus tokens via the promo code 50FLASH.\nBut more than numbers, Coldware (COLD) is solving a critical bottleneck: onboarding. Crypto still intimidates the average person, and Coldware’s plug-and-play devices may be the missing link to global adoption. With built-in dApp store access, gasless wallet transfers, and hardware-level security, it lowers the barrier to entry for both retail users and institutions.\nBlockDag (BDAG): Developer Fuel for a Multi-Layered Ecosystem\nOn the flip side, BlockDag (BDAG) is staking its future on developer engagement. With a staggering $371 million raised and over 25.1 billion tokens sold, this presale is one of the largest of 2025. And the growth hasn’t slowed—BlockDag (BDAG) is now priced at $0.0276, reflecting a 2,660% return since its earliest batch.\nWhat makes BlockDag (BDAG) stand out is its laser focus on builders. Its flagship Hackathon has attracted over 500 development teams, using Solidity-compatible and low-code tools to create dApps across DeFi, gaming, and AI.\nWhereas many projects hope for post-launch innovation, BlockDag (BDAG) is ensuring the Mainnet goes live with utility from day one. That’s a massive differentiator—and one that makes BDAG more than a speculation token.\nHardware vs. Software: Which Layer Wins Long-Term?\nThe fascinating part of this comparison isn’t which token performs better—it’s how well they complement each other.\nColdware (COLD) brings physical access. Its smartphones and laptops become the secure endpoint where users interact with the blockchain—possibly even with BlockDag (BDAG) applications. Meanwhile, BlockDag (BDAG) builds the infrastructure: a scalable, fast, and app-rich ecosystem ready to power the next generation of blockchain utility.\nIn this sense, the combination of Coldware (COLD) and BlockDag (BDAG) could mirror the relationship between iPhones and the App Store. One delivers the device; the other brings the experience.\nWhy 2025 Investors Are Buying Both\nInvestors are increasingly recognizing that crypto’s next bull run won’t be fueled by hype alone. Tokens like Coldware (COLD) and BlockDag (BDAG) are seeing record presale interest because they offer actual products—hardware, apps, and development frameworks—that will survive market cycles.\nWhere Coldware (COLD) shines in accessibility and self-custody, BlockDag (BDAG) wins in utility and developer support. Backing both is a bet on Web3’s full-stack future.\nConclusion: Two Layers, One Future\nCrypto’s evolution is being driven by real-world relevance. Coldware (COLD) brings decentralization to your pocket, while BlockDag (BDAG) fuels the apps that make those devices powerful. If you're looking for 2025 tokens that bridge speculation and substance, both Coldware (COLD) and BlockDag (BDAG) deserve a front-row spot in your portfolio.\nFor more information on the Coldware (COLD) Presale:\nVisit Coldware (COLD)\nJoin and become a community member:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/reactortrade-kicks-off-react-token-sale-ahead-of-tge-as-defi-market-cap-hits-98b",
        "text": "ReactorTrade, a decentralized trading platform, has begun the sale of its native $REACT token, the core utility token of the ReactorTrade ecosystem. $REACT powers all value exchange between traders, liquidity providers, strategy developers, and platform participants, acting as the gateway to governance, premium features, and incentive mechanisms. This marks the start of community distribution, well before the Token Generation Event (TGE). Unlike a TGE — which unlocks token liquidity and market trading — the current public sale phase allows early supporters to secure allocations at a discounted rate ahead of exchange listings and full ecosystem activation.\nThe initial distribution phase begins alongside the first phase of ReactorTrade’s public rollout — the Trade Aggregation Engine — with yield aggregation vaults scheduled for Q4 2025 and dynamic perpetuals set to follow in early 2026, forming a multi-phase product roadmap designed to steadily expand user capabilities.\nDeFi Market Momentum Supports $REACT’s Public Sale\nThe timing coincides with a surge of interest across the DeFi sector. As of June 2025, the combined market capitalization of top DeFi tokens reached $98.4 billion, representing a 38% year-over-year surge from $71.2 billion. Across the sector, the numbers show investors are once again interested in productive, infrastructure-focused crypto assets.\nAccording to industry data, DeFi was June’s top-performing category with a roughly 10.9% increase in total value locked, even as the broader crypto market remained flat.\nMeanwhile, the Coinbase COIN50 index showed a strong increase in TVL across DeFi assets. This all but confirms sustained momentum at a time when the broader market and other sectors are showing flat or even declining trends. ReactorTrade’s token sale taps into this trend, positioning $REACT amid a DeFi upswing that is valuing utility, governance power, and yield mechanics.\nMore About $REACT\n$REACT launches with a maximum supply based on a $30M starting fully diluted valuation (FDV), with an FDV of $100M projected at TGE. The current price of the token is $0.03, increasing to $0.10 at the TGE. $REACT will be available on BNB Chain and Base.\nThe global token distribution follows a deflationary supply model: for every token sold to the community, an equal token is permanently burned. The token allocation is 20% LP tokens, 25% community tokens, 5% team tokens (locked for 12 months, then vested linearly over 24 months), 20% ecosystem growth, 2% KOLs, 3% advisors, and 25% burned.\nUnder the burn-on-sale model, the “community tokens” share is flexible — for every token sold, an equivalent token is earned for distribution, and the undistributed portion adjusts accordingly. For example, if 35% of the supply is sold, 35% will be earned for distribution and the undistributed share will drop proportionally.\nIn terms of utility, $REACT acts as the core economic and governance layer for ReactorTrade. Holders can vote on protocol decisions like new market listings and feature priorities, with voting power tied to holdings or staking levels. Stakers can also earn trading fee discounts, liquidity reward multipliers, and access to event-based promotions. Token holdings will determine membership tiers, to be introduced after the first stage of the sale, offering varying bonuses and perks for participants. Certain premium features, such as early market access, advanced trading bots, exclusive analytics, and alpha/beta testing participation, are token-gated and require either a minimum holding or staking commitment. This mechanism ties token scarcity directly to platform adoption — a rarity among DeFi governance models — creating a clear link between network growth and tokenholder value.\nTo further widen community participation, ReactorTrade is introducing its “ConvertDrop” program, allowing early supporters and partner protocol communities to swap certain assets or stake holdings in exchange for recurring $REACT airdrops, reinforcing grassroots ownership from day one.\nAbout ReactorTrade and the $REACT Token\nReactorTrade is a decentralized trading and yield platform combining spot trading, permissionless perpetuals, and meta-governance yield aggregation in one interface. By unifying liquidity aggregation, yield strategies, and governance, it solves a core DeFi pain point — switching between multiple tools to trade, farm, and vote. Its hybrid architecture blends aggregated AMM liquidity, on-chain order book access, and automated strategy vaults for deep liquidity, fast execution, and reduced MEV risk. Built with a community-first approach and backed by seed funding, ReactorTrade is designed for progressive decentralization, with its $REACT token powering governance, incentives, and long-term value alignment across the ecosystem.\nHave questions about ReactorTrade and its token?

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/top-blockchain-projects-to-watch-in-2025",
        "text": "The blockchain space is growing quickly, with new projects constantly emerging to address specific industry needs. As we look ahead to 2025, several mid-tier blockchain projects stand out for their practical applications, unique ecosystems, and significant growth potential.\nHere in this article will take a closer look at five blockchain projects that are worth keeping an eye on in 2025: Gleec, Mosaic Alpha, Hedera, Quant, and VeChain. Each of these projects brings a different approach to the blockchain landscape, offering solutions for financial tools, decentralized finance, enterprise-grade performance, interoperability, and supply chain transparency.\n1; Gleec\nGleec was initially introduced in 2015 as a safe communications system. Nevertheless, it later became a complete blockchain ecosystem developed on top of a Bitcoin fork. Its native token is GLEEC which consists of 21 million capped tokens, and is used to facilitate different kinds of financial and digital services, seeking to provide convenient solutions to users in emerging markets.\nEcosystem:\nGleec has developed a number of new tools that users can now access to facilitate their entry into the crypto environment and close the gap between crypto and traditional finance.\n-\nGleec Pay: An IBAN crypto-friendly service, that supports fiat-to-crypto conversions effortlessly, e.g., in areas where access to banking solutions is restricted.\n-\nGleec Card: Visa-backed debit card which can use the creations to spend their crypto assets with millions of companies and shops across the globe.\n-\nGleec BTC Exchange: The exchange venue is approved in El Salvador and promotes BTC-to-USD exchanges since the nation offers friendly terms towards cryptocurrencies.\n-\nRaphael Coin: This is a new project that offers tokenized art benefiting surging interest in digital assets and NFTs.\nWhat are Gleec’s Use Cases? Gleec employs a proof-of-work consensus mechanism like Bitcoin, which can make the mechanism highly secure and transparent. It is traded over 15 exchanges such as HitBTC and Changelly and has a market cap of about $43 million.\nRecent Developments:\nIn 2024, Gleec had its exchange granted regulatory approval in El Salvador and launched staking rewards and community governance capabilities. Another area of focus is increasing the outreach of the platform through partnership with other regional fintechs to scale Gleec Pay.\nWhy Watch in 2025:\nGleec’s focus on practical financial tools for emerging markets positions it well for growth. The small market cap and its low-profile status make it a potential sleeper hit, though it faces competition from larger payment-focused blockchains like Ripple.\n2; Mosaic Alpha\nMosaic Alpha, a decentralized platform that launched on the Binance Smart Chain, makes DeFi investing easier by providing token baskets. Those baskets represent a preselected portfolio of assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polkadot, and are set to make the crypto investment process more accessible to new and seasoned investors.\nEcosystem:\nThe mosaic Alpha ecosystem centers itself on a simple portfolio management feature, simplifying the ability of users to diversify their investments.\n-\nToken Baskets: Portfolios that have been built or created to hand users a selection of crypto assets to invest in simultaneously.\n-\nMosaic Wallet: Mosaic Wallet is an Ethereum wallet, which gives you a complete control over your assets, and natively integrates with multiple DeFi systems.\n-\nMosaic Chain: The project is developing a Polkadot parachain to increase its scalability and multi-hub capabilities.\nTechnical Details:\nThe platform runs on the BNB Chain with low fees and fast transactions. Transaction fees can be paid by using KDX tokens, as well as using the token to access premium services, like advanced portfolio analytics. The platform is built in a manner that is deeply decentralized, and governed by the community.\nRecent Developments:\nIn 2024, Mosaic Alpha introduced emerging DeFi tokens to its token basket, and it incorporated Polkadot into the ecosystem in which to be interoperating. New governance features have also been implemented on the platform such as top holders being allowed to curate baskets.\nWhy Watch in 2025:\nMosaic Alpha stands out for its user-centric approach to DeFi investing, making it accessible to a wide range of investors. Its integration with Polkadot ensures scalability, though it will need to compete with established DeFi giants like Aave and Yearn Finance.\n3; Hedera\nHedera was launched in 2018 and uses the hashgraph consensus algorithm to provide transactions at high speeds and low costs. It is a platform overseen by a council of international enterprises such as Google, IBM, and Boeing which endears it as a reliable solution to enterprise and DeFi applications.\nEcosystem:\nThe Hedera ecosystem is intended to enable diverse use cases, ranging to enterprise applications to decentralized finance.\n-\nHedera Token Service (HTS): Gives businesses the power to create specialized tokens to support their initiatives in an easy way.\n-\nHedera Consensus Service (HCS): A high-throughput data verification service dedicated to the tracking of supply chains, as well as financial settlements, among others.\n-\nSmart Contracts: Hedera embraces Solidity based smart contracts whose finality occurs within 3-5 seconds.\nTechnical Details:\nHedera is built upon hashgraph, a more energy-efficient and faster-transacting consensus algorithm as compared to the traditional blockchains. It has a capacity that can handle more than 10,000 transactions each second and it is carbon negative.\nRecent Developments:\nIn 2024 Hedera increased its DeFi integrations and partnered with Indian Institute of Technology to encourage blockchain education. On top of this, the platform is launching the HashSphere project, a personal blockchain that integrates regulated sectors, in 2025.\nWhy Watch in 2025:\nThe enterprise support and high-performance nature of Hedera gives it a competitive advantage regarding institutional adoption. Nonetheless, its governmental structure is centralized, which can be the cause of alarm among blockchain enthusiasts.\n4; Quant\nQuant works on addressing the burning problem of blockchain interoperability. The communication between the various blockchains, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, or Ripple, is made possible via its Overledger platform without involving the creation of a new network.\nEcosystem:\nOverledger is the most significant element of the Quant ecosystem that offers the solution to an interconnection issue between blockchain networks of various enterprises.\n-\nOverledger: Network-agnostic API which links the public and the private blockchains and allows cross-chain payments and sharing of data.\n-\nQNT Token: QNT coin is a native token of the platform and helps to license the platform as well as pay fees on transactions.\nTechnical Details:\nQuant is a layer-1.5 solution that does not build a new blockchain instead of integrating the existing ones. This renders it an impartial stage of cross-chain data and asset transfer. The total number of QNT tokens (approximately 14.6 million) provides the project with stability.\nRecent Developments:\nIn 2024, Quant collaborated with UK financial institutions on tokenized securities testing and added to its Overledger APIs to further interoperability within DeFi. Its grants were community driven, and it further added to the expansion of the platform ecosystem.\nWhy Watch in 2025:\nQuant’s focus on interoperability positions it as a key player in blockchain adoption, especially as cross-chain capabilities become more essential for enterprises. Its neutrality makes it a strong solution for developers looking for a seamless connection between different blockchain networks.\n5; VeChain\nVeChain is a blockchain platform established in 2015 aimed at enhancing the transparency of the supply chain. Its two-token model (VET to transfer values and VTHO to pay the transaction fees) has taken it on the top of the list of companies that offer blockchain solution to any company across the world.\nEcosystem:\nVeChain’s ecosystem focuses on offering businesses solutions for traceability, sustainability, and logistics.\n-\nToolChain: A plug-and-play platform that enables businesses to use blockchain as a supply chain traceability mechanism, and luxury goods in particular authentication, and in food safety.\n-\nVeChainThor: A public chain that allows smart contracts and decentralized apps to be carried out that makes transactions cheap.\nTechnical Details:\nVeChain uses a proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, which ensures efficiency and scalability. Transaction costs are minimal, around $0.01 in VTHO, making it attractive for enterprise use.\nRecent Developments:\nIn 2024, VeChain expanded its carbon tracking programs and introduced new integrations for SMEs in Asia. Its node infrastructure was also upgraded for faster transaction processing, further enhancing scalability.\nWhy Watch in 2025:\nVeChain’s established partnerships with global brands and its focus on transparency and sustainability make it a top choice for enterprises looking to implement blockchain technology in supply chain management.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $124,000 early on Thursday. Following the high, the price retraced to just above $121,000. While the crypto market is very bullish, buyers are starting to lose steam. Could buyer exhaustion bring the price further down?\nExcitement continues to grow\nThe good news for crypto just keeps on coming, at least in the US, which is the main market for alternative assets. Only just last week, President Trump signed an executive order allowing Americans to invest their 401(k) retirement savings accounts into crypto. Looking into the future, this move alone could open the door to some of the more than $12 trillion that is invested into these plans.\nWith Bitcoin just having hit a new all-time high it might be expected that this surge continues. Excitement is growing by the day and the US stock exchanges are riding high, making their own all-time highs with mounting regularity.\nA note of caution\nHowever, Bitcoin is just on the edge of the overbought zone. Therefore, two possible scenarios could play out. Firstly, the market could continue to climb higher, but eventually reach a point where buyer exhaustion causes a precipitous plunge back to earth. The other potential scenario is that the Bitcoin price starts to track sideways again until the momentum indicators for the shorter term time frames have reset.\nThis is still a bull market\nOne thing to bear in mind is that this is a bull market, and it is entering what could be its final stage. The trend is up, and is likely to remain so. There will probably be more corrections to come, but in the main, this market is likely to go higher.\n$BTC in healthy trend higher\nSource: TradingView\nThe short-term time frame shows that since leaving the bull flag the $BTC price has continued higher, but in a very healthy ebb and flow manner, without surging madly.\nAfter making the all-time high, the price has come back to test the tops of the candles from the last upward impulse. The Fibonacci levels for this entire bull flag move reveal that the price is now beyond the 0.786 level. The 1.618 extension level is overhead, pretty much exactly at $130,000.\nFinally, the ascending trendline (faint dotted line) is still being respected. So until it’s not, this particular upside impulse is probably set to continue.\n$BTC continuation of this upside move?\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily time frame illustrates the trend break in the RSI. The indicator line broke up through the descending trendline and this was reflected in the bull flag breakout in the price action.\nNow this recent upward trend (faint dotted line) has reached the point where it will either continue, or it will break down. A bounce of the indicator line from this ascending trendline would signal a continuation of the upside move.\n$BTC price follows bull market parabolic curve\nSource: TradingView\nZoomed right out on the weekly time frame, the entirety of this bull run plus the climatic stage of the previous one can be viewed. The Fibonacci extension levels indicate that the 1.618 Fibonacci level was reached at just over $100,000, while the 2.618 level is overhead at a price of almost $155,000 - a very possible target.\nIt can be seen that the price action is still keeping to the parabolic curve, meaning that the price is likely to continue to rise steeply. At the bottom of the chart, the Hash Ribbons indicator has printed a row of 3 back-to-back blue buy signals. Such a tight group of 3 buy signals has never printed before on the weekly time frame. It can only be imagined what could happen to the price from here.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/from-010-to-033-why-funtoken-is-on-track-for-a-major-price-surge-in-2026",
        "text": "After a year of steady momentum, FUNToken ($FUN) - trading around $0.0185 at the time of writing - is drawing attention for a bold prediction: that it could first reach $0.10 in the coming months and then push as high as $0.33 in 2026.\nWhile many projects rely on speculation to drive targets, FUNToken’s approach combines a proven deflationary model, community-powered adoption, and a clear roadmap.\nHere is a closer look at why analysts and early supporters believe this path is more than wishful thinking.\nThe First Milestone: How $0.10 Became Realistic\nThroughout 2025, FUNToken has laid the groundwork for the initial price leg up to $0.10, powered by several tangible achievements:\n-\nConsistent Burns\nIn June 2025 alone, 25 million tokens were burned, with future burns projected to grow as revenue scales. -\nUser Growth Through Telegram\nOver 105,000 active players are already using FUNToken’s Telegram bot. As more games launch, this number is expected to double. -\nExpanding Wallet Adoption\nThe project’s roadmap targets 500,000 wallets by the end of Q4 2025, creating a broad base of participants who transact daily.\nThese fundamentals have created real upward price pressure, and reaching $0.10 is increasingly seen as the natural outcome of this progress rather than a speculative spike.\nWhat Will Drive the Next Phase to $0.33?\nMoving from $0.10 to $0.33 will require not just momentum but a different scale of adoption, engagement, and disciplined supply reduction. Here are the core drivers expected to power this next phase of growth:\n1. Scaling the Game Catalog\nBy early 2026, FUNToken plans to operate 30 or more live games across Telegram, iOS, and Android platforms. Each release has three important effects:\n-\nDaily Active Transactions: Every new game generates thousands of daily micro-transactions, each contributing to platform fees and demand for FUN tokens. This steady activity base helps support liquidity and price floors.\n-\nRevenue for Burns: As usage grows, so does platform revenue. This revenue is then recycled into quarterly buybacks, removing tokens from circulation in a predictable, transparent way.\n-\nReferral Growth: New titles give existing players reasons to invite friends, further expanding the user base. Telegram’s built-in referral tools make it simple for users to share links and earn bonuses.\nWith the roadmap targeting 10 million players by Q2 2026, the impact on demand could be substantial. No other gaming token project has laid out this level of detail for scaling both content and community.\n2. The $5 Million Giveaway’s Ongoing Impact\nUnlike many promotional campaigns that last only a few weeks, the $5 million giveaway is structured to run over an extended period, rewarding not just early adopters but also those who stay engaged.\nThis initiative drives growth in several ways:\n-\nIt incentivizes users to hold and stake their tokens, reducing circulating supply.\n-\nIt motivates new players to join, play, and refer friends to earn rewards.\n-\nIt creates sustained buzz across Telegram communities and social media channels.\nAs more participants qualify for rewards, the program is expected to bring the community into the hundreds of thousands, increasing both awareness and transaction volumes.\n3. Staking as a Scarcity Engine\nStaking will become a cornerstone of FUNToken’s strategy once the dedicated FUN Wallet app launches in the coming quarters.\nHere is why staking is so important:\n-\nPredictable Lock-Ups: Tokens staked in smart contracts are effectively removed from the trading supply for a set period, reducing liquidity and sell pressure.\n-\nIncentives to Hold: Players will have reasons beyond passive yields to stake, including access to exclusive games, higher rewards, and premium features.\n-\nAccessibility: Integrating staking directly into the wallet app eliminates the need for separate DeFi platforms, making it easy for casual users to participate.\nIf even 20–30% of the growing base of wallet holders stake some of their tokens, the cumulative impact on supply could be significant, supporting a sustained price climb toward $0.33.\n4. Compounding Deflation\nOne of FUNToken’s most powerful mechanics is its commitment to quarterly burns funded by real platform revenue.\nOver time, the effect of these burns compounds:\n-\nEach quarter, fewer tokens remain in circulation.\n-\nAs the user base grows, the volume of burns increases.\n-\nA smaller supply means each incremental buy order has more impact on price.\nIn June 2025, the project burned 25 million FUN tokens. With the planned expansion in games, staking, and active users, future burns could grow substantially. Historically, this combination of shrinking supply and rising demand has been the catalyst for major price movements in other deflationary ecosystems.\nWhat the Timeline Looks Like\nHere is a simplified view of how this journey could unfold:\n|\nMilestone |\nEstimated Period |\nTarget Price Range |\n|\n$0.10 achieved |\nQ4 2025 |\n$0.08 – $0.10 |\n|\n1M wallets and 10M players |\nQ2 2026 |\n$0.15 – $0.20 |\n|\nSustained burns and staking growth |\nQ3 – Q4 2026 |\n$0.25 – $0.33 |\nWhile no outcome is guaranteed, this roadmap demonstrates a clear, staged approach to scaling both utility and token scarcity.\nWhat Sets FUNToken Apart\nHere are a few reasons FUNToken’s strategy is different from other gaming tokens:\n-\nProven Execution\nEvery major milestone so far has been delivered transparently. -\nAccessible Onboarding\nWith frictionless Telegram integration and a simple wallet app, the project is attracting casual users, not just crypto traders. -\nCommunity-Driven Growth\nThe combination of staking, referrals, and the giveaway creates incentives for long-term holding and organic expansion.\nFinal Thoughts\nFUNToken’s journey from $0.10 to $0.33 will depend on continued execution and community engagement. But unlike projects that rely on hype cycles, FUNToken’s fundamentals are rooted in measurable adoption, regular burns, and a roadmap the team has consistently delivered on.\nFor investors and supporters watching closely, 2026 could be the year this unique combination of gaming, deflation, and community incentives translates into one of the most significant price surges in the Web3 space.\nNote: The price mentioned was accurate at the time of writing (July 14, 2025) and may have changed since\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/142-gain-from-0004-to-0009-unils-415-increase-upon-listing-is-set-to-outshine-bnb-and-ada-time-to-buy",
        "text": "The new AI altcoin Unilabs Finance (UNIL) has become a strong alternative to the BNB coin and Cardano crypto. Surpassing $12.8 million in funding in record time amid massive retail and whale demand, experts consider it the best new crypto to invest in. Its projected 415% rally from $0.009 to $0.05 makes it a bullish wave not to miss.\nThe BNB Coin Approaches a New High; Is a Pullback Close?\nAs the overall crypto market cap increased, exceeding $4 trillion, so did the BNB coin price. The exchange-based token surged by 10% over the past seven days to $830, approaching a breakout above its July ATH of $859.\nWith daily trading volume surpassing $2.8 billion (a 2% increase) and a broader market rally, the BNB coin could enter price discovery soon. However, despite the optimistic token price outlook, technical indicators, notably the RSI and MACD, suggest it is in an overbought area and could decline.\nNevertheless, a sustained rally, plus accelerating momentum, could send the BNB coin price higher, echoing Josh’s $920 target. However, if current support is lost, the altcoin price could retest its 30-day low of $675.\nCardano Crypto to $1 Soon?\nThe Layer-1 crypto ADA skyrocketed, marked by a 15% increase in the Cardano crypto price to $0.8. Surging forward, the market cap has also increased by 7% to $29.7 billion, cementing its position among the top 10 cryptocurrencies.\nAt the same time, the daily token trading volume has exceeded $2 billion (a 40% increase). As momentum accelerates, a breakout above $1 seems imminent, presenting a bullish and optimistic price outlook. Meanwhile, a breakout above $0.9 could ignite a significant run, positioning the Cardano crypto among the altcoins to watch.\nFurthermore, according to Messari, mindshare is “very high,” rising by 13% in the past week. This on-chain metric suggests growing investor interest and positions the Cardano crypto for higher upside. However, a dip below $0.75 could ignite a cascading sell-off toward $0.68, its 30-day low.\nUnilabs Finance (UNIL) — Can This New AI Token Outshine Top Altcoins?\nFollowing a 142% rally from $0.004 to $0.009, its current price in the sixth ICO stage, Unilabs Finance (UNIL) has been on investors’ radars. Still in its early stages, participation in the presale will yield a 415% gain at the listing price of $0.05, making it arguably the best new crypto to invest in.\nWith many looking beyond its anticipated gain, another of its biggest attractions is its bullish narrative. Compared to other DeFi protocols, Unilabs Finance (UNIL) intersects with artificial intelligence and traditional finance. It will be the world’s first AI-driven DeFi asset manager, poised to reshape the financial landscape and primed for adoption.\nAs it nears its debut, experts are optimistic about it outshining other protocols in the DeFAI category. For instance, while SUPRA has a $70 million market size and PAAL has a $110 million market cap, UNIL is on track for massive growth. This is because of features like staking and governance, as well as the sharing of 30% of the generated fees to token holders.\nClosing Thoughts\nAmid soaring presale demand, the UNIL ICO has crossed $12.8 million in funding and skyrocketed by 142%. With a 415% increase programmed on the launch day at $0.05, experts believe it is the best new crypto to invest in, potentially outshining the BNB coin and Cardano crypto.\nFor more information about Unilabs Finance (UNIL) visit the links below:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Finding the best crypto to invest in right now means looking at more than just hype. You need networks that have a clear purpose, strong community backing, and momentum in both adoption and market activity. This list covers four options making noise for the right reasons, each with unique angles that could drive growth in 2025.\nCold Wallet is flipping the traditional wallet model by rewarding users for every on-chain move, while Dogecoin, Pepe, and Shiba Inu continue to dominate the meme coin conversation with strong price action and whale activity. The market is shifting fast, and these picks show a mix of utility, cultural influence, and growing traction. Here’s why they’re worth watching before the next surge hits.\n1. Cold Wallet Turns Usage into Rewards\nCold Wallet isn’t here to be a storage app, it’s built to reward every action you take on-chain. Instead of paying fees and moving on, you get CWT cashback for gas, swaps, and on/off-ramps. The rewards scale with how much CWT you hold, with Diamond tier users getting up to 100% of their gas back. This is a wallet that puts value back in your pocket every time you use it, turning everyday crypto activity into an income loop.\nThe Cold Wallet presale is live in its 17th stage with prices at $0.00998 and has raised more than $5.9 million in record time. Each presale stage sees a price increase. That means the earlier you join, the more you get for the same spend. With 40% of supply allocated to the presale, plus extra bonuses for referrals, the structure is built to reward quick movers. Combine that with its no-staking tier system, and you have a setup where rewards scale naturally as you hold more CWT.\nFor anyone scanning the market for the best crypto to invest in, Cold Wallet checks every box: genuine utility, a product users will return to daily, and incentives designed to keep the token in demand. The cashback model is straightforward but powerful, and the team’s push towards Layer 2 solutions could make rewards instant and free to claim. Waiting too long could mean buying in at much higher prices\n2. Dogecoin Maintains Whale Interest\nDogecoin (DOGE) has seen renewed movement this week, trading around $0.2257 with 24-hour highs near $0.2258 and lows of $0.2057. Its market cap sits above $33 billion, placing it firmly in the top 10. Whale accumulation has been a big driver lately, with over 1 billion DOGE purchased in just 24 hours, sending trading volume past the $1 billion mark.\nThis kind of whale activity often sets the tone for broader market sentiment. DOGE is now testing resistance around $0.225, and breaking that could push it towards $0.232. While short-term pullbacks are possible, the combination of high liquidity and its strong retail following keeps it relevant for anyone considering the best crypto to invest in. For traders, DOGE remains one of the most recognizable and liquid meme coins, giving it staying power in volatile markets.\n3. Pepe Gains on Bullish Signals\nPepe (PEPE) is showing signs of upward momentum, currently trading around $0.000011 with daily gains between 5% and 7%. Trading volume has stayed strong at over $700 million, with a market cap hovering near $4.6–$4.8 billion. A TD Sequential “buy” signal has fueled speculation of more upside, while macro factors like expected U.S. rate cuts have added to the risk-on sentiment.\nPEPE has already proven it can deliver major spikes when volume surges, and high liquidity makes it appealing for active traders. While ambitious targets like $1 are unrealistic, technical setups still suggest room for growth in the short term. For those building a list of the best crypto to invest in, PEPE offers the mix of volatility and community enthusiasm that can drive big moves when market sentiment turns bullish.\n4. Shiba Inu Shows Signs of Recovery\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is trading near $0.00001296 with a market cap of about $7.6 billion, ranking #22. Over the last seven days, it’s up around 12%, backed by ecosystem activity through Shibarium, ShibaSwap, and token burns. Whale accumulation has been reported alongside a 12,887% spike in large-holder outflows, a stat that stands out even if the base number was small.\nSHIB has clear cultural weight in the meme coin sector and continues to build DeFi infrastructure that could help sustain relevance. Key resistance sits near $0.00001599, and holding above current support could open the door for a push higher. For those considering the best crypto to invest in, SHIB offers both speculative upside and an active developer base working on real-world use cases. That combination keeps it in the conversation even as newer meme coins fight for attention.\nSumming Up\nThe best crypto to invest in today depends on your mix of goals, whether you want utility-driven growth or meme coin volatility. Cold Wallet brings a unique angle by rewarding usage, with a presale model that directly benefits early participants. Dogecoin shows continued whale interest and high liquidity, making it a stable meme coin option.\nPepe offers aggressive upside potential tied to technical signals and community hype, while Shiba Inu blends cultural relevance with infrastructure building. Each has distinct strengths, but timing is key, prices and momentum can change quickly. Acting before the next major move could make the difference between catching the run early or buying after the market has already shifted.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "As the Shiba Inu (SHIB) chart shows a notable 2.57% increase in the past 24 hours, traders are wondering: Is this the beginning of a serious rebound, or just another short-term \"dead cat bounce\"? With the price currently at $0.00001267, Shiba Inu has been climbing steadily from its recent low of $0.00001234, suggesting some renewed optimism. Investors looking for better opportunities in the meme coin space might want to keep an eye on two emerging competitors that are quickly gaining traction: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and its innovative Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 blockchain, and the rapidly growing token backed by strong security and community involvement.\nShiba Inu: Short-Term Bullish Momentum, But Potential Resistance Ahead\nSHIB is indicating near-term bullish activity in its price action. Trading volume increased by 122.98% over the last 24 hours, indicating an increase in interest in the market. The recent growth in the price of SHIB is comparable to the growth in the overall market value of the asset, which currently stands at $7.53 billion as the market cap.\nInvestors are, however, advised to be wary of SHIB, which is set to touch possible resistance points of the price in the range of $0.0000127.\nCardano (ADA) Shows Bullish Momentum with 3.73% Increase\nCardano (ADA) has recorded a 7.44% surge and is trading at around $0.7906. This is shown by the bouncing of the price at the relatively low price of $0.7413 following a bullish direction with an increase in the market sentiment.\nThe increase in volume was 102.46%, which was a sign of greater market participation. There was also an increasing market cap to 28.01 billion, which further strengthens the momentum in the upswing of ADA. Nonetheless, ADA may meet some resistance at a mark of about $0.792 that may restrict its increase in the short term. Conversely, there is support at $0.7376, and as long as this support holds, ADA could have a bullish price run.\nLittle Pepe: A Meme Coin With Real Utility\nLILPEPE is unlike many other meme coins that use solely hype. The memecoin is becoming a serious crypto project by launching its Ethereum-compatible layer-2 chain. This latest innovation makes Little Pepe have an advantage over other meme tokens since the currency has higher transaction speeds, reduced costs, and improved scalability. This is an essential set of features of a project that is based on high levels of community participation and active trading.\nThe reason most people are talking about Little Pepe isn’t just because it taps into meme culture, but also due to its focus on utility and infrastructure. Built on a Layer-2 Ethereum-compatible blockchain, it enables decentralized applications (dApps), liquidity pools, and other features that help establish a healthy ecosystem where both users and developers can participate. Additionally, with anti-sniper bot protection, LILPEPE aims to create a fair trading environment by preventing automated bots from manipulating token issuances and market activity. With the stage 10 presale of LILPEPE nearing completion and more than 11.59 billion tokens already sold, the demand for LILPEPE is undeniable. Currently priced at $0.0019, the token price is set to increase to $0.0020 in the next stage, offering an incentive for early investors to buy now.\nCertiK Audit: Proven Security for Investors\nBesides innovative blockchain features, Little Pepe has also been through a CertiK audit, which is one of the most well-regarded security-side verifications in the crypto world. LILPEPE is demonstrating its intentions concerning security and transparency with its strong audit score of 95.49%. The audit includes the functionality of smart contracts, the known vulnerabilities, and the compliance to the ERC-20 standard, so that investors are confident that they can deal with the Little Pepe ecosystem.\nWhy Little Pepe Might Be Superior to SHIB as a Purchase\nThe advantage of the market demand, a successful presale, and a safe, scalable, layer-2 infrastructure put Little Pepe ahead of the pack of meme coins. Although the recent bull run of Shiba Inu might mean that it is experiencing a short-term recovery, it is a risky decision because of the chances that a pullback might happen. Alternatively, the true potential of Little Pepe, its innovative blockchain, and high-level security promote an attractive long-term prospect to consider among the representatives of the meme token world.\nDon’t Miss the Giveaway!\nThe project is also offering a limited-time giveaway opportunity for 10 lucky winners to each receive $77,000 worth of $LILPEPE tokens, totaling $777,000 in prizes. To participate, simply contribute a minimum of $100 to the presale, complete giveaway tasks, and earn bonus entries to increase your chances of winning. As its community grows, it receives investor support and has a focus on the actual utility in the meme coin market; Little Pepe might become the next big thing to break through Shiba Inu.\nFor More Details About Little PEPE, Visit The Below Link:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

But while the buying pressure has been substantial, recent price action shows that even in a bullish macro trend, short-term corrections remain part of the game.\nBTC Institutional Inflows Surge in 2025\nThe scale of institutional participation this year is remarkable:\n-\n$50 Billion in 2025 Alone – A Deutsche Bank report estimates that institutional investment inflows into Bitcoin have already topped $50 billion this year.\n-\nETF Powerhouses – BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now holds more than $80 billion in assets, surpassing the growth trajectory of gold ETFs at the same stage.\nSource: blackrock.com\n-\nRecord-Breaking ETF Flows – Spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted $14.8 billion in inflows as of late July, driven by both retail and institutional buyers.\n-\nLong-Term Projections – Strategic studies forecast inflows reaching $120 billion by 2025 and up to $300 billion by 2026, potentially accelerating Bitcoin’s path toward broader adoption.\nThese figures highlight a structural shift — Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative retail asset but an increasingly embedded component of institutional portfolios.\nSmart PR in Bull Markets: Outset PR’s Role\nIn conditions like these — where institutional capital is flowing and market sentiment is strong — smart PR becomes an indispensable growth multiplier. Whether markets are surging or consolidating, strategic communications can determine whether a brand rides the trend or gets lost in the noise.\nIf PR has ever felt like navigating a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data. Its strategies combine retrospective and real-time metrics to deliver results with lasting impact. Rather than relying on vague promises, Outset PR delivers concrete plans tied to perfect publication timing, product–market fit-driven narratives, and performance-based media selection.\nWhile many crypto PR agencies rely on standardized packages and mass outreach, Outset PR builds tailored campaigns calibrated to each client’s goals, budget, and growth stage. Its proprietary traffic acquisition technology blends organic editorial placements with SEO and lead generation, allowing clients to dominate high-discovery surfaces.\nThe firm’s internal media analytics desk tracks outlet performance by domain activity, month-on-month visibility shifts, audience geography, and traffic sources — enabling data-driven media targeting.\nIn a market upswing, such as Bitcoin’s current momentum phase, the opportunity window for visibility is wide open — but only for brands that know how to time and place their stories. Outset PR ensures clients are positioned where the market’s attention is highest.\n👉 Reach Out to Outset PR to Boost Your Brand Visibility\nBTC Price Reaction: Rally Meets Pullback\nDespite these inflows, Bitcoin’s price has seen notable short-term volatility:\n-\nCurrent Price – As of now, BTC is trading near $118,458, down 1.6% from its previous close.\n-\nIntraday Range – The day’s high reached $120,726, with a low of $118,249, reflecting a pullback from the recent all-time high of around $123K.\n-\nETF Outflows Amid Inflows – While total inflows remain strong, short bursts of outflows — like BlackRock’s IBIT recent $292 million withdrawal — can trigger quick retracements.\nThis suggests that while the long-term institutional trend is supportive, short-term price action can still be heavily influenced by liquidity shifts and profit-taking.\nConclusion\nInstitutional inflows into Bitcoin show no sign of slowing, with billions in capital reshaping market dynamics in 2025. While short-term dips below $120K are natural, the structural demand from ETFs, corporate treasuries, and sovereign funds creates a solid foundation for long-term growth.\nFor crypto brands, moments like this are a rare alignment of market and narrative opportunity. With Outset PR’s data-driven, tailored strategies, the potential to capture and convert market attention is greater than ever.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "The cryptocurrency market no longer feels like an experimental playground where speculation ruled the day. Over the past few years, it has matured into a space where structure, clear objectives, and measurable progress matter just as much as price action.\nProjects now compete on technology delivery, adoption metrics, and consistent execution, rather than simply riding hype cycles. This shift has made it easier to identify the top cryptos to buy now among names like Arbitrum, Stellar, and Mantle, based on real performance indicators. Let’s look at why these are considered the top cryptos to buy now, setting the stage for a deeper review of each.\n1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Pre-Launch Push Gains Market Momentum\nBlockDAG is gaining strong traction ahead of its mainnet, positioning itself among the top cryptos to buy now. Its approach focuses on building infrastructure and community before going live, a strategy that has already delivered impressive results.\nThe project has secured over $373 million in funding, sold more than 25 billion BDAG coins, and advanced through 29 batches, with the latest priced at $0.0276. Early participants from Batch 1 have already seen returns exceeding 2,600% compared to the current rate.\nThe network merges Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) scalability with Proof-of-Work (PoW) security, creating a hybrid Layer-1 model designed for speed, decentralisation, and resilience. This architecture addresses common blockchain bottlenecks while maintaining robust security standards, making it attractive for long-term adoption.\nBlockDAG’s ecosystem is already active. The X1 mobile mining app has attracted over 2.5 million users, while 19,000 ASIC miners have been distributed globally. This dual-tier mining system allows both casual participants and dedicated miners to contribute, ensuring a diverse hashrate and reducing the risk of centralisation.\nA live Demo Trading Dashboard adds another layer of engagement, letting users simulate trades, monitor real-time prices, and test platform features before the full launch. Unlike many early-stage crypto projects that depend on post-launch activity, BlockDAG (BDAG) enters the market with a ready community, functioning tools, and operational mining power.\n2. Arbitrum (ARB): Ethereum’s Layer-2 Leader\nArbitrum, priced at $0.40, is the leading Ethereum Layer-2 solution, integrating DeFi, NFTs, and numerous applications. Its expanding Total Value Locked (TVL) and strong network activity support long-term price growth. Analysts suggest ARB could reach $2.00–$3.00 in the next cycle, delivering 5–7x potential gains.\nFor example, $50 could become $300–$350. This consistent performance positions ARB as a reliable mid-cap choice. With its solid fundamentals and steady adoption, it earns a place among the top cryptos to buy now for balanced growth potential in a portfolio focused on both stability and reasonable returns.\n3. Stellar (XLM): Cross-Border Payments Power\nStellar trades at $0.41 with a $12.97 billion market cap, designed for fast cross-border transactions, remittances, and tokenised asset transfers. With a track record of real-world usage, XLM remains far below its all-time high of $0.94. A recovery to $1.50–$2.00 could mean a 4x–5x rise, where a $50 stake might turn into $200–$250.\nWhile its speculative upside is lower than some, Stellar’s practical utility strengthens portfolio diversity. For those aiming for consistent and utility-driven returns, it remains one of the most dependable picks among the current top cryptos to buy today.\n4. Mantle (MNT): Scalable Ethereum Rollup\nMantle, backed by BitDAO, operates as a modular Ethereum rollup, supporting DeFi and advanced infrastructure projects. Currently valued at $2.9 billion and priced at $0.87, it offers scalability and efficiency. Market forecasts point to significant growth in its Total Value Locked (TVL) and user activity, possibly pushing its price to $4–$8.\nThis translates into potential 5–10x returns, where $50 could grow to $250–$500. It serves as a strong mid-tier growth opportunity within a diversified portfolio, securing its position as one of today’s top cryptos to buy now for those seeking steady yet rewarding performance.\nLast Word on the Market’s Most Reliable Performers\nMarket cycles often reshape which projects hold lasting value, and the current phase is no exception. BlockDAG’s pre-launch momentum, proven fundraising success, and already active mining ecosystem make it the most compelling of the top cryptos to buy now. Arbitrum continues to benefit from its expanding role as Ethereum’s leading Layer-2, supported by consistent network growth.\nStellar’s focus on efficient cross-border transactions adds stability to any diversified portfolio. Mantle’s scalable rollup model positions it for steady adoption in DeFi infrastructure. Together, they reflect a market where structure now outweighs speculation, offering measured opportunities for those watching long-term performance.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Now in its third year, the hit game gives fans itching to call the shots an opportunity to live the plays rather than watch them. With a fairer economy, fresh game modes, and over 800 new player cards, now’s the time to unleash your inner coach, assemble a killer team, and chase gridiron glory.\nA Brand-New Playbook\nOfficially licensed by the National Football League, NFL Rivals has over six million downloads since launching two years ago. Not content with these accomplishments, its creator, Mythical Games, is introducing multiple bold changes from August 27, having acknowledged that the game “hit a wall in Year 2.”\nAn arcade-style strategy game, NFL Rivals compels players to assemble a squad from collectible player cards, ranging from Common to Elite, and test their strategy in fast-paced, high-energy games. Among other notable changes, Season 3 will tackle a key issue from last year: namely, the inability of new players to compete with veterans managing overpowered teams. Consequently, base cards have been replaced by Training Points, which help you upgrade your roster’s performance.\nBy ensuring new players aren’t outmatched by pros with significant power advantages, Mythical Games is targeting further growth rather than seeking to appease existing players. Cards from in-game packs now start locked, encouraging their use in gameplay rather than instant trading, with cheaper pack prices sweetening the deal.\nFor those still keen to trade peer-to-peer, Mint Tokens unlock cards for the open market, keeping the game’s economy vibrant.\nShowdown at the Stadium\nOne of the biggest changes to be made ahead of season 3 is the introduction of Stadiums Mode, wherein real-time PvP matches are set based on skill level and the winner unlocks up to ten stadiums of varying difficulty. Stadium Mode is activated via in-game coins, and rewards depend on wins, league standings, and stadium progress. Interestingly, matches in Stadiums Mode aren’t timed but rather based on total-plays-per-game.\nAs for leagues, they will now run from Monday to Monday, with rankings tied to coins earned in Stadiums and Events. It’s a competitive overhaul designed to reward strategy, skill and endeavor, whether you’re a rookie or a seasoned tactician.\nAlso sure to be popular with new players are the edits made to the upgrade system. Gone are the days of endless grinding for high-tier cards; now the focus is on fun, with Training Points and Rank Up Tokens – earned by burning cards – letting you boost star players without needing a massive budget. Or to put it another way, to upgrade a player’s tier, you must feed them other cards. Naturally, Season 3 minted cards have a special significance: they get an extra rank, an extra special star, and five bonus levels..\nWith over 800 new cards across all 32 teams – including one Legendary player per team boasting 145–150 power (PWR) – NFL Rivals will benefit from the added firepower. And with squad-building easier than ever, newcomers won’t feel like they’re outgunned from the get-go.\nEasy to Start, Hard to Master\nNFL Rivals isn’t just about building a roster — it’s about outsmarting opponents through smart squad-building and clever plays. Whether you’re a casual fan or a playbook nerd, the game’s arcade vibe and strategic depth deliver.\nBy lowering pack prices, improving card quality, and reducing the gap between new and veteran players, Mythical Games hopes to entice new blood while keeping veterans on-side. Or in their own words, hitting “the sweet spot: easy to start, hard to master.”\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Cryptocurrency exchange BTCC has unveiled its first sports sponsorship deal by naming Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies forward and 2023 NBA Defensive Player of the Year, as its global brand ambassador.\nThe agreement signals BTCC’s growing interest in expanding crypto’s presence in mainstream culture by partnering with a high-profile athlete who exemplifies consistency, discipline, and forward thinking, values the company says have shaped its 14-year history in the digital asset space.\n“Jaren brings authenticity, consistency, and a championship mindset, values that mirror what we’ve built at BTCC over the past 14 years,” said Aaryn Ling, Head of Branding at BTCC. “We’re not here for hype, we’re here for substance, and Jaren’s personality and traits embodies all that as a sporting, cultura,l and lifestyle icon. We welcome Jackson to the BTCC family and are excited for what is to come!”\nKnown for his elite shot-blocking ability and leadership on the court, Jackson Jr. has also built a strong presence off the court with a passion for music, fashion, and creative expression. The partnership with BTCC seeks to reflect that multidimensional identity—combining professional sports, culture, and next-generation finance in a broader effort to connect with global audiences.\n“I’m very excited to join the BTCC family. They’re not just another crypto brand; they’ve been in it for over a decade, and that kind of consistency means something to me. I’ve always believed in doing the work, staying disciplined, and thinking long term, whether that’s in basketball or building your future. Partnering with a platform that shares that mindset is a natural step for me, and I look forward to this journey,” said Jackson Jr.\nBTCC plans to use the collaboration to launch fan engagement initiatives, highlight core platform features such as futures trading and copy trading, and develop original content that offers a closer look at Jackson Jr.'s journey both on and off the court. Through these efforts, the company aims to bridge the gap between professional athletes and the evolving crypto landscape.\nAt the heart of the campaign is a shared commitment to security, focus, and long-term strategy. BTCC emphasizes that its platform enables users to explore the world of digital assets with confidence, while Jackson Jr. continues to lead on the court and inspire fans around the world.\nTo celebrate the new partnership, BTCC will host a trading competition featuring a significant prize pool and exclusive signed merchandise from Jackson Jr. Further details will be released via BTCC’s official website and X account.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Pantera Capital has confirmed an investment of over $300 million into digital asset treasury (DAT) companies, signalling confidence in their potential to outperform traditional crypto investment vehicles such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nWhat Are Digital Asset Treasuries?\nDAT companies maintain significant cryptocurrency holdings on their balance sheets and actively deploy them to generate yield, aiming to compound returns over time.\nThese public companies differ from passive crypto holders by leveraging their reserves through activities such as staking, lending, and other yield-generating strategies. By doing so, they aim to increase net asset value per share and expand token ownership. Pantera believes this approach offers superior return potential compared to simply holding tokens directly or via ETFs, which typically track spot market performance without generating operational yield.\nPantera’s Investment Scope and Thesis\nThe venture capital firm has targeted DAT firms in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Israel, with holdings spanning Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, BNB, Toncoin, Hyperliquid, Sui, and Ethena. Companies in Pantera’s portfolio include BitMine Immersion, Twenty One Capital, DeFi Development Corp, SharpLink Gaming, Satsuma Technology, Verb Technology Company, CEA Industries, and Mill City Ventures III.\nGeneral partner Cosmo Jiang and head of content Erik Lowe emphasised that these companies are “employing strategies to grow their digital asset holdings in a per-share accretive way,” positioning them to benefit from both market appreciation and yield generation.\nEthereum as a Core Bet\nBitMine Immersion, one of Pantera’s key investments, has recently launched an Ethereum-focused treasury strategy, becoming the largest ETH treasury holder and the third-largest DAT globally with 1.15 million ETH valued at $4.9 billion as of August 10. Pantera views Ethereum as a long-term macro growth driver, underpinned by increasing institutional adoption, tokenization of real-world assets, and stablecoin expansion.\nPublic blockchains currently host more than $25 billion in tokenized assets and $260 billion in stablecoins, with Ethereum capturing the majority of this activity. Since April 2025, ETH has gained 103% against Bitcoin, reinforcing Pantera’s conviction in its structural growth trajectory.\nMarket Context and Outlook\nThe rise of DATs reflects a broader institutional trend toward onchain treasury management. As financial institutions integrate blockchain for security, settlement, and staking participation, Pantera expects further growth in both the number and scale of DAT companies. The firm has raised two DAT-specific funds totalling over $100 million and has yet to decide on launching a third.\nBy aligning with companies actively compounding token holdings, Pantera aims to capture outsized gains compared to passive exposure, betting that crypto treasuries will emerge as a key segment in the digital asset market.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Several bullish technical signals are aligning for XRP, making this a critical moment for the cryptocurrency. The price has been steadily climbing lately while holding firm above strong support near $2.68. Stable moving averages and an RSI below overbought territory point to healthy momentum with room to run. Combined with a historically reliable XRP-specific trend indicator flashing positive, these factors suggest the bulls may be preparing for their next push.\nIn market conditions like this, Outset PR delivers the data-driven insights and precision storytelling that help projects capture maximum visibility when investor attention is at its peak.\nXRP Eyes Potential Gains with Steady Climb\nSource: tradingview\nXRP is currently trading between almost $3 and a bit over $3.40. It's nearing a key level at nearly $3.65, which, if crossed, could drive prices higher. Recent weeks have shown a steady rise of almost 4%, while the last month saw growth of over 16%. In half a year, XRP's price climbed around 29%, indicating strong potential for further increase. If momentum carries it past $3.64, the next target is about $4.12. This would represent a significant rise from current levels. Investors remain hopeful as market signals suggest room for further growth, especially if support holds firm near $2.68.\nPR with C-Level Clarity: Outset PR’s Proprietary Techniques Deliver Tangible Results\nIf PR has ever felt like trying to navigate a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data.

This is PR with a personal touch, where strategy feels handcrafted and every client gets a solution that fits.\nOutset PR’s secret weapon is its exclusive traffic acquisition tech and internal media analytics.\nProprietary Tech That Powers Performance\nOne of Outset PR’s most impactful tools is its in-house user acquisition system. It fuses organic editorial placements with SEO and lead-generation tactics, enabling clients to appear in high-discovery surfaces and drive multiples more traffic than through conventional PR alone.\n|\nCase in point: Crypto exchange ChangeNOW experienced a sustained 40% boost in reach after Outset PR amplified a well-polished organic coverage with a massive Google Discover campaign, powered by its proprietary content distribution engine. |\nDrive More Traffic with Outset PR’s In-house Tech\nOutset PR Notices Media Trends Ahead of the Crowd\nOutset PR obtains unique knowledge through its in-house analytical desk which gives it a competitive edge. The team regularly provides valuable insights into the performance of crypto media outlets based on the criteria like:\n-\ndomain activity\n-\nmonth-on-month visibility shifts\n-\naudience geography\n-\nsource of traffic\nBy consistently publishing analytical reports, identifying performance trends, and raising the standards of media targeting across the industry, Outset PR unlocks a previously untapped niche in crypto PR, which poses it as a trendsetter in this field.\n|\nCase in point: The careful selection of media outlets has helped Outset PR increase user engagement for Step App in the US and UK markets. |\nOutset PR Engineers Visibility That Fits the Market\nOne of the biggest pain points in Web3 PR is the disconnect between effort and outcome: generic messaging, no product-market alignment, and media hits that generate visibility but leave business impact undefined. Outset PR addresses this by offering customized solutions. Every campaign begins with a thorough research and follows a clearly mapped path from spend to the result.

This system enforces data quality and coordinates participation through four integrated mechanisms: staking, validation, reputation, and incentives.\nRowan Stone, CEO of Sapien, says, “Sapien exists to help AI teams answer two questions that matter for every decision their models make: where did this data come from, and can it be trusted? Onchain systems have proven that incentives can organize capital at scale. We’re applying the same principles to knowledge through our Proof of Quality protocol, aligning incentives to verify provenance and scale high-value data. The aim is simple: make human data traceable, trustworthy, and scalable so the AI built on it can actually improve lives.”\nSapien is already trusted by leading organizations, including Midjourney, Workday, Alibaba, GAC, Lenovo, Transsion, CarVertical, and the United Nations.\nThe upcoming TGE introduces a fair launch model that balances early utility, contributor rewards, investor alignment, and long-term community governance. At launch, 25% of the total token supply will be unlocked, with the remaining 75% released through transparent vesting schedules. The total token supply is capped at 1,000,000,000 $SAPIEN.\nToken Distribution Overview\n- Ticker: SAPIEN\n- Total Supply: 1,000,000,000\n- Network: Base (ERC-20)\n- TGE Date: Aug. 20, 2025\nEligible contributors will be able to claim a portion of their airdrop immediately following the TGE. This marks the first season of the Sapien Airdrop, an ongoing campaign designed to retroactively reward high-quality contributions.\nTo prepare for the drop, point accumulation for task-based work has been paused. A final leaderboard will be published ahead of the August 20th event. After the TGE, contributors will begin earning $USDC and $SAPIEN directly through the platform.\nCookie and Kaito campaigns will continue awarding points for eligible social content. Cookie’s claim window will also open at TGE, with vesting terms to be announced separately.\nSeason 1 Airdrop Pool:\n- 5% to contributors based on confirmed points\n- 0.5% CookieDAO allocation to top 10,000 Snappers\n- 25% to the top 100\n- 30% unlocked at TGE, then 3 months linear vesting\nSapien Squad and Discord Role holders will also receive a bonus allocation based on their participation.\nToken Allocation Breakdown\nSapien is led by Rowan Stone, co-creator of Base at Coinbase, and Trevor Koverko, founder of Polymath, and backed by leading investors including Variant, Primitive Ventures, Yield Guild Games (YGG), and Orange DAO through its $10.5M seed round.\nSapien is actively collaborating with strategic partners such as AirTM, GIG, Intract, KGeN, Mises Browser, OpenLedger, Sentient Open AGI, Veera, Worldcoin, and YGG.\nAbout Sapien\nSapien is building a decentralized data foundry, a permissionless protocol enabling enterprises, AI models, and agents to source expert knowledge at scale.

In the world of meme coins, few projects balance humor and technical depth this effectively.\nPEPD Presale Snapshot\nThe Top Crypto ICO for Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is in Stage 1, nearly complete:\n-\nPrice: $0.004688\n-\nLaunch Price: $0.03695\n-\nProgress: 97% sold\n-\nUSD Raised: $1,280,167 of $1,317,138\n-\nTokens Sold: 273,073,174 of 280,959,484\nInvestors using the promotional bonus code get a larger token allocation, making this entry point even more compelling.\nJoin Pepe Dollar Presale:\nPepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/\nPepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity\nPEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar\nPENGU’s Market Strength\nTrading at around $0.035, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has carved out a unique lane as one of three microcap meme coins identified for potential 100x gains in the next bull market. Its combination of NFT credibility, Solana-based token utility, and global retail presence gives it an edge over pure-play meme tokens.\nWhy Analysts Group Them Together\nThe logic is simple: PENGU offers cultural staying power through brand expansion, while Pepe Dollar (PEPD) delivers speculative firepower via the Top Crypto ICO model. Together, they provide investors with a balanced meme portfolio — one for the long game, and one for the high-velocity sprint.\nConclusion\nPudgy Penguins (PENGU) may win hearts, but Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is out to win wallets. With the Top Crypto ICO nearly sold out and a promotional bonus code in circulation, early entrants have a chance to secure a stake in one of the most buzzed-about launches of 2025 before it leaves the presale stage.\nJoin Pepe Dollar Presale:\nPepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/\nPepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity\nPEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Crypto presale markets are heating up as many of their projects reach their fundraising goals before August ends. Top of the chart is Ozak AI, which has a price of 0.005 $OZ in phase four and a commitment price of $1. The AI-enhanced blockchain governance and predictive analytics systems of the project make it a competent candidate to outgrow Solana in its early development rate.\nPredictive Blockchain Governance offered by Ozak AI\nOzak AI combines the organizational structure of decentralized autonomous organizations and artificial intelligence to reinvent governance, efficiencies, and automation in a blockchain ecosystem. It employs predictive analytics to sweep through market facts, identify them, and prepare actionable forecasts to inform more improved community decisions. The intention of this approach is to advance the rate of participation and avoid manipulation of governance.\nOzak AI is now in Presale Phase 4, priced at $0.005 per $OZ token with an impressive 121,052,065.346 $OZ tokens sold so far, raising a total of $1,805,260.236. With marking a 400% jump from its initial $0.001 launch price. With a projected listing at $0.05 and a target of $1, early investors could enjoy substantial returns up to 200x. Already listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, the project features exciting giveaways.\nThis Ozak AI platform promotes automation during the analysis of proposals, delegation of votes, and audit of smart contracts. Using AI-driven systems, governance proposals are categorized according to their susceptibility to a potential impact, and weaknesses are identified prior to implementation. This guarantees smooth operation of DAO routine activities without necessarily depending on human interaction.\nOzak AI ensures high security levels through recognizing and preventing fraudulent accounts and suspicious money transmission behavior in real-time. Its fraud models prevent the abuse of the attempts, like Sybil attacks, by detecting the abnormal activity within the blockchain records. This reinforces governance, and it is transparent.\nThe ecosystem integrates Arbitrum Orbit for Layer-2 scalability, enabling faster smart contract execution and lower gas costs. In addition, it uses EigenLayer AVS to secure transaction validation, ensuring tamper-proof governance processes. These integrations improve both performance and trust in the system.\nOzak AI also utilizes AI in decentralized finance to streamline treasury management, automate dispute resolution, and provide personalized governance advice. These characteristics make it a complete governance and analysis scheme of rising DeFi and crypto AI industries.\nNexChain’s High-Speed AI Blockchain Integration\nNexChain provides a Layer 1 blockchain capable of delivering AI-enhanced interoperability and scalability to real-time applications. Its maximum transaction capacity is around 400,000 transactions each and every second at an insignificant price of 0.001 dollars. It adds protection when using hybrid PoS consensus with dual-level security and adds the ability to audit and execute smart contracts quickly.\nWeb3 Gaming Of Skill-Based Gaming Tapzi\nTapzi is an anti-cheat, instant-rewarding, decentralized Web3 gaming hub on the BNB Smart Chain. Tapzi tokens are staked by players in competitive mods such as chess and checkers. The platform also offers SDKs for third-party game developers to integrate staking and reward platforms.\nMeme-DeFi Hybrid of Pepe Dollar\nPepe Dollar is a meme-edged DeFi entertaining and utility application to Ethereum Layer 2. It is limited in supply, has an in-built burn mechanism, and includes DeFi utilities. Its scarcity model and extra on-chain functionality have increased demand.\nThe Ethereum Bull Market Meme Token of ETH Bull\nETH Bull promotes itself as the next bull coin in the form of a meme coin in Ethereum, with staking rewards, ETH airdrops, and a burn. The community-based tokenomics are focused on maximizing growth in Ethereum rallies. Nevertheless, its audit report is not final, which leaves doubts regarding its contract security.\nNeo Pepe, Community-Governed Meme Ecosystem\nNeo Pepe combines DeFi governance with the meme culture and provides a community-driven ecosystem. It will compensate for the commitments of long-term engagements with governance and incentive rights. It will rely on the active community to perpetuate the momentum after the elimination of staking rewards.\nFor more information about Ozak AI, visit the links below.\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "London, United States, August 13th, 2025, Chainwire\nOpenServ, the leading full‑stack AI infrastructure platform and protocol, today announced a partnership with LunarCrush, the leading web3 social analytics firm serving companies such as Coinbase, Kraken, HTX, and Binance. The collaboration integrates LunarCrush’s 24/7 tracking of 30–50 million social media posts per hour, along with live market data, directly into OpenServ’s generative UI platform for Telegram mini apps and agent workflows. Two products are live today: DeFi News aApp on Telegram and Dash.fun (open beta).\nDeFi News aApp creates short AI video briefings using LunarCrush insights—right inside Telegram—where anyone can try it at t.me/definews_aapp_bot. Users pick a topic, set a timeframe and data source, then receive a one- to three-minute video with animated overlays and on-screen stats. Templates include Bitcoin Daily Brief, Ethereum Weekly, Solana Ecosystem, and Hidden Altcoin Gems. Users can also run a custom analysis, choose an AI presenter, and schedule daily delivery. The app reads LunarCrush metrics such as social dominance, Galaxy Score, trending assets, and top influencers, then assembles a concise script and renders a finished video in‑chat for easy sharing.\nDash.fun launched in open beta on Thursday, August 7, 2025. It surfaces up‑to‑the‑minute information on any cryptocurrency based on social sentiment, recent highlights, company updates, price action, and more—without manual updates. Visit dash.fun to explore live dashboards powered by LunarCrush data.\n“The fastest way to make data useful is to put it where people already work,” said Tim Hafner, CEO and co‑founder of OpenServ. “Telegram is the home base for crypto communities. Together, LunarCrush and OpenServ give users a live social signal and a way to publish that insight as video in seconds. This is just the first of many agentic use cases on Telegram.”\n“Builders want context they can act on,” said Joe Vezzani, chief executive of LunarCrush. “In a world where large language models are trained, released, and end their intelligence at a point in time, LunarCrush fills the gap to allow real-time social context to anyone building LLMs and agents.”\nThe collaboration began after an early‑July discussion between Hafner and Vezzani about opening social data to AI agents and everyday users in chat. The partnership pairs LunarCrush analytics with OpenServ’s aApp Factory, Dash.fun dashboards, and agent tooling for Telegram. OpenServ agents use the same LunarCrush API that powers Dash.fun, shortening setup and improving reliability for teams that want to add social metrics to their own agents, tiles, and dashboards.\nTo help builders, OpenServ is publishing resources so teams can add LunarCrush data to custom workflows: a starter template for Telegram mini apps, an agent guide, and a Dash.fun example that maps social dominance to charts and triggers. A joint livestream will walk through the integration, show how the DeFi News aApp works, and answer questions from developers and community managers. Details will be posted on OpenServ’s Telegram Announcements channel and X account.\nAbout OpenServ\nOpenServ is the leading platform for building AI apps and products. Developers worldwide use OpenServ's generative UI to build and employ AI agents that interact with APIs, automate workflows, and operate across any framework. With native support for Telegram and a modular SDK, OpenServ moves agents from passive interfaces to active participants in decentralized ecosystems. From finance and governance to messaging and research, agents on OpenServ are designed to act, earn, and evolve for your business. Learn more at openserv.ai.\nAbout LunarCrush\nLunarCrush provides real‑time social insights for crypto, stocks, and culture by analyzing millions of posts across major networks for investors, creators, and institutions.\nAvailability\n- DeFi News aApp: live now at t.me/definews_aapp_bot\n- Dash.fun: live now at dash.fun\n- Builder templates & documentation: available from OpenServ, rolling out publicly in stages.\nContact\nHead of MarketingRyan Dennis\nOpenServ\n[email protected]\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon has pleaded guilty in a New York court to conspiracy and wire fraud charges linked to the $40 billion collapse of TerraUSD and Luna.\nDo Kwon Admits Fraud in U.S. Court\nDo Kwon, the co-founder of collapsed blockchain firm Terraform Labs, has pleaded guilty to U.S. fraud charges, marking a dramatic turn in the long-running legal fallout from the TerraUSD and Luna token collapse. The plea was entered before U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan on August 12.\nKwon, who was extradited from Montenegro earlier this year, admitted to charges of conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud. Under a plea agreement with the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s Office, prosecutors will not seek a sentence exceeding 12 years. Sentencing is scheduled for December 11.\nTerraUSD Collapse and Alleged Market Manipulation\nKwon co-created TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the U.S. dollar, alongside the Luna cryptocurrency. In May 2021, TerraUSD lost its peg, wiping out approximately $40 billion in market value.\nProsecutors allege that Kwon misled investors by claiming that the “Terra Protocol” algorithm would restore the stablecoin’s value. Instead, they say he secretly enlisted a high-frequency trading firm to purchase large volumes of TerraUSD, artificially propping up its price. This intervention drove further investor confidence and boosted Luna’s valuation to around $50 billion by early 2022, before its eventual collapse.\nMulti-Jurisdiction Legal Battle\nThe guilty plea follows a complex legal saga spanning multiple jurisdictions. After South Korea issued a warrant for his arrest in 2023, Kwon fled the country, eventually being detained in Montenegro for using falsified travel documents. He was later extradited to the United States to face a nine-count indictment, which included securities fraud, commodities fraud, and money laundering conspiracy.\nInitially pleading not guilty in January, Kwon reversed his position as part of a negotiated settlement. In addition to the criminal case, he faces significant civil penalties, including an $80 million fine and a ban on participating in cryptocurrency transactions, under a $4.55 billion settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRegulatory Message\nTodd Snyder, appointed to oversee Terraform Labs’ liquidation, described the plea as a critical step in reinforcing accountability within the digital asset industry. The case is among the most prominent prosecutions stemming from a cryptocurrency failure, underscoring heightened regulatory scrutiny of the sector.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "As the cryptocurrency market continues to grow, innovative projects like Ozak AI are emerging with the potential to make waves in the DeFi market. As Ozak AI is moved into Phase 4 of its presale and the $OZ token, investors will keep an eye out as these AI-powered blockchain protocols fight to reach their lofty goal of $1 per token by 2026 amid signs of Ethereum (ETH) finding some sort of bullish momentum this week as it has continued to inch closer to the $4,400 mark.\nBeing sold at an immensely low price of $0.005 per token early in Phase 4 of its presale, the $OZ token has already attracted the interests of traders and investors, with analysts estimating that the token is capable of a 200x increase in terms of price by the end of Phase 4 of the presale, when it will reach the price point of $1.00. There is also something to look forward to, as early-stage investors emerged with a better deal when the price was raised to $0.01 in the next stage.\nWhat Is Making Ozak AI Popular?\nOzak AI, unlike many other speculative tokens, has a real-world use case in the form of predictive analytics via the use of artificial intelligence working in tandem with blockchain technology to be able to offer real-time predictive analytics.\n$OZ allows investors to make quicker and better decisions since it can give them timely market intelligence regarding cryptocurrency, equity, and forex markets through superior AI-driven models. Such utility puts Ozak AI ahead of the pack and has caused a lot of hype about its future potential.\nAs the $OZ token presale progresses, the project has already raised over $1.80 million, with more than 121 million tokens sold. The platform's increasing adoption and the token's expected price increase signal strong market interest. If the momentum continues, Ozak AI is well-positioned to reach the projected $1 price target by the end of 2025, or even earlier.\nCommunity Engagement Drives Investor Confidence\nOzak AI is more than merely technology, it is community building. The project is also engaged in engaging leads into the crypto community, especially in live events involving the GM Vietnam event. These appearances have been used as a launching pad in the establishment of partnerships with the key players in the crypto world, further cementing the credibility of the project and gaining more investors.\nOzak AI is establishing trust and an online fan following through practical experience and the transparency of technical details.\nStrong Tokenomics Support Long-Term Growth\nOzak AI tokens have a tokenomic that drives stability and growth over the long term. During the Token Generation Event (TGE), 10% of the total amount of tokens will become unlocked, and the rest of them will be released linearly over a half-year term.\nThis mechanism prevents large-scale sell-offs that could disrupt the market and ensures steady price appreciation as demand for the $OZ token increases.\nA Strong Foundation for Growth\nThe Ozak AI system comprises AI-powered intelligence as well as cross-chain capability and community governance to offer the required adaptability and scalability of the system. The upside of it is that it utilizes machine learning and predictive analytics to identify arbitrage opportunities in numerous blockchain networks, which cannot be found anywhere.\nMoreover, the decentralized systematic approach and adherence to open-source governance enable the token holders to comment on the decisions of the company, such as protocol changes and the fee systems. This will establish a community-led type of growth, which will harmonize the interests of the investors, development partners, and users.\nWill Can Ozak AI Hit $1 Before Ethereum Hits 5,000?\nFollowing the recent bullish performance of Ethereum (ETH) and its proximity to the $4,400 mark, everyone is looking at the promising projects in the realm of crypto, such as Ozak AI with its advanced technological solutions and real application. The good tokenomics, its active community, and the variety of strategies in AI-driven market analytics make Ozak AI a clear favorite to reach its target price of $1 by the end of 2025, with a possibility of doing it earlier.\nTo those investors who would like to jump over the barriers and have some share of the early stages of the project, Ozak AI is likely to be a rewarding project, as the existing presale price of $0.005 serves as an exceptional chance to reap high profits. In the early stages of the project, price raising may bring tremendous payoffs to the early adopters, as Ozak AI breaches the price thresholds on its way to $1 and beyond.\nFor more information about Ozak AI, visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "A prominent Ethereum (ETH) analyst has named four cryptocurrencies they believe could mint the next wave of millionaires: Ondo (ONDO), SPX6900 (SPX), Pepe Dollar (PEPD), and Ethereum (ETH) itself. While ETH provides the blue-chip stability and DeFi dominance, the other three offer explosive potential — especially Pepe Dollar (PEPD), which has been called the Best Crypto Presale opportunity of 2025.\nBreaking Down the Picks\n-\nEthereum (ETH) is trading at $4,307, with bullish momentum that could push it toward $5,500 if current trends hold. Institutional inflows and ETF adoption continue to strengthen its long-term case.\n-\nOndo (ONDO) has surged 13% this week on a “Cup and Handle” breakout pattern, eyeing $1.48 as its next target. Strong technicals and adoption in tokenized assets are key drivers.\n-\nSPX6900 (SPX) remains a meme-coin legend with over 135,000% gains from its all-time low, while its spiritual successor Token6900 (T6900) has already raised over $1.83M in presale funding.\n-\nPepe Dollar (PEPD) blends meme culture with Layer-2 infrastructure, deflationary supply, and integrated gaming/NFT ecosystems, making it stand out from typical meme coins.\nJoin Pepe Dollar Presale:\nPepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/\nPepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity\nPEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar\nPEPD Presale Numbers Signal Strong Entry Point\nThe Best Crypto Presale tag for Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is backed by hard data:\n-\nStage 1 Price: $0.004688\n-\nLaunch Price: $0.03695\n-\n97% Sold\n-\nUSD Raised: $1,280,167 of $1,317,138\n-\nTokens Sold: 273,073,174 of 280,959,484\nWith less than 3% remaining in Stage 1, the analyst warns that buyers may miss the lowest possible entry price if they delay.\nHow To Buy Pepe Dollar (PEPD)\n-\nVisit the Official Website — Only buy through the official presale portal to avoid scams.\n-\nChoose Your Payment Method — ETH, USDT, BNB, or card payments are supported.\n-\nConnect Wallet — Use MetaMask or WalletConnect for smooth transactions.\n-\nConfirm and Receive — Tokens are stored securely until the post-presale claim period.\nWhy These Four Could Dominate 2025\nThe analyst’s thesis is that Ethereum (ETH) will provide the infrastructure backbone, Ondo (ONDO) will lead in tokenized assets, SPX6900 (SPX) will remain a culture driver, and Pepe Dollar (PEPD) will capture meme-driven retail mania — all while being part of the Best Crypto Presale strategies that seasoned investors are quietly executing.\nConclusion: A Diversified Path To Millions\nCombining large-cap strength with mid-cap growth plays and one high-conviction presale like Pepe Dollar (PEPD) gives investors a balanced approach to wealth creation in crypto. With markets heating up and presales filling faster than ever, these four picks could be the blueprint for millionaire portfolios in the next cycle.\nJoin Pepe Dollar Presale:\nPepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/\nPepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity\nPEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Cardano (ADA) is riding a wave of bullish sentiment that could carry it far beyond its previous all-time highs. One top crypto analyst now projects a $13 price target for 2026, fueled by institutional catalysts, network upgrades, and broader market momentum. But while ADA has a clear long-term trajectory, many investors are pairing their ADA holdings with early entries into Pepe Dollar (PEPD) — the Top Crypto ICO gaining whale-level attention.\nCardano’s Bullish Setup for the Next Cycle\nAfter a 6.3% weekly gain, Cardano (ADA) has climbed to third place in Grayscale’s performance rankings. The ongoing SEC review of the ADA ETF — with a 75% approval probability — is considered a major bullish driver. Approval could unlock a wave of institutional inflows, dramatically increasing ADA’s liquidity and trading volumes.\nThe launch of the Midnight protocol has further strengthened ADA’s position, bringing privacy-enhanced smart contract functionality that appeals to both developers and enterprise clients. Analysts believe these upgrades could be the catalyst for ADA to break its current $3.10 ATH and march toward double-digit prices in the coming cycle.\nJoin Pepe Dollar Presale:\nPepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/\nPepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity\nPEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar\nWhy ADA Investors Are Buying Into PEPD\nEven with ADA’s strong fundamentals, many of its long-term holders are hedging by entering early-stage, high-growth plays like Pepe Dollar (PEPD). This meme-driven yet utility-backed token is generating hype for its unique blend of cultural parody — mocking the U.S. Federal Reserve — and real Layer-2 blockchain capabilities.\nPEPD’s staking rewards, capped supply, and community-powered liquidity platform make it more than just another meme coin. For ADA investors, this represents a way to add explosive ROI potential to their otherwise steady ADA portfolio.\nPresale Timing and Strategic Accumulation\nPepe Dollar (PEPD)’s presale pricing tiers mean that the earliest buyers stand to make the highest percentage gains. ADA investors entering now can acquire tokens at a fraction of their expected listing price. With strong whale participation already confirmed, the presale is shaping up to be one of the most competitive of the year.\nMany Cardano (ADA) holders are funding their Pepe Dollar (PEPD) buys from staking rewards, avoiding the need to liquidate core ADA positions while still gaining exposure to a high-velocity asset.\nDual-Asset Strategy for the Bull Run\nThe combination of ADA and Pepe Dollar (PEPD) offers exposure to two complementary growth models. ADA’s path to $13 relies on macro adoption trends, regulatory green lights, and ecosystem expansion. PEPD, meanwhile, could deliver faster, more aggressive returns driven by social momentum and meme culture. Together, they form a balanced playbook for capitalizing on the next bull cycle.\nWhy $13 ADA and PEPD Could Define 2026 Portfolios\nIf ADA hits $13, it would mark one of the largest blue-chip gains in the cycle. For investors holding Pepe Dollar (PEPD) alongside, even a fraction of ADA’s market cap could translate into life-changing multiples. Analysts point out that these asymmetric bets often define bull market legends — those who not only held strong assets but also took calculated risks in the right presales.\nConclusion\nCardano’s climb toward $13 is backed by hard fundamentals, while Pepe Dollar (PEPD) offers the cultural and community power that can send a token parabolic. For Cardano (ADA) investors, combining the two is less about choosing between safety and risk — and more about owning both engines that could drive their portfolio deep into profit territory by 2026.\nJoin Pepe Dollar Presale:\nPepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/\nPepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity\nPEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Some digital coins still cost less than a dollar, yet they show signs of strong growth. These overlooked tokens are drawing attention from investors searching for high returns from small investments. Learn which five coins could climb sharply if they catch the right moment. Each one stands out for special reasons that set it apart from the rest.\n$XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI\nXYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game.\nWith the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project.\nWhat sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth.\nFueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto.\n$XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market\nThe $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price.\nLaunch Price: $0.0001\nPrice Now: $0.005\nNext Stage: $0.01\nFinal Presale Price: $0.02\nFollowing the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries.\nSo far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch.\nDemand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns.\nJoin $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions!\nStellar (XLM)\nSource: TradingView\nXLM has been climbing. The token is up 5.32% in the past week, 10.89% over the month, and 30.78% in six months. It now trades between 0.40 and 0.48, hugging the 10-day SMA at 0.44 and the 100-day SMA at 0.45. That narrow spread shows a tug-of-war that could snap soon.\nMomentum reads are calm. RSI is 44.94, Stochastic 46.21, and MACD is slightly negative at ‑0.0024. Buyers have cooled but remain present. Holding above support at 0.35 keeps the longer trend intact, while a slip to the deeper floor at 0.26 would erase much of the recent advance.\nA push above 0.48 targets the first barrier at 0.52. Clearing that could propel XLM to 0.60, a jump of roughly 25% to 35% from the mid-range. If bulls stall, the coin may slide to 0.40 and test 0.35, cutting about 15% to 20%.\nTerra Classic (LUNC)\nSource: TradingView\nLUNC has inched up 0.93% in the last 7 days, trimming only a bit of the grind that sent it down 2.19% over the past month and 25.83% in 6 months. The coin now trades between 0.00005793 and 0.00006576, a narrow band that keeps traders alert.\nThe 10-day moving line sits at 0.00006091 while the 100-day reads 0.00006225, so price is still under the long trend. Momentum gauges agree; RSI is 42.35 and stochastic is 32.15, both shy of oversold yet signaling the buyers are not in charge. The MACD line stays below zero, hinting at fading force.\nIf LUNC climbs past 0.00006902, the chart points to 0.00007686 next, a potential gain of roughly 18% from mid-range. Failure to clear that lid could send the coin back to the 0.00005334 floor, about 12% lower, and even 0.00004551, near 28% down. With volume thin, the next sessions decide whether the drift turns into an uptick or another slide.\nSiren (SIREN)\nSource: TradingView\nSiren woke up this week. The token jumped 75% in 7 days and has doubled in a month. Over 6 months it still sits 37% higher, so the bigger picture is green too. The current band runs from 0.0628 to 0.1566, showing traders have been willing to chase quick swings but have not cracked the next ceiling.\nThe 10-day and 100-day averages almost overlap at 0.0971 and 0.0990, hinting that a fresh trend is near. Strength and swing gauges sit at 39 and 20, both close to oversold territory. That leaves room for a rebound. If buyers take charge, the first test stands at 0.1965, roughly 25% above the recent top and more than 200% above the range low. A break there could unlock 0.2903, an extra 80% jump from the first barrier.\nFailure to hold the band, though, drags focus to 0.00898. That floor sits about 85% below the range low and would wipe out all recent wins. Momentum favors a push higher while the oversold readings last, yet the token must clear 0.1965 soon to keep the rally alive.\nZora (ZORA)\nSource: TradingView\nZORA stunned traders. The token jumped 71% in 7 days, 1325% in a month, and 11881% over 6 months. Price climbed from sub-penny to the current 0.07-0.13 zone, thrusting the coin into wider view.\nThe range hugs the 10-day mean at 0.12, above the 100-day read of 0.10, hinting at near strength. Yet RSI at 45 is flat, stochastic at 13 is oversold, and MACD is just below zero, showing weak push. Traders eye 0.15 resistance; above that sits 0.20.\nA break past 0.15 could lift price 15% fast, then 30% to 0.20. Holding over 0.20 would stretch the 6-month gain beyond 12000%. Failure could drag ZORA to 0.0394, a 45% slide from today’s mid-range. Low volume means either move may arrive quickly.\nConclusion\nXLM, LUNC, SIREN, and ZORA all show strong potential. However, XYZVerse is unique, blending sports and meme hype, offering a promising roadmap, and aiming for standout growth in this bull run.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "KuCoin, a global cryptocurrency exchange, has announced a collaboration with digital financial infrastructure provider AlloyX to explore the integration of Real-World Asset (RWA) tokens into its credit line collateral mechanisms. The initiative will begin with the inclusion of the RYT token—backed by a licensed traditional asset management company—into KuCoin’s Off-Exchange Settlement (OES) system. The integration will be phased in and adjusted based on market feedback.\nThe partnership introduces tokenized units from the \"ChinaAMC USD Digital Money Market Fund,\" issued by China Asset Management (Hong Kong) Limited, into KuCoin’s credit system. The effort marks an early attempt to bridge Web2 and Web3 assets by incorporating traditional fund-backed tokens into an exchange credit model.\nIntroducing Collateral Use for Regulated RWA Tokens\nChina Asset Management (Hong Kong) Limited, a subsidiary of China Asset Management Co., Ltd., is among the first Chinese asset managers to operate overseas. The company issues the underlying assets for RYT, a tokenized representation of the \"ChinaAMC USD Digital Money Market Fund.\" This fund is one of Asia’s first tokenized USD funds aimed at retail investors, with fund units that can be subscribed to and redeemed on-chain.\nUnder the new mechanism, KuCoin users holding RYT will be able to apply for credit lines using the token as collateral. This approach combines secure collateralization with yield-generating assets, enabling users to treat RWA tokens similarly to other on-chain assets. In doing so, the exchange aims to diversify asset allocation and unlock leverage utility within compliant parameters.\nThe RYT token’s asset structure has undergone compliance design, with Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong serving as custodian, administrator, and registrar—reflecting a traditional financial framework adapted to on-chain environments.\nStatements from Leadership\nKuCoin CEO BC Wong stated: “KuCoin has always been committed to bridging traditional finance and the crypto world through innovation. This collaboration with AlloyX to explore RWA tokens as collateral mechanisms exemplifies our dedication to providing users with secure and compliant solutions. We emphasize trustworthiness and risk control—this partnership not only elevates the platform's innovation level but also delivers reliable asset appreciation opportunities to global users, helping them manage digital assets more confidently in dynamic markets.”\nAlloyX Co-Founder and CEO Thomas Zhu remarked: “Our focus has always been on how RWA, as an asset form, can deliver more authentic and sustainable economic functions on-chain. This cooperation with KuCoin is a pragmatic attempt centered on 'collateral mechanisms and scenario building,' not only offering users more possibilities for asset utilization but also providing the industry with opportunities for structural validation.”\nShaping RWA Adoption Through Exchange Infrastructure\nThe partnership reflects a broader industry trend toward recognizing the utility of tokenized traditional assets. By integrating a fund-backed token into an exchange’s credit system, KuCoin and AlloyX are laying the groundwork for future structural models, potentially influencing standards for asset issuers, platforms, and regulators.\nAs institutional interest in RWA continues to grow, KuCoin has signaled that it will pursue additional collaborations to advance the application and liquidity of RWA assets on-chain.\n.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Besides Bitcoin, Ethereum has been the major driving force in crypto over the last three months or so. However, Solana (SOL) has just woken up and looks as though it might start outperforming $ETH. Is $SOL about to embark on its own bull run?\n$SOL breaks out but faces $200 major resistance\nSource: TradingView\nAlready up more than 5% on Wednesday so far, the $SOL price has broken out of a big downtrend. Initially, $SOL broke up through a descending trendline that stretched from January. A retrace then occurred, and now $SOL has broken out again. There is a major resistance at $200, so if this can be broken the resistance at $252 could be next.\n$SOL explosive move awaits\nSource: TradingView\nZooming out into the 2-week time frame it can be seen that things are looking extremely bullish for $SOL. As already mentioned, in the price action it can be noted that a break of the current resistance would probably lead to an ascent to the last major resistance at $252.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) tells the big story. The indicator line is poking through a descending trendline that goes all the way back to March 2024. If this is indeed broken, the price action for $SOL could be explosive to the upside.\nSOL/ETH about to turn back in favour of $SOL?\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily chart for SOL/ETH has looked quite ugly for $SOL over recent months. It can be seen that SOL/ETH broke down out of a long-time ascending channel and entered a descending wedge pattern. It might be that finally $SOL could be about to turn the downtrend around.\nSOL/ETH sees perfect bounce from 0.618 Fibonacci level\nSource: TradingView\nThe weekly chart puts things very much into perspective. If $SOL is going to turn things around against $ETH it really looks like it will begin here. The Fibonacci retracement levels have the price bouncing perfectly from the 0.618, which also happens to be the bottom trendline of the falling wedge. Also, if one looks at the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart, it can be seen that the indicator lines are at the bottom and ripe and ready to start their ascent.\nThe Solana network is faster, cheaper, has more network activity, and more users than Ethereum, and this is by many multiples. At less than ⅕ the market cap of Ethereum, this is not a state of affairs that is likely to continue. $SOL should be by far the fastest horse in this race.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Pepe Dollar (PEPD) has emerged as one of 2025’s fastest-growing crypto presales, capturing attention from retail traders and institutional players alike. Built as a meme coin with a serious twist, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) blends cultural satire with Layer-2 scaling and deflationary tokenomics, creating a dual appeal for both speculative and utility-driven investors. Early backers are targeting triple-digit percentage gains by exchange listing, with whale wallets already deploying significant capital. Among those joining in is a prominent Litecoin (LTC) whale, whose $50,000 strategy has sparked debate about whether blending a legacy altcoin with a high-growth presale could produce millionaire-level returns.\nInside the Whale’s $50,000 Diversification Play\nThe whale’s approach is calculated: split the $50,000 evenly, placing $25,000 into Litecoin (LTC) for stability and $25,000 into Pepe Dollar (PEPD) for asymmetric upside. The idea is to ride Litecoin (LTC)’s anticipated rally to $170 while leveraging Pepe Dollar (PEPD)’s explosive presale growth. The combination targets a portfolio blend where one asset provides long-term resilience, and the other delivers aggressive short-term appreciation. This is a risk-managed method that still allows participation in the Best Crypto Presale buzz of 2025.\nLitecoin (LTC) Breaks Technical Barriers\nLitecoin (LTC) recently broke above an ascending channel pattern, a move often seen as the start of an accelerated uptrend. With prices above $133 and Open Interest hitting a record $1.27 billion, bullish momentum is hard to ignore. The hashrate’s steady climb adds further confidence, enhancing network security. Analysts suggest a rally toward $170 could play out, offering a solid return for those positioning early.\nWhy Pepe Dollar (PEPD) Holds the X-FactorWhile Litecoin (LTC) offers a proven network and stability, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) offers scarcity-driven hype and early-stage growth potential. Token burn mechanics, community-led marketing, and Layer-2 gaming integrations are expected to push trading volume aggressively post-launch. This is why whales are calling it the Best Crypto Presale to combine with blue-chip altcoin holdings.\nMarket Sentiment and Whale InfluenceWhale wallets have historically been market movers, and seeing one allocated into both Litecoin (LTC) and Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is a strong sentiment signal. It’s also a reminder that major profits often come from diversified strategies rather than single-token bets. As liquidity flows into the PEPD presale and Litecoin (LTC) maintains upward pressure, this dual-position play could outperform the broader market.\nConclusion\nThe $50,000 split between Litecoin (LTC) and Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is a textbook example of balancing security with speculative upside. If Litecoin (LTC) reaches $170 and Pepe Dollar (PEPD) delivers the explosive gains many expect from the Best Crypto Presale of 2025, this whale’s strategy could indeed mint new millionaires.\nJoin Pepe Dollar Presale:\nPepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/\nPepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity\nPEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

However, there may be some housekeeping to do first, in the form of a quick dip down to close the recent CME gap that stretches from $119,000 down to just over $117,000.\nIf the $BTC price did take this particular route, the potential dip would likely coincide with a retest of the top trendline of the bull flag, so probably no harm done.\nCME gaps aren’t always filled, but most of the time they are. It just remains to be seen in this particular instance whether the market will want to take off to the upside, or whether it can be held for a last little dip.\n$BTC is currently respecting an ascending trendline (faint dotted line), so if the price falls through this line, it could be a sign that a retrace to $117,000 might be about to take place. On the other hand, if the price lifts off from this trendline, and given the strong bullish fervour in the market, it just might not come back.\nHorizontal support can favour the gap fill\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily chart illustrates that things are relatively serene for $BTC. That said, the Stochastic RSI indicators are perhaps shaping to turn back down. They have not quite reached the top so this remains to be seen. The blue 50-day SMA is travelling up, and it could act as support again if there was more than a slight dip in price.\nAlso on the subject of support, it can be seen that the lower part of the horizontal support band would not be far from the bottom of the CME gap. Could these particular stars be aligning?\nA very bullish 2-week chart\nSource: TradingView\nZooming a lot further out, the 2-week chart continues to look bullish for the $BTC price. In the price action it can be observed that should this two-week period close more or less as is, the current candle will envelop the previous one. If one looks back to the previous bull flag, a similar enveloping candle was what took the price up to the next bull flag.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index reveals that the indicator line is right up against the descending trendline. A breakthrough here would likely result in a strong surge to the upside. Watch this closely.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "The cryptocurrency market has rebounded to reclaim the $4 trillion mark after Tuesday’s decline as Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies traded in positive territory. However, the flagship cryptocurrency is only marginally up, as altcoins led the market recovery. BTC dropped to an intraday low of $118,305 on Tuesday before rebounding to cross the $120,000 mark. However, it lost momentum and fell to its current levels. BTC is marginally up over the past 24 hours, trading around $119,415.\nMeanwhile, altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are leading the market recovery. ETH has raced past $4,500 and is trading above $4,600, up over 7% in the past 24 hours. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency could surge to a new all-time high if buyers maintain momentum. On the other hand, SOL is up nearly 12% and is on the brink of reclaiming $200. Ripple (XRP) has also regained momentum, up 2.25%. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up over 6%, while Cardano (ADA) is up nearly 9%, trading around $0.857. Chainlink (LINK) is up almost 10%, while Stellar (XLM) is up 1.70%, trading around $0.444. Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial increases.\nDo Kwon Pleads Guilty To Fraud Charges\nTerraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon has pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud. According to reports, Kwon waived his right to go to trial on two of the nine charges brought against him by the US government. The plea agreement with prosecutors also imposes $19 million in financial penalties. The charges against Kwon could carry a prison sentence of up to 25 years if served consecutively. However, the agreement could see prosecutors recommend not more than 12 years.\nDo Kwon was indicted in March 2023, with charges including securities fraud, market manipulation, money laundering, and wire fraud. Do Kwon initially pleaded not guilty to all charges after appearing in court following his extradition from Montenegro.\nSEC To Focus On Crypto Regulatory Framework Following Ripple Case Dismissal\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to focus on developing clear crypto regulations after dropping its case against Ripple. According to SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce, the SEC’s decision to dismiss legal action against Ripple is a \"welcome development.”\n“Last week, the SEC’s case against Ripple was finally laid to rest,” Peirce wrote. “A welcome development for many reasons, including that minds once occupied with litigation now can concentrate on creating a clear regulatory framework for crypto.”\nSEC Chair Paul Atkins supported Pierce, advocating for the creation of crypto-specific policies. Atkins stated in a post on X,\n“Commissioner Peirce is right. With this chapter closed, we now have an opportunity to shift our energy from the courtroom to the policy drafting table. Our focus should be on building a clear regulatory framework that fosters innovation while protecting investors.”\nThe SEC dropped its case against Ripple on August 7. The market regulator had alleged that Ripple violated several federal securities laws.\nUS Bank Group Urges Congress To Close Genius Act Yield Loophole\nSeveral US banking groups led by the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) urged Congress to close a loophole in the GENIUS Act. The banking groups claim the loophole allows stablecoin issuers to pay yield on stablecoins through affiliates. Stablecoin laws under the GENIUS Act prohibit stablecoin issuers from offering yields. However, they do not ban cryptocurrency exchanges or affiliated businesses. This allows issuers to potentially sidestep the law by offering yield through their partners. According to the BPI, failure to close the loophole could disrupt the flow of credit to US businesses, and potentially trigger over $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows from the traditional banking system.\nBanking groups are concerned that yield-bearing stablecoins could undermine the ability of banks to attract deposits with high-interest savings products. BPI stated in the signed letter to Congress,\n“These distinctions are why payment stablecoins should not pay interest the way highly regulated and supervised banks do on deposits or offer yield as money market funds do.”\nBPI added that such a shift in the financial system could pose a risk to the country’s credit system.\n“The result will be greater deposit flight risk, especially in times of stress, which will undermine credit creation throughout the economy. The corresponding reduction in credit supply means higher interest rates, fewer loans, and increased costs for Main Street businesses and households.”\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\nBitcoin (BTC)’s rally stalled after crossing the $120,000 mark on Tuesday. The flagship cryptocurrency raced to an intraday high of $122,319 on Monday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level, slipping below $120,000 to settle at $118,701. It recovered on Tuesday, rising over 1% to reclaim $120,000 and settle at $120,113. However, BTC is back in bearish territory during the ongoing session, with the price marginally down at $119,980.\nDespite downward pressure, BTC held the $118,000 level. However, it still faces strong selling pressure above $120,000. The flagship cryptocurrency’s failure to hit a new all-time high led to a sharp pullback across the market. However, while BTC made a marginal recovery, altcoins led the recovery, rebounding and crossing key resistance levels. Some analysts have struck a cautious tone after Monday’s drop from $122,000, with ZAYK Charts stating that the Wyckoff method indicates BTC may have entered a distribution phase. A confirmation of the distribution phase could drag BTC to $100,000 or lower.\n“After a strong Accumulation Phase in March, April confirmed by bullish RSI divergence, BTC entered a powerful Mark-Up phase, reaching new highs. Currently, price action is showing signs of a Distribution Phase — sideways movement with weakening momentum, supported by bearish RSI divergence. If distribution confirms, the next phase could be a markdown, with a potential drop toward the 95K zone.”\nHowever, others believe BTC could continue its rally after the release of the July US Consumer Price Index (CPI), which showed inflation was unchanged at 2.7%, and below the 2.8% forecast. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 3.1% annually, in line with expectations. Overall CPI increased 0.2%, down from 0.3% in June, while core CPI rose 0.3%, compared to June’s 0.2% increase.\nCPI data reinforces a bullish backdrop for BTC as inflation cools, strengthening the case for monetary easing.\nBTC registered a sharp decline on Friday (August 1), dropping over 2% and settling at $113,365. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 0.67% and settled at $112,601. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Sunday, rising 1.52% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,215. The price continued pushing higher on Monday, registering a 0.69% increase and settling at $115,051. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $112,707 on Tuesday as selling pressure returned. It rebounded from this level to reclaim $114,000 and settled at $114,051, ultimately dropping 0.83%. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.80% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,028.\nSource: TradingView\nBullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $117,000 and settle at $117,515. Despite the positive sentiment, the price was back in the red on Friday, falling nearly 1% to $116,683. BTC registered a marginal decline on Saturday but recovered on Sunday, rising 2.42% to reclaim $119,000 and settle at $119,309. The price surged to an intraday high of $122,319 on Monday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $118,701, ultimately dropping 0.51%. Buyers returned to the market on Tuesday as BTC recovered, rising 1.19% to reclaim $120,000 and settle at $120,113. The current session sees the price marginally down, trading around $120,059.\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\nEthereum’s (ETH) rally has resumed after Monday’s wobble, as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency raced past $4,600. ETH registered a marginal drop on Monday as buyers failed to cross $4,400. However, bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rallied, rising almost 9% to cross $4,500 and settle at $4,590. The current session sees ETH up over 2%, trading above $4,700.\nAnalysts believe ETH could continue rising, potentially reaching a new all-time high if buyers maintain momentum. One trader predicted it could cross $8,000 if BTC hits $150,000.\n“In major bull runs, ETH typically hits 30-35% of Bitcoin's [market cap].”\nThe analyst predicted that if BTC crosses $150,000, a 25% increase from current levels, ETH could reach $8,656. Several analysts and crypto firms expect BTC to reach $150,000 by the end of the year. Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, and Unchained market research director Joe Barnett have predicted a move to $150,000 for BTC. Regarding ETH, analysts believe it could reach a new all-time high, driven by surging institutional and ETF demand.\nETH started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 6% and settling at $3,488. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 3%, slipping below $3,400 to $3,393. ETH recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to reclaim $3,500.

ETH rallied on Tuesday, surging nearly 8% to cross $4,500 and settle at $4,590. The current session sees the price up over 2%, trading around $4,700. Analysts believe ETH could surge to a new all-time high and potentially test the $5,000 level.\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\nSolana (SOL) has crossed the $200 mark for the first time in almost a month, as bullish sentiment intensifies. SOL started the week with a sharp drop, falling over 4% to $174. However, it made a strong recovery on Tuesday, surging nearly 10% to cross $190 and settle at $191. SOL has crossed $200 during the ongoing session, up almost 5%.\nSOL’s rally can be attributed to several bullish developments over the past week. Public companies have upped their SOL purchases to access the blockchain’s staking rewards.

        "text": "The Shiba Inu price is green, just like the Dogecoin price, which is in an uptrend. Alongside memes, AI has emerged as another high-potential narrative, with Unilabs Finance (UNIL) leading the line. Combining artificial intelligence and DeFi, UNIL’s integration with traditional finance puts it on the list of the best coins to invest in this month and year.\nThe Shiba Inu Price Nears Breakout\nFollowing a 5% rally on the weekly chart, the Shiba Inu price is nearing a breakout. As of press time, the bulls are holding the $0.000013 level, aiming to regain the monthly high of $0.000015.\nMoreover, momentum has been increasing, as shown by the 40% surge in daily trading volume to $295 million. If the current trajectory is maintained, a breakout above $0.000015 in the SHIB price could play out in the coming days, supported by the bullish technical indicator, MACD.\nMeanwhile, Johncy is optimistic that the SHIB price will surpass $0.000020 and $0.000025 if we see a sustained bounce. Hence, at the current price, the dog-themed cryptocurrency is among the best coins to invest in.\nFurther Upswing for the Dogecoin Price?\nWith memes back in the spotlight, the Dogecoin price recorded almost a 10% gain on the 7-day chart. Currently trading above $0.22, the top meme could rocket past $0.28, its 30-day high, during its next leg up. With daily trading volume increasing by 25% over the past 24 hours to $2.8 billion, bulls are anticipating a significant rally.\nAt the same time, technical indicators signal further uptrends in the Dogecoin price. According to the MACD and Bull Bear Power, as well as the 20-VWMA, the dog-themed cryptocurrency is in an oversold zone, suggesting a big leap.\nMeanwhile, Marcus targets $0.43, supposing the bulls \"stay hungry.\" With a breakout above its 2021 all-time high (ATH) of $0.73 on the cards, the current Dogecoin price represents a good entry.\nUnilabs Finance (UNIL) — 2025’ Wild Card\nGiven its unique and innovative blend of AI, DeFi and TradFi, Unilabs Finance (UNIL) might be this year’s wild card. Its novelty has yet to be priced in and is on track to reach escape velocity once it officially launches. Before then, investors stand to gain a 415% profit at the listing price of $0.05—a more promising alternative than most top altcoins.\nIn the sixth ICO stage, the UNIL token is significantly undervalued at $0.0097, placing it among the best coins to invest in this month and year. Further contributing to its bullish outlook and upside potential is its unique value proposition as the world’s first AI-backed DeFi asset manager.\nCompared to traditional asset managers and DeFi protocols, the UNIL platform will be driven by artificial intelligence. There will be an AI launchpad at its heart, drawing comparison to Raydium, a leading DEX with a $1.5 billion market size. However, it could outperform, considering users are eligible for periodic airdrops from launched tokens and redistribution of 30% of generated fees.\nClosing Thoughts\nAs memecoins and AI return to the spotlight, the Dogecoin price and Shiba Inu price are poised to skyrocket, while UNIL is also among the best coins to invest in. Surpassing $12.7 million in funding, smart investors are betting big on this new AI token, which experts consider this year’s wild crypto card.\nFor more information about Unilabs Finance (UNIL) visit the links below:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "The Binance Coin price is making news in the market, with experts predicting it could reach $1,200. However, the spotlight is shifting as a new DeFi coin rises, stealing attention from Ripple.\nWith its innovative AI features, Unilabs has gained fast traction. It has raised over $12.7 million and sold 1.8 billion coins, positioning itself as a major player in the DeFi market. In the meantime, the Ripple price still trades around $3.\nBinance Coin (BNB) Price Faces Selling Pressure\nAccording to CoinMarketCap data, the Binance Coin price is consolidating around the $800 mark after facing selling pressure at $822. The pullback comes amid a whale purchase.\nPer reports, BNC bought 200,000 BNB for $160 million and plans to keep buying until it hits $1.25 billion worth of the DeFi coin. BNC is the daughter firm of CEA Industries and is now the largest public holder of BNB.\nThis massive whale accumulation and corporate institution interest positively drive the Binance Coin price. MANDO CT predicts that the price of Binance Coin can surge to $1,000. According to them, the DeFi coin is “moving beautifully” and could rise to the given target soon.\nIn an earlier post, Ali Martinez noted that the Binance Coin price is currently mirroring Bitcoin’s price structure, suggesting it could be in the early stages of a major bull rally. According to him, if this pattern continues to play out, the DeFi crypto price could surge toward the $1,200 mark, reinforcing bullish sentiment around the Binance Coin price in the coming months.\nRipple (XRP) Predicted To Touch $3.60\nThe Ripple price is about to test the $3.10 support after days of failing to cross the resistance around the $3.30 region. Data from CoinMarketCap indicates that the Ripple price has been trading between $3.10 and $3.40 since August 7.\nIf bulls cannot defend the lower support, the Ripple price might drop below the $3.00 mark. Meanwhile, Ali Martinez says the Ripple price has a major resistance at $3.27. He observed that a breakout would cause a new bullish momentum, which could see the Ripple price reach $3.60 in the near future.\nIn another tweet, The Cryptomist expressed strong optimism, saying the Ripple price is unlikely to drop below $2 again. She told her followers to see any dip as a buying opportunity.\nThe Cryptomist added that her target for the Ripple price this bull market is around $8. Given the end of the Ripple-SEC case, the XRP ETF could hit the market anytime from now. This launch would take the Ripple price to a new high by the end of this year.\nUnilabs (UNIL): The AI-Powered Portal to Intelligent Crypto Investing\nUnilabs (UNIL) is a blockchain-based investment platform that merges AI with high-yield crypto strategies to give retail investors the tools normally reserved for hedge funds. Operating in the AI-powered asset management sector, which is expected to grow at 24.5% CAGR to $17 billion by 2030, Unilabs is positioned to tap into one of the fastest-growing sectors in blockchain and fintech.\nWith over 153k subscribers, YouTube analyst Crypto Show praised Unilabs for bringing Wall Street-grade tools to everyday users. One is the Early Access Scoring System (EASS), which identifies and secures allocations in early-stage projects before they hit mainstream exchanges.\nThe platform’s four flagship funds, DeFi Yield Pools, Bitcoin Funds, AI Assets, and Tokenized Real-World Assets, allow users to diversify their holdings. Unlike MakerDAO’s single-focus model, Unilabs’ multi-fund approach blends stability with growth, offering both predictable yield and speculative upside.\nThe UNIL token fuels all operations, granting access to exclusive funds, distributing 30% of platform fees back to holders, etc. With the price at $0.0097 in Stage 6, its trajectory suggests a possible climb toward $0.60 if it captures even 0.5% of the projected DeFi market cap.\nFinal Thoughts on the Best Crypto To Buy\nThe Binance Coin price could rally to a new peak of $1,200 soon. Meanwhile, the rise of the new DeFi cryptocurrency, Unilabs, presents an exciting opportunity for investors. As Ripple is having a hard time sustaining itself, this DeFi project has a high growth potential that can make it a market leader.\nFind out more about the Unilabs (UNIL) Presale Today:\nWebsite: https://unilabs.finance/\nTelegram: https://t.me/unilabsofficial\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/ika-core-contributor-dwallet-labs-reveals-refhe-first-fhe-scheme-that-works-like-a-real-cpu",
        "text": "Zug, Switzerland, August 13th, 2025, Chainwire\ndWallet Labs, a core contributor of Ika, and a leader in cryptography and decentralized security, today announced REFHE (Ring-Enhanced Fully Homomorphic Encryption), a new encryption scheme that brings encrypted computation closer than ever to how real processors work. REFHE uniquely supports both arithmetic and logical operations on encrypted 64-bit values, enabling software to switch seamlessly between math and logic—just like a modern CPU.\nWhy This Matters\nFully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows computation on encrypted data without revealing the underlying information—a capability long considered a “holy grail” of cryptography. But existing schemes typically force a trade-off: choose between efficient arithmetic or efficient logic. REFHE removes that barrier, creating a unified approach where real-world software—full of mixed arithmetic and logic—can run encrypted.\nBreaking a Decade of TFHE Dominance\nSince 2016, TFHE has been one of the most widely used FHE schemes, especially in the context of blockchain use cases, and is leveraged by companies such as Zama. For nearly a decade, no scheme had meaningfully surpassed its performance and latency—until now. REFHE delivers:\n- 100× smaller ciphertexts\n- 20× faster multiplications\n- 1,000× faster additions\nThese gains, alongside being optimized for both arithmetic and logical operations, make it the first FHE scheme capable of operating as a practical, CPU-like encrypted execution engine.\nImplications for 2PC-MPC and the Ika Network\nThe latest FHE-related research, including REFHE and Threshold FHE, can be integrated into the 2PC-MPC protocol powering the fastest MPC network - Ika, coordinated on Sui. With these breakthroughs, 2PC-MPC could directly execute its Zero-Trust signing with FHE, reducing communication rounds and boosting latency, throughput, and security.\nBuilding on Recent Threshold FHE Breakthroughs\nREFHE follows dWallet Labs’ recent Threshold FHE research, which enables scalable, efficient, secure multi-party decryption. Together, these advances form the basis for encrypted systems that are both high-performance and capable of real-world program logic.\n\"This is more than a speedup,\" said Omer Sadika, Co-Founder of Ika and CEO at dWallet Labs. \"It’s about finally aligning encrypted computation with the way real software and CPUs work. That opens up a new class of secure, privacy-preserving applications that were simply not practical before.\"\nAbout Ika\nIka is the fastest parallel MPC network, offering sub-second latency, unprecedented scale and decentralization, and zero-trust security.

        "text": "Dubai, UAE, August 13th, 2025, Chainwire\nPepeto, the Ethereum-based meme coin, is approaching the end of Stage 8 of its presale after raising $6,096,096.67 in total. With more than 100 billion tokens sold so far, the Pepeto team points to consistent demand from both meme coin enthusiasts and the broader crypto community as the driver behind its steady progress.\nBuilt on Ethereum and integrating a zero-fee exchange model, Pepeto aims to combine utility with meme culture. The project’s audited infrastructure, reviewed by SolidProof and Coinsult, and community-focused approach have contributed to its legitimacy and growing investor confidence. Stage 9 is the next step in the project’s timeline toward public launch.\nStage 8 Nears Sellout as Project Advances\nThe nearing completion of Stage 8 is more than a milestone, it reflects investor sentiment. The project reports that each stage has moved faster than expected, driven by increasing participation from new and returning contributors. At a current price of $0.000000146, Pepeto offers early entry with room for potential growth, matching the total supply of 420 trillion tokens, the same as PEPE.\nUnlike many meme coins built solely on viral marketing, Pepeto is anchored by a defined roadmap and tangible developments. Its upcoming platform aims to enhance accessibility, provide zero-fee trading, and bridge multiple blockchain networks, positioning it to scale effectively while appealing to a wide investor base.\nCommunity-Driven Growth and Strategic Foundations\nPepeto’s visibility is supported by both structured development and active community engagement.

In parallel, development milestones, including the launch of a demo version of its PepetoSwap exchange, have showcased its readiness for market entry.\nThe project’s emphasis on combining staking rewards of up to 247% APY with scalable infrastructure has been cited by the team as a differentiator in the meme coin space. This measured approach, combined with regular updates and verified audits, positions Pepeto as a project working toward sustained growth rather than short-lived hype.\nWhat Comes Next for $PEPETO\nAccording to the team, with Stage 9 about to begin, Pepeto is preparing for further growth ahead of its public listing. The team has announced that applications for legitimate Web3 project owners to list on its upcoming platform will open in Stage 2 of its post-launch rollout. Alongside this, the demo exchange display, already live, will transition into its full version, expanding the project’s ecosystem.\nFuture plans also include expanding marketing reach, integrating additional trading tools, and leveraging community incentives to maintain engagement before listing. The team believes that these developments, combined with the established audit-backed trust, will help Pepeto stand out as a credible contender in the meme coin market.\nDisclaimer:\nTo buy PEPETO, users must make sure to use the official website: https://pepeto.io. As the listing draws closer, some are attempting to capitalize on the hype by using the name to mislead investors with fake platforms. Stay cautious and verify the source.\nAbout Pepeto\nPepeto is an Ethereum-based meme coin in its presale stages, merging viral meme culture with real-world crypto utility. Built for investors looking for the next big crypto presale, the project offers zero-fee trading, a cross-chain bridge, and high-yield staking opportunities, all backed by two independent smart contract audits. Designed to compete with top Ethereum meme coins, Pepeto’s platform aims to deliver scalable performance and long-term value while attracting a global community of traders and holders.

        "text": "San Francisco, United States, August 13th, 2025, Chainwire\nCaldera today announced the launch of ERA Force One, a new community platform created to provide $ERA token holders with status and direct access to the team and fellow strategists. Inspired by the \"Air Force One\" moniker, the program establishes a tiered community structure where members earn ranks based on the official U.S. Air Force progression. A member's rank, which is determined by their total token and staked token balance, dictates their level of access and community standing.\nBuilding a Unified Community\nERA Force One represents a significant step forward in community building for Caldera's ecosystem. The platform introduces a ranking system where users progress from \"Airman Basic\" to \"General\" based on the sum of their ERA token holdings and staked positions. This merit-based structure ensures that the most committed community members receive appropriate recognition and access to premium benefits.\n\"Our community is the backbone of Caldera, and ERA Force One is our way of recognizing their conviction,\" said a spokesperson for Caldera. \"We're adopting the official Air Force ranks to create a structured and familiar path for advancement. We want our most dedicated holders, our 'Generals' and 'Colonels', helping us shape our strategic direction.\"\nExclusive Access and Future Rewards\nMembers of ERA Force One gain access to exclusive communities for networking and strategy. Top-tier members, such as those who achieve the ranks of General, Brigadier General, and Colonel, are granted entry into private Telegram groups for direct communication with the team and fellow strategists.\nThis platform serves as a direct channel between the project and its most committed stakeholders, ensuring community voices are central to future governance and development initiatives.\nBeyond immediate community access, ERA Force One members may be eligible for future initiatives and potential rewards. Specific details of upcoming programs remain under development.\nSeamless Registration Process\nCommunity members can register for ERA Force One through the dedicated platform at https://eraforce.one. The registration process automatically calculates users' combined token holdings and staked positions to assign appropriate ranks within the community hierarchy.\nSupporting Caldera's Growing Ecosystem\nThe launch of ERA Force One comes as Caldera continues to expand its influence in the blockchain infrastructure space after a successful launch of the $ERA token, which is listed on top-tier exchange venues such as Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, Upbit, Bitget, and Bithumb.\nThe community platform aligns with Caldera's broader mission of building sustainable, engaged ecosystems around its technology offerings. By creating structured incentives for token holders, ERA Force One strengthens the project's relationship with its community while establishing a framework for future governance and participation initiatives.\nAbout Caldera\nCaldera is a leading provider of rollup infrastructure solutions, making it easy for developers and organizations to deploy and manage high-performance blockchain rollups.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/the-smart-money-has-spoken-blockdag-presale-surge-makes-it-a-must-watch-in-top-crypto-coins-2025",
        "text": "Institutional investors have a way of signalling market potential long before retail sentiment catches up. That’s exactly what’s happening with BlockDAG, where the scale of committed capital is already drawing comparisons to early-stage funding rounds of projects that went on to achieve multi-billion-dollar market caps.\nNearly $371 million has been raised in the presale, a figure that has caught the attention of retail buyers looking to position alongside deep-pocketed backers. With each batch pushing the price higher, entry points are getting tighter. For those scanning the market for the top crypto coins 2025, BlockDAG’s funding momentum is a clear indicator to watch.\nInstitutional-Level Capital in a Presale Stage\nInstitutional investors rarely commit heavily to projects without seeing a compelling case for long-term viability. In BlockDAG’s case, the nearly $371 million raised during its presale reflects strong confidence in the project’s architecture, scalability, and growth potential. This level of early-stage capital is reminiscent of the kind of backing seen in now-established networks during their formative periods.\nThe presale has already sold over 25 billion coins, and the current batch price is $0.0276, representing a 2,660% ROI since batch 1. For retail participants, these numbers matter because institutional support often brings both credibility and visibility. This combination is why BlockDAG is increasingly being mentioned among the top crypto coins 2025 in market discussions.\nRetail Capital Following the Smart Money\nInstitutional backing doesn’t just inject large sums into a project, it also serves as a public signal that the risk-to-reward profile has been evaluated by professionals with extensive resources. Retail investors often follow these cues, interpreting institutional participation as a form of validation. This is now playing out in BlockDAG’s presale, where inflows from smaller buyers have accelerated in recent weeks.\nThe psychological effect is powerful: seeing large-scale capital already locked in makes the opportunity feel more time-sensitive. As the presale nears its funding target, the remaining supply at current prices shrinks, creating a stronger sense of urgency. For retail investors weighing their options in the top crypto coins 2025 category, the combination of institutional and grassroots interest makes BlockDAG a notable entry.\nPotential to Scale Into a Multi-Billion-Dollar Ecosystem\nThe historical pattern in crypto is clear: projects that attract significant early capital and sustain post-launch adoption tend to outperform over the long term. With its current trajectory, BlockDAG is positioned to follow a similar path. The funds raised provide not only market validation but also operational runway to support developer grants, ecosystem expansion, and marketing campaigns after Mainnet launch.\nThis capital strength means the network can invest heavily in user acquisition and partnerships without relying solely on post-listing token sales. For long-term investors, this creates a more stable growth environment, one that could push BlockDAG toward multi-billion-dollar status if adoption targets are met. Such positioning is a major reason it stands out as one of the top crypto coins 2025 with both immediate momentum and future potential.\nFinal Say\nRaising nearly $371 million during a presale is more than a milestone, it’s a statement of confidence from investors with the means to shape markets. For BlockDAG, this level of early backing mirrors the launch phases of networks that went on to become dominant players in the industry.\nWith over 25 billion coins sold, a 2,660% ROI since batch 1, and a current price of $0.0276, the case for early positioning is strong. Institutional-grade capital is already locked in, and retail participation is accelerating. For those identifying the top crypto coins 2025 with both funding momentum and adoption potential, BlockDAG demands a close look.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Ethereum remains a leader when it comes to creating new blockchain-based projects, and hundreds of thousands of tokens and decentralized applications are running on its platform. The most hyped about in terms of opportunities will obviously be the Ozak AI, with the potential to skyrocket on the basis of a presale price of 0.005 dollars to an estimated 1 dollar rise. Such a growth target means having a 200x gain, which is in the spotlight along with known Ethereum-based altcoins, including Chainlink, Uniswap, Render and Injective.\nOzak AI: Artificial Intelligence-Blockchain Giant\nOzak AI is the combination of blockchain infrastructure and powerful trading tools, analysis, charting, and market alerts provided by artificial intelligence. The intended users of this utility are not only retail but also institutional ones, which need to work with information about dynamic markets and act accordingly. To reinvent the metaverse, EarthMeta AI is pursuing the concept of a digital replica of the whole Earth within its ecosystem.\nEarthMeta AI will enable its users to own, trade and grow virtual cities and landmarks as NFTs. Artificial intelligence will add smart ownership, dynamic governance and responsive environments to these assets, resulting in a more immersive virtual world than the usual virtual worlds. It is also enhanced by the power of augmented reality and blockchain technology, adding a more interactive and transparent framework.\nThe AI functionalities in the project will provide adjustments to the virtual layout of the cities, streamline governance regimes, and customize experiences on the basis of behavior and data tendencies. The strategy makes the metaverse an organic, dynamic platform. As an extension of the greater mission that Ozak AI has had, this endeavor would make it a leader in the AI and virtual asset space.\nOzak AI is now in a fourth-stage presale at a price of $0.005; it started in previous presale stages at $0.001 and according to the financial experts, the token might start with a price of a dollar, which would translate to high returns to the initial market members. It has a regulated emission and a Certik audit, which contributes to the stability of its development.\nChainlink (LINK) Oracle Network Leader\nChainlink is an essential part of the Ethereum ecosystem and an oracle that could interface smart contract data with the external world with its decentralized oracle services. Decentralized finance, games and the adoption of blockchain in enterprise operations cannot be realized without this functionality. Its relevance is also evidenced by the steady growth of the network over a very long period of time.\nLINK does not have the same 200x potential as Ozak AI, but it is a stable option that will not disappoint. It is a good addition to other higher-risk opportunities in a diversified portfolio whose track record it has demonstrated. Its market position becomes stronger as a result of further integration into new applications.\nThe Chainlink technology is still essential in securing and correcting data feeds in the blockchain platforms. With the expansion of adoption, one can hardly expect that it will lose its high utility and prevalence in the Ethereum environment.\nUniswap (UNI) DeFi Exchange Pioneer\nUniswap is one of the most significant decentralized exchanges that exists in Ethereum and allows exchanging tokens by using the automated market maker protocol. UNI token owners determine the decisions of the governance, like upgrades and treasury decisions. Its platform has been another important aspect in the growth of DeFi.\nIts growth rate has since subsided relative to its initial boom, but the adoption of DeFi again would help it to start climbing upwards. The function that the platform plays in terms of providing liquidity makes it relevant. UNI is one of the main Ethereum assets that traders would like to get exposure to in a stable way because of its DeFi activity. The fact that Uniswap is globally accessible and can support unlimited tokens makes it ideal to use in the long term.\nRender (RNDR) AI-Powered GPU Rendering\nRender offers a decentralized GPU network that is used to render AI 3D Graphics and metaverse applications. Its usefulness is across these industries that need large-scale rendering capabilities, such as the gaming and design industries. This puts it in the emerging market of AI and metaverse crossover.\nRNDR projections are considered to be between four and nine dollars in 2025. Although this is a minor expansion, the usefulness of the project creates resilience. It is demanded as a high-quality rendering service that revolves around the growing requirements of digital worlds in the future.\nAn infrastructure of Render provides stable involvement in the AI-fueled content generation industry. This long-term positioning assists perseverance in humor with more flip-flop high-upside tokens.\nInjective (INJ) DeFi Infrastructure Innovator\nThe service provided by Injective is decentralized trading in derivatives, order books and cross-chain DeFi. Its low charges and scalability have seen it grow to multiple blockchain systems. The platform maintains a high level of trading capabilities for diverse clients.\nAnalysts expect the stock of INJ to move between $14 and $56 by 2025. Such projections underscore a medium growth rate in relation to the hypothetical potential of Ozak AI. However, its infrastructure utility qualifies it to be a consistent element in Ethereum-powered portfolios.\nInjective is also at the forefront of innovation in DeFi, which makes it poised to be used long term. It is flexible, and this means that it is able to keep pace with the changing market needs.\nFor more information about Ozak AI, visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Metaplanet has boosted its Bitcoin reserves to 18,113 BTC with a $61.4 million purchase, reinforcing its aggressive treasury strategy and positioning itself among the world’s largest corporate holders.\nMetaplanet Adds 518 BTC in Latest Acquisition\nJapanese firm Metaplanet Inc. has deepened its commitment to Bitcoin with the latest purchase of 518 BTC valued at approximately $61.4 million. The acquisition was made at an average price of $118,519 per coin, lifting the Japanese firm’s total reserves to 18,113 BTC. At current market rates, the company’s Bitcoin holdings are worth roughly $1.85 billion, with an average acquisition cost of $101,911 per coin.\nAggressive Treasury Expansion\nThe latest purchase is part of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Treasury Operations, launched in late 2024, aimed at systematically building digital asset reserves. The company, originally a hotel operator, has since evolved into one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders in the world, currently ranking sixth behind U.S.-based miner Riot Platforms. Over the past year, Metaplanet has accelerated its buying pace, supported by both operational income and capital market activities.\nCapital Raising for Further Purchases\nEarlier this month, Metaplanet announced plans to raise ¥580 billion ($3.7 billion) through a large-scale stock offering to fund additional Bitcoin acquisitions. The approach mirrors the strategy pioneered by Michael Saylor’s company Strategy, which leveraged equity issuances to amass over 628,000 BTC. Like Strategy, Metaplanet has seen its share performance closely track Bitcoin’s price movements, underscoring the direct impact of its digital asset-focused model.\nMeasuring Shareholder Value Through Bitcoin Yield\nMetaplanet uses a metric called Bitcoin Yield to measure the growth of BTC per fully diluted share, effectively isolating the benefits of its treasury strategy from the effects of share dilution. The company reported a 468.1% year-to-date Bitcoin Yield for 2025. From April to June alone, yield growth reached 129.4%, with the current quarter standing at 26.5% as of August 12. These figures highlight the accretive effect of the firm’s accumulation strategy on shareholder value.\nFinancing and Liquidity Management\nIn July, Metaplanet redeemed ¥12.75 billion from a bond issuance, using proceeds from exercised stock acquisition rights. The move reflects its balanced approach to funding growth, expanding Bitcoin reserves without straining liquidity. Consistent investor participation in share exercises through July and early August has further reinforced its capital position.\nLong-Term Vision for Bitcoin\nMetaplanet’s rapid accumulation strategy reflects a conviction in Bitcoin as both a hedge against currency depreciation and a long-term store of value. By combining aggressive acquisition with disciplined financing, the company continues to position itself as a prominent institutional advocate for the asset. For investors, the strategy offers significant upside potential alongside the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "FG Nexus has acquired $200 million worth of Ethereum as part of a strategy to secure a 10% network stake, leveraging staking partnerships and institutional custody to drive long-term yield and position itself among the largest corporate ETH holders.\nFG Nexus Makes Aggressive ETH Entry\nFG Nexus, the digital assets arm of Fundamental Global Inc., has purchased 47,331 ETH worth approximately $200 million at an average price of $4,228.40 per token. The move marks the start of an ambitious strategy to secure 10% of Ethereum’s circulating supply, positioning the company among the largest corporate ETH holders globally.\nThe firm, which is based in Charlotte, North Carolina, began accumulating ETH on July 30, initiating its plan with a symbolic 6,400 ETH purchase to mark the 10-year anniversary of Ethereum’s genesis block. It has since expanded its holdings through multiple acquisitions, deploying all net proceeds from a recent $200 million private placement into ETH purchases.\nYield-Driven Strategy\nFG Nexus intends to leverage its growing ETH reserves through staking and restaking activities, aiming to generate recurring yields while maintaining long-term exposure to the asset. The company defines “ETH Yield” or ETH generated per share as a core value creation metric for shareholders.\nBeyond direct ETH accumulation, FG Nexus plans to serve as a gateway to Ethereum-powered financial products, including tokenized real-world assets and stablecoin-based yield opportunities. The approach reflects a broader corporate trend of integrating digital assets into treasury strategies.\nInstitutional Partnerships and Custody\nThe company’s ETH holdings are secured with Anchorage Digital, which also facilitates trading operations. Partnerships with Anchorage Digital and Galaxy are set to enhance custody, trading, and structured asset management capabilities, enabling scalable yield generation and reinforcing operational security.\nAnchorage Digital CEO Nathan McCauley called FG Nexus’ approach a “bold, long-term bet” on Ethereum’s role as the backbone of future finance.\nMarket Context and Outlook\nFG Nexus’ announcement comes amid a strong rally in ETH prices, which reached $4,310 on Monday, up 47% over the past month, as the cryptocurrency approaches its all-time high. The company’s rebranding from FGF to FGNX coincides with its pivot toward a digital asset-focused business model.\nEthereum continues to serve as the foundation for decentralized applications, tokenized assets, and blockchain-based finance. FG Nexus’ large-scale accumulation and yield-focused strategy could set a precedent in corporate crypto treasury management, though market observers note the inherent volatility of the sector will test the execution of its long-term plan.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Crypto markets reward speed, yield, and adaptability. XRP still holds a place in the hearts of long-term believers, but the clock is ticking for those who want immediate returns. As we enter the final hours of Stage 4 in Bitcoin Swift’s presale, the contrast between waiting years for XRP’s projected gains and earning high-yield rewards with BTC3 today has never been sharper.\nXRP outlook is steady but slow\nXRP’s growth predictions are methodical. Estimates show about $3 in 2026, $4 in 2030, $5 in 2035, and $7 in 2040. While these numbers can reward patient holders, they are measured in years, not hours. For traders seeking results now, that slow-burn trajectory feels like watching a glacier move in a bull market.\nBitcoin Swift, wealth creation without the wait\nBitcoin Swift’s Proof of Yield model adjusts rewards based on real-time network activity, community governance, and environmental efficiency. This means participants are paid for actively contributing to the ecosystem’s growth. Contracts run in a WASM environment with AI agents that adapt and optimize over time.\nPrivacy is guaranteed through decentralized identity with zk-SNARK technology, letting users prove compliance without exposing personal details. Security combines Proof of Work for block creation with Proof of Stake for governance checkpoints every 100 blocks. The result is a system built to reward engagement immediately. Learn more at Bitcoin Swift.\nAI efficiency and governance strength\nBTC3 rewards cleaner, smarter participation through AI oracles that track carbon impact and system performance. Governance is AI-assisted from proposal screening to quadratic voting based on verified reputations. A dedicated emergency council can block malicious actions, giving investors confidence that the rules won’t be hijacked by whales.\nBTC3E stablecoin for real-world utility\nBTC3’s USD-pegged stablecoin, BTC3E, lets users lock BTC3 in 150% collateral vaults to mint a stable asset for payments, DeFi, and cross-platform use, all without bridges. AI oracles keep the peg tight, and auto-liquidations protect the system’s solvency.\nSecurity, audits, and influencer attention\nBitcoin Swift’s credibility is reinforced by a Cyberscope Audit, a Solidproof Audit, and a Spywolf Audit, alongside full KYC verification. Buzz is growing on X, with in-depth coverage from:\n-\nBull Run Angel explaining BTC3’s market advantage.\n-\nToken Galaxy analyzed why BTC3’s architecture positions it ahead of most launches.\n-\nCrypto Show detailing how its combination of yield, governance, and scalability stands out.\nFinal hours of Stage 4, urgency meets opportunity\nThis isn’t just the last day, it’s the last few hours to lock in:\n-\nPrice: $4, targeting $15 at launch\n-\nStage 4 APY: 106% PoY rewards, paid instantly at stage end\n-\nOver 2100 participants and $580k+ raised\n-\nLiquidity already among the highest at this stage in the market\nInternal reports suggest active discussions with MEXC, KuCoin, and LBank for listings. That could mean rapid post-launch trading volume and wider visibility, a perfect setup for those entering before this stage closes.\nConclusion\nWhile XRP’s steady climb might reward patient holders in 10 to 15 years, Bitcoin Swift is delivering triple-digit APY and ecosystem benefits today. With only hours left in Stage 4, BTC3’s blend of high-yield rewards, institutional-grade governance, AI-driven efficiency, and real-world utility is making it the obvious choice for investors who value both immediate and long-term gains.\nFor more information on Bitcoin Swift:\nWebsite: https://bitcoinswift.com\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/top-3-meme-coins-to-buy-now-that-feel-like-catching-dogecoin-doge-under-00020-in-2020",
        "text": "When Dogecoin was trading at fractions of a cent, very few took it seriously. Most saw it as a joke—or at best, a fun distraction in a market still trying to find its identity. But that tiny coin eventually turned modest bets into massive windfalls, proving that the meme coin category has more depth than many realize. Now, a few tokens generate the same kind of quiet conviction Dogecoin had before its explosion. And they’re doing so with a stronger sense of purpose, better infrastructure, and clearer community traction.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Sub-$0.002 Token That’s Starting to Feel Familiar\nAt first glance, LILPEPE looks like another cheeky entrant in the meme coin space. But under the surface, it’s behaving more like a community-backed project that understands the rhythm of real market demand. In Stage 9 of its presale, the project raised over $16.2 million, selling nearly 11.1 billion tokens, and brushing close to full allocation before flipping into Stage 10 at $0.0019. It’s not just the funding that signals strength—it’s how it’s being raised: gradually, transparently, and with visible community support. Unlike some meme coins that rely only on trends, LILPEPE is tying its identity to structure. The latest milestone? LILPEPE has been CertiK audited, which is a huge credibility boost for a meme coin and a step most presales never take. Its tokenomics reflect that: fixed supply, early-stage pricing incentives, and confirmed centralized exchange listings on the horizon. With a total supply capped and tokens distributed over a structured vesting model, early buyers are incentivized to stay in the ecosystem, not dump at launch. LILPEPE’s cult-like following isn’t just built on frog memes—it’s backed by movement. Telegram groups are active, X threads are buzzing, and presale entries keep ticking upward even without paid promotion overload.\nBRETT: Base Chain’s First Meme Star With Real Staying Power\nIf LILPEPE is 2020 DOGE with a roadmap, BRETT is closer to what Dogecoin became in 2021—popular, well-positioned, and riding a wave larger than itself. Launched on Coinbase’s Base network, BRETT draws from the exact comic origins as PEPE but gives it a Base-native twist. Its real strength comes from being a network's first major meme coin, gaining serious traction. That alone has helped push its market cap to $1.4 billion—a stunning figure for a token with no built-in utility. What BRETT lacks in tech, it makes up for in timing and placement. It owns the meme niche on Base, and if the Base ecosystem continues to expand, BRETT could rise with it. Liquidity is strong across major Base DEXs like Aerodrome, and the community remains highly engaged across platforms.\nTOSHI: The Underdog Meme Coin That Might Surprise\nNamed after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s cat, TOSHI may sound like a joke, but it has become a serious contender within the Base community. While not as large as BRETT, it has the grassroots grit that often defines long-term meme coin winners. With a market cap fluctuating between $150 million and $200 million, TOSHI remains accessible while being visible enough to matter. It benefits from launching during Base’s growth phase, and its organic traction has helped it hold a strong user base without the need for heavy marketing. Its presence on primary Base-based tools and early liquidity across DEXs means there’s enough foundation for a big move if sentiment catches up. Should Base experience a breakout moment in 2025, TOSHI could easily piggyback off that growth. While it won’t move as fast or as far as LILPEPE or BRETT, its position makes it a potential mid-cap favourite for meme coin speculators.\nFinal Thoughts: Don’t Miss the Signals\nDogecoin was a punchline before it was a portfolio changer. History has shown that it’s not always about catching the trend—it’s about seeing the energy early. LILPEPE, BRETT, and TOSHI channel different parts of what made DOGE memorable. LILPEPE brings structure to early chaos. BRETT rides the strength of Base’s expanding ecosystem. TOSHI represents the underdog that could punch above its weight. Each carries different levels of risk and return. But all three are early enough that, in hindsight, they might look like catching DOGE under $0.002 all over again.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Joint Project by P2P Foundation and Commons Foundation Draws Industry Expert Attention\nSeoul, South Korea, August 12, 2025 – The meme coin project SatoshiMeme ($SATOSHI), jointly developed by P2P Foundation and Commons Foundation, announced that it successfully raised $580,000 USDT by completely selling out 8 billion tokens in its first presale. Building on this success, the second presale will begin on August 13, 2025, at 18:00 (UTC+9).\n1st Presale Sellout and Expert Evaluation\nThe first presale sold out completely within just 6 days, confirming high interest from the cryptocurrency community. The combination of P2P Foundation's participation—the only platform where Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto was active—and Commons Foundation's technical expertise from operating blockchain mainnets for 8 years has garnered significant attention from investors.\nOneSafe, a cryptocurrency-related fintech company, stated in a recent analysis report that \"$SATOSHI is changing the game in the meme coin world. Unlike most meme coins that are just for fun, this project is actually pursuing substantial change.\" OneSafe particularly analyzed that \"they are pursuing a return to Bitcoin's original vision—the vision that Satoshi Nakamoto had—focusing on utility rather than speculation in cryptocurrency.\" OneSafe also evaluated the participation of the two foundations, stating that \"their support is not simply for quick profits, but aims for community participation and education, which is not something you can easily see in the crypto world.\"\n2nd Presale Launch on August 13\nCommons Foundation Chairman Choi Yong-kwan stated, \"The rapid complete sellout of the first presale, which began without any promotional activities after the project launch, demonstrates that the market has recognized the project's differentiated value. The second presale will provide opportunities for more participants to join the project.\"\nThe second presale is the second phase of an 8-stage presale roadmap, offering discounted prices compared to future stages despite increased pricing from the first round. According to the project team, second presale participants can secure tokens at up to 40% discount compared to the final listing price.\nThe participation process remains the same as before: users send USDT to wallet addresses provided on the official website, install the dedicated MicroBitcoin wallet WONPAY app to generate wallet addresses, and then send transaction details (TXID) along with wallet addresses via email for automatic token distribution.\nMajor Exchange Launchpad Sales and Additional Reward Plans\nThe project team announced plans to accelerate multiple launchpad sales with major exchanges ranked within the top 20 on CoinMarketCap. $SATOSHI, based on the MicroBitcoin (MBC) mainnet, plans to expand global market accessibility through exchange listings after presale completion.\nMeanwhile, free airdrops of certain amounts will be conducted for all active users of SNS, websites, and all exchanges where MBC is listed, as well as for everyone who installs Wonpay for the first time. Additionally, through various challenges, video production contests, hackathons, and other activities, additional rewards will be provided to individuals or organizations contributing to the SatoshiMeme project according to the Commons economic model.\n2nd Presale Details\n-\nStart Time: August 13, 2025, 18:00 (UTC+9)\n-\nEnd Time: Until fundraising target is reached\n-\nHow to Participate: Check wallet addresses at https://satoshimemes.com\n-\nPayment Method: USDT (TRC-20, Solana, BSC networks supported)\n-\nTransaction Confirmation: Send TXID and receiving wallet address to [email protected]\n-\nMinimum Purchase: 1 million $SATOSHI\n-\nMaximum Purchase: 10 billion $SATOSHI\n-\nFundraising Target: 800,000 USDT\n-\nToken Distribution: Distributed within 12 hours after sale participation\nOfficial Channels\nRelated Organizations\nAbout Commons Foundation Commons Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering commons-based peer production and community-driven innovation. It was established to support projects that prioritize collective ownership, open knowledge sharing, and decentralized governance.\nKey Activities: The foundation identifies and nurtures commons-based projects, provides funding for community-driven initiatives, and facilitates knowledge sharing among global commons communities. Notable achievements include supporting multiple open-source blockchain projects and establishing partnerships with leading P2P organizations worldwide.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/250-in-this-meme-coin-could-explode-into-50000-before-shiba-inu-shib-rallies-to-00001",
        "text": "Shiba Inu might be one of the best-known meme coins in the cryptocurrency world, but its journey to $0.0001 is still far off. In the meantime, a new meme token generates significant returns from modest investments—Little Pepe ($LILPEPE). Analysts expect that an investment of $250 in Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) could soar to $50,000, vastly outpacing Shiba Inu's growth toward its next price milestone.\nSHIB’s Road to $0.0001: Long, Slow, and Crowded\nShiba Inu has plenty of loyal fans and serious brand power, but that massive token supply keeps prices neutral. Sure, Shibarium went live, and burns are happening, yet even with that, prices might only work to $0.0001 in a few months, or drag out into years. It all hinges on broad crypto markets, Shiba-related news, and how active the community stays. Reaching that target would require a multi-billion-dollar investment and a huge market cap, as it trades at $0.00001. Large-cap meme tokens have seen that level of growth in the past, but it would take a lot of time. If you’re after a fast return on investment, SHIB is likely not for you anymore.\nEnter Little Pepe ($LILPEPE): The Meme Coin Built Different\nWithin the upcoming wave of meme currency altcoin breakouts, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is emerging as a frontrunner. It's the epitome of fun, tech, and profits. With lightning-quick Layer-2 blockchain, no taxation, and aggressive meme brand marketing, this one is hard to miss. Now in stage 10 of its presale, the project has raised more than $16.4 million in the presale and is now trading for $0.0019, a significant increase from the launch-stage price of $0.001. Early adopters have also enjoyed excellent returns, and the surge in value shows no signs of slackening. With a $250 investment, one could receive more than 131,500 tokens of Little Pepe. A more realistic long-term target would be $0.38, achievable due to its Layer-2 roadmap and prospective exchange listings. If $0.38 is hit, your $250 investment would turn into $50,000. Such potential gains are almost Non-Existent in the meme coin universe, but the case of Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is different, as it doesn’t stick to the standard template. Unlike the typical derivatives of cryptocurrency, it possesses its own blockchain, an audited smart contract through Certik, and features that set it apart from the usual pump and dump coins.\nLayer-2 Infrastructure With Meme Appeal\nWhat sets Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) apart is its purpose-built Layer-2 blockchain, which is EVM-compatible and tailored for meme tokens. It has low gas fees and fast transaction finality. It even has a Meme Launchpad for community-initiated projects. Including its anti-sniper bot protection, you have one of the most equitable, sophisticated meme ecosystems available. These attributes make it appealing not just to degens but also to developers and investors who are uninterested in meme culture, coupled with genuine underlying technology. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is scheduled to launch on two major centralized exchanges, with speculation around a listing on the world's largest exchange. These listings are projected to boost liquidity and visibility tremendously, thus further accelerating price discovery. Across social media, the token is going viral. Crypto Twitter, Telegram, and meme influencers are all hopping onto the Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) train because of its humorous branding, solid tokenomics, and infrastructure—something that is rarely found in meme coins.

        "text": "BlackRock Inc. is steering clear of the first wave of proposed U.S. exchange-traded funds tracking XRP, opting to stick with Bitcoin and Ether despite mounting evidence of investor demand for the token.\nReportedly, the world’s largest asset manager has no plans “at this time” to file for a spot XRP ETF, quashing months of speculation it would join at least eight other issuers awaiting U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval. The decision follows the August 8 resolution of Ripple Labs Inc.’s long-running legal battle with the SEC — a case many believed was the last major hurdle for a regulated XRP product.\nCompetitors in Position\nBlackRock’s absence leaves the early lead to competitors such as Grayscale Investments, Franklin Templeton and Bitwise Asset Management. Industry veterans say first movers in crypto ETFs tend to capture the lion’s share of liquidity and advisory attention, advantages that can be hard to dislodge.\nIgnoring crypto assets besides BTC and ETH “makes zero sense”, said Nate Geraci, President of NovaDius Wealth Management.\nThere has been roughly $1 billion in inflows to newly launched futures-based XRP and Solana products this year as evidence of robust appetite for regulated exposure.\nManaging the Narrative in an ETF-Driven Market\nFor crypto projects the developments around major coins such as XRP can be as pivotal as price action. That’s where firms like Outset PR, founded by crypto PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, have carved out a niche. The agency blends daily market analytics with boutique-level campaign design, ensuring that messaging not only reaches the right media channels but also lands during moments of peak relevance.\nIn a cycle where ETF headlines can trigger billions in market cap shifts overnight, Outset PR’s approach — tailoring pitches to each platform’s audience, mapping campaign timing to market catalysts, and targeting high-discovery outlets — has proven effective for crypto companies seeking to amplify their story in sync with market momentum.\nThe firm’s data-led strategy has driven measurable results for clients such as Step App, Choise.ai, and ChangeNOW, often aligning visibility spikes with token price surges. For projects looking to capture investor mindshare ahead of major catalysts like ETF approvals, such coordinated PR efforts can mean the difference between being part of the headline or buried under it.\nXRP Price Reaction and Technical Picture\nXRP has extended its rally to a sixth consecutive month, trading between $2.93 and $3.41 after a 10.36% weekly gain. The token is up 19.26% over the past month and 35.10% in six months, with buyers defending each minor pullback.\nThe coin is holding above both its 10-day and 100-day moving averages at $3.24 and $3.23, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 57.48, suggesting stable momentum, while a Stochastic Oscillator reading near 87 reflects growing bullish enthusiasm. The MACD remains in positive territory.\nImmediate resistance is at $3.64, with a more significant barrier at $4.12. Support lies at $2.68 and $2.20. A break above $3.64 would open the way to $4.12 — a potential 25%–30% upside from mid-range levels. Holding above $3.00 keeps that scenario in play; a drop below $2.93 could see retracements toward $2.68 (–15%) or $2.20 (–30%). Trend bias stays upward while price remains above $2.68.\nThe Road Ahead\nWhether BlackRock’s “not now” becomes “not yet” will hinge on how quickly competitor products scale. A surge in assets could prompt the firm to reverse course, as it did when it entered the Bitcoin ETF race after rivals filed first.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "The cryptocurrency market lost momentum after surging past the $4 trillion mark and is now down over 2%. Market sentiment soured after Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies fell into the red. BTC failed to test its all-time high, losing momentum around the $122,000 mark.\nThe flagship cryptocurrency plunged as selling pressure returned, dropping below $120,000 to its current level. BTC is down nearly 3% in the past 24 hours, trading around $118,700.\nEthereum (ETH) also stalled after crossing $4,300 as profit-taking took hold. As a result, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency dropped to a low of $4,200 before moving to its current level of $4,292. Ripple (XRP) is down nearly 4%, while Solana (SOL) is down almost 6%, trading around $175. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down over 6%, while Cardano (ADA) is down 5.50%, trading around $0.777. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) are also trading in the red.\nFTX Users Update Lawsuit\nUsers of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX are preparing to update their lawsuit against Fenwick & West, a law firm contracted by the exchange. Users claim new information shows the firm was central to the FTX collapse. FTX customers filed an amended filing stating,\n“The criminal trial of FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and investigations in the exchange’s bankruptcy proceedings produced specific evidence supporting that Fenwick played a key and crucial role in the most important aspects of why and how the FTX fraud was accomplished. Simply put, the FTX Fraud was only possible because Fenwick provided ‘substantial assistance’ by creating and approving the structures that allowed numerous frauds.”\nThe customers accused the law firm of agreeing to create, manage, and represent conflicted companies, including FTX’s sister company, Alameda Research, and its subsidiary, North Dimension. They added that the companies had no safeguards in place to prevent billions of dollars that were stolen. The filing is part of a multi-district class-action lawsuit filed by FTX users following the exchange’s collapse in 2022. The filing added,\n“At SBF’s criminal trial, FTX Insider and co-founder Nishad Singh testified that he informed Fenwick of the misuse of customer funds, improper loans, and false representations, and that Fenwick advised on how to facilitate and hide these very acts.”\nDo Kwon May Enter A Change Of Plea\nTerraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon could enter a “change of plea” at a Tuesday conference scheduled by a federal judge overseeing the case against him. US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) judge Paul Engelmayer ordered all parties associated with the case to appear in court on Tuesday, suggesting that Do Kwon was preparing to change his plea. The Terraform co-founder had pleaded not guilty to nine felony counts following his extradition hearings in Montenegro. Judge Engenlayer stated,\n“[T]he defendant should be prepared to give a narrative allocution that incorporates all elements of the offense(s) to which the defendant is pleading guilty. In the interest of clarity and efficiency, the Court encourages counsel to assist the defendant in writing an allocution that can be read in open court during the plea proceeding.”\nAuthorities indicted Kwon in March 2023, charging him with securities fraud, market manipulation, money laundering, and wire fraud. Authorities alleged he was responsible for the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, wiping out $40 billion in investor wealth.\nAnalysts Worry US Could Nationalise Bitcoin (BTC) Holdings\nCorporate crypto treasuries have crossed $100 million in value, prompting concerns that the US could nationalise some of the holdings in a move harking back to the gold standard era. Bitcoin (BTC) treasury companies hold over 791,662 BTC worth around $95 billion, a staggering 3.98% of BTC’s circulating supply. Corporate treasuries could become a central point of vulnerability for BTC, and could see the asset follow a similar path to gold in 1971. One crypto analyst stated,\n“If the US dollar is structurally getting weak and China is coming in, it’s a fair point that the US might make an offer to all the treasury companies and centralize it, where it could be then put into a digital form, not create a new gold standard. You could then rug it like happened in 1971. And it’s all centralized around the digital Bitcoin. The whole history repeats again back to the beginning.”\nETH Holders Could Rotate Back To BTC\nBitcoin (BTC) pioneer Samson Mow believes Ethereum (ETH) investors will turn back to BTC once ETH prices get high enough. The pivot back to BTC could reverse a five-week jump in ETH prices. Mow explained his stance in a post on X, stating,\n“Let me explain what’s happening with ETHBTC. Most ETH holders have a lot of BTC (ICO/insiders), and they are rotating that BTC into ETH to pump it on new narratives (Ethereum Treasury co’s). Once they’ve gotten it high enough, they’ll dump their ETH, creating new generational bagholders, and then rotate the gains back into BTC. No one wants ETH in the long run.”\nMow has criticised altcoins in the past, and added that it will be difficult for ETH to jump to all-time highs, stating that the closer it gets to its all-time high, the stronger the trader’s drive to sell the asset.\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\nBitcoin (BTC) slipped below $120,000 on Monday despite starting the week on a bullish note. The flagship cryptocurrency raced to an intraday high of $122,319 as buyers attempted to push the price beyond $123,000. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell to $118,701, ultimately registering a 0.51% drop. BTC is marginally up during the ongoing session, but is struggling to reclaim $120,000.\nAnalysts believe BTC could surge past $130,000 if it manages to cross $123,000. However, it could face resistance at this level and could fall back towards established support levels. Analysts believe BTC must stay above $119,000 to maintain its bullish structure and push above $123,000. The price is looking to push towards the upper reaches of its trading channels, and a breakout past $123,000 could create a clear path to $130,000 and higher. BTC’s resistance zone is crucial, as the price has historically paused or reversed after attempts to cross into a higher timeframe.\nHowever, a rejection from these levels will not necessarily end BTC’s bullish structure. However, it could trigger a decline towards $100,000 and another consolidation phase. The flagship cryptocurrency remains poised for further upside. A break above $123,000 could send BTC into price discovery. However, a rejection could see it drop to $100,000. Henrik Andersson, Chief Investment Officer at Apollo Crypto, believes a rally is long overdue following a period of consolidation.\n“In our view, it was just a matter of time before it would break up. In this time, we have seen positive ETF flows, more treasury companies buying Bitcoin, and several positive developments coming out of the White House. Bitcoin has been stuck in a low-volatility band between $115,000 and $120,000 despite all the good news.”\nBTC registered a sharp decline on Friday (August 1), dropping over 2% and settling at $113,365. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 0.67% and settled at $112,601. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Sunday, rising 1.52% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,215. The price continued pushing higher on Monday, registering a 0.69% increase and settling at $115,051. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $112,707 on Tuesday as selling pressure returned. It rebounded from this level to reclaim $114,000 and settled at $114,051, ultimately dropping 0.83%. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.80% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,028.\nSource: TradingView\nBullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $117,000 and settle at $117,515. Despite the positive sentiment, the price was back in the red on Friday, falling 0.71% to $116,683. Sellers retained control on Saturday as BTC registered a marginal decline and settled at $116,492. Bullish sentiment returned on Sunday as the price rose 2.42% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,309. BTC reached an intraday high of $122,319 on Monday as buyers attempted to push above $123,000. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level, dropping below $120,000 and settling at $118,701. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to exert control.\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\nEthereum (ETH) lost momentum after reaching an intraday high of $4,364 on Monday as traders began locking in their profits. The rally saw the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency surge past $4,000 on Friday and reach $4,262 on Saturday before losing steam. However, ETH is back in positive territory during the ongoing session, with the price up over 2%.\nOn-chain analytics platform Glassnode revealed that short-term ETH holders have been aggressively taking profits compared to their long-term counterparts. Glassnode analysts believe short-term holders are expecting a pullback in the short term.\n“ETH profit realization (7D SMA) peaked at $771M/day in July, above Dec ‘24 levels, and is now ramping up again at $553M/day. Profits from long-term holders match Dec ‘24 levels, but short-term investors are realizing far more gains, driving the current wave.”\nGlassnode revealed that ETH profit realisation, measured using the seven-day SMA, is around $533 million per day, primarily being driven by short-term investors. Meanwhile, long-term holders have been happy to sit on the sidelines. ETH crossed $4,300 during the ongoing session. Analysts believe buyers must retain this level for a move towards $4,500 to materialise. ETH has been accumulating for months, steadily absorbing selling pressure before its latest breakout.\nETH started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 6% and settling at $3,488. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 3%, slipping below $3,400 to $3,393. ETH recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to reclaim $3,500. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price rallied, rising over 6% to cross $3,700 and settle at $3,721. ETH was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping nearly 3% to $3,612. It rebounded on Wednesday, rising over 2% and settling at $3,685.\nSource: TradingView\nBullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH rallied, rising over 6% to cross $3,900 and settle at $3,911. The price crossed $4,000 on Friday, rising 2.52% and settling at $4,010. ETH rallied on Saturday, rising over 6% to cross $4,200 and settle at $4,262. However, it lost momentum on Sunday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $4,251. Sellers retained control on Monday as the price fell 0.59% to $4,226. ETH has recovered during the ongoing session, with the price up almost 2%, trading around $4,303.\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\nSolana (SOL) slumped below $180 on Monday as selling pressure returned. The altcoin started the week with a move to an intraday high of $186. However, it could not push higher as buyers lost momentum. As a result, selling pressure returned, driving the price below $180 to $174. SOL is marginally up during the ongoing session,\nAnalysts believe SOL could regain momentum thanks to several bullish developments over the past week. Public companies have upped their SOL purchases to access the blockchain’s staking rewards. Firms including Bit Mining, Upexi, and DeFi Development Corp have increased their SOL holdings, with plans to increase their stake substantially over the next few months. The Solana ecosystem is also emerging as the preferred chain for real-world asset tokenization. The Solana Foundation recently concluded an agreement with R3 to integrate the Solana blockchain for asset tokenization. The network has also registered a sharp jump in daily active addresses, indicating growing user engagement.\nSOL started the previous weekend with a sharp drop, falling nearly 6% on Friday and settling at $162. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell 2.57%, slipping below $160 and settling at $158. It recovered on Sunday, rising over 2% to reclaim $160 and settle at $162. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as SOL rallied, rising nearly 5% to settle at $169. The price was back in bearish territory on Tuesday, falling 3% to $164. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as SOL rose 2.50% and settled at $168.\nSource: TradingView\nSOL continued pushing higher on Thursday, rising over 4% to cross $170 and settle at $175. Buyers retained control on Friday as the price rose 0.79% to $176. Price action remained bullish over the weekend as SOL rose 1.80% on Saturday and 1.51% on Sunday, crossing $180 and settling at $182. Despite the positive sentiment, the price was back in bearish territory on Monday, dropping over 4%, slipping below $180 to settle at $174. The current session sees SOL marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control.\nInternet Computer (ICP) Price Analysis\nInternet Computer (ICP) ended the previous weekend on a bullish note, rising over 3% to cross $5 and settle at $5.13. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose 3.30% to $5.30. Despite the positive sentiment, ICP lost momentum on Tuesday, falling over 4% to an intraday low of $4.95 before settling at $5.07.

        "text": "XRP’s projected growth paints a steady, if unspectacular, picture. At an estimated $3.43 in 2026, $4.17 in 2030, $5.33 in 2035, and $6.80 in 2040 based on a 5% annual increase, it offers gradual appreciation for long-term holders. While this slow climb may appeal to the most patient investors, many in today’s market are looking for more immediate, higher-yielding opportunities.\nThis is where Bitcoin Swift (BTC3) enters the conversation, a project that is turning heads for how quickly it can activate returns and for its focus on making participants richer through adaptive rewards and high utility from day one.\nBitcoin Swift: Built for rapid, sustained ROI\nBitcoin Swift (BTC3) is designed as a decentralized financial operating system, not just another token. It combines the security of Proof-of-Work with the governance efficiency of Proof-of-Stake, while its Proof-of-Yield (PoY) model ensures rewards adapt in real time to network activity, environmental performance, and governance votes.\nWhere XRP offers predictable price targets years into the future, BTC3 delivers programmable staking rewards that start during the presale and are distributed automatically at the end of each stage. This transforms early participation into immediate on-chain value.\nAI-driven efficiency and governance safeguards\nBTC3’s AI oracles monitor energy usage and network health, rewarding efficient participation with higher returns. Governance is reinforced by quadratic voting weighted by decentralized identity reputation, AI-powered proposal screening, and an emergency council to block harmful changes. This structure keeps the reward system stable and investor-focused.\nSecurity is independently verified through the Spywolf Audit and Solidproof Audit, with team legitimacy confirmed via KYC verification. Internal sources indicate a third audit is in progress.\nInfluencer-driven visibility\nBTC3 is gaining traction across major crypto channels. Influencer reviews from Bull Run Angel and Crypto Show highlight its unique reward mechanics, compliance-ready design, and the strong potential for post-presale listings to boost value.\nPresale momentum\nBTC3 is now in Stage 4 of its 64-day presale, ending September 18, 2025. Over 2,100 participants have contributed more than $580k at the current price of $4. Stage 5 will increase to $5, with a confirmed launch price of $15. Stage 4 offers 106% APY through PoY rewards, automatically distributed at each stage’s close. The launch will take place on Orca, a leading Solana DEX.\nInternal reports suggest BTC3 is preparing exchange listings with MEXC, KuCoin, and LBank when the presale ends. Its liquidity is already among the highest at this stage, ensuring smoother trades and better price stability for new and existing holders.\nBTC3 tokenomics\n-\nTotal supply: 45,000,000 BTC3\n-\n50% (22.5M) allocated to PoY rewards over 30 years\n-\n30% (13.5M) to presale participants with early governance rights\n-\n15% (6.75M) for liquidity provisioning\n-\n5% (2.25M) for the team and reserve allocations\nCommunity growth that pays\nBTC3 offers a 10% referral bonus for both referrer and invitee, with no lockups or hidden conditions. It is a direct way to grow your position while expanding the network.\nFinal verdict\nXRP’s steady rise offers predictability, but BTC3’s combination of high APY, short presale duration, adaptive reward mechanics, and strong listing prospects makes it a far more aggressive ROI play. For investors seeking faster returns backed by advanced tech and verifiable security, Bitcoin Swift is the standout option in 2025.\nFor more information on Bitcoin Swift:\nWebsite: https://bitcoinswift.com\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Real-world asset tokenization is at its peak, but the sky is the limit for this industry. What companies/projects are leading this charge, what new companies could announce a TGE event in the final months of 2025, and how will the tokenized RWA ecosystem transform by the end of the year?\nThe decentralized real-world assets (RWA) market is one of the fastest-growing industries in the DeFi space. In the past year, the total value locked (TVL) reached an all-time high of $13 billion on DeFi platforms, with the total market capitalization at $24 billion, a 380% growth since 2022. In addition, investors and venture capital firms are adding millions of dollars into the space, setting a clear bullish path for the industry in the coming months.\nThe markets are expected to turn bullish at the tail end of 2025, according to analysts, and RWA tokenization projects could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the predicted wave. In this article, we focus on the biggest drivers of the RWA tokenized market in 2025, both in the traditional finance space and the decentralized finance space. From the entry of Blackrock’s tokenized treasury fund to Mavryk Network’s $3 billion agreement with UAE companies, the industry is flourishing, and these are the top companies/projects leading the charge.\n1 BlackRock’s entry into tokenized RWAs\nOne of the biggest stories in the RWA marketplace is the entry of BlackRock into the tokenization of real-world assets via its BUIDL tokenized Treasury fund. Since January 2025, the tokenized Treasury Fund has added over $2.4 billion – from $650 million to $2.9 billion – representing a 350% increase in eight months.\nThe fund aims to connect RWAs with decentralized finance (DeFi), having announced a partnership with DeFi protocol Euler, launching sBUIDL, allowing holders of the staked BUIDL token to borrow USDC or AUSD stablecoins.\n2 Mavryk Network Prepare For $MVRK token launch\nMavryk network is preparing for the $MVRK TGE event in May this year. $MVRK will be the native utility token for the blockchain, allowing users to participate in the ecosystem, including RWA tokenization, governance, and treasury functionalities. The token is expected to be the cornerstone of the $10 billion ecosystem and offer users a fast, secure and affordable medium to participate in the tokenization industry.\nIn a landmark deal in May this year, blockchain infrastructure provider Mavryk partnered with MultiBank Group, the world’s largest financial derivatives institution based in Dubai, and UAE-based real estate giant MAG to ink a $3 billion RWA tokenization agreement – the largest ever in the space. The deal fast-tracked the announcement of its token generation (TGE) event for the $MVRK token, with the pre-TGE accessible on QuestN and Galxe.\n3 RWA.io Eyeing A TGE Event In 2025?\nHaving launched the RWA.io Launchpad earlier this year, RWA.io announced its plans to launch its TGE too. The platform aims to connect startups in the RWA space with investors looking for early opportunities in the space. The platform’s official website points to an upcoming TGE, allowing early investors to get in at fixed prices before public trading begins.\nRWA.io’s latest development, the Launchpad, is designed to be a central hub, connecting promising projects with investors who are looking for early opportunities in the RWA space. The native token will be used as transaction fees, incentivising users and on-chain governance of the platform.\nHow The Tokenized RWA Ecosystem Could Shape Up In 2026\nThe coming year could be a critical step forward for the RWA tokenization industry. The nascent technology could unlock trillions in traditional assets, enhancing liquidity and accessibility and serve as the nexus between the two iterations of finance.\nOne key trend in 2025 is the entry of institutional players in the industry – a trend that will likely continue in 2026. Legacy finance companies (banks, hedge funds, and pension funds, are increasingly noticing the benefits of tokenisation, as witnessed with big players entering the market. In July, Goldman Sachs & BNY Mellon announced a partnership to tokenize money market fund shares through blockchain technology. As stated above, BlackRoack launched the BUIDL Fund —an Ethereum-based tokenized fund tracking cash equivalents and U.S. Treasuries – and has $3 billion in its coffers.\nAdditionally, the RWA tokenization ecosystem is becoming more interoperable, giving rise to multichain economies. According to a report by The Business Research Company, blockchain interoperability will witness a 29.3% CAGR for the next three years. This will allow for easy capital movement across the wider economy and open new economies in the RWA space in 2026.\nConclusion\nThe final quarters of 2025 looks bullish in the coming months, as more traditional players enter the ecosystem. The upcoming TGE events from Mavryk and RWA.io, and the possibility of more players entering before year-end, the final quarter of 2025 could be pivotal.\nUnderstandably, institutions entering the field is positive for the industry with billions of dollars projected to enter the RWA tokenization market in 2026.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Traders have been getting excited as the price of SOL and the Shiba Inu price have seen double-digit growth on the weekly charts. This momentum is projected to continue as their technical indicators are also quite bullish. Even some prominent analysts, such as Crypto GEMs and Shib Knight, have made bold price predictions for these top crypto coins.\nAmid all this excitement, many whales are now discussing Unilabs (UNIL) - a new AI crypto coin that recently entered phase six of its presale. Its presale run has been great so far, having raised over $12 million and potentially reaching $20 million before the end of August. As the first AI-driven DeFi asset management platform, many whales believe Unilabs stands out from crypto coins like Solana and Shiba Inu.\nUnilabs (UNIL): First AI-Driven DeFi Asset Manager Making Waves\nUnilabs (UNIL) is becoming a hot topic among whales, while the price of SOL and the Shiba Inu price are seeing some growth. It is a presale star that has made early investors 140% richer—a percentage that will likely rise soon, as CoinMarketCap will soon list UNIL, triggering a massive surge in demand.\nHype was already high for Unilabs as it recently launched the first AI-fueled DeFi asset management platform with over $30 million in AUM. On it, users get access to AI portfolio management, which focuses on finding the \"next best thing\" in the crypto market before anyone else does.\nWhales are super pumped because Unilabs revealed they'll send 30% of all the fees straight back to anyone holding the UNIL crypto coin. The more you hold, the bigger your slice gets. As a result, over 1.8B UNIL tokens have been bought so far. This crypto coin is worth $0.0097, but this value will hit $0.0108 after the seventh round begins. This 11% growth is just the tip of the iceberg since a Tier-1 CEX will soon list UNIL - triggering a price spike.\nCrypto GEMs: The Price of SOL May Hit $1,000\nSolana (SOL) is one of the best cryptos and it has seen some good movement. CoinMarketCap indicates that the price of SOL has increased from approximately $165 to over $185 in the past seven days. In other words, Solana shot up nearly 15% in just one week.\nMarket analyst Crypto GEMs also excited traders with his Solana price prediction. According to his X post, the price of SOL is now following a rising channel. If it continues to do so, Crypto GEMs predicts that Solana may be valued at over $1,000 by 2026.\nThe technical analysis also supports this Solana price prediction. Notably, TradingView indicates that the momentum indicator is currently at 21, suggesting that this uptrend is strengthening. While the price of SOL may soar soon, whales are turning to Unilabs (UNIL) as it has a smaller market cap, which means faster price gains.\nThe Shiba Inu Price Looks Ready To Move\nAs one of the meme coin titans, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has also experienced some growth. According to CMC data, the Shiba Inu price increased by nearly 10% on the one-week chart. During that period, the value of SHIB increased from approximately $0.000012 to over $0.000013.\nPeople are also keeping an eye on Shiba Inu (SHIB) thanks to some bullish statements from prominent analysts. For instance, Shib Knight made an X post saying that the Shiba Inu price is now testing the 1553 downtrend line. If it manages to break out, the value of SHIB could soar to $0.000033 or even $0.000045.\nTradingView shows some bullish signs too. For example, its momentum indicator also sits at 0.00000154, which indicates this Shiba Inu price trend is accelerating. Although this Shiba Inu price prediction has made some waves, many whales who are more interested in utility are now focusing on Unilabs (UNIL).\nWhy Is Unilabs (UNIL) More Appealing to Whales Than Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB)?\nEven though the price of SOL and the Shiba Inu price are looking like they wanna lift off, whales are putting their cash in Unilabs (UNIL) right now. This could be because Unilabs is in the perfect spot to capitalize on the growth of the AI market, which Grand View Research predicts will be valued at $1.8 trillion by 2030.\nIf it does, the long-term growth potential as well as stability will make UNIL a more favorable option than Solana and Shiba Inu.

        "text": "The partnership with DigiFT is a step forward for KuCoin’s goal of advancing the RWA tokenization market and allowing institutional customers access to regulated tokenized investment funds.\nLeading centralized crypto exchange KuCoin announced the partnership with DigiFT, a leading licensed platform for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), to support the UBS uMINT token. uMINT is the first tokenized investment fund launched by UBS Asset Management and distributed through DigiFT, allowing institutional clients to invest in UBS Asset Management’s risk-managed financial solutions.\nNotwithstanding, the partnership aims to unlock the trillions locked in illiquid assets in the traditional finance market to streamline trading and add liquidity. BC Wong, CEO of KuCoin explains the partnership will revolutionise the tokenized RWA market, “securing investments for the global market”.\n\"This partnership with DigiFT to support the UBS uMINT token highlights a significant step forward in exploring the viability and adoption of secure investments for a broader audience,” BC Wong further stated. “It empowers institutions to unlock tokenized traditional assets for seamless global trading and solidifies KuCoin's leadership in converging traditional and digital finance.\"\nAs part of the partnership, KuCoin will support the uMINT token, allowing institutional tokenholders through DigiFT to utilize their tokenized investment funds as off-exchange collateral. This will enable efficient trading on the tokenized assets, enhance liquidity and safeguard collateral by linking the TradFi market with new digital assets on a robust blockchain infrastructure. In addition, investors can also access an array of digital assets and other investments offered on the exchange.\n\"KuCoin remains committed to innovation alongside unwavering compliance and security,\" Wong added.\nUBS Asset Management launches tokenised MMF Via DigiFT\nBy holding the uMINT token, institutional clients can access UBS Asset Management’s institutional-grade cash management solutions. These solutions are backed by high-quality money market instruments and follow a dynamic risk-managed framework. The tokenized uMINT was offered through DigiFT, a platform that provides investors access to tokenized RWAs.\nThe platform supports subscription and redemption of the tokens via stablecoins and fiat currency in a non-custodial manner. The partnership with KuCoin Exchange will allow investors access to a higher liquidity pool and easy redemption of the tokenized RWA tokens. DigiFT’s goal is to advance the RWA tokenization market, developing the next iteration of compliant institutional-grade capital markets infrastructure for Web3.\nSpeaking on the partnership, Henry Zhang, CEO of DigiFT, stated:\n“The integration of the UBS uMINT token, which will enable tokenholders to use their funds as collateral via KuCoin’s mirroring program, exemplifies our focus on enhancing capital efficiency across digital asset markets through tokenized RWAs. Together with our partners, we are reshaping the innovation contours of institutional digital asset infrastructure.”\nGrowing The Trillion-Dollar RWA Tokenization Market\nNearly $14 billion is currently locked on on-chain RWA tokenization platforms. With RWA increasingly touted as the next phase of blockchain and institutional grade infrastructure being built, the market could be in a bullish phase. KuCoin aims to lead this charge with such incentives. Expanding the use of tokenized RWAs in real-world exchanges and trading environments will initroduce additional utility for cryptocurrencies, according to the KuCoin press release.\nAdditionally, KuCoin targets more partnerships in the RWA tokenization market, as demand for\nhigh-grade on-chain income assets grows. This is to see broader adoption of RWAs, foster a more interconnected financial ecosystem, and provide institutional clients with flexible trading solutions to optimize capital efficiency and boost returns.\nInvestors will be able to trade RWA Ltokens with stablecoin equivalents without transferring ownership, enabling sophisticated trading on digital assets while preserving yields and control through a third-party regulated custodian. This will all be done on highly secure and regulatory-compliant blockchain infrastructure – a new standard for the RWA tokenization economy.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Ethereum’s trading volume recently surpassed Bitcoin’s in the spot market—a notable shift in the crypto landscape that has caught the attention of traders and analysts alike. This development raises questions about shifting investor priorities, evolving market sentiment, and what it means for the ongoing competition between BTC and ETH. As both assets show strong price action, the implications for market leadership, liquidity flows, and potential future rallies are significant.\nWith these dynamics in play, Outset PR provides the analytical perspective and strategic insights needed to navigate such pivotal moments in the cryptocurrency market.\nBitcoin Aims Higher as It Surges Above $114k\nSource: tradingview\nBitcoin is currently exhibiting a steady upward trend, trading between $114,807 and $121,187. The digital currency recently experienced a 5% increase in just one week, suggesting potential for further growth. Bitcoin is approaching its closest resistance level of approximately $123,327, and a breakthrough could lead to a rise towards the second resistance level around $129,707, representing a nearly 7% increase from current levels.\nOver the past six months, Bitcoin's price has climbed by about 26%, indicating strong momentum and investor interest. The market is closely watching to see if this bull run will persist as Bitcoin tests these key price points.\nEthereum Shows Promise with Strong Price Movement\nSource: tradingview\nEthereum is holding strong in a range from above $4,000 to over $4,300. This shows solid momentum, with a notable rise of nearly 23% in the past week and almost 46% over the last month. These steady gains suggest potential growth toward the next resistance around $4,856.\nLooking further ahead, reaching past $5,000 isn't out of the question. The one-month performance reflects a considerable jump, hinting at a brighter future. As Ethereum gains traction, investors watch closely, hoping to see continued upward movement in this dynamic crypto market.\nOutset PR Crafts Communications Like a Workshop, Powered by Data\nFounded by renowned crypto PR expert Mike Ermolaev, Outset PR operates like a hands-on workshop, building every campaign with market fit in mind.\nInstead of offering random placements or templated packages, Outset PR carefully weaves a client’s story into the market context, showcasing what organic PR looks like:\n-\nMedia outlets are selected based on metrics like discoverability, domain authority, conversion rates, and viral potential\n-\nPitches are tailored to fit each platform’s voice and audience\n-\nTiming is mapped to let the story unfold naturally and build trust organically\nOutset PR occupies a unique niche as the only data-driven agency with a boutique-level approach.

        "text": "If you are on your last $1,000, the XRP price might be too high and the ADA coin might not be worth it at the current market size. Meanwhile, experts are optimistic that Unilabs Finance (UNIL) is the best DeFi token to invest in this year. Alongside its decentralized feature, it intersects with traditional finance and AI and is teeming with potential as a presale token.\nIs the Current XRP Price a Good Entry?\nThe XRP price hovers above $3.1 at the time of writing, recording an 8% gain over the past week. Despite the slight decline from its monthly peak price of $3.6, the bulls maintain the $3.0 support, presenting an optimistic outlook.\nHowever, momentum has been declining, as highlighted by the 5% decrease in daily trading volume to $5.5 billion. At the same time, technical indicators signal a potential downturn in the XRP price. Losing the $3.0 support might spell doom, with experts predicting a significant downswing below $2.5.\nHence, the current XRP price might not be a good entry, considering the fear of a pullback. Nevertheless, for long-term investors seeking modest gains, the payment-based cryptocurrency might be a good pick. With the SEC lawsuit officially settled and an XRP ETF in plans, it is an altcoin worth keeping on the radar.\nIs the ADA Coin Overvalued?\nWith a market size of $28 billion, saying the ADA coin is overvalued isn’t a stretch. As the 10th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, it has little room to run, prompting investors to seek other high-potential altcoins.\nAt $0.8 following a 15% gain on the monthly chart, the ADA coin is en route to $1.0. Regaining its 30-day high of $0.92 will set the stage for a breakout and a potential retest of its 2021 ATH of $3.0. While the price outlook might be optimistic for large-volume investors and institutions, the Layer-1 coin isn’t as compelling for retailers.\nNevertheless, the token trading volume has exploded by 135% over the past month to $44.5 billion and fees by 45% to $305,000, signaling adoption of the smart contract platform. While the ADA coin might not be the best DeFi token to invest in for substantial gain, it is nonetheless a good option for modest returns.\nUnilabs Finance (UNIL) — Are Experts Right to Consider It the Best DeFi Token to Invest In?\nUnilabs Finance (UNIL) has been the talk of the crypto community for several reasons, notably its upside potential and intriguing blend of AI, DeFi and TradFi. As an emerging and presale token, a 415% gain is projected on the launch date at the listing price of $0.05.\nAdditionally, given its AI integration, experts have drawn a parallel with FET, a protocol with a $1.7 billion market size. However, it is tipped to outperform courtesy of its staking and governance features, as well as yield-sharing. Compared to other protocols, this AI-backed asset manager will distribute 30% of the fees generated by the platforms to users.\nMeanwhile, it boasts over $30 million in AUM, spread across four flagship funds: BTC, AI, Mining and RWA. Attracting just 0.1% of the traditional hedge fund capital could exponentially increase its value, positioning it as the best DeFi token to invest in this year.\nClosing Thoughts\nPrimed to explode amid interest from everyday users and crypto enthusiasts, the UNIL token is significantly discounted at $0.0097 in the sixth ICO stage. It is considered the best DeFi token to invest in and a better alternative to the ADA coin due to its upside potential and bullish narrative. Underpriced compared to the XRP coin, early funding surpassing $12.5 million isn’t surprising.\nFor more information about Unilabs Finance (UNIL) visit the links below:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The Spot Ethereum ETFs are continuing to buy heavily, and therefore it might just be a matter of time before $ETH crashes through its all-time high.\nSource: TradingView\nIn the 4-hour time frame it can be seen how the $ETH price burst out of its previous bull flag with enough impetus to also crash through the strong resistance band from $4,000 to $4,100.\nNow, while the other shorter term Stochastic RSIs are coming down to reset, the price is consolidating within a tight range. The price could keep chopping sideways for a while, but this most definitely looks like a continuation pattern.\n$ETH rally becoming parabolic\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily chart for $ETH shows just how parabolic this rally has become.

With the all-time high at around $4,880, the target would be another 32% from there, and 50% from today’s price.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Not only has this Bitcoin dip back to the top of its bull flag closed the CME gap at $119,000, it has also retested support at $118,000. Could this dip take the price back into the bull flag (fakeout), or will this just be a normal retest before $BTC heads back towards its all-time high?\nDoubts creeping in for the bulls?\nSource: TradingView\nWhen $BTC broke out of its bull flag and surged to just over $122,000 it really did look as though this was going to be the beginning of the next leg higher. Of course, it still may be. There is the possibility that the price has just come back to close the CME gap at $119,000 and test the support at $118,000 before returning to head higher.\nThat said, a few little doubts for the bulls are perhaps creeping in. The price has so far remained around the $119,000 support. Could there be another dip to retest the top of the bull flag? Or in the worst case scenario could the price even reenter the flag and confirm a fakeout?\nThe RSI at the bottom of the chart reveals that the indicator line has crossed down below the uptrend. This is a low time frame, so perhaps too much shouldn’t be drawn into it. However, this trendline did start at the lowest point of the price rally back into the bull flag, and this strong dip below the uptrend of the indicator line looks to be signalling that this particular rally could be over.\nThe Stochastic RSI indicators on this time frame are practically at the bottom, although the 8-hour and 12-hour Stochastic RSIs still require a lot more time to reset.\nBearish daily candle for Monday\nSource: TradingView\nWith one exception, the picture on the daily time frame looks more positive for the bulls. The one exception is the quite negative looking candle for Monday. The strong surge to the upside, followed by the dip back down to support, left a lengthy candle wick behind, which as things stand is revealing a bearish double top pattern.\nIn favour of the bulls, the dip back down tested the support band, which also coincides with the top of the bull flag. There is a small ascending trendline which is so far holding. If the price bounces from here, this will have been a standard test and confirmation of the breakout.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator line will need to be watched closely. There is the possibility that a retest of the descending trendline plus the 50.00 level could take place.\n$119,000 is major level for rally or breakdown\nSource: TradingView\nFor the weekly chart view it is still very early to be making any strong assumptions. This said, the $119,000 level can be seen to be the major level for whether this current breakout rally continues, or whether a breakdown back into the bull flag and perhaps an even more bearish scenario plays out.\nAs already mentioned, a confirmation of the bull flag breakout is absolutely fine. The fact that the surge out of the flag was so strong just means that the price has further to come down in order to make this confirmation.\nAt the bottom of the chart the indicators in the Stochastic RSI are making their way down. They may have gone too far down now for a bounce from the 80.00 level, therefore, the next chance for the bulls is at the 50.00 level. If no bounce comes there, these indicators could carry on down to the bottom. If they do, price action is also likely to fall. It would just be a case of how far would it fall before the Stochastic RSI indicators were able to reset and head back up.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Names like MYX and ZORA appeared alongside unexpected surges such as TROLL and SOON. What caused these price jumps, and what makes these tokens stand out now? The details may surprise even close watchers.\n$XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI\nXYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game.\nWith the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project.\nWhat sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend.

If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries.\nSo far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest.

Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns.\nJoin $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions!\nMYX: The Fast-Lane Token Powering Cross-Chain Perpetual Plays\nMYX sits at the heart of a new kind of trading spot. The coin fuels a cross-chain exchange that lets users bet on price moves without time limits. A smart system called the Matching Pool lines up orders, so trades fill at the price you see. No surprise slips. Up to 50× leverage is on offer with stable USDC as margin. The app lives at once on BNB Chain, Arbitrum, opBNB, and Linea, so funds fly where they are needed. Tens of millions already rest in its pools, and volume has crossed the billion mark.\nRecent cross-chain links lit a spark, sending active wallets and fees surging. In a market hunting for real use, that growth stands out. Many tokens tied to leverage trades, such as GMX or DYDX, have already made big moves this cycle. MYX is younger, still below them in value, yet its pool-to-peer design aims for the same clear fills with lighter costs. If TVL keeps climbing and new chains join, the token could gain fresh demand from both traders and reward seekers. As always, price swings will follow crypto mood, but the setup looks promising.\nSOON: The Fast Lane Token Riding the Solana Super Stack\nSOON powers the Super Adoption Stack, a set of rollups built on the Solana Virtual Machine. These rollups click together like blocks, moving data fast and across many chains. People use SOON to vote, stake, earn rewards, and pay fees. The initial stash sits near one billion tokens, and new coins grow at about three percent each year. Daily trading is brisk, and the cap already sits in the high nine-figure range. Backers have poured tens of millions into the stack, and timed unlocks keep fresh supply flowing.\nThe pitch is simple: rollup speed with Solana tools and Ethereum-style reach. That blend could shine in a market hunting for cheap, fast lanes while Bitcoin cools and Layer-2s crowd. SOON’s clear use cases give it more purpose than many meme coins born this year. Still, the steady unlocks and three percent inflation mean price needs growing demand to climb. If the next cycle favors networks that link chains instead of sealing them off, SOON may stand out much like MATIC did in 2021 or OP in 2023. For traders who see cross-chain traffic as the next big wave, holding a slice of this stack looks worth a closer look.\nTROLL Coin: When Internet Mischief Meets Multi-Chain Mayhem\nTROLL started as a wink to every prank lover online. The coin has no promised use, yet it spreads across Ethereum, Solana, and other chains like a sly joke gone viral. Because its code is renounced, no one can secretly change the rules. Each chain shows its own price, swinging from a few million to almost two hundred million in value. Some weeks the chart leaps double digits in days, reminding fans why meme tokens keep stealing the spotlight.\nMany traders see TROLL as the next playful bet in a market hungry for stories. Meme coins like DOGE and SHIB moved first; now fresh crowds chase newer badges of internet fame. TROLL offers the extra twist of living on many chains, so buyers can pick the network they know best and still join one big tribe. If the current cycle keeps favoring high-risk fun, a low-utility token with loud culture can shine again. Yet the split prices between chains leave room for jumps if they line up. In short, TROLL’s future may depend less on math and more on memes, and memes still rule the feed.\nSIREN: The Mythic Bridge Bringing DIY Options to Ethereum Fans\nSIREN is a fresh stop for people who love choice. Built on Ethereum, it lets anyone create, trade, or close an option on any ERC-20 token while coins stay in their own wallet. Every bet is fully backed, so no gaps appear if prices swing. The name borrows from Greek tales and often mixes with talk of smart AI seas. Daily volume and value both sit in the low tens of millions, big enough for action yet small enough to grow fast.\nMany Web3 coins promise speed, but few give users real control. By skipping middlemen, SIREN feels closer to the core dream of crypto than big exchanges. Its focus on options also sets it apart from the crowded world of simple swaps. If the next market wave lifts Bitcoin and Ether, traders may chase tools that add spice without leaving the chain. SIREN meets that wish. For people who trust on-chain finance and enjoy calling future token prices, the coin looks lively in this cycle.\nZORA: The Social NFT Highway Built for Creators and Low Fees\nZORA lets artists turn any image, clip, or line of text into an on-chain collectable. It runs on a fast, low-cost copy of Ethereum called a Layer 2, built with the OP Stack. Since its 2021 start, the team has added a friendly mobile app, so minting takes a few taps. A link with the Base network now lets users drop “content coins” that rise or fall with each like and share, blending social buzz with real value. Daily trade numbers stay lively, and the market cap already sits in the hundreds of millions.\nMany NFT chains chase volume, yet fees still bite. ZORA’s cheap rails give it an edge over older rivals like the main Ethereum chain and even some newer Layer 2s. The focus on creators, not speculators, lines up with a wider trend: social media moving on-chain. If that wave keeps growing, demand for ZORA’s coin could follow. Prices are still below past peaks, so long-term fans may see room to run in this cycle. As always, the biggest gains tend to go to platforms that people use every day.\nConclusion\nMYX, SOON, TROLL, and SIREN have shown strong performance, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by combining meme culture with sports, aiming for huge growth and community-driven success.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/xdc-network-breaks-300m-staking-barrier-amid-secs-supportive-pos-regulatory-stance",
        "text": "XDC Network has emerged as one of the most closely watched blockchain platforms in 2025, breaking through the $300 million mark in total staked value at a time when regulatory clarity is beginning to favor proof-of-stake (PoS) ecosystems. The milestone solidifies XDC’s status as one of the top six PoS networks on CoinMarketCap and underscores the growing appeal of its hybrid, enterprise-oriented blockchain model.\nRegulatory Winds Shift in Favour of PoS\nIn recent remarks, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a distinction that the crypto industry has long sought: participating in or operating a PoS network is not inherently a securities transaction. While the agency maintained that certain token sales or reward structures could still trigger securities regulations depending on their design, the acknowledgement that PoS consensus itself is not a security has been widely interpreted as a green light for validator participation.\nFor the XDC Network, where validators are essential to maintaining scalability, security, and governance, this represents a strategic tailwind. Institutional stakeholders, once hesitant due to regulatory ambiguity, now see greater scope for involvement without the looming threat of enforcement targeting the staking model itself.\nBreaking Down the $300M+ Locked Value\nData from XDC’s Masternode dashboard indicates 2,660,802,298 XDC are currently staked via active masternodes and delegated pools. At the current market price of $0.092 per token, that stake is valued at approximately $245 million USD.\nBeyond validator staking, the ecosystem has expanded into DeFi and liquid staking solutions. DeFiLlama reports an additional ~142.39 million XDC (around $13.1 million USD) locked in protocols enabling yield farming, lending, and other capital-efficient strategies. Platforms such as PrimeStaking now lead the segment, with over $6 million in locked value.\nTaken together — and factoring in staking via centralized exchanges and wallet-based programs — the total locked value comfortably exceeds $300 million USD, representing a significant portion of the circulating supply.\nThe Economics of XDC Staking\nAccording to StakingRewards.com, XDC currently offers an estimated 10% annual percentage rate (APR) for validators. A masternode requires a locked stake of 10 million XDC (about 874,740 USD), generating roughly 1 million XDC annually, or 874,740 USD per year in rewards, equivalent to just over $8,000 per month.\nDelegated staking allows participants with smaller holdings to earn proportionate rewards by supporting established validators. For risk-managed investors, this creates an accessible entry point without the operational requirements of running a node.\nHosting a Masternode: Step-by-Step\nFor investors considering the full validator route, the onboarding process is straightforward but requires technical readiness and capital commitment:\n-\nAcquire 10 Million XDC — Store in XDC compatible wallet.\n-\nAccess the Masternode Portal — Review setup guidelines and network requirements here.\n-\nComplete KYC — Submit identification for compliance with governance standards.\n-\nConnect Your Node — Link the masternode’s coinbase address to your wallet.\n-\nLock the Stake — Confirm the transaction to activate candidacy.\n-\nMaintain Performance — Ensure uptime and reliability for uninterrupted rewards.\nLiquid Staking and DeFi Expansion\nXDC’s liquid staking infrastructure allows users to maintain staking rewards while receiving tokenized representations of their locked assets, which can then be deployed across DeFi platforms. This dual-layer approach enables strategies such as:\n-\nYield farming with staked tokens\n-\nUsing staked assets as collateral for loans\n-\nParticipating in liquidity pools without forfeiting validator rewards\nThe integration of staking and DeFi broadens the utility of XDC, attracts yield-focused participants, and increases overall capital efficiency.\nEnterprise-First Blockchain Model\nUnlike many PoS projects that began with retail speculation and later pivoted to institutional use cases, XDC was designed from the outset for enterprise-grade applications. Its hybrid architecture merges the transparency of public blockchains with the privacy controls of permissioned ledgers, enabling adoption in:\n-\nTrade finance digitization\n-\nReal-world asset tokenization\n-\nRegulated asset exchanges\nPartnerships in these areas have bolstered XDC’s credibility among institutional actors while maintaining accessibility for the retail market through listings on exchanges such as Binance.US, KuCoin, Bitstamp, and Gate.io.\nCrossing the $300 million locked value threshold signals more than just strong network participation — it reflects deep capital commitment, reinforced by regulatory clarity, competitive yield, and real-world use cases. As tokenization of assets gains momentum and blockchain integration deepens in global trade and finance, XDC’s combination of yield generation and enterprise adoption positions it as a compelling player in the PoS landscape.\nFor both institutional and retail participants, the XDC Network’s growth trajectory suggests that its staking economy is not merely an income opportunity but a stake in the infrastructure shaping the next phase of blockchain adoption.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/from-tokens-to-access-how-web3-and-mirror-links-are-reshaping-digital-freedom",
        "text": "For years, “Web3” has been synonymous with speculation—an ecosystem dominated by NFTs, memecoins, and volatility. But beneath the noise of token trading and decentralized finance hype, a quieter, more revolutionary movement is taking root. One that’s less about wealth—and more about access.\nIn places where digital repression is the norm and online platforms bend to state control, the technologies that underpin Web3—blockchains, decentralized storage, peer-to-peer protocols—are merging with another unlikely ally: mirror links. Together, they are laying the foundation for a freer internet—one that resists censorship not through protest, but through architecture.\nWelcome to the next frontier of digital freedom, where tokens don’t just represent value—they represent entry.\nWeb3's Unintended Superpower\nThe first wave of Web3 was about ownership—owning your assets, your identity, your data. But in censored markets—from Iran and Myanmar to Russia and parts of Sub-Saharan Africa—Web3 is taking on a more urgent mission: keeping the internet open when the walls close in.\nAt the core of this evolution is decentralization. Web3 technologies are inherently resistant to control because they operate outside traditional gatekeepers. Smart contracts don’t live on corporate servers. DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) don’t respond to government subpoenas. And decentralized applications (dApps) don’t vanish when an app store delists them.\nThis matters because censorship today is less about outright bans and more about chokepoints: app removals, domain blocks, surveillance, and payment restrictions. Web3 rebuilds the web from the ground up without those chokepoints.\nMirror Links: The Bridge Between Old and New\nWhile Web3 provides the backend resistance, mirror links offer the frontline access. These are alternate URLs—clones or proxies—that replicate a blocked website’s content on a different domain. Frequently used in regions where authorities block popular news outlets, social platforms, or even crypto exchanges, mirror links are an old trick with new relevance. And when these mirror links are paired with Web3 infrastructure, they become even more powerful.\nFor example:\n-\nA mirror link can point to a dApp frontend hosted on IPFS, making the site immune to takedowns.\n-\nDecentralized domains (like those registered through ENS or Handshake) can be used as mirror destinations, bypassing centralized DNS entirely.\n-\nUsers can receive real-time updates of working mirrors via encrypted Web3 messaging protocols like XMTP or Lens.\nDigital Identity and Permissionless Access\nTraditional internet access is increasingly tied to identity—phone numbers, SIM registration, KYC, IP tracking. In censored countries, this can lead to blanket surveillance or targeted harassment. Web3 disrupts this through self-sovereign identity (SSI) models. Users authenticate via cryptographic wallets, not real-world documents.\nIn this new model:\n-\nA user in Iran can access an educational dApp without revealing their name or location.\n-\nA journalist in Russia can publish investigative content to IPFS via a DAO, using a pseudonymous Ethereum address.\n-\nA citizen in Ethiopia can receive stablecoin remittances tied to a wallet—not a bank.\nThis kind of permissionless participation is impossible in Web2 environments, where every access point is controlled. In Web3, your wallet is your passport—and no one can cancel it.\nCensorship Resistance by Design\nWeb3 apps don't just operate differently; they resist differently. Here’s how:\n-\nContent Hosting on IPFS and Arweave: Instead of a server, data is stored across a distributed network. Censoring one node does nothing.\n-\nDecentralized Frontends: Tools like Fleek or Skynet allow websites to deploy on decentralized hosts, making mirror creation automatic.\n-\nDNS Alternatives: ENS (.eth) and Handshake (.hns) domains live on blockchains, immune to seizure by ICANN or local ISPs.\n-\nToken-Gated Access: Some platforms use NFTs or tokens as keys to gated services—bypassing traditional login systems and surveillance traps.\nEven when governments block access to crypto or dApp services, VPNs, browser extensions, and rotating mirror URLs keep the doors open.\nReal-World Adoption: Quiet but Growing\nWhile many in the West debate regulatory frameworks, users in restricted environments are already adopting Web3 out of necessity—not choice.\n-\nIn Nigeria, P2P stablecoin markets are thriving among freelancers and students facing inflation and fintech crackdowns.\n-\nIn China, developers experiment with blockchain-based publishing tools to preserve censored stories and whistleblower reports.\n-\nIn Ukraine and Venezuela, DAOs have become fundraising tools to bypass banking restrictions and coordinate aid.\nIn these cases, tokens become tools, and mirror links become lifelines.\nRisks, Challenges, and the Road Ahead\nOf course, this isn’t a utopia. Web3 comes with risks—rug pulls, scams, UX friction, and government pushback. Tools like IPFS are still too technical for most users. Wallet recovery remains a pain point. And mirror links, while useful, can be short-lived without constant maintenance.\nBut the direction is clear: access is becoming decentralized. Where the old internet fails under pressure, the new one bends and adapts. Where content is blocked, it’s mirrored. Where users are tracked, they are anonymized. Where speech is banned, it is tokenized and distributed.\nConclusion: A New Internet for the Next Billion\nWeb3 is no longer just about speculation or protocol upgrades. It’s becoming a humanitarian technology stack—a way to bring connectivity, agency, and financial freedom to people who’ve been locked out of the traditional web.\nIn the new paradigm, mirror links are more than circumvention tools. They’re bridges.\nTokens are more than speculative assets. They’re passports.\nAnd Web3 is more than an evolution. It’s a reclamation—of access, autonomy, and voice.\nAs censorship grows more subtle and more technical, so too must the resistance.\nAnd right now, that resistance is being coded into the very fabric of the decentralized web.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/new-meme-coin-takes-the-spotlight-as-shiba-inu-shib-quickly-loses-market-share-and-slips-in-rankings-in-2025",
        "text": "As of writing, a surprising shift is happening in the meme coin universe. In 2025, a new competitor named Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is quickly changing the landscape previously dominated by seasoned breeders like Shiba Inu (SHIB). LILPEPE draws interest from traders, investors, and influencers, while SHIB is fading from its once-glorious position. With a powerful presale nearly concluded, a $777K giveaway live, and a recent listing on CoinMarketCap, this new meme-layer sensation defines what the future of meme coins could look like.\nShiba Inu’s Decline: The Numbers Don’t Lie\nIn early 2025, Shiba Inu held strong in the meme coin rankings, second only to Dogecoin. However, we have seen a consistent downtrend in both market sentiment and share in recent months. As of August 4, 2025, SHIB trades at $0.000013 as of writing, down from prior highs, with a market cap of $7.37 billion and a daily trading volume of around $163 million. Once ranked comfortably within the top 15 cryptocurrencies, SHIB has now slipped to #22 on CoinMarketCap, with its global crypto market share shrinking to just 0.23%. Despite efforts like Shibarium, ShibaSwap upgrades, and token burns, SHIB appears trapped in a cycle of diminishing returns. Its reliance on Layer-1 Ethereum infrastructure means it continues to face high gas fees and scalability limitations—an Achilles’ heel that new-generation meme coins like LILPEPE are exploiting.\nEnter Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin That Builds While Others Fade\nUnlike many meme tokens that merely ride on hype, LILPEPE is building a full ecosystem. Designed as the native token of its own Layer-2 blockchain, LILPEPE blends meme culture with technical fundamentals—offering ultra-low fees, blazing-fast transactions, and a chain specifically engineered for meme coin launches and liquidity. Currently in Stage 9 of its presale, LILPEPE is priced at $0.0018, having already raised $15.6 million out of a $16.475 million target. Over 10.8 billion tokens have been sold out of the 11.25 billion allocated for presale, signaling strong investor demand. With a listing price of $0.003, early participants stand to make significant returns even before full market listing occurs. Adding to the frenzy is a $777,000 giveaway, where ten winners will receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens each. Over 183,000 entries have been recorded, a clear signal of the coin’s growing community and viral appeal.\nA Meme Coin That Passed the Smart Test\nIn a space often plagued by scams and rug pulls, LILPEPE has gone through a smart audit, reinforcing investor trust. The contract is built on the Ethereum (ERC-20) network and features zero taxes on buys and sells, meaning more gains go directly to investors. The tokenomics are transparently structured, with no initial unlock at TGE (Token Generation Event) and a 3-month cliff followed by 5% vesting every 30 days—a setup designed to prevent sudden dumps and ensure long-term price stability.\nLILPEPE’s Ecosystem: Built for the Future, Not Just the Hype\nWhile SHIB remains stuck on Ethereum’s congested Layer-1, LILPEPE is pioneering a new Layer-2 chain built specifically for meme coins. Its roadmap is rich with growth potential:\n-\nLaunch on Top Exchanges & Uniswap\n-\nGoal of $1 Billion Market Cap\n-\nLayer-2 EVM Rollout\n-\nTop 100 CoinMarketCap Ranking Target\nAs of writing, LILPEPE is officially listed on CoinMarketCap, signaling further validation. With its smart blend of narrative and infrastructure, it’s not just aiming to be a meme—it wants to be the platform for memes.\nWhy LILPEPE Is Surging While SHIB Is Slipping\nSeveral critical distinctions explain why LILPEPE is gaining traction:\n-\nTechnical Infrastructure: A custom-built Layer-2 blockchain gives LILPEPE an edge over SHIB’s reliance on Ethereum L1.\n-\nCommunity Momentum: A growing, engaged base of early investors, meme lovers, and airdrop hunters.\n-\nTransparent Tokenomics: Clear vesting schedules, 0% taxes, and anti-dump mechanics make it investor-friendly.\n-\nNarrative Advantage: While SHIB has struggled to maintain its momentum beyond burns and DEXs, LILPEPE has crafted a compelling origin story and roadmap—resonating with both degens and serious traders.\nMeanwhile, SHIB’s lack of innovation and over-reliance on legacy infrastructure has left it vulnerable to newer, faster, and more community-driven competitors.\nThe Bottom Line: Is SHIB Losing Its Legacy to LILPEPE?\nIf current trends hold, LILPEPE could redefine what a meme coin looks like in 2025 and beyond. From its deeply engaging lore and Layer-2 ambitions to its smart contract audit and aggressive community growth strategies, it’s clear this isn’t just another frog meme—it’s a contender for the meme coin crown. With its presale nearing its final stage, and major exchange listings expected post-launch, now might be the last chance for early investors to grab a meaningful position before the price discovery phase kicks in. Don’t sleep on LILPEPE. As SHIB struggles to hold ground, this new meme-layer king may already write the next chapter in meme coin history. Ready to join the green candle ride?

        "text": "As altseason approaches, several altcoins are expected to score new highs. One such coin is Tron. Javon Marks forecasts that the value of the DeFi token could rally to $1.11 in the months ahead. Solana, too, is poised for a rally, with forecasts suggesting it could hit $400.\nMeanwhile, the altcoin most experts are watching out for is Unilabs (UNIL). With over $12.5 million, the DeFi project has become the center of attention for transforming DeFi investment with AI. Unilabs is projected to outperform the top crypto coins with a 5x pump, driven by the increasing adoption.\nAnalysts Say Tron (TRX) Could See Massive Upside\nCrypto analyst Javon Marks believes the Tron price is still on track to hit $1.11 or even higher. According to Marks, reaching these levels would represent more than a 220% upside from current prices, effectively delivering over a 3x return for investors.\nHe notes that momentum remains strong, and the Tron price has shown the technical setup needed for such a rally. Echoing this bullish sentiment, technical analyst Altwolf highlights that the daily chart continues to print only bullish uptrends for TRX.\nHe adds that the TRON price needs a \"God candle\" on the weekly chart to push toward $0.50, which he believes is \"coming soon.\" With multiple experts aligning in their outlook, the TRON price appears to be gearing up for a potential explosive move shortly.\nThe Tron price has been caught within a narrow range in the past few days. Bulls' attempt to break past the $0.34 level has failed due to high selling pressure. Still, technical indicators such as the RSI, which reads 66, support a rebound in the coming days.\nSolana (SOL) Is Undervalued, Says Expert\nCardzz, a top crypto supporter, believes the Solana price could skyrocket if it breaks out of the $120–$186 range. He argued that the current Solana price is heavily undervalued and poised for a significant rally, with a target between $350 and $400.\nAccording to Cardzz, the Solana price could soar once momentum kicks in, leaving its current levels far behind. For investors watching closely, the Solana price breakout could start a powerful new bullish phase.\nAnother expert, Kamran Asghar, told his followers the Solana price is \"making history in 2025\" similar to 2021. Kamran's chart depicted Solana price in a parallel channel on the multi-month timeframe. The analyst predicted that the Solana price might reach up to $460 within the next few months.\nPresently, CoinMarketCap data indicates the Solana price has risen by 12.3% on the weekly timeframe. The altcoin price, however, has faced a tough resistance level at the $185 mark.

        "text": "Kaspa price prediction gains interest across the market, but the real conversation is where the next wave of wealth creation will come from. The crowd wants systems that pay for participation, not just patience. That spotlight is drifting toward a new engine built to share growth with its users.\nKaspa price prediction gains interest\nKaspa has been garnering attention lately, particularly with forecasts painting a mixed but intriguing picture for its next moves. Some analysts see it breaking past the $0.24 mark in the short term, while more ambitious projections stretch toward $0.30 by year’s end. Long-term predictions are even bolder, with some placing Kaspa over $0.50 within the next two years if market conditions align.\nThat said, the road isn’t without its bumps. Volatility and shifting macro conditions mean these targets could be tested. While the growth potential is there, Kaspa still faces stiff competition from projects offering richer incentives, faster scaling strategies, and more aggressive liquidity expansion, areas where Bitcoin Swift is making a louder case for investor attention.\nWhy Bitcoin Swift attracts more Stage 4 buyers\nBitcoin Swift, also known as BTC3, is designed as a financial operating system that rewards real usage. Security anchors to Proof of Work, while Proof of Stake seals checkpoints every 100 blocks and directs governance. Zero-knowledge credentials let users prove age or residency without leaking private data. The wealth pitch is simple. Adaptive PoY rewards start from day one and link payouts to activity, so participants share in the growth they help create.\nAI energy efficiency that compounds gains\nThis is where the engine gets exciting. AI oracles watch throughput and energy mix, then tune PoY multipliers so efficient participation earns more. Contracts run inside a WASM environment and include learning agents that improve performance over time. The result is fewer wasted cycles and rewards that follow real demand. That is how a protocol can scale while paying users fairly. You can explore the stack at Bitcoin Swift, and see how efficiency aligns with returns.\nSecurity checks and governance architecture\nCapital wants safety as well as upside. BTC3 has a completed Solidproof Audit and a completed Spywolf Audit, plus team verification through KYC. According to internal sources from the team, they are working on a third security audit with a well known and reputable blockchain firm to ensure user safety and protocol integrity further. Governance starts with AI risk scoring, then quadratic voting weighted by decentralized identity reputation, and an emergency council can veto malicious proposals. Updates roll out on X and major milestones are mirrored on the official BTC3 site.\nBTC3E stablecoin turns activity into daily utility\nBTC3 plans a USD pegged stable token called BTC3E. Users lock BTC3 in collateral vaults to mint BTC3E with an initial collateral ratio near 150%. AI oracles track prices in real time and can trigger liquidations if safety thresholds are breached. Governance can adjust stability fees and oracle sources. That creates a spendable asset for payments and DeFi while keeping value inside the ecosystem, which supports stronger PoY dynamics for long term holders.\nInfluencers say why attention is building\nPlenty of creators are covering the thesis, with detailed reviews that unpack why Bitcoin Swift attracts more Stage 4 buyers.\nStage 4 presale momentum that rewards participation\nInterest is accelerating because programmable PoY rewards are released at the close of each stage, so holders feel the protocol working right away. Insider chatter points to active talks with MEXC, KuCoin, and LBank for listings, which would deepen order books and speed discovery. Liquidity is already strong for a project at this point, an edge that reduces slippage and supports healthier price action on entry and exit. Tap the official hub at Bitcoin Swift to follow along.\n-\nCurrent price: $4\n-\nLaunch price: $15\n-\nStage 4 APY: 106%\n-\nInvestors: over 2100 with more than $580k sold\nThe presale runs for only 64 days and ends on 18 September 2025. Short runway, immediate PoY distributions, and standout liquidity are exactly why Bitcoin Swift attracts more Stage 4 buyers while Kaspa price prediction gains interest.\nConclusion: Bitcoin Swift Gains More Attention Amid Kaspa’s Analysis\nKaspa price prediction gains interest, yet wealth often flows where users are paid to participate. Bitcoin Swift aligns payouts with real usage through AI tuned PoY, serious audits, and a path to daily utility with BTC3E. That mix is why Bitcoin Swift attracts more Stage 4 buyers today.\nFor more information on Bitcoin Swift:\nWebsite: https://bitcoinswift.com\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Two meme coins are hurtling toward a showdown, one already proving its worth, the other about to enter the ring for the first time. MemeCore has been on a tear since launch, climbing 35%.\nBut Bitcoin Pepe is staring down a much bigger prize: direct access to Bitcoin’s $2.3 trillion liquidity. For those just tuning in, this is the first meme ICO built on BTC, with LBank joining MEXC and BitMart ahead of its August 13th DEX debut.\nWith over $17m raised at only $0.0458, early whales and fresh-faced investors are bagging Bitcoin Pepe before this historic DEX debut, betting on a launch surge that could rocket the price straight to the moon.\nHit the official website to keep up with the latest updates before August 13th rolls around.\nBitcoin Pepe vs MemeCore – Meme 2.0 from two angles\nMemeCore is courting creators, validators, and meme-token stakers into one economy, with a concept that is simple yet ambitious: make virality measurable, and then make it pay. Since its market debut, M has climbed 35%, and the ecosystem of Meme Vaults, Viral Grants, and staking pools is starting to fill with activity.\nBitcoin Pepe is taking a more radical path. The PEP-20 standard strips away the friction of creating new assets on BTC, leading to a possible explosion of meme tokens, NFTs, and DeFi apps on crypto’s oldest chain. Its upcoming Layer 2 promises Solana-like speed on top of Bitcoin’s security.\nIn short, MemeCore shows that a meme chain can be structured, fair, and self-sustaining. Bitcoin Pepe is betting that a meme chain doesn’t need to be its own chain at all if you can plug into the biggest one on earth.\nWhich meme coin could 100x in the upcoming weeks?\nOn August 13th, Bitcoin Pepe will get its first real stress test when open-market trading begins without presale caps or allocation limits. That’s when the market decides if the hype translates into momentum, and right now, plenty of traders think it will, with only limited tokens left ahead of the big launch.\nThe staking pool offering 15,000% APY on 1.5 million tokens sold out in a flash, suggesting serious appetite for yield inside the BPEP ecosystem. Partnerships have been stacking up fast, instantly plugging BPEP into a huge, active audience.\nBeyond this, macro is working in its favor: Standard Chartered is eyeing $200k BTC in the months ahead. This rising tide could lift the entire Bitcoin ecosystem and BPEP is small enough to move dramatically if demand spikes. With hype this thick, 100x doesn’t feel far-fetched.\nBitcoin Pepe is a way to get exposure to the BTC network’s credibility and liquidity without paying BTC’s five-figure entry price. This could be a Solana-style expansion, except on Bitcoin, with all the trust and attention this name carries.\nThe next big trade might not be chasing BTC’s climb, but riding BPEP as it builds a full meme economy on top of it. Timing, as always in crypto, is everything, and right now, the countdown is ticking toward one of the most hyped launches of the year.\nLast days before Bitcoin Pepe’s launch on August 13th: Over $17m raised\nThe August 13th DEX listing is the first chance for the open market to decide Bitcoin Pepe’s worth, and if demand spikes, this could be the cycle’s most aggressive moonshot.\nMemeCore has shown that Meme 2.0 can be structured, rewarding, and sustainable. But Bitcoin Pepe offers the asymmetric play: smaller, faster, and ready to ride Bitcoin’s brand in a way MemeCore can’t.\nFor traders priced out of Bitcoin, BPEP is the small-cap ticket into the same ecosystem, with far more room to run.\nThis could be the last moment to buy Bitcoin Pepe at presale prices of only $0.0458.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/why-cardano-ada-might-disappoint-in-the-upcoming-bull-run-and-2-crypto-coins-poised-to-rally-instead",
        "text": "People have long said that Cardano (ADA) is one of the most environmentally friendly blockchain solutions because it focuses on peer-reviewed development, energy efficiency, and proof-of-stake consensus. However, as the 2025 bull run gets closer, Cardano might be unable to give investors the enormous gains they want. ADA might not be able to get the same kind of returns as other new coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) because it has a high market cap, slow growth in DeFi, and its ecosystem isn't growing. Dogecoin and LILPEPE might be better investments for higher returns and faster development. Let's discuss why Cardano might not do well in the next bull run and why Dogecoin and LILPEPE are better set up for big price jumps.\nCardano (ADA): The Blockchain That Doesn't Have Much Room To Grow In The Short Term\nThere are many good things about Cardano (ADA). It is one of the most respected cryptocurrencies because it has a proof-of-stake system, is environmentally friendly, and has a lot of academic support. The Hydra scaling solution for Cardano is supposed to improve the network's transaction throughput. Cardano was made with security and scalability in mind. Cardano may not see the kind of quick returns that many investors are looking for in the upcoming 2025 bull run, even though it has a lot of potential in the long term. Here are the main reasons why ADA might let you down: A lot of money in the market: Cardano has already taken much of its market share, with a market cap of several billion dollars. Even though its price will increase from $0.7539, the percentage gains will be smaller than those of smaller, newer coins. Slow Adoption in DeFi: Even though Cardano's ecosystem is getting bigger, it hasn't taken over the DeFi space as much as competitors like Solana and Ethereum. This slower adoption makes it harder to grow in the short term. Stagnation in Ecosystem Growth: Cardano is becoming more popular in Africa and other developing areas. However, its use and growth in DeFi and NFTs are still behind other Layer-1 blockchains. Because of these things, Cardano (ADA) will unlikely see the massive percentage growth many investors expect shortly.\nDogecoin (DOGE): The Meme Coin That Will Last\nAlthough Cardano might not perform as expected in terms of returns, Dogecoin (DOGE) will have a significant rally during the next bull run. The first meme coin, Dogecoin, has become a staple in the crypto world with the help of the community and celebrity fans, notably Elon Musk. Dogecoin currently trades at $0.2090 and is expected to increase fivefold to an estimated price of $1 by the end of 2025. At that, DOGE remains an auspicious meme coin to keep an eye on in 2025 since it has an active community, is well-established, and has seen increased utility in the space of NFTs and gaming, as well as in retail payments. Although Dogecoin is not as technology-oriented or promising as some leading coins, it possesses a huge market cap, brand recognition, community contribution, and nature, which is likely to result in a significant rally soon.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin That Works\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) is another coin likely to do better than Cardano in the next bull run. LILPEPE's community may not be as big as Dogecoin's, but it's quickly becoming a meme coin with real use. LILPEPE is trading at $0.0018, raised $15.7 million in presale across blockchain layers, and is built on Layer-2. So transactions are done quicker with lower fees, and the network can support more users than Cardano and Dogecoin. This tech edge makes it more usable and durable for long-term growth. LILPEPE is supported by the Pepe Pump Pad, which gives meme token developers a safe place to start their projects with anti-rug pull features and liquidity locks. This is in addition to its blockchain infrastructure. Analysts say that LILPEPE could reach $0.40 by 2025, a significant return on its current price. Whale investors are starting to buy up LILPEPE, and the community is growing.\nWhy LILPEPE and DOGE Will Do Better Than Cardano\n-\nLower starting points and more potential for growth\nCompared to Cardano, LILPEPE, and Dogecoin have lower entry points and more room for growth. Because Cardano has a high market cap, it can't grow considerably. On the other hand, LILPEPE and DOGE have a lot more room to grow.\n-\nUsefulness in the real world and support from the community\nCardano is a long-term investment, but LILPEPE and Dogecoin are already part of the meme coin culture and can be used for NFTs, gaming, and DeFi. LILPEPE is especially good because it has faster transactions and lower fees, which makes it more useful in the growing DeFi space.\n-\nThe potential for explosive growth\nLILPEPE has a low market cap, which means that early investors could make significant returns as the coin becomes more popular. Dogecoin is also in an excellent position for substantial growth because it has a huge community and is well-known. Retail investors keep buying the token.\nHow to Put Money into LILPEPE\nAre you ready to invest in Dogecoin or pits? Here's how you can get started:\n-\nGet MetaMask or Trust Wallet for your computer or phone.\n-\nPut ETH or USDT (ERC-20) in your wallet.\n-\nGo to littlepepe.com to see the official presale page for LILPEPE.\n-\nConnect your wallet and buy some tokens.\nThe price of LILPEPE will go up as the presale stages move forward, so the best time to invest is early.\nIn Conclusion, Dogecoin And LILPEPE Are Better Choices Than Cardano.\nCardano is still a good long-term investment because it is sustainable and has been peer-reviewed, but it has limited room for growth in the short term. Instead, Dogecoin and LILPEPE are better choices for investors who want to make a lot of money quickly in the next bull run. LILPEPE has real use, a low entry point, and a community that spreads the word about it, so it should do better than Cardano in 2025. Dogecoin and LILPEPE are the meme coins to watch if you want to make more money.

        "text": "Bitcoin is trading near record levels after a historic regulatory shift that could eventually allow U.S. retirement accounts to hold crypto assets. While the change will take time to implement, the move is fueling optimism among investors and could serve as a major accelerant for long-term adoption.\nAs market adoption increases and competition for attention intensifies, high-quality PR becomes a key growth driver. This article highlights how Outset PR leverages data-backed strategies to deliver results with lasting impact.\nThe Catalyst: Laying the Groundwork for Crypto in 401(k) Plans\nIn early August, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing regulators to expand access to alternative investments such as cryptocurrencies and privately held companies within 401(k) retirement accounts.\nU.S. 401(k) plans currently manage an estimated $8.9 trillion in assets, making the policy a potentially huge channel for future crypto inflows. However, the order does not make crypto investments available immediately.\nWhile some asset managers already offer limited crypto exposure via specialized funds, full-scale inclusion in 401(k)s will depend on forthcoming regulatory updates and employer adoption.\nImmediate Market Reaction\nDespite the timeline for implementation, the market reacted swiftly:\n-\nBitcoin (BTC) rose over 3% intraday, hitting $122,000—just shy of its July 14 all-time high of $123,091.\n-\nMicroStrategy (MSTR), with its large Bitcoin holdings, rallied on the news.\n-\nCoinbase (COIN) saw gains on expectations of long-term retail inflows and higher trading activity.\nThe bullish response reflects both the symbolic impact of policy recognition and the market’s tendency to price in future demand.\nMacro Tailwinds Boosting the Rally\nThe policy news landed in a favorable macroeconomic environment:\n-\nWeaker U.S. Dollar – The dollar eased ahead of key inflation data and a looming U.S.–China tariff decision.\n-\nRate Cut Expectations – Growing bets on potential Federal Reserve rate cuts boosted appetite for risk assets.\n-\nGlobal Liquidity Conditions – Improved liquidity across financial markets supported speculative flows into crypto.\nTogether, these factors amplified the positive sentiment generated by the executive order.\nTechnical Outlook: ATH in Sight\nBitcoin’s chart remains decisively bullish:\n-\nPrice reclaimed $120,000, now acting as short-term support.\n-\nRising volumes confirm strong conviction among buyers.\n-\nRSI levels are elevated but not yet flashing classic overheating signals for a rally phase.\nA clean break above $123,091 could unlock the next targets between $130,000 and $135,000, where psychological levels and Fibonacci projections align.\nRiding Market Trends with Precision: The Outset PR Edge\nIn a market where adoption is growing and competition for attention is intensifying, high-quality PR is no longer optional—it’s a growth driver. Navigating the crypto narrative without the right tools can feel like driving a foggy road without headlights. Outset PR changes that, using data-backed strategies drawn from both retrospective and real-time metrics to produce results with lasting impact.\nRather than relying on vague promises, Outset PR delivers concrete plans with:\n-\nperfect publication timing\n-\nnarratives built around product–market fit\n-\nperformance-based media selection.\nEvery campaign is tailored to a client’s specific goals, budget, and growth stage—far from the cookie-cutter packages common in the industry.\nIts proprietary traffic acquisition technology fuses organic editorial placements with SEO and lead generation, enabling brands to appear in high-discovery surfaces and multiply traffic compared to conventional PR.\nOutset PR also runs an internal media analytics desk to track outlet performance by domain activity, visibility shifts, audience geography, and traffic sources—publishing industry reports that help clients stay ahead of trends.\nBy aligning visibility strategies with market momentum—whether it’s Bitcoin nearing an all-time high or an altcoin entering a breakout phase—Outset PR ensures that its clients don’t just ride the wave; they’re positioned where the wave is highest.\nConclusion\nBitcoin’s rally toward its all-time high is powered by both regulatory optimism and a supportive macro backdrop. While the 401(k) development will take time to translate into real investment flows, it signals a notable shift in U.S. policy toward digital assets.\nIn parallel, the evolving competitive landscape in crypto makes strategic PR a critical tool for amplifying opportunities. Firms like Outset PR show how data-driven, trend-aware campaigns can turn market developments into lasting visibility and measurable business outcomes.\nYou can find more information about Outset PR here:\nWebsite: outsetpr.io\nTelegram: t.me/outsetpr\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Dogecoin experiences a surge, displaying strong upward momentum after surpassing a 200-day moving average, a significant technical threshold. This rally sparks interest and curiosity among crypto enthusiasts, eager to identify key levels surpassing which could propel the prices higher.\nThis piece of analysis is presented by Outset PR, a unique data-driven crypto PR agency that navigates the market trends in order to craft compelling and timely stories for blockchain projects and let them stand out in the crowd.\nDogecoin Shows Steady Rise Amid Increasing Market Interest\nSource: tradingview\nDogecoin is experiencing a positive momentum, with its price currently in the lower-to-mid 20 cents range. It has shown a rise of over 15% in the past week. This indicates growing enthusiasm among investors. The coin is flirting with a significant resistance level at around 28 cents. If it breaks through, it could potentially climb to over 30 cents, reflecting a rise of nearly 20% from current values.\nOn the flip side, DOGE faces support at around 17 cents. This recent trend aligns with its month-long increase of nearly 15%, although there's still some recovery needed from past months’ slight dip. With market interest growing, Dogecoin might be headed for another upward phase.\nPR with C-Level Clarity: Outset PR’s Proprietary Techniques Deliver Tangible Results\nIf PR has ever felt like trying to navigate a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data. It builds strategies based on both retrospective and real-time metrics, which helps to obtain results with a long-lasting effect.\nOutset PR replaces vague promises with concrete plans tied to perfect publication timing, narratives that emphasize the product-market fit, and performance-based media selection.

Outset PR addresses this by offering customized solutions. Every campaign begins with a thorough research and follows a clearly mapped path from spend to the result. It's data-backed and insight-driven with just the right level of boutique care.\nConclusion\nAs interest in the market grows, different coins show varied results.

        "text": "The meme coin market is heating up again, with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) showing early signs of momentum after weeks of sideways action. Yet while the world’s two most famous meme coins prepare for possible breakouts, an upstart competitor — Little Pepe (LILPEPE) — has already surged 80% in its presale and is drawing heavy attention as the next big thing in the sector.\nDogecoin Price Outlook: Recovery Attempts Underway\nDogecoin has spent much of the past two weeks consolidating around the $0.20 level after a 16% drop from July highs. While the decline rattled some holders, technical indicators suggest DOGE could be attempting a rebound. On the daily chart, DOGE recently broke out from the upper trendline of a falling wedge — a formation that often signals trend reversals. However, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains in slightly negative territory, showing that bullish momentum is still weak. Although the histogram bars are shrinking, which suggests the bearish momentum is waning, the MACD is also struggling to enter positive territory. Should DOGE maintain its position above $0.20 and break resistance at $0.24, the next target for traders could be the $0.26 region. Selling pressure could lead DOGE to $0.17, which is a critical support zone. Breaching this level could trigger a deeper corrective phase.\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Technical Setup: Cup & Handle Points to 36% Rally\nShiba Inu has quietly formed a bullish Cup & Handle pattern on its daily chart, a setup that could pave the way for a significant upside move. Currently trading around $0.00001274, SHIB is approaching its breakout resistance at $0.00001710. If buyers push through this level with strong volume, SHIB could rally to $0.0000239 — a gain of over 36% from current prices. A double Bottom pattern, another reversal signal that strengthens the case for a breakout, adds to the bullish picture. Momentum indicators are tilting in SHIB’s favor, with RSI holding steady and volume picking up. The key level to watch is $0.0000103 — a breakdown here would invalidate the bullish pattern and potentially send SHIB lower.\nThe New Challenger: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Already Up 80%\nWhile DOGE and SHIB holders wait for their next move, Little Pepe has been quietly making waves — and big gains — in its presale. Since launch, LILPEPE’s price has increased from its initial stage to $0.0018, marking an 80% rise before the token has even hit exchanges. LILPEPE isn’t just another meme coin trying to ride the hype. The project is building the world’s first Layer-2 blockchain dedicated entirely to meme coins, aiming to provide:\n-\nUltra-fast, low-cost transactions\n-\nA meme coin launchpad for new projects\n-\nAnti-sniper bot technology to protect fair trading\n-\nA community-driven ecosystem that rewards holders\nWith a total supply of 100 billion tokens and 25 billion allocated to presale buyers, the project is positioning itself for explosive growth when it lists.\nSecurity First: CertiK Audit Score of 95.49%\nOne of LILPEPE's biggest differentiators is its commitment to security — something often overlooked in the meme coin space. The project recently completed a full audit by CertiK, one of the blockchain industry’s most respected security firms.\nThe audit’s results were impressive:\n-\nScore: 95.49%\n-\nNo critical vulnerabilities detected\n-\nSmart contracts built with best-in-class coding practices\n-\nFull compliance with ERC-20 standards\nThis means presale participants and future buyers can confidently interact with LILPEPE, knowing its code has been vetted at the highest level.\nPresale Stage 9: Almost Sold Out\nAs of now, LILPEPE is in Stage 9 of its presale:\n-\nPrice: $0.0018 (Next Stage: $0.0019)\n-\nFunds Raised: $15,647,250 / $16,475,000\n-\nTokens Sold: 10,790,138,577 / 11,250,000,000 (95.91% sold)\nWith less than 5% of this stage’s allocation left, demand is pushing the project toward its next price increase. Early investors are positioning ahead of the token’s planned listing on two top-tier centralized exchanges, with hints at targeting the biggest exchange in the world post-launch.\nWhy LILPEPE Could Outpace DOGE and SHIB in 2025\nDOGE and SHIB have established themselves as meme coin leaders, but their massive market caps make 100x returns much harder to achieve. In contrast, LILPEPE’s low entry price, small initial market cap, and strong fundamentals give it far more upside potential.\nKey reasons LILPEPE could dominate this cycle:\n1. First-mover advantage as a Layer-2 chain built for meme coins.\n2. Utility + Hype — combining meme appeal with real blockchain infrastructure.\n3. Top-tier security validated by CertiK.\n4. High community engagement through giveaways and presale events.\n5. Exchange-ready with confirmed CEX listings at launch.\nIf meme coin market conditions mirror past bull runs, LILPEPE’s fundamentals could make it the cycle’s breakout star, like SHIB was in 2021 and BONK in late 2023.\nThe Bottom Line\nWhile both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have the potential for short-term price spikes, their price growth potential is not as promising as that of up-and-coming projects. Little Pepe is already +80% in its presale. Perhaps the next great meme coin will derive from new innovators rather than seasoned veterans. With its CertiK-audited smart contracts, Layer-2 blockchain vision, and fast-selling presale, LILPEPE has the right mix of hype, utility, and security to capture the spotlight in 2025. The window to get in early on Little Pepe is closing fast for investors looking for outsized returns in the meme coin market.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Dogecoin (DOGE) steals the spotlight as a prime altcoin to show recovery after a double-digit gain last week. Experts have voiced a bullish Dogecoin price prediction that can yield gains of up to 260% in the upcoming weeks. This news is likely to encourage investors to acquire DOGE tokens at lower entry points.\nMeanwhile, another AI-based investment platform, Unilabs Finance (UNIL), has secured the spotlight as the brightest star for memecoin investors. As the project grows, experts predict that Elon Musk can soon back this revolutionary platform, pumping it 12,650% like he helped Dogecoin skyrocket in 2021.\nDogecoin Price Prediction: Experts Voice 260% Rally to $0.65\nThe 260% Dogecoin price prediction has sparked optimism and hope among the memecoin holders. With a weekly surge of 15% due to the Russia-Ukraine war and trade wars between India and the US, DOGE memecoin is poised for a bullish breakout as buyers eye low entry points to secure spots in the next price pump.\nThe market sentiment is heating up as the bullish sentiment has crossed 85% on CMC. Though the risks exist for a pullback if the political crisis worsens, the monthly potential of the DOGE memecoin stays strong. Experts have set targets on the $0.6533 support level after a double bottom formation at $0.2140.\nWhy DOGE Traders Pump Investments Into Unilabs Presale\nDOGE experts are observed supporting Unilabs as the next prime altcoin to buy for securing gains like Dogecoin in 2021. The platform is known for its Memecoin Identification Tool, which allows high-risk and high-volume traders to hunt early opportunities and maximize profitability through precision trading.\nMoreover, the platform also searches for newly launched memecoins that have the potential to skyrocket due to strong fundamentals and development teams. This makes DOGE experts believe that there is a chance that Elon Musk can announce support for the meme-friendly platform to pump it like he did for DOGE in 2021.\nMeme-Friendly Unilabs Finance Tops Charts With AI-Platform News\nUnilabs Finance (UNIL) is promoted globally for its revolutionary AI-powered platform that manages hedge fund and retail investments with precision and cutting-edge analytical tools. The platform has secured a ground-breaking $12.2 million in stage 6 of the public presale and has sold 1,630 million tokens to 10,000+ users.\nFurthermore, its smart tools like AI Market Pulse and Early Access Scoring System allow hunting for new opportunities in diverse markets, including BTC, stocks, equities, real-world assets, and mining ventures. What makes Unilabs Finance unique is its attention towards passive income for its users through staking, platform fees, and governance.\nOne significant achievement for Unilabs is that it is managing $31 million in assets before its official launch. This shows that investors see a clear trajectory of the platform on top, rushing to buy UNIL tokens at just $0.009. Experts see this as the best time to buy UNIL tokens before the mainnet listing and the upcoming 12,000% pump for early buyers.\nConclusion: Why Buying Unilabs Is Like Acquiring DOGE in 2021\nDOGE price gears up for a bullish rebound in the upcoming weeks, as many experts have voiced a 260% Dogecoin price prediction. However, Unilabs steals the spotlight as the next-generation investment platform liked by meme traders for meme coin-friendly features and advanced analytics for high-risk traders.\nWith expectations of Elon Musk backing this platform like Dogecoin, investors are taking early positions in its presale before the price skyrockets to $0.1 after the mainnet launch announcement.\nLearn more:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Husky Inu (HINU) registered the latest price jump of its pre-launch phase over the weekend, rising from $0.00019519 to $0.00019576. The project’s next price increase will see the value of the token rise to $0.00019633.\nThe project’s regular price increases are part of its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. It also reached a major fundraising milestone on July 25, crossing the $850,000 milestone.\nHusky Inu is also closing in on a major fundraising milestone and has raised $872,976 so far.\nHusky Inu (HINU) Token Value Reaches $0.00019576\nHusky Inu (HINU) has registered its latest price increase, rising from $0.00019519 to $0.00019576. The project’s regular price increases are part of its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The pre-launch phase aims to empower the fledgling Husky Inu community, continuing its fundraising efforts as its launch date draws closer. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion.\nHusky Inu adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, allowing it to raise the HINU token’s value every two days. This has been instrumental in the project’s fundraising efforts, helping it cross key fundraising milestones. It has also helped Husky Inu raise funds while maintaining a favorable price for its fledgling community, rewarding early adopters of the project while promoting transparent growth.\nAnother Milestone Within Reach\nHusky Inu (HINU) is also closing in on its latest fundraising milestone. The project has raised $872,976 so far, and could cross the $900,000 mark this month. The project’s presale and pre-launch phases have allowed it to cross several key fundraising milestones. The project adopted a dynamic and progressive pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, increasing the price of the HINU token every two days. This has allowed the project to raise funds quickly while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering its growing community. Thanks to this dynamic strategy, Husky Inu crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached its latest milestone in record time, crossing $850,000 on July 25.\nIntroducing SwapCrypto.com\nLast week, Husky Inu created waves in the memecoin ecosystem by announcing the launch of SwapCrypto.com, the project’s very own cryptocurrency exchange. The launch was a pivotal moment for the project, reinforcing its commitment to providing value to its nascent user base and building real-world utility. Unlike other memecoins that depend on hype and speculation, Husky Inu is dedicated to its utility and long-term vision. Instead of becoming just another memecoin, it is creating the infrastructure to give its community the tools to engage with digital finance. SwapCrypto.com enhances Husky Inu’s growing ecosystem and solidifies its position in an increasingly competitive DeFi ecosystem.\nVisit the following links for more information on Husky Inu:\n-\nWebsite: Husky Inu Official Website\n-\nTwitter: Husky Inu Twitter\n-\nTelegram: Husky Inu Telegram\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "The crypto market’s weekend rally extended into Monday as Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies traded in bullish territory. The flagship cryptocurrency’s price action turned bullish on Sunday, surging past a crucial resistance level and breaking past $120,000 early on Monday.\nThe rally can be attributed to the convergence of several bullish catalysts, including surging ETF inflows, expectations of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve, and a bullish flag pattern. BTC is up nearly 3% over the past 24 hours, trading around $121,655 after reaching an intraday high of $121,981.\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) broke the $4,000 barrier over the weekend, with analysts expecting a new all-time high. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has rallied, rising nearly 23% last week, and is up almost 2% in the past 24 hours, trading around $4,300. Ripple (XRP) is marginally up while Solana (SOL) reclaimed $180 over the weekend and is trading around $185, with buyers in control. Cardano (ADA) is marginally up, while Chainlink (LINK) is up almost 4%, trading around $22. Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable increases. However, Toncoin (TON) and Stellar (XLM) defined market trends and traded in the red.\nWhite House Crypto Advisor Bo Hines Resigns\nBo Hines, head of President Donald Trump’s Council of Advisors on Digital Assets, has resigned from his role to return to the private sector. Hines played a crucial role in American crypto regulation, with the sudden and unexpected departure fueling speculations about the reasons behind his resignation. Hines confirmed his resignation through a post on X, and called his experience of working with President Trump and Crypto Czar David Sacks “the honor of a lifetime.” Hines praised their efforts in making the US the “crypto capital of the world” and pledged to support the industry from the private sector.\n“Serving in President Trump’s administration and working alongside our brilliant AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks as Executive Director of the White House Crypto Council has been the honor of a lifetime. Together, we have positioned America as the crypto capital of the world. I’m deeply grateful to the industry for its unwavering support.”\nHines did not give any specific reasons for stepping down, while reactions from the community ranged from admiration to surprise. Some sources speculated that a lucrative private sector opportunity could have prompted Hines to resign.\nCrypto Debanking Is Still Happening\nSeveral crypto firms are still facing account closures and denial of banking services under the pretext of de-risking. The crypto community believes the ongoing debanking policy, called “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” is a policy-driven effort to undermine and suppress the growth of digital assets. The crypto industry believed debanking would become a thing of the past following President Trump’s election victory. Trump campaigned on the promise of a crypto-friendly administration, and several early policy moves indicated a friendly attitude towards crypto compared to the previous administration. This led many to believe restrictions on crypto would gradually ease.\nHowever, recent incidents suggest crypto debanking is still occurring. Andreessen Horowitz partner Alex Rampell warned that banks were squeezing crypto and fintech apps, calling it “Operation Chokepoint 3.0.” According to Rampell, banks are hiking fees to access account data or transfer funds to crypto platforms like Robinhood and Coinbase. Alex Konanykhin, CEO of Unicoin, echoed these concerns, adding that US banks were closing accounts for crypto firms without explanation. Konanykhin stated,\n“We know about it first-hand, as Unicoin and its subsidiaries have been de-banked, without explanations, by several banks.”\nVitalik Buterin Reclaims On-Chain Billionaire Status\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has reclaimed his on-chain billionaire status after ETH surged past the $4,000 mark over the weekend. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency last reached this level over eight months ago. Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham stated,\n“BREAKING: VITALIK BUTERIN IS NOW AN ON-CHAIN BILLIONAIRE AGAIN.”\nButerin’s portfolio is valued at $1.04 billion and holds 240,042 ETH, along with stakes in several other digital assets, including Aave Ethereum (AETHWETH), WhiteRock (WHITE), Moo Deng (MOODENG), and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).\nWorld Liberty Financial Exploring Public Company To Hold WLFI\nWorld Liberty Financial is exploring the creation of a publicly-traded company to hold its WLFI tokens. The company is looking to raise roughly $1.5 billion for the venture. According to reports, the deal's structure is yet to be finalized. However, World Liberty Financial has already reached out to major investors in technology and crypto. The move puts World Liberty Financial among a growing list of publicly-listed crypto treasury companies. Treasury companies have raised around $79 billion in 2025 for Bitcoin (BTC) purchases alone.\nAccording to reports, the new treasury vehicle will be a shell company listed on the Nasdaq. World Liberty Financial’s approach mirrors Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which reinvented itself as a Bitcoin (BTC) holding company. Strategy has amassed over $72 billion in BTC and has reached a market cap of $113 billion.\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\nBitcoin (BTC) has started the week on a bullish note as the flagship cryptocurrency surged past the $120,000 mark. Price action stalled on Friday when BTC fell 0.83% and slipped below $116,000 on Saturday, settling at $115,957. However, with positive macroeconomic developments, surging ETF inflows, and growing optimism about a rate cut, the price recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 3% to cross $119,000. Bullish sentiment has persisted during the ongoing session, with the price up over 2%, trading around $122,000. Analysts believe BTC could set a new all-time high if buyers maintain positive momentum.\nAnalysts believe a move past $120,000 was only a matter of time, and prices could reach a new all-time high if positive momentum persists. BTC’s latest rally is attributed to a bullish executive order in Washington and rising inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Henrik Andersson, Chief Investment Officer at Apollo Crypto, believes a rally was long overdue following a period of consolidation.\n“In our view, it was just a matter of time before it would break up. In this time, we have seen positive ETF flows, more treasury companies buying Bitcoin, and a number of positive developments coming out of the White House. Bitcoin has been stuck in a low-volatility band between $115,000 and $120,000 despite all the good news.”\nAndersson credited President Trump’s executive order allowing crypto in 401(k) retirement accounts as the key driver of the rally. The executive order could see around $9 trillion in capital flow into BTC and the broader crypto industry. Michael Saylor’s announcement about an impending BTC buy has also boosted investor sentiment. Saylor hinted that Strategy is preparing to add to its BTC stash this week, stating,\n“If you don’t stop buying Bitcoin, you won’t stop making Money.”\nBitcoin ETFs continued to see inflows, purchasing $773 million worth of BTC to close the previous week. Despite the flagship cryptocurrency’s impressive rally, on-chain data shows that sentiment isn’t overheated, indicating there is room for further price increases. The Fear & Greed Index is still in the “Greed” zone, at 70 out of 100.\nAnalysts believe BTC could reach a new all-time high this week as a bullish flag pattern activates. A bullish flag pattern often precedes a major breakout. The pattern began on July 22, bottoming out below $100,000 and peaking at an all-time high of $123,091. Investors are also bullish about a possible rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. Odds of a rate cut soared after the US released weak nonfarm payroll data earlier this month.\nBTC registered a sharp decline on Friday (August 1), dropping over 2% and settling at $113,365. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 0.67% and settled at $112,601. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Sunday, rising 1.52% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,307. The price continued pushing higher on Monday, registering a 0.69% increase and settling at $115,097. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $112,707 on Tuesday as selling pressure returned. It rebounded from this level to reclaim $114,000 and settled at $114,139, ultimately dropping 0.83%. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.80% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,047.\nSource: TradingView\nBullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $117,000 and settle at $117,483. Despite the positive sentiment, the price lost momentum on Friday, dropping nearly 1% to $116,513. Sellers retained control on Saturday as BTC fell 0.48% and settled at $115,957. Bullish sentiment returned on Sunday as BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $119,000 and settle at $119,046. The current session sees BTC up almost 2%, trading around $121,100 after reaching an intraday high of $122,190.\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\nEthereum (ETH) raced past the $4,000 level, retaking it after eight months as bullish sentiment around the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency intensified. ETH has been on an upward trajectory since last weekend, rebounding from an intraday low of $3,372. ETH’s stellar recovery prompted BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes to buy back into the asset only a week after selling 2,373 ETH for $8.32 million. Hayes moved $10.5 million in USDC across several transactions, redirecting it towards purchasing ETH.\nHayes had warned of a possible drop in BTC and ETH prices last week, thanks to mounting macroeconomic pressures. The BitMEX founder cited renewed tariff fears following weak nonfarm payrolls numbers, adding that sluggish growth could push BTC and ETH towards $100,000 and $3,000, respectively.\nETH has surged nearly 24% this week, reaching an intraday high of $4,347 earlier today. According to one analyst, the price could surge to $4,000 as it breaks out of its current pattern. The analyst stated that ETH had been accumulating for months and steadily absorbing selling pressure. According to the Wyckoff theory, such a phase generally ends with a decisive breakout. Meanwhile, analysts Crypto Rover and Titan of Crypto believe ETH is breaking above the upper trendline of a multi-year symmetrical triangle and suggested it could climb to $8,000 in the coming months.\nInstitutional interest in ETH has also surged since July, with institutions and whales scooping up over 1,032 million ETH worth $4.7 billion through exchanges and institutional trading platforms.\n“In the month since July 10, more than 1.035 million ETH ($4.167 billion) have been hoarded by multiple unknown whales/institutions through channels such as exchanges or institutional business platforms. The price of ETH also rose from $2,600 to $4,000 in this month, a 45% increase.”\nETH started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 6% and settling at $3,488. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 3%, slipping below $3,400 to $3,393. ETH recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to reclaim $3,500. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price rallied, rising over 6% to cross $3,700 and settle at $3,721. ETH was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping nearly 3% to $3,612. It rebounded on Wednesday, rising over 2% and settling at $3,685.\nSource: TradingView\nBullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH rose over 6% to reclaim $3,900 and settle at $3,911. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency crossed the $4,000 mark on Friday, rising 2.52% and settling at $4,010. ETH rallied on Saturday, rising over 6% to cross $4,200 and settle at $4,262. Despite the overwhelming positive sentiment, ETH lost momentum on Sunday, registering a marginal drop and settling at $4,251. The current session sees ETH up nearly 1%, trading around $4,280.\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\nSolana (SOL) continued pushing higher over the weekend, crossing $180 as buyers maintained control. The altcoin has been steadily rising since last week as institutional interest around the asset grows. SOL is up over 12% in the past week, breaking out of key technical structures. Analysts predict a push towards $200 this week if buyers maintain control. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified a textbook “cup and handle” pattern and predicted a 600% increase from current levels. However, more conservative estimates predict SOL will test its all-time high of $260. Whether buyers have the strength to take the price beyond this level remains to be seen. Institutional interest in SOL has also ramped up, with Upexi, DeFi Developments Corp, SOL Strategies, and Torrent Capital acquiring over 3.5 million SOL, marking one of the strongest accumulation waves in SOL’s history.\nSOL started the previous weekend with a sharp drop, falling nearly 6% on Friday and settling at $162. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell 2.57%, slipping below $160 and settling at $158. It recovered on Sunday, rising over 2% to reclaim $160 and settle at $162. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as SOL rallied, rising nearly 5% to settle at $169. The price was back in bearish territory on Tuesday, falling 3% to $164. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as SOL rose 2.50% and settled at $168.\nSource: TradingView\nBullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as SOL rallied, rising over 4% to cross $170 and settle at $175.

By selectively acquiring low-cost power operations, Cango aims to enhance operational efficiency, cost discipline, and long-term financial resilience—while establishing the foundation for a more advanced energy strategy in the future.\nThe facility has hosted Cango's miners under a third-party hosting agreement. Following this acquisition, Cango will allocate 30 MW to its self-mining operations and 20 MW to hosting services for third-party clients. Fully equipped with essential mining infrastructure, accommodation, and support facilities, the facility enables a seamless transition for Cango. With this acquisition, Cango will begin developing in-house operational expertise required for managing self-owned mining sites, strengthening the Company's technical and managerial foundation. As this infrastructure is put in place, Cango is also laying the strategic groundwork for a gradual pivot towards supplying energy for high-performance computing (HPC) applications, further expanding the long-term potential of its sites beyond Bitcoin mining while leveraging operational and technical expertise developed in-house.\nMr. Peng Yu, CEO of Cango, said, \"This acquisition is a critical milestone and marks the beginning of our vertical integration as we transition towards a more diversified and resilient portfolio of Bitcoin mining sites and energy infrastructure.

        "text": "As investors scan the market for the best crypto to buy now, a new contender has ignited speculation: Layer Brett ($LBRETT). Unlike legacy meme coins, $LBRETT positions itself as a next-generation Layer 2 project, aiming to combine the explosive meme appeal of Brett (original) with technical ambitions that seek to rival and surpass both Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2025. With its Layer 2 foundation and the promise of a 10 billion max supply (mirroring current meme coin economics), $LBRETT is being touted as a candidate for 150x growth—potentially eclipsing the combined gains of Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin.\n$LBRETT vs. Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE): Utility, Hype, and Upside\nUtility and Ecosystem\nSolana (SOL) has long been celebrated for high throughput (50,000+ TPS) and low transaction fees, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is renowned for its viral, community-driven appeal. $LBRETT, by contrast, enters the narrative as a Layer 2 platform, promising ultra-low gas fees and near-instant transactions—paralleling the DeFi and meme coin trends that dominate “best crypto to buy now” searches. However, unlike Solana (SOL), whose technical credentials are independently validated, $LBRETT’s exact throughput and fee metrics remain unverified to date.\nTokenomics and Growth Potential\n$LBRETT’s presale mirrors top-tier projects, with a $0.004 price and a 10B max supply—implying a fully diluted valuation (FDV) near $180 million. This sets the stage for substantial upside if the token captures even a fraction of the attention given to Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin, both of which command multi-billion-dollar market caps in 2025. While Dogecoin (DOGE) is praised for its accessibility and low fees, $LBRETT aspires to deliver similar low-cost transfers but with additional value capture through staking and potential Layer 2 utility.\nStaking, Accessibility, and Core Value Alignment\nStaking and Rewards\nWhile specific $LBRETT lockup details are undisclosed, typical Layer 2 protocols offer short lockups (7–30 days), matching the flexible, user-first ethos that has propelled Solana (SOL) and DOGE adoption. With a staking APY of 20,000%+ for early birds, Layer Brett is top of the tree. $LBRETT’s support for ETH, USDT, BNB, Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin payments, as well as MetaMask and Trust Wallet compatibility, further underscores its ambition to match or exceed the inclusive ecosystem of its rivals.\nCommunity and “Best Crypto To Buy Now” Momentum\nThe meme-powered branding and Layer 2 positioning of $LBRETT tap directly into the “best crypto to buy now” trend. Layer Brett aims to capture the same viral energy that propelled Dogecoin and the stout developer backing that fuels Solana (SOL). In spite of $LBRETT being in its early stages of presale, the community-driven narrative and speculative upside have attracted significant attention in social channels.\nThe Verdict: Will Layer Brett Outperform Solana and Dogecoin?\nBoth Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) remain foundational players in the crypto landscape. But $LBRETT’s blend of meme coin hype and Layer 2 technology positions it as a high-risk, high-reward candidate for outsized gains in 2025. Investors seeking the best crypto to buy now may find $LBRETT’s projected 150x potential compelling, not to mention the 20,000%+ APY for the earliest investors, the $1 million giveaway and the no KYC policy!\nGrab Layer Brett at $0.004 before the climb to $0.0042—lock in your position while it lasts.\nWebsite: https://layerbrett.com\nTelegram: https://t.me/layerbrett\nX: (1) Layer Brett (@LayerBrett) / X\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "2025 has seen fierce competition among meme coins in the cryptocurrency market, with PEPE holding on as one of the top Ethereum-based tokens. But the emergence of Layer Brett ($LBRETT) brings a formidable challenger, prompting speculation about a potential shift in the meme coin hierarchy. This analysis examines the latest Pepe coin price data, performance metrics, and narrative catalysts, while directly comparing PEPE to $LBRETT, and referencing other major competitors: Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Bonk, and Brett Original.\nPEPE: Status, Price Performance & Catalysts\nAs of August 9, 2025, the PEPE coin price was approximately $0.00001228, with a notable 24-hour increase of 9.28% and a 7-day gain of around 9.30%. In the past 12 months, PEPE has achieved an impressive 43.73% growth, resulting in a market cap fluctuating between $5.15 billion and $5.19 billion. The circulating and max supply remain fixed at 420.69 trillion coins. PEPE is consistently ranked between #36 and #38 by market cap on major platforms, situating it among the elite Ethereum meme coins.\nRecent catalysts, such as Bitnile’s acceptance of PEPE for payments, robust social media momentum, and speculative projections of a $100 billion market cap, have fueled bullish sentiment assisting the PEPE coin price. The technical landscape is currently supported by a Fear & Greed index of 74 (“Greed”), and whale accumulation is reportedly on the rise. High liquidity and exchange activity further underscore PEPE’s ongoing relevance among meme tokens.\n$LBRETT: Ethereum Layer 2 Ambitions and Utility\nLayer Brett ($LBRETT) positions itself as a next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 meme coin, aiming to combine meme culture with scalable utility. Its max supply is confirmed at 10 billion tokens, with its presale having raised $150,000+ thus far. $LBRETT’s ecosystem is designed to incorporate advanced utility and gamified staking, with APY at 20,000% for early investors. Promotional narratives position $LBRETT as a contender for the “next 100x meme coin” and a potential disruptor of PEPE’s dominance.\nEthereum L1 fees remain volatile, often exceeding $10-$20 during peak congestion, while Layer 2 solutions like $LBRETT aim to deliver lower costs. Community engagement for $LBRETT is rising, but it is still less established than PEPE, which maintains high visibility and active social sentiment.\nComparative Analysis: PEPE vs. $LBRETT and Key Meme Coin Competitors\nPEPE currently holds a decisive lead in both market cap and public recognition. $LBRETT though, is actively marketed as a serious upstart within the Ethereum meme coin ecosystem. It seems as though the new challenger $LBRETT’s strategic positioning as an Ethereum Layer 2 project with a capped supply offers a differentiated narrative.\nCompetitor coins like Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Bonk, and Brett Original continue to shape the meme coin landscape. PEPE’s established track record and liquidity make it the current standard, but the speculative energy around $LBRETT and its Layer 2 ambitions reflect the broader market trends toward scalability, lower fees, and novel staking mechanisms.\nConclusion: Is PEPE’s Reign Threatened?\nEven with its ongoing bullish momentum and strong market cap, PEPE faces growing competition from $LBRETT and other meme coins. $LBRETT’s strategic focus on Ethereum Layer 2 scalability, capped supply, and meme utility could challenge PEPE’s status as Ethereum’s #1 meme coin as ecosystem development progresses. Layer Brett’s $1 million giveaway is accelerating community traction and its no KYC policy is attracting attention. For now, PEPE remains the benchmark, but the evolving landscape signals a dynamic contest for meme coin supremacy.\nSecure $LBRETT early—position for tomorrow’s gains.\nWebsite: https://layerbrett.com\nTelegram: https://t.me/layerbrett\nX: (1) Layer Brett (@LayerBrett) / X\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Bitcoin is catching eyes with bold price targets, but some experts are watching a rising star called XYZVerse. Its potential returns might leave even Bitcoin in the dust, according to fresh analysis. The question now: could XYZVerse really deliver gains far beyond what is expected from Bitcoin’s next move? Readers may find the answer surprising.\nUndervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX\nXYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase.\nSo far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005.\nAt the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount.\nFollowing the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch.\nBorn for Fighters, Built for Champions\nXYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin.\nCentral to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell.\nCommunity-First Vibes\nIn XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record.\nBacked by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary.\nAirdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits\nBitcoin’s Next Act: Scarce Coins, Big Dreams\nBitcoin is the first online coin. It was launched in 2009 by the hidden coder Satoshi Nakamoto. Instead of paper bills, it lives on a shared digital record kept by many computers. No single bank controls it. People who move coins send signed messages to this record. Helpers called miners check each message by solving hard math riddles. The system then gives fresh coins to the fastest solver. A built-in rule cuts that reward in half about every four years, and only 21 million coins will ever exist. This keeps new supply tight.\nMany fans call Bitcoin “digital gold.” Big funds now add it to their mix, and some countries treat it like property. The last reward cut happened in 2020 and sparked a strong rally. Another cut is due soon, and traders are watching. Rival coins offer faster moves or fancy apps, yet none match Bitcoin’s age, size, or name power. If demand stays steady while new supply falls, the price could climb again. Still, swings are sharp, so timing matters. For long-term holders who believe in scarce digital money, this cycle may look tempting.\nConclusion\nBTC, ETH, SOL, PEPE, and MOG are strong coins with proven track records. However, XYZ, the first all-sport memecoin, stands out for its unique approach, community focus, and ambitious growth targets.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Bitcoin has broken out from its bull flag and is surging up towards the all-time high at $123,200. Currently at a price of around $122,000, it probably won’t be long before the high is broken. Is $130,000 likely to be the next pitstop?\nIt’s been a while coming, but it does finally look like Bitcoin is on its way again. The king of the cryptocurrencies spent just short of 4 weeks inside a bull flag before breaking out and confirming the breakout on Sunday. Currently surging higher, Bitcoin has the formality of breaking past its all-time high and launching into price discovery once again.\nStrong $BTC breakout on 4-hour chart\nSource: TradingView\nLooking at the $BTC price on the short-term 4-hour chart it can be observed that the breakout is strong and as far as price action is concerned things appear to be going to plan for the bulls.\nHowever, the indicators at the bottom of the chart are signalling that the gas tank is starting to empty. That said, the Stochastic RSI indicators can probably continue as they have been doing since the price dropped to the low, while the RSI indicator still needs to climb above the last high at 85.21 in order to avoid bearish divergence.\nDaily RSI signals more upside price action\nSource: TradingView\nIn the daily time frame the RSI illustrates two key signals for the last two breakouts. Looking left to the previous bull flag it can be seen how the low in the RSI matched the low in the price action, and also how the breakout and confirmation of the descending trendline matched the initial surge in the price action.\nAs can be observed above, the same thing has now just taken place for this current bull flag. It might be expected that the indicator line travels back into the overbought territory like it did before, signalling more upside for the $BTC price action.\n$BTC embarks on its journey to $150,000\nSource: TradingView\nThe weekly chart reveals the inverse head and shoulders pattern that appears to be playing out nicely. The price broke through the neckline of the pattern, returned to confirm the breakout, and is now rising higher. The measured move for this pattern is pretty much exactly $150,000. $130,000 could just be the next pitstop on the way.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows how the indicator line is rising to meet the descending trendline once again. This would be a very good time for the indicator line to finally breach the downtrend. If it does so, expect a decent surge in the price action above.\nThat said, the indicator line will need to continue up and get above the last high at 88.40 in order to avoid bearish divergence.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "An early expert on Solana, who gained $12 million during the last bull run, has now shifted focus to XYZVerse. All attention is on this new project, as the investor seeks huge gains again. Many are curious about what makes XYZVerse so special that it could possibly deliver a hundredfold profit next.\nDemand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone\nXYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3.\nUnlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms.\nNotably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet.\nPrice Dynamics and Listing Plans\nDuring its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges.\nThe projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization.\nSo far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors.\nChampions Get Rewarded\nIn XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big.\nThe Road to Victory\nWith solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary.\nAirdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits\nSolana: The Fast Lane Coin Racing Ahead of the Pack\nSolana is a digital chain built for speed and scale. It hosts small apps called dapps, much like Ethereum and Cardano, yet moves data faster. Developers can pick from many coding styles, making building simple. At the heart sits SOL, the coin that keeps everything moving. People use it to pay for tasks, run custom tools, and earn rewards for supporting the network. Every tap of SOL adds power to the system, linking users, makers, and investors in one busy place.\nThe current market cycle favors projects with real use and clear speed gains. Solana ticks both boxes. Its single-layer design avoids the puzzle of side lanes and shards, so growth feels smooth. Daily activity keeps rising, showing demand for quick trades, games, and art tokens. While Ethereum stays the big name and Cardano eyes research depth, Solana offers a middle path of fast action and low fees. If you believe heavy traffic will shift to faster rails, SOL may look like an early ticket.\nConclusion\nSOL and other major coins remain strong choices, but XYZVerse (XYZ) leads as the first all-sport memecoin. Its blend of sports, memes, and strong community aims for standout growth in this bull run.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Bitcoin (BTC) broke out on Sunday and Monday has seen a continuation of the surge. What about the altcoins? Not many alts are matching Bitcoin’s performance right now. However, the signs are that an altcoin breakout is not far away.\nAltcoins approach breakout\nSource: TradingView\nThe Total2 chart tracks the combined market capitalization of all the cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin. The weekly chart is telling us that the altcoins are very close to either breaking out of a descending trendline that stretches all the way back to November 2021, or they will be rejected from it. The price action shows a series of higher lows, but in order to make a higher high the trendline will need to be broken.\nMoving down the chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also at a critical stage. It can be seen that if the indicator line is able to break through the descending trendline on the RSI, this would likely coincide with a breakout in the price action.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are pointing down again. However, as previously happened, the indicators could turn back around again. This would certainly provide a lot more upside price momentum.\nBitcoin dominance gets a bounce\nSource: TradingView\nBitcoin dominance (BTC.D) is obviously one of the first charts to refer to when checking out the chances of an altcoin surge. The above 12-hour chart shows that Bitcoin dominance fell out the bottom of the bear flag, but was then able to bounce from the ascending trendline that goes all the way back to November 2022, with extra help from the horizontal support at 60%.\nIt might appear that a crucial point has been reached. The bottom of the bear flag is combining with other horizontal resistance to perhaps put a halt to further Bitcoin dominance gains from the current price level.\nBitcoin dominance trendline is all-important for altcoin season\nSource: TradingView\nMoving out into the weekly time frame the importance of the ascending trendline can be understood. It can probably be safely said that an incredible altcoin season depends on whether Bitcoin dominance falls below the trendline, or whether it continues to bounce.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators have almost hit the floor before turning up again. If these indicators drag along the bottom for a period of time, this could be what the altcoin bulls are waiting for.\n$ETH to retest breakout and then go higher\nSource: TradingView\nEthereum (ETH) is the premier altcoin, and therefore if $ETH is successful, the rest of the altcoins will undoubtedly follow. The weekly chart for the $ETH price reveals the supremely important breakout of resistance levels that go back to 2021.\nThat said, it is likely that $ETH goes back to test this horizontal level as support, whether the price goes back to $4,100, or $4,000.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators will need to turn back around. As can be seen, this may already be starting to happen.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In April, the Group set a single-day trading record of $56 billion, with high client activity sustained across its global platforms.\nInvestor excitement peaked in July with the launch of the $MBG Utility Token on MultiBank.io, MEXC, Gate.io, and Uniswap. Since its debut on 22 July, $MBG has surged to roughly seven times its launch price, reflecting strong customer sentiment.\nThe $MBG token powers MultiBank’s four-pillar ecosystem:\n- MultiBank FX/CFDs: Traders can use $MBG for fee discounts and enhanced platform access, while introducing brokers and social traders may benefit from token-based rebates and loyalty tiers.\n- MEX Exchange (Institutional ECN): A hybrid FX and crypto ECN for emerging markets, where $MBG automates settlement, reduces counterparty risk, and enables smart contract-based margin and delivery versus payment (DvP).\n- MultiBank.io (crypto exchange): Regulated in the UAE, Australia, and Seychelles, the platform offers spot and leveraged trading. $MBG is used for trading fee discounts, launchpad access, staking, and token buy-in events.\n- MultiBank.io RWA: Built on Mavryk’s layer-1 blockchain, this arm follows a $3 billion real estate tokenization agreement with MAG Lifestyle Development. $MBG holders receive fee discounts, early project access, and benefit from revenue-linked token burns that gradually reduce circulating supply.\n“Delivering $209 in revenue in just six months highlights the effectiveness of our core businesses and the trust our clients place in us worldwide,” said Naser Taher, Founder and Chairman of MultiBank Group. “The subsequent growth of our $MBG Utility Token shows how our digital asset program can build on that performance and create further value for stakeholders.”\nWith more than two million users, licenses from 17 regulators worldwide, and an unblemished compliance track record since 2005, MultiBank Group is scaling its blockchain and risk infrastructure to accelerate digital asset adoption and DeFi participation worldwide.\nABOUT MULTIBANK GROUP\nMultiBank Group, established in California, USA in 2005, is a global leader in financial derivatives.

        "text": "Bitcoin forks have been popping up for years, often promising revolutionary changes but delivering only minor tweaks to the original code. Traders have learned to approach them with caution because most fail to add meaningful innovation. The market is now demanding projects that not only enhance security and scalability but also bring fresh mechanics that reward long-term participation.\nWhy Forks No Longer Excite the Market\nFork-based projects can generate short-term hype, yet they rarely manage to sustain momentum. Many rely on branding rather than delivering unique features that impact user returns or network utility. Investors are now shifting focus toward protocols with clear innovation in rewards, governance, and technical infrastructure. This is where Bitcoin Swift enters the conversation, not as a fork but as a fully engineered system built to evolve.\nBitcoin Swift: More Than Just Another Blockchain\nBitcoin Swift (BTC3) is a modular blockchain that combines high-level scalability with a reward system designed to grow user wealth from day one. Its Proof-of-Yield (PoY) architecture issues programmable staking rewards that adapt dynamically based on network conditions and environmental factors, setting it apart from static reward systems.\nThis adaptability is powered by AI integration across multiple layers of the protocol. AI oracles optimize energy efficiency, monitor clean power usage, and feed accurate real-time data into smart contracts. It is this combination of yield intelligence and scalability that is driving BTC3’s rising profile among crypto analysts.\nTechnical Advantages Driving Adoption\nBTC3’s ecosystem blends compliance readiness with advanced decentralized governance. Participants can engage in protocol decisions through a structure that uses decentralized identity verification and quadratic voting to ensure fairness.\n-\nAI Energy Efficiency: AI systems monitor carbon usage and reward sustainability, ensuring long-term operational viability.\n-\nGovernance Architecture: A multi-layer voting process includes AI risk assessment and DID-based reputation scoring, protecting against bad proposals.\nInfluencers have taken notice. A detailed review by Bull Run Angel highlights how BTC3’s technology could set new benchmarks for on-chain reward models.\nSecurity is another cornerstone of the project. Independent verifications like the Spywolf Audit and Solidproof Audit, along with KYC verification, confirm its commitment to safety. According to internal sources, a third security audit is already being arranged with a reputable blockchain firm.\nPresale Momentum and Market Buzz\nThe BTC3 presale is currently in Stage 4, with over 2,100 participants and more than $580,000 already raised. The price is set at $4, with a planned increase to $5 in Stage 5, and a confirmed launch price of $15. Stage 4 APY is 106%, and rewards are distributed at the end of each stage, meaning early participants enjoy active benefits from the start.\nThis presale stands out as one of the shortest in the industry, lasting only 64 days until September 18, 2025. Reports from insiders suggest that the team is in talks with major exchanges including MEXC, KuCoin, and LBank for listings, news that could further accelerate demand.\nBTC3’s liquidity is also among the highest at this stage compared to similar projects. This matters because strong liquidity ensures smoother trading, less slippage, and better price stability after launch.\nBTC3 Tokenomics and Community Growth\n-\nTotal Supply: 45 million BTC3\n-\n50% (22.5M) allocated to PoY rewards over 30 years\n-\n30% (13.5M) for presale participants with governance access\n-\n15% (6.75M) for liquidity\n-\n5% (2.25M) for team and reserves\nOn top of that, the referral program offers a 10% bonus for both referrer and referee, with no hidden terms or lockups, making network expansion as rewarding as holding the token.\nFinal Verdict\nBitcoin Swift is not trying to win by copying Bitcoin’s code. It is building a multi-layered protocol that combines AI-driven efficiency, adaptive rewards, and verifiable governance to create a comprehensive ecosystem. The PoY system directly aligns network growth with user wealth, while high liquidity, strong audits, and short presale timelines create conditions for rapid adoption.\nFor more information on Bitcoin Swift:\nWebsite: https://bitcoinswift.com\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "XRP struggles to push past the $3 barrier, leaving many watchers puzzled. At the same time, XYZVerse’s early sales numbers point to remarkable future growth. Investors are taking notice as today’s winners might not be tomorrow’s leaders. Big moves could be ahead, with one token grabbing the spotlight as another stands still.\nPrice Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible?\nXYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains.\nThe broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch.\nKey Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market:\n-\nStrong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal\n-\nDeflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure\n-\nLiquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch\n-\nCommunity incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding\nPrice Prediction for $XYZ\n-\nCurrent Presale Price: $0.005\n-\nProjected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates)\n-\nPotential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO)\n-\nLong-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings)\nBuy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains\nRealistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10?\nA 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on:\n-\nStrong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day.\n-\nSustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement.\n-\nMarket Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit.\nIs a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ?\nXYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable.\nInvest in $XYZ Before It Surges\nXRP: The Fast Coin Racing to Connect the World’s Money\nXRP is a digital coin that lives on the XRP Ledger. It was built by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz in 2012. The code makes each payment zip across the globe in seconds. Fees are tiny, and no bank account is needed. One hundred billion coins were made at birth. The team gave 80 billion to Ripple, the company driving growth. Ripple locked 55 billion of those coins in escrow and releases them slowly. The name came from “ripple credits,” a nod to smooth money waves.\nToday traders hunt for coins that move fast and cost little. Bitcoin is sturdy but slow. Ethereum is smart but fees soar when traffic spikes. New chains like Solana promise speed but have paused during overloads. XRP has run for years with few hiccups and settles in four seconds. This edge turns heads in the latest market cycle, where cross-border apps and micro-payments are hot. Fresh releases from escrow add supply, yet clear rules on timing calm shock.

        "text": "Cardano (ADA) remains one of the top smart contract platforms due to the loyalty of its community and its calm and research-oriented development style. Still, ADA has been unable to rival the price action of Solana and Ethereum. While it has strong fundamentals, the lack of significant updates has kept ADA from reaching new highs. Even with possible updates being worked on, ADA has struggled to gain further upward price action. According to ChatGPT and a growing wave of market sentiment, newer, more agile crypto projects are capturing investor attention. If you're planning your 2025 portfolio, here are the top five cryptos that could outshine ADA—starting with a rapidly rising meme coin that's building more than just hype.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) – The Meme Coin That’s Building a Blockchain\nLittle Pepe ($LILPEPE) is no ordinary meme coin—it’s leading a Layer 2 blockchain revolution, blending meme culture with high-speed, low-cost transactions. Selling at just $0.0018 in Stage 9, this token isn’t just about laughs and frog memes; it’s building infrastructure. $LILPEPE aims to be the world’s fastest and cheapest blockchain for memes, a dedicated L2 chain that eliminates sniper bots and supports a full-blown meme Launchpad. Unlike most meme coins that die off after the initial hype, Little Pepe is backed by anonymous crypto veterans with a track record of successful meme coin launches. Tokenomics include 0% tax, 13.5% staking rewards, and 30% chain reserves for future growth. Already listed on CoinMarketCap, the presale is advancing at warp speed. The project has plans for top-tier centralized exchange (CEX) listings and aims to become the largest exchange in the industry once it goes live. Little Pepe’s roadmap is a meme masterpiece—complete with phases like “Pregnancy,” “Birth,” and “Growth,” all of which it’s flown through ahead of schedule. With Stage 9 in progress, a $77,000 token giveaway in motion, and a community that memes as hard as it holds, Little Pepe has serious potential to deliver a 7800%+ return for early investors. Cardano may be solid, but Little Pepe is fun, fast, and ferociously focused on becoming the king of meme infrastructure in 2025.\nToncoin (TON) – Riding the Telegram Wave\nToncoin has been making waves as the native token of The Open Network, initially developed by the Telegram team. Telegram has begun integrating Toncoin into its application for payments and other activities involving tokens. With over 700 million users, TON is slowly moving towards mass adoption. The project's attention to rapid transaction speeds and scalability puts it ahead of its competitors in the payments and microservices industry. TON is already listed on major exchanges and climbing steadily on CoinMarketCap. With strong utility and a built-in user base via Telegram, TON is positioning itself as the sleeper hit of 2025.\nInjective (INJ) – DeFi Powerhouse with Real Growth\nInjective (INJ) is a protocol for decentralized finance (DeFi) that allows for rapid, safe, and completely decentralized trading. The Cosmos SDK supports INJ, resulting in low fees and high throughput for dApps and derivatives. With rising interest from institutions and adoption in the ecosystem, INJ has become a staple in many crypto portfolios. It has shifted from a niche to a necessary addition. Its innovative tokenomics include staking rewards and deflationary mechanics, solidifying INJ’s place as a long-term DeFi investment. While the DeFi space is still in its early days, INJ has stood out as one of the few projects that consistently keeps its commitments.\nRender (RNDR) – Powering the Future of AI and 3D\nRender Network is pioneering the decentralized GPU rendering space, offering scalable solutions for AI model training, 3D rendering, and metaverse development. With NVIDIA and Apple showing increased interest in spatial computing and AI-generated media, RNDR stands at a valuable intersection of AI and blockchain. RNDR’s use case is becoming increasingly relevant in an AI-driven world, and its listing on top exchanges ensures strong liquidity. As content creation shifts toward 3D and AR/VR, Render is building the infrastructure to power the metaverse.\nOptimism (OP) – Scaling Ethereum With Speed and Efficiency\nOptimism is a top contender in the Ethereum Layer 2 race. Designed to reduce gas fees and increase throughput dramatically, Optimism uses optimistic rollups to process transactions faster and cheaper. It’s already supporting major DeFi projects and has received endorsements from key Ethereum contributors. As Ethereum continues its transition to full scalability, OP is one of the best-positioned tokens to benefit. For investors looking at long-term L2 dominance, Optimism remains a must-watch.\nConclusion: ADA’s Not Dead, But It’s Being Outpaced\nAlthough Cardano is still progressing, it’s evident that newer and more focused projects are getting all the attention. From Little Pepe’s meme-fueled Layer 2 chain to Toncoin’s Telegram integration and Render’s role in the AI economy, these five tokens offer strong narratives and absolute momentum. In 2025, the crypto market will reward agility, innovation, and community—and these tokens are checking all the boxes.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of a significant rally, with analysts eyeing a potential surge to $2. However, amidst the hype surrounding DOGE, a cheaper meme coin priced below $0.004 is quietly gaining traction, with the potential to deliver massive returns, outshine DOGE, and offer investors a rare opportunity to achieve millionaire status.\nDogecoin (DOGE) Bulls Eye the $2 Mark\nDogecoin has reentered the spotlight. Technical analysis is flashing bullish signals, especially following a double bottom formation and a confirmed breakout above the $0.25 resistance. Whales are quietly accumulating again, with over 200 million DOGE tokens swapped in recent days, implying the biggest wallets are lining up for a serious breakout. With the mood swinging positive, analysts are eyeing a potential climb to $2 by the end of 2025. The optimism is high, but those looking for higher upside potential may want to turn their attention to a rising competitor priced below half a cent.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin Under $0.004 with Millionaire Potential\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) is making serious waves in the meme coin space. Built as a Layer 2 blockchain focused on speed, affordability, and meme culture, it’s quickly separating itself from the sea of low-effort meme tokens. With a name that draws from crypto's rich meme heritage and a Layer 2 infrastructure that combines fun with functionality, LILPEPE is more than just another joke coin. It’s gaining traction where it counts: community growth, presale success, and early market exposure.\nPresale Momentum Signals Explosive Potential\nLILPEPE’s presale has been nothing short of impressive. Stage 8 sold out faster than anticipated, raising $13.775 million. Now in Stage 9 at $0.0018, the token has seen an 80% increase since its presale began, already rewarding early participants. More than 10.72 billion tokens have been sold, and listings are starting to appear, including on CoinMarketCap, giving the project early credibility in the broader crypto space. Community has always been at the heart of meme coins, and LILPEPE is no exception. To celebrate the presale’s success, the team has launched a $777,000 giveaway. Over 181,500 entries have been recorded so far, with 10 lucky winners set to receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens each.\nThe Token to Make You a Millionaire\nThe low entry price, well under $0.004, positions LILPEPE as a standout opportunity. Analysts project gains of up to 2,500x, which would turn a $1,000 investment into a massive $2.5 million. Such predictions, while bold, are fueling even more interest from investors hunting for the next big winner. What sets LILPEPE apart is the team and advisory group quietly behind it. While most names remain anonymous, many have proven track records of success with some of the top meme tokens in the market. This level of behind-the-scenes experience gives LILPEPE a major edge. Meme coins may be fun, but serious market players know success requires strategy and execution. With the right people involved, LILPEPE looks primed for a major breakout.\nLooking Ahead: A Roadmap Built for Momentum\nLittle Pepe isn’t standing still. With each step forward, the coin continues to gain attention from both casual investors and more seasoned crypto holders. While DOGE may be eyeing a solid 8x return if it hits $2, LILPEPE presents a different kind of opportunity: exponential gains from a fraction-of-a-cent entry point. That kind of upside is what turns small investments into massive wins.\nFinal Thoughts\nDogecoin’s rally toward $2 is exciting, no doubt. But the spotlight is starting to shift toward fresh contenders that combine viral potential with early-stage access. Little Pepe (LILPEPE), priced under $0.004, is catching fire with a unique mix of meme appeal, blockchain capability, and strong community backing. With over $13.7 million already raised, a growing user base, and industry veterans backing the project, LILPEPE is more than just hype; it’s a serious contender in the next meme coin wave. The current price window might not last long. For those searching for the meme coin with millionaire-making potential, Little Pepe could be the one.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/cold-wallets-3423-roi-attracts-millions-to-presale-while-solana-cardano-price-eyes-a-dip",
        "text": "Solana’s (SOL) price update shows the altcoin locked in a descending triangle, threatening a further 10% slide if $160 support cracks. Cardano’s (ADA) price drop risk is even sharper, with technicals hinting at a potential 25% loss toward $0.53 as bearish sentiment builds.\nWhile both projects wrestle with near-term selling pressure, Cold Wallet(CWT) is taking the opposite path, growing before launch. Its $270M Plus Wallet acquisition instantly onboarded 2M+ users, while a presale at Stage 17 and $0.00998 per token still offers a potential 3,423% ROI to launch. In this market, the token flipping gas fees into rewards looks like the smartest bet.\nSolana Faces Key Support Test as 10% Price Drop Looms\nSolana’s price is showing weakness below its June high, forming a descending triangle; a pattern often signaling further drops. Right now, SOL is around $163, teetering just above its $160 support level with bearish indicators building. If it slips past this foundation, it could slide toward $153 in the near term. On‑chain data shows a net outflow of $18.6 million from SOL spot markets, hinting at caution among larger holders.\nStill, dips can serve as entry points when buying pressure returns. Lower prices may offer a chance to accumulate SOL before any recovery. Watch for renewed inflows, a rebound from support, or a break above $166. Those signs could signal that Solana might be preparing for its next move upward.\nCardano Faces a Possible 25% Drop\nCardano (ADA) is showing weakness after failing to hold above $0.74, with analysts warning it could slide toward $0.53. On-chain data shows a decline in tokens moving off exchanges, signaling reduced investor confidence. Over 50% of traders are holding short positions, adding to bearish pressure.\nTechnical signals such as the MACD and on-balance volume are trending lower, reflecting fading momentum. While this setup points to a potential 25% fall, it may also create a lower entry point for long-term buyers. Investors should watch for a shift in volume or a price rebound from key support levels before committing.\nThe next move will likely depend on whether buyers can regain control or sellers push ADA into deeper losses.\nCold Wallet’s $270M Deal Just Changed the Game for Web3 Wallets\nCold Wallet’s $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet is more than just a big number; it is a calculated, pre-launch growth accelerator. This single move instantly brought over 2 million active users into its ecosystem, a scale that most blockchain projects take years to achieve after going live.\nBy absorbing Plus Wallet’s infrastructure, Cold Wallet supercharges its cashback rewards model from the first day of full operations. Every swap, gas payment, or transfer now becomes part of an earning loop instead of a cost sink, giving users a reason to choose it over MetaMask or Trust Wallet.\nUser frustration with traditional wallets’ complex interfaces is growing, and Cold Wallet is positioning itself as the simpler, more rewarding alternative. With $5.8 million already raised in its presale, Stage 17 pricing set at $0.00998, and the Stage 1 price having been just $0.007, the window for maximum ROI is already tightening.\nThe fixed launch price of $0.3517 represents a 3,423% return for those entering now, before more stages sell out and the upside shrinks. This acquisition is not just a headline; it compresses years of user acquisition, adoption, and utility growth into one decisive move.\nTakeaway\nThe Solana (SOL) price update warns of short-term weakness as on-chain flows turn negative. Cardano’s (ADA) price drop pressure underscores deeper structural hurdles, with over half of traders shorting the asset. Cold Wallet, in contrast, is building momentum with measurable, bankable growth; $5.8M raised, Stage 17 entry at $0.00998, and a fixed launch price of $0.3517.\nStage 1 buyers at $0.007 are already looking at a 4,923% ROI projection. With 2M+ users secured pre-launch, a real cashback utility model, and no reliance on speculative hype, Cold Wallet stands as the best-positioned play for outsized returns before broader market sentiment shifts.\nExplore Cold Wallet Now:\nPresale: https://purchase.coldwallet.com/\nWebsite: https://coldwallet.com/\nX: https://x.com/coldwalletapp\nTelegram: https://t.me/ColdWalletAppOfficial\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "As crypto markets enter a new phase of cautious optimism, a handful of standout projects are commanding outsized attention, and for good reason. From decentralized AI infrastructure to DeFi-powered cross-chain networks, the innovation hasn’t stopped. Among the names gaining massive traction are Render, Polygon, and Polkadot, each seeing renewed investor confidence and ecosystem momentum. But one project, BlockDAG, is emerging as a potential game-changer in the Layer 1 space.\nIts presale price of $0.0016 and explosive growth metrics make it a strong contender for the title of the top trending crypto right now. Backed by a real ecosystem, global visibility campaigns, and even a 10 BTC reward pool, BlockDAG isn’t just making noise, it’s executing.\nIn this spotlight, we break down what makes these four projects especially compelling this week, and why every crypto investor should be paying attention to the new leaders forming in the market narrative.\nBlockDAG: The $0.0016 Underdog That’s Dominating the Spotlight\nBlockDAG is quickly becoming the top trending crypto in the presale arena, and the numbers don’t lie. With a confirmed listing price of $0.05 later this year, early investors at the $0.0016 level are staring at a potential 30x ROI. But there’s more than hype behind those figures. BlockDAG has already raised $368 million, drawn over 200,000 holders, and built a real user base through its X1 mobile mining app, boasting 2.5 million downloads globally.\nThe project blends Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture with Proof-of-Work security to create a faster, more decentralized Layer 1 network. With 19,000 miners sold and a fully functional demo trading platform live, BlockDAG isn’t just promising performance, it’s demonstrating it. Meanwhile, its 10 BTC Auction Pool (worth over $1.1 million) offers presale buyers a chance to win Bitcoin, adding even more fuel to its momentum.\nWith its “GLOBAL LAUNCH release” happening on August 11 to draw global visibility, BlockDAG is primed to explode in awareness. While many Layer 1s launch with little more than a whitepaper, BlockDAG is entering the ring with users, capital, and a functioning ecosystem. It’s no surprise it’s considered the top trending crypto this quarter.\nRender: The “Eye” of the Decentralized AI Revolution\nIn the fast-emerging decentralized AI landscape, Render (RNDR) is carving out a unique and essential role. While projects like Bittensor act as the “brain,” orchestrating neural networks and AI models, Render is focused on being the “eye”, providing the GPU rendering power needed to visualize and train AI efficiently. According to a recent breakdown by Indodax Academy, this complementary function makes Render a vital layer of the growing AI-on-blockchain infrastructure.\nWhat sets Render apart is accessibility. Its tokenomics and use case, allowing users to rent or provide GPU rendering power, are straightforward, especially when compared to more complex AI protocols like TAO.\nThis clarity gives Render an adoption edge, especially among newcomers to the AI-crypto space. With enterprise demand for GPU processing continuing to surge, Render’s position becomes even more crucial. It’s no surprise it continues to feature on lists of top trending crypto picks for AI enthusiasts and utility-driven investors alike.\nPolygon: Liquidity, Cross-Chain Expansion, and a Technical Rebound\nPolygon (POL), formerly known as MATIC, is staying relevant by doing what it does best, building infrastructure and partnerships. This week, DeFi protocol Fluid announced an expansion of liquidity incentives across several chains, with Polygon high on the list alongside Arbitrum and Base. These developments are enhancing cross-chain liquidity, an increasingly critical function in the DeFi world.\nOn the technical front, POL has broken above both its 50-day EMA ($0.2149) and 200-day EMA ($0.2177), signaling potential bullish momentum. This move has caught the attention of analysts and traders alike, as POL’s price action begins to reflect renewed confidence in its roadmap.\nPolygon’s consistent presence in enterprise solutions, coupled with this technical strength, is why it continues to rank as a top trending crypto in infrastructure circles.\nPolkadot: Bullish Signals Amid Institutional Accumulation\nPolkadot (DOT) is another network gaining steam this week after posting a 4% rally from $3.65 to $3.80. What’s noteworthy is that this move appears to be driven not by retail speculation, but by institutional buying. With strong support forming near $3.68, DOT is showing resilience and potential for breakout behavior if momentum sustains.\nWhile Binance cautioned that DOT remains in consolidation, the signs of life are strong. As parachain auctions and cross-chain interoperability regain investor interest, Polkadot is once again finding itself in the conversation.\nIt may not have the flashy headlines of a presale token, but it continues to serve as a quiet giant in the background, often surfacing on top trending crypto watchlists for its long-term scalability play.\nConclusion\nIn a market where narratives change quickly, a handful of projects are rising above the noise to define the next cycle’s themes. Whether it's Render powering the AI frontier, Polygon leading DeFi’s cross-chain expansion, or Polkadot building sustainable long-term infrastructure, each is carving out critical niches.\nBut BlockDAG is the standout of the moment. With a live ecosystem, huge community, and once-in-a-cycle entry price of $0.0016, it’s dominating the charts and headlines. Add in a 30x ROI potential and one of the biggest presale prize pools ever (10 BTC), and it’s clear why BlockDAG is being called the top trending crypto this season.\nAs attention intensifies around the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release, now is the time to watch, and possibly act. These aren’t just projects; they’re pillars of what’s next in crypto. Miss them, and you might miss the momentum shift altogether.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Ozak AI has emerged as one of the most promising crypto presales of 2025, offering what some analysts are calling a once-in-a-cycle opportunity. Currently in Stage 4 of its presale, $OZ tokens are available at just $0.005 each. With over $1.6 million raised and more than 80 million tokens sold, early investor interest continues to accelerate—driven by projections that this low entry price could turn into massive profits once the token hits exchanges.\nAt the current rate, a $1,000 investment gives you 200,000 $OZ tokens. If the token launches at $1 as projected by some analysts, that investment could explode to $200,000, delivering a 200x gain—or a staggering 200,000% return. These numbers are attracting attention not just from small retail investors but also from early-stage crypto whales looking to enter before broader exposure sends prices soaring.\nAnalysts Are Already Calling It the Top Presale of 2025\nWhat separates Ozak AI from dozens of other presales is not just the token price or marketing—it’s the project’s compelling fundamentals. The platform is being built as a full-scale AI and blockchain integration hub, focusing on real-world tools like predictive analytics, DeFi automation, and AI agents that assist in trading, research, and decision-making. Analysts have noted that this combination of utility and innovation places Ozak in a unique league—one that could mimic the success trajectories of early breakout tokens like The Graph or Injective.\nBecause of its focus on AI—arguably the hottest theme in both traditional tech and crypto—Ozak AI benefits from a strong narrative. Its potential launch around $1 is not just speculation. Several research reports suggest that given the low token supply, utility, presale traction, and increasing demand for AI-driven Web3 solutions, such a valuation at launch is plausible—and potentially conservative.\nThe Path from $0.005 to $1: Not Just Hype, But Momentum\nSkeptics may be quick to dismiss a 200x return as hype, but the reality is that crypto has repeatedly produced similar stories during strong market cycles. Ozak AI’s tokenomics are designed for scarcity, with a limited supply and a significant portion locked for development and community incentives. Once the presale closes and $OZ hits major exchanges, scarcity combined with demand could push prices up sharply.\nImportantly, Ozak AI is already listed on major data aggregators like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko and has undergone audits by Certik as well as internal security teams. These signals suggest the project is gearing up for a legitimate public launch—not a fly-by-night operation. With more CEX listings expected to follow, the post-launch environment could be highly favorable for early holders.\nBranding That Bridges Culture, AI, and Real-World Experience\nOzak AI’s appeal isn’t only technical—it’s cultural. As part of its broader community engagement strategy, the team has begun rolling out branding elements that connect crypto with real-life experiences, including its signature cocktail range and Vietnamese cà phê campaigns. These elements help create a lifestyle identity around the token, making it more than just a digital asset. In a space crowded with look-alike projects, this type of creativity can drive organic adoption and build a loyal following beyond the presale.\nBy embracing a multi-layered approach that blends technology, culture, and investor incentives, Ozak AI is building a holistic ecosystem—one that’s designed to last and evolve well past the launch.\nFor anyone wondering whether it’s too late to get in, the answer is a clear no. Ozak AI’s presale is still active, and the current entry price of $0.005 offers one of the most favorable risk-reward ratios in the market right now. A $1,000 entry could theoretically become $200,000 if $OZ reaches $1, and higher still if the token sees continued growth post-launch. Even more conservative projections—such as a $0.50 or $0.25 listing—still offer incredible upside.\nIn a market where timing is everything, Ozak AI stands out as a project that combines momentum, innovation, and affordability. If the $1 launch target becomes reality, early believers could indeed find themselves part of the next wave of crypto-made millionaires.\nAbout Ozak AI\nOzak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.\nFor more, visit\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nTwitter: https://x.com/ozakagi\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "This week in crypto, major regulatory moves included the SEC clarifying certain staking receipt tokens are not securities, Dubai approving its first regulated crypto options license, and China preparing to launch its first fiat-backed stablecoin. Let’s dig deeper.\nBusiness:\nRipple has announced plans to acquire stablecoin payment platform Rail for $200 million to expand its global digital asset payment capabilities and strengthen its enterprise stablecoin offering.\nWeb3\nStablecoins’ role in the shift from centralized lending to decentralized, Bitcoin-backed finance is unlocking capital efficiency by letting holders retain BTC exposure while accessing liquidity in a non-custodial, permissionless manner.\nAs the crypto world holds its breath, Bitcoin Swift is racing toward the end of Stage 3, and the price has already surged past $4.\nBlockSack is a newly launched Layer 2 meme coin on the Base blockchain that's gaining serious attention as it blends bold storytelling with real tools like staking, NFT minting, and a trading bot, all powered by the BSACK token.\nBlockSack has become a magnet for projects building high-performance dApps without losing decentralization. $BSACK taps into that strength.\nIn a year when many tokens struggled to maintain relevance, FUNToken ($FUN) has reached around $0.0188 at the time of writing after climbing from under $0.007 in early April.\nOne of the most powerful forces behind FUNToken’s recent surge is its predictable, revenue-backed deflationary model, a system that rewards real usage with measurable scarcity.\nDecentralized perpetuals exchange gTrade has released version 10 (v10), its most significant upgrade to date, introducing a funding fee model that replaces the previous borrowing fee structure.\nThe AI and gaming-focused blockchain infrastructure provider DAR Open Network is unlocking the full benefits of its expansive GameFi ecosystem with DAR Citizenship.\nRWA-focused Layer-1 blockchain (Mavryk), a global derivatives giant (MultiBank), a Dubai real estate company (MAG Group), and an institutional-grade custody leader (Fireblocks) have teamed up to make property ownership accessible to all by ambitiously targeting tokenizing $10 billion of property in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\nAurora Labs has introduced the first cohort of startups to emerge from its six-week Aurora Blocks Incubator program to showcase what’s possible with its simple, no-code blockchain development platform.\nBitcoin.com Casino has leveled up its community engagement with a social presence on Telegram, X, and Discord, as well as a streaming experience on Twitch and Kick to allow gamblers to share strategies, tournament updates, and gameplay clips.\nSecurity\nThe team behind the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol CrediX Finance has disappeared just days after a $4.5 million exploit compromised the platform with the protocol’s official X handle and website going offline since August 4.\nRegulation\nThe CFTC has launched a new initiative to allow spot crypto trading on federally registered exchanges, marking a key step toward unified federal oversight of digital assets.\nPresident Trump has signed an executive order allowing 401(k) retirement plans to include crypto and other alternative assets, opening the $12.5 trillion market to digital investments while raising concerns around investor protection and fiduciary responsibility.\nDubai has officially approved its first regulated crypto options trading license, marking a significant regulatory milestone in its ambitions to position itself as a global hub for digital assets.\nChina is set to approve its first fiat-backed stablecoin through Hong Kong’s new licensing regime, marking a significant policy shift aimed at expanding the renminbi’s global influence and reducing dependence on the US dollar.\nThe SEC has clarified that staking receipt tokens issued under specific administrative conditions are not securities, offering key regulatory relief to liquid staking platforms.\nFormer President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order that would direct federal agencies to crack down on banks allegedly denying services to crypto firms and politically conservative entities based on ideological grounds.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Ozak AI is becoming a standout opportunity in the crypto space, with crypto investors turning modest $100 stakes into potential profits of $10,000 or more. Currently in its 4th presale level at simply $0.005 per token, Ozak AI combines effective AI-pushed market insights with blockchain technology, attracting sizable attention and raising over $1.6 million at the same time as promoting more than 90 million tokens.\nStrong tokenomics, rigorous security audits, and strategic partnerships with innovators like Weblume and SINT have boosted investor confidence, making this presale one of the most promising possibilities for outsized returns because the mission moves towards release.\nWhat Sets Ozak AI Apart?\nOzak AI distinguishes itself from many crypto projects by using that which specializes in actionable AI-driven trading insights. The platform’s superior AI models examine market facts across cryptocurrencies, equities, and foreign exchange to offer real-time, predictive alerts. This stage of sophistication became historically handiest available to hedge finances and institutional investors; however, Ozak AI aims to democratize this intelligence, empowering retail investors with modern equipment.\nThe $OZ token is at the middle of this space, granting customers the right of entry to premium statistics feeds, permitting participation within the platform, and facilitating transactions. This multi-software aspect strengthens token demand past mere hypotheses, making it a vital element of the platform’s long-term sustainability.\nExplosive Presale Growth and Investor Confidence\nSince its inception, the Ozak AI presale has gained remarkable traction. Selling over 90 million tokens and raising more than $1.6 million to date, the project’s 4th presale stage continues to attract a growing base of investors who see the potential for massive returns.\nThis surge is underpinned by well-designed tokenomics that foster confidence. Only 10% of tokens are released at the Token Generation Event (TGE), with the rest vested over a six-month period following a one-month cliff. Such a controlled release reduces the hazard of fee crashes due to big sell-offs, encouraging long-term holding and price stability.\nSecurity and Transparency Build Trust\nIn the frequently unstable and risky world of crypto, protection and transparency are paramount. Ozak AI has taken steps to reassure traders via undergoing audits from Certik, a top blockchain safety firm, and conducting thorough inner audits. These opinions verify the protection and integrity of the platform’s clever contracts, decreasing the hazard of vulnerabilities.\nFurthermore, the undertaking’s listing on reputable aggregators like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko adds an extra layer of visibility and credibility. Investors can assess Ozak AI’s performance overtly, which bolsters market confidence and facilitates enticing a much wider target market.\nStrategic Partnerships Powering Growth\nOzak AI’s ecosystem is expanding rapidly with its strategic partnerships with modern gamers within the blockchain and AI area. One such collaboration is with Weblume, a no-code Web3 improvement platform. This partnership seeks to immediately combine Ozak AI’s real-time market signals into Weblume’s drag-and-drop app builder, making it less difficult for creators to expand information-rich on-chain programs.\nAnother significant alliance is with SINT, a platform offering “one-click AI upgrades” for products across Web2 and Web3. SINT’s voice-activated AI agents enable users to interact seamlessly with trading platforms and decentralized apps without coding knowledge. The synergy between Ozak AI’s predictive data and SINT’s autonomous agents could revolutionize how investors execute trades, combining speed with ease of use.\nTurning $100 Into $10,000\nThe mixture of innovative era, robust tokenomics, and strategic partnerships positions Ozak AI as a superb presale possibility. Priced at simply $0.005 per token within the present stage, projections propose the token could attain $1, probably delivering 200x returns.\nFor buyers, this means that a $100 investment ought to balloon to $10,000 or more if Ozak AI meets its increased potential. While such profits come with inherent risks typical of the crypto marketplace, the mission’s basics offer a compelling case for early participation.\nWhat the Future Holds for Ozak AI\nAs the broader cryptocurrency market gears up for what many expect to be a bullish phase in 2025, projects like Ozak AI with real-world applications and strong communities are likely to lead the pack. The platform plans ongoing feature enhancements and expanded AI capabilities to keep delivering cutting-edge market insights.\nCommunity events, such as recent meetups in Vietnam combining networking with innovative brainstorming over signature cocktails and Vietnamese cà phê, highlight the vibrant and engaged user base that supports Ozak AI’s vision. This active community plays a crucial role in driving adoption and fostering trust.\nOzak AI’s presale is more than just another crypto offering—it represents a transformative opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on AI-powered blockchain innovation. With over $1.6 million raised, millions of tokens already sold, and a clear roadmap backed by strong security and partnerships, Ozak AI is making waves.\nFor those willing to act early, the potential to turn a small $100 investment into $10,000 or more is very real. As always, investors should conduct their own research, but Ozak AI’s presale stands out as one of the most exciting and promising entry points in today’s crypto landscape.\nAbout Ozak AI\nOzak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets.

        "text": "Despite SOL’s effort to reclaim the $200 mark, the Solana price failed to do so. SOL traders have not lost hope that it can reach its anticipated $200 mark or even its previous ATH. The formation of a golden cross has given hope for another Solana price rally.\nWhile the SOL token starts an ascending path, investors flock to an emerging asset management platform called Unilabs Finance. This AI-backed platform has become the talk of the town with a staggering presale raise of about $12 million in stage 6 of the presale. Experts call it “SOL slayer” due to its growth potential.\nSolana Price Analysis: Golden Cross Could Propel SOL Back To $200!\nThe SOL token has maintained a 10% increase over the past three months despite the recent correction, with the Solana price currently reaching the $170 mark. This resilience points to underlying strength in the SOL token even as short-term price movements trend downwards.\nOne of the most promising signals comes from exchange data. Solana’s price balance on centralized exchanges has dropped sharply from 33.06 million on July 23 to 30.78 million by August 5. This 10% reduction suggests fewer SOL tokens are available for immediate selling, often a precursor to price rebounds.\nOn-chain metrics reveal that the Solana price has once again moved above the exchange supply trendline. This crossover has historically preceded short-term rallies. Previous instances saw SOL jump from $173 to $205 in six days following a similar crossover on July 16, and from $182 to $188 in just three sessions after the July 24 crossover.\nThe technical analysis reveals the formation of a golden cross on the SOL charts. The 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 200-day EMA are approaching a golden crossover. This setup typically signals the beginning of a stronger uptrend and occasionally triggers rallies.\nUnilabs Finance Combines AI And Crypto For Explosive Growth!\nUnilabs Finance is a newly launched asset management platform that is here to change the investment game with its cutting-edge AI-powered technology. It is being labelled as a SOL slayer by the market experts thanks to its huge growth potential.\nIt is the world’s first AI-backed asset manager that boasts over $31.8 million in Assets Under Management (AUM) and offers massive profits to users. Unilabs’ AI Market Pulse feature aims to help newbie investors identify promising investment opportunities early on.\nThis tool can analyze market trends and key metrics about a project to deliver actionable insights. Using this insightful data, investors can easily pick profitable projects before they hit the mainstream market and deliver massive profits. It also offers a unique Memecoin Identification Tool, which enables high-risk investors to vet out memecoins likely to deliver gains.\nFurthermore, Unilabs Finance is offering its Flash Loan Accelerator to boost its value proposition. High-risk investors often require substantial capital, and through Unilabs Flash loans, users would instantly access massive capital without any collateral.\nUNIL Picks Up Momentum With $12 Million Raised!\nUnilabs Finance, besides offering such high-technology features, has also done remarkably well in its ongoing presale. It also comes out as a highly enticing investment option, as leading altcoins like the Solana price fail to deliver what their investors were expecting.\nThe AI-powered platform has sold over a billion UNIL tokens and raised over $11.9 million. Unilabs is currently available for just $0.0097, but it’s expected to reach $0.0108 in the next presale round. The platform offers a variety of benefits for UNIL holders that give it an edge over other ongoing presales.\nThese perks include 14% gains, governance rights, and discounts for early investors. Furthermore, Unilabs rewards its early investors through its twelve-tier reward system. Users would get up to 30% of all the fees generated on the platform based on their UNIL holdings.\nFurthermore, Unilabs Finance is getting ready for its CMC listing, which makes it more probable for Unilabs to deliver over 10x gains as observed in the past for such utility coins.\nKey Takeaways\nExperts call Unilabs Finance a “SOL slayer” due to its staggering presale raise of about $12 million and its explosive growth potential. The platform has grabbed the spotlight in this bull run, while the Solana price analysis reveals the formation of a golden crossover and an impending rally.\nFind out more about the Unilabs (UNIL) Presale Today:\nWebsite: https://unilabs.finance/\nTelegram: https://t.me/unilabsofficial\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/blockdags-viral-00016-countdown-is-on-while-xrp-and-hype-hit-critical-price-zones",
        "text": "Crypto markets are entering a crucial stretch, and three of the top crypto coins right now are drawing investor attention for vastly different reasons. XRP is facing a high-stakes legal and ETF decision window that could redefine its price trend, while Hyperliquid (HYPE) is showing strong on-chain growth and setting up for a technical breakout from the $34–$38 zone.\nMeanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) has gone viral across social platforms, crypto Telegram groups, and influencer channels after slashing its presale price to $0.0016, a massive 17x discount from its batch listing rate. That offer ends in 48 hours, and with over $367 million raised, the market buzz is now undeniable.\nAs different as these projects are in focus, their current paths make them the top crypto coins to watch as August unfolds.\nXRP Price Prediction: All Eyes on August 15\nThe latest XRP price prediction centers on one date: August 15, when the SEC is set to update its stance on Ripple. If the agency moves toward settlement or reduces its appeal posture, the XRP chart could break out of its current consolidation and target the next leg toward $4.20.\nXRP is currently holding above $3.00, with strong support from both whale wallets and ETF-related institutional flows. Since July’s breakout, which saw XRP jump over 65%, volume has held above average and RSI remains in bullish territory. On-chain data shows over $300 million in inflows to XRP-tied ETF vehicles, signaling growing institutional demand.\nHowever, there’s caution beneath the optimism. Smart money addresses have reportedly taken some profit during the recent rally, raising the possibility that a portion of the buying pressure was speculative ahead of the SEC announcement. If August 15 delivers regulatory clarity, this month could mark a new era for the XRP price.\nUntil then, holding the $3.00 support is critical. Any break below could retest $2.60, while upside targets remain at $3.84 and $4.20.\nHyperliquid (HYPE) Price Prediction: Fundamentals Fuel Speculation\nFew tokens are gathering technical and fundamental momentum quite like Hyperliquid (HYPE). The project recently posted $1.1 billion in annualized revenue—up 40% month-over-month—and is now sitting near a key long-term support zone between $34 and $38.\nThat price range aligns with both the 200-day EMA and the so-called “golden pocket” on Fibonacci levels, making it a classic zone for accumulation. On-chain analysts have pointed to rising volume and renewed whale engagement, particularly on decentralized platforms like Kamino.\nMarket watchers are increasingly drawing comparisons between HYPE and early-stage Solana, thanks to similar chart structures and strong revenue momentum. As of now, Hyperliquid (HYPE) price prediction models suggest a parabolic move could develop if HYPE reclaims $38 and sustains above the 200EMA. Some analysts project a longer-term target as high as $260–$300 if bullish structure holds and broader altcoin strength returns.\nThe MC/Revenue ratio has rebounded to 11.2x, still significantly below crypto and fintech peers like HOOD and SCRL, further supporting the narrative that HYPE remains undervalued despite the recent pullback.\nBlockDAG: Viral Presale, Real Infrastructure, and a Countdown Clock\nBlockDAG has officially entered the final 48-hour window of its $0.0016 presale offer, with over $367 million already raised. Now in batch 29, the project is being hailed as one of the top crypto coins right now, even before exchange listings. After August 11, the price reverts to its batch-listed rate of $0.0276, with an estimated launch price of $0.05, marking a 17x jump and closing the door on early entry.\nWhat sets BlockDAG apart from other presales is its real infrastructure and traction. The X1 mining app has surpassed 2.5 million users, and Dashboard V4 has launched with simulated trading tools and real-time charting features. The project’s hybrid architecture, merging blockchain and DAG, allows for high throughput, EVM compatibility, and seamless low-code smart contract deployment.\nBlockDAG has also announced partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves (rugby) and Seattle Orcas (cricket), embedding itself in real-world fan engagement through NFTs and token utilities. A 10 BTC auction is live for presale participants, and a 100 million token airdrop is onboarding thousands of new wallet holders daily.\nBetween viral traction, tangible product rollouts, and a steep discount expiring in days, BlockDAG is gaining momentum as not just a presale, but the kind of early entry that investors typically chase in retrospect.\nAll Three Projects Are Heating Up, But Only One Has a Countdown\nFor traders and crypto watchers, August is becoming a critical moment for positioning. XRP price prediction depends almost entirely on the August 15 SEC filing. Hyperliquid (HYPE) price prediction rides on continued revenue strength and whether the $34–$38 zone holds.\nBlockDAG, however, doesn’t require speculation to deliver value; it has already built the infrastructure and raised nine figures, and now its $0.0016 pricing is vanishing in hours. That kind of clarity, especially in a market full of unknowns, is exactly why BDAG is going viral, and why many see it as the top crypto to buy in 2025.\nJoin BlockDAG Presale Now:\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Sometimes all it takes is a few spare dollars and the right timing to rewrite your financial future. Usually, blue-chip assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum offer steady growth. However, it's low-cap, high-upside tokens have turned pocket change into six- or even seven-figure windfalls. With the 2025 market heating up, a new wave of tokens could offer not just hype, but serious potential. Let's take a look at five tokens that could be life-changing this year.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): From Meme to Millions?\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) is storming the meme coin scene with utility, innovation, and serious investor attention. While many meme coins rely solely on hype, Little Pepe is building real infrastructure. That's precisely why it's drawing comparisons to the early days of Dogecoin and PEPE, but with far more upside. Now in Stage 9 of its presale, $LILPEPE is trading at just $0.0018, with over $15 million already raised. Interest is accelerating, especially after the project’s CoinMarketCap listing, which solidified its credibility in the eyes of retail and early whales alike. The token powers its own Layer 2 blockchain, built specifically for the meme economy. This means zero tax trading, sniper-bot resistance, and lightning-fast speeds. Its ecosystem also features a dedicated meme launchpad, giving it an ecosystem that’s light-years ahead of typical meme coins.\nAdding to the excitement, two top-tier centralized exchange listings are locked in for launch, with confirmed negotiations to list on the world’s largest exchange. Investors are positioning early before this goes mainstream. Analysts believe that if $LILPEPE even grazes $0.50, early buyers at $0.0018 could secure 300x returns within 18 months. The project is also running a $777,000 giveaway, with 10 lucky winners receiving $77,000 each in tokens. To qualify, investors must contribute at least $100 and complete a few simple tasks. This giveaway has added even more incentive to join now. With a powerful blend of meme culture, blockchain tech, and massive upside potential, this is one of the most compelling tokens in 2025 for turning spare change into generational wealth.\nTurbo (TURBO): AI-Generated Hype with Real Staying Power\nTurbo (TURBO) is a distinctive meme coin created entirely by AI. It is now listed and trading at about $0.00430, with a market cap of around $297 million. Launched in April 2023 on a $69 budget using GPT‑4 and Midjourney, Turbo quickly earned cult status with its toad mascot “Quantum Leap.” Despite its lack of concrete utility today, it remains one of the top meme coins capturing AI-meme crossover interest. Analysts forecast price potential as high as $0.0105–$0.0119 by year-end. If a macro meme cycle arrives, the upside could be explosive. For investors starting with just a few dollars, it remains one of the rare meme coins still trading under $0.005 with serious upside potential.\nWall Street Pepe (WEPE): Meme Finance with Explosive Potential\nWall Street Pepe (WEPE) is carving out a unique lane in the meme coin space, blending satire, finance, and viral internet culture. As of early August, the token remains well under the radar with a modest market cap below $25 million. This leaves plenty of room for explosive upside. WEPE's strategic branding, meme-rich narrative, and growing community that thrives on humor and hustle set it apart. It recently secured listings on BitMart and MEXC, sparking fresh interest and widening access. The team has teased an NFT line and DeFi utility in development, adding long-term potential to the hype. With strong meme momentum and clever execution, WEPE could quietly become one of 2025’s most surprising breakout tokens.\nPopcat (POPCAT): The Viral Cat Token Poised for a Comeback\nPopcat (POPCAT) is trading at approximately $0.2970, with a market cap of around $286 million. After peaking at $2.06 in November 2024, the token has since retraced about 85%, settling near current levels as meme coin sentiment cools. Market trading volume is healthy at $25–30 million daily, supported by listings on platforms like KuCoin and Kraken. Analysts estimate Popcat could reclaim $1–$2 by late 2025 as meme mania returns and Asia-based virality reignites. Popcat’s combination of cultural clout, steady exchange presence, and reclaimed momentum in a market hungry for explosive returns positions it as a potential high-beta play.\nPepecoin (PEP): A Layer‑1 Meme Coin with Real Potential\nPepecoin (PEP) trades around $0.00050, commanding a market cap of approximately $57 million. After soaring to an all-time high of $0.00185 in December 2024, PEP has since retraced 70%. But it remains resilient, recently rebounding from its $0.00045 low. Pepecoin distinguishes itself through Layer‑1 decentralization, merge-mining compatibility with Litecoin and Dogecoin. It also has zero pre-mine or VC allocation, traits rare in meme token space. Analysts see a strong asymmetrical upside of 10× to 50×.\nConclusion\n2025 will be a breakout year for high-upside altcoins, and these five tokens are leading the charge.

        "text": "The Ripple price has jumped by more than 12%, soaring on news of a close to the Ripple-SEC legal battle. The news has brought excitement to the market, paving the way for a potential altcoin rally.\nAnother cryptocurrency that has made history is Unilabs (UNIL), the Solana slayer that pumped 30% after its CoinMarketCap listing. Unilabs could become a force to be reckoned with in the DeFi investment space. Also, the Dogecoin price has risen on the weekly chart.\nRipple (XRP) Price Skyrockets Following End of Legal Battle\nThe Ripple price saw a sharp rise on Thursday after the end of the 4-year legal battle with the US SEC. The case ended after the securities regulator submitted a dismissal of its\nAlso, Donald Trump's greenlighting of crypto investment in the 401(k) retirement industry adds to the bullish sentiment. According to CoinMarketCap, the Ripple price has pumped 8.6% on the weekly chart.\nConsidering the bullish trend in the market, the Ripple price could fly up to about $4 before next week. However, a key level to watch is the resistance at $3.5. Conversely, the DeFi coin may be forced to fall below the $3.10 mark due to selling pressure.\nTechnically, some indicators support a continuous uptrend. The RSI has surpassed the 50 mark as a result of increased buying pressure. Armando Pantoja, a top analyst, believes the end of the Ripple-SEC case is a major boost for XRP. The crypto investor forecasts that the Ripple price could pump to $8 and then $25.\nDogecoin (DOGE) Soars To New Weekly High\nFollowing the uptick in the crypto market, the Dogecoin price has risen by 5.8% on the weekly timeframe. The memecoin printed a green candle on the chart as investors' sentiment turned positive.\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, the Dogecoin price has crossed the $0.22 mark with its eyes on the $0.25 barrier. Chris, a trading analyst, believes it is time for the Dogecoin price to rally to $1.00.\nCharting Guy, a well-known crypto supporter, has sparked excitement in the community with his latest analysis on the Dogecoin price. He noted that the $DOGE monthly RSI is pending a bullish cross, and the last time this happened, the Dogecoin price skyrocketed by an astonishing 439%.\nIn another update, he shared a chart highlighting how the Dogecoin price is breaking out of a descending trendline, a pattern seen before prior to massive rallies. Based on these signals, Charting Guy believes the Dogecoin price could surge to an impressive $1.40 soon.\nWhile development in the Dogecoin ecosystem remains low, the potential release of a Dogecoin ETF could attract positive sentiment to the market.\nUnilabs and the 122% APY Edge: AI-Powered DeFi Project To Earn Passive Income\nLike other top crypto coins that are bullish, the value of Unilabs' UNIL has also skyrocketed by 30%, potentially hitting $1 before the year runs out. With over $30 million in assets under management, Unilabs is a new project that could take over the DeFi market, which is worth over $90 billion.\nThe central part of the Unilabs strategy is its AI Market Pulse. This sophisticated tool searches in real-time both on-chain and off-chain data to identify market changes even before they hit the headlines. This allows the platform to rebalance portfolios and identify emerging opportunities quickly, giving investors an edge.\nUnilabs also offers four distinct investment funds around AI, BTC, RWA, and Mining. The DeFi project is shaping the future of investing by democratizing access to institutional-grade tools.\nUnilabs also stands out in staking rewards. While top staking platforms such as Lido provide a 3.5% APY on Ethereum staking, Unilabs provides up to 122% APY to users staking its native UNIL token.\nThe DeFi coin is currently trading at $0.0097 and is expected to explode soon. With its growth rate and the increasing adoption of the project, Unilabs' presale funding is also expected to hit $20 million from its value of $12.1 million.\nAltcoins To Watch Following Ripple-SEC Victory\nGiven the end of Ripple's legal battle with the SEC, the crypto market could see a massive uptick in the coming weeks. The best altcoins to buy for this rally are XRP and Unilabs. The new ICO has caught the attention of the whole crypto community with its passive earning opportunities and bonuses. Investors eager for the next big breakout opportunity should watch this rising star closely.\nFind out more about the Unilabs (UNIL) Presale Today:\nWebsite: https://unilabs.finance/\nTelegram: https://t.me/unilabsofficial\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Blockchain security firms flagged the exploit on Monday, confirming that crypto assets worth $4.5 million were drained from the platform. In response, CrediX Finance paused all operations to prevent users from depositing more funds. Blockchain security firm SlowMist gave a detailed breakdown of the exploit, stating that hackers had gained access to the protocol’s multisig admin and bridge wallets. The attackers exploited the access to mint crypto as collateral to drain the DeFi protocol’s liquidity pools.\nCrediX Finance’s official X account went offline on Friday, and its website has been offline since the day of the exploit. The protocol’s official Telegram channel has also disappeared, with no announcements or official communication from the team. CertiK stated on X,\n“Following the incident that resulted in a $4.4M loss, the CrediX Finance team has disappeared. X account is inactive, and the website hasn’t been brought back online since August 4.”\nCrediX Finance Had Promised Reimbursements\nCrediX Finance had claimed in a now inaccessible post that it had convinced the attackers to return the funds in return for the money paid by the protocol’s treasury. It had also said it would reimburse users for the funds lost during the attack.\n“Reached successful parley with the exploiter who agreed to return the funds within the next 24-48 hours in return for money fully paid by the CrediX treasury.”\nHowever, the DeFi protocol has since gone dark, deleting all official communications and all its official platforms. Security expert Harry Donnelly criticized CrediX Finance’s post-hack negotiation strategies, calling them a red flag for exit scams.\nLegal Effort Underway\nImpacted users and protocols are turning to legal avenues to recover the stolen funds. According to a Stability DAO Discord post, impacted entities, including Euler, Sonic Labs, Beets, and Trevee, are working with legal and cybercrime authorities to trace the stolen funds. Stability DAO stated that it had gathered evidence, traced the stolen funds, and accessed the KYC information of two CrediX Finance team members. Stability plans to submit the information as part of the legal filing against CrediX Finance.\n“Our teams are collaborating to gather all evidence, trace the funds, and coordinate with relevant legal and cybercrime units.”\nStability DAO added that it will share a full report detailing what happened and the steps being taken with the community. Meanwhile, Trevee revealed the hack had indirectly impacted it through a $1.6 million scUSD loan to Stability’s metaUSD, which became fully exposed to CrediX following a bank run.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "In a crypto market known for its surprises, Jasmy Coin’s projected performance has sparked more yawns than excitement. According to current price forecasts, Jasmy is expected to move from $0.015 in 2026 to just $0.030 by 2040. That’s a 100% return over 14 years, which might sound decent, until you realize that Bitcoin Swift (BTC3) is offering a 106% yield instantly in Stage 4 of its presale.\nInvestors seeking long-term gains are beginning to reassess where their capital should be allocated. While JasmyCoin continues to focus on slow and steady progress, the rest of the market is waking up to something a lot more aggressive, dynamic, and potentially game-changing.\nJasmy Coin Lacks Speed in a Market That Demands It\nJasmyCoin is undoubtedly not a bad project. It emphasizes data ownership and aims to give users control over their digital identity. That mission still holds weight, and its slow, projected growth reflects a cautious but thoughtful approach to utility. But as the market evolves rapidly, projects like Bitcoin Swift are rewriting the pace of what “crypto success” should look like.\nAnd BTC3 is not waiting around.\nBitcoin Swift Is Scaling Faster Than Expectations\nBitcoin Swift is not just another altcoin chasing trends. It’s a self-adaptive, AI-powered blockchain system that introduces programmable staking rewards, decentralized identity, and automated governance all in one.\nWhat sets BTC3 apart is how fast it is attracting users and money. From privacy to compliance to wealth-building mechanics, it’s built to perform at every level of the crypto stack.\nIts Proof-of-Yield (PoY) reward architecture allows early buyers to benefit instantly from the protocol. It’s not just about owning a token. It’s about plugging into the infrastructure and participating directly in how the system evolves.\nOne of the most detailed reviews came recently from Crypto Sister, who broke down why BTC3’s reward system, governance design, and real-time adaptability are drawing huge attention from serious investors and crypto influencers alike.\nCore Technologies Making Bitcoin Swift Stand Out\nBTC3 is deeply technical yet simple in user experience. Here’s why developers and investors are equally excited:\n-\nAI Energy Efficiency: BTC3 uses AI-powered oracles to monitor environmental impact and adjust network behavior in real time, prioritizing clean and efficient computing.\n-\nGovernance Architecture: The protocol supports quadratic voting, AI pre-screening of proposals, and decentralized identity verification to ensure governance integrity.\n-\nPrivacy Systems: With built-in zk-SNARK layers and shielded transactions, user data and transaction history remain secure and private.\n-\nProgrammable Staking Rewards: PoY incentives are not fixed. They shift dynamically with real-time network metrics, environmental conditions, and community governance.\nAccording to internal sources from the team, they’re currently working on a third security audit with a well-known and reputable blockchain firm to further ensure user safety and protocol integrity. The project has already passed both the Spywolf Audit and Solidproof Audit, and has completed KYC verification with Spywolf. That’s an impressive checklist that most early-stage projects don’t even attempt.\nThe Presale That Has Everyone Talking\nBTC3 is currently in Stage 4 of its presale. And the numbers are stunning:\n-\nOver 2,100 users joined\n-\nOver $580k raised so far\n-\nStage 4 price is $4\n-\nLaunch price set at $15\n-\nAPY during Stage 4 is 106%\n-\nPresale ends on September 18, 2025\nThis isn’t just a token sale. It’s a launchpad into a live protocol with built-in programmable staking rewards. With PoY rewards distributed immediately at the end of each stage, users are already tapping into a real, working infrastructure.\nBTC3 is also gaining attention from behind the scenes. Internal sources suggest that discussions are already underway with MEXC, KuCoin, and LBank to secure listings post-launch. While official announcements are pending, the confidence around these developments is driving even more buying pressure.\nRoadmap That Reflects the Vision\nBitcoin Swift’s roadmap is ambitious and already in motion:\n-\nAI-powered smart contract engine launching early 2026\n-\nzk-SNARK ledger with privacy tools for confidential transactions\n-\nGovernance simulation tools to prevent malicious proposals\n-\nDID framework integrated with global compliance standards\n-\nInstitutional onboarding and stablecoin rollout by Q4 2026\nFrom AI integration to full DeFi utility, BTC3 is targeting both retail users and financial institutions. And it’s doing all of this while rewarding early participants through a live reward structure that adapts every step of the way.\nFinal Thoughts\nJasmy Coin may be taking the safe route, but Bitcoin Swift is accelerating on a whole different level. With real-time PoY rewards, AI-backed infrastructure, top-tier audits, and smart governance, BTC3 is not just climbing, it’s sprinting.\nIf you're still watching from the sidelines, this might be the last chance to step in before the next stage begins.\nFor more information on Bitcoin Swift:\nWebsite: https://bitcoinswift.com\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/pharos-network-teams-up-with-morpho-to-launch-native-lending-for-rwas",
        "text": "RWA blockchain Pharos Network has revealed that it’s working with lending network Morpho to roll out native lending backed by tokenized real-world assets. The collaboration will see new lending capabilities take root on Pharos, adding greater utility to RWAs and giving them DeFi-like powers, strengthening the incentives for holding these tokenized assets.\nMorpho knows a thing or two about lending, having accrued more than $9B in user deposits, but its move onto Pharos’ Layer 1 will mark fresh territory for deploying its best-in-class infra. The idea behind the initiative is to enable asset originators and LPs on Pharos to enjoy greater capital efficiency through being able to access lending markets on demand. Morpho will take care of the infra, with the Pharos ecosystem onboarding the sort of professionals who stand to benefit from this arrangement.\nRWAs Come of Age\nNow a $25B sector, tokenized real-world assets may have taken their time in gaining traction, but they’re making up for it now, having been posting an average of 5% monthly growth all through 2025. Pharos has been doing its bit to expedite this process, its EVM-compatible chain providing the scalability and compliant framework institutions need to access the thriving RWA onchain economy. But while tokenizing assets such as equities and bonds is the starting point, it’s certainly not the endgame. The next step is to add greater utility to these assets over and above the ability to trade them 24/7, which is where Morpho comes into the picture.\n“Deploying natively on Pharos allows us to keep extending Morpho's most trusted lending infrastructure to the real-world asset space following initial success like private credit and tokenized stocks,” explains Morpho’s Kirk Hutchison, adding: “Pharos’ vision for RWAfi aligns with our commitment to transparent and scalable credit systems. Together, we are creating a powerful infrastructure for structured lending products, better risk pricing, and more accessible yield opportunities across both institutional and retail markets.”\nThe phrase “RWAfi” is significant here. It’s an attempt to combine the best bits of DeFi – global access; composability; money markets – with the compliance and professionalism that characterizes TradFi. Once assets have been tokenized and made tradable onchain, there’s a lot more that can be done with them than simply swapping them. Lending is the most obvious DeFi-native use case to give the RWA treatment, allowing institutions and pro investors to use their assets as collateral and borrow against them or lend them to counterparties.\nDeFi Dressed Up\nThere’s an array of DeFi protocols out there offering yield and novel financial primitives galore, but the majority are unsuited to institutions, who are required to tread carefully when transacting onchain. While recent legislation such as the GENIUS Act has made it safer for Wall Street firms to enter the onchain economy, they are obliged to do things by the book – which is why solutions such as that being developed by Morpho and Pharos hold so much promise.\nPharos is preparing to deploy a number of institutional-focused vault launches and capital deployment frameworks, and this is where Morpho will be involved initially by helping refine the vault designs. The integration of Morpho's lending infrastructure expertise will support composability with Pharos’ existing infrastructure. In the process, it will showcase the sort of financial primitives that RWAs can support, allowing LPs and asset issuers to generate yield and efficiently put their capital to work.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "While both the Solana price and XRP price might have peaked, Unilabs Finance (UNIL), a novel AI token, is just starting its run. After a 142% rally from its initial price of $0.004 in the first ICO round to $0.0097 in the sixth stage, a 415% gain is projected at the listing price of $0.05. Called the Solana and XRP killer, this might be the best new crypto to invest in this year.\nCan the Solana Price Increase by 10X This Cycle?\nSince its launch, according to CoinMarketCap, the Solana price has increased by over 20,000%. This means new retail investors aren’t early; they already missed the train. Earlier this year, during the meme frenzy, the Layer-1 coin reached a new ATH of $294 in January, with little room left to run.\nAfter falling below $160 this week, the bulls have regained momentum, marked by a 30% surge in daily trading volume to $5.1 billion. The token price increased by 4% on the daily chart, soaring past $175. But at the current Solana price, can it pull a 10x gain?\nAs of press time, the coin’s market capitalization is over $90 billion, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by size. Additionally, active addresses this past month have declined by 16%, suggesting dwindling interest and adoption of the smart contract platform. While a 2x increase in the Solana price cannot be ruled out, a 10x gain might be a stretch.\nThe XRP Price Retests $3; And So What?\nAfter trading below $3 for most of the week, the bulls finally broke out with a 10% rally, pushing the XRP price above $3.3. However, smart investors are less concerned, as they are already doubling down on alternative altcoins with higher upside potential.\nOn the monthly chart, the XRP price has surged by 43%. However, technical indicators, notably the MACD and RSI, suggest it is in an oversold area. Some top analysts go so far as to say a bull trap is imminent, predicting a potential retest of its 30-day low of $2.20.\nMeanwhile, the bulls losing momentum and the XRP price falling beneath $2.8 might be the start of its woes. Also, the token trading volume has skyrocketed by 180% to $230 billion over the past month, suggesting a potential pullback in the payment-based altcoin.\nUnilabs Finance (UNIL) — New SOL and XRP Killer?\nUnilabs Finance (UNIL) has quickly become the talk of the crypto community, hailed as the new SOL and XRP killer. Combining AI, DeFi and TradFi, it is backed by a strong narrative. Additionally, its upside potential as a new altcoin and top ICO is astounding, positioning it as the best new crypto to invest in this year.\nAs the world’s first AI-backed DeFi asset manager, industry experts believe massive adoption is inevitable. On track to capture at least 0.1% of traditional hedge fund capital, analysts have drawn a parallel with top DeFi protocols like Hyperliquid.\nHowever, it could outperform HYPE, a leading DEX with a $14 billion market cap. Its key advantages include periodic airdrops to investors, yield-sharing (30% of total platform fees) and governance features. And with a massive 415% gain projected on the launch date at $0.05, it is no surprise experts have called it the best new crypto to invest in.\nClosing Thoughts\nWith interest and demand skyrocketing, the UNIL presale has exploded past $12.1 million in funding. Despite the slight upside in the XRP price and Solana price, their long-term outlooks are not promising. Meanwhile, Unilabs Finance (UNIL) is considered the best new crypto to invest in due to its growth prospects and interesting blend of AI, DeFi and TradFi.\nFor more information about Unilabs Finance (UNIL) visit the links below:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Over $1.2 billion worth of Ripple tokens have been sold within 24 hours, with a vast majority of investors flocking to the Unilabs token. The XRP price is trading within the $2.9-$3.5 range. This is a very delicate price range for the Ripple token.\nA technical analysis of the XRP price reveals the prevalence of a cautious sentiment. A breakout above $3.10 or a slip below $2.95 can have a huge impact on the Ripple token. Unilabs presale, on the other hand, continues to soar with a massive rise of almost $12 million.\nXRP Price Analysis: Ripple Crosses $3.5 Resistance Level\nThe XRP price has reached the $3.7 mark with an intraday increase of over 4.5%. The Ripple token is currently trading between $2.95 and $3.07, with a dominant green candle on the daily charts. Ripple’s intraday ascent indicates relative stability.\nOver the past week, the XRP price has shown mixed trends. The Ripple token dipped about 4.7% recently, even as Bitcoin edged up, signaling underperformance. The technical analysis reveals that the Ripple token also suggests a bullish projection for the XRP price.\nThe Ripple token recently dipped after being rejected at the $3.10 level, falling over 6% to a low near $2.90. The XRP price is consolidating between $2.95 and $3.05 as Ripple stabilizes. The technical indicators show caution for the Ripple around the $2.95 support, which is being tested.\nThe lowest near-term risks for the XRP price lie below the $2.95-$3 range. An inverted cup-and-handle is forming around the Ripple token. This formation could signal a potential downturn if broken. However, reports suggest that bullish sentiment is still possible for the XRP price with ongoing ETF filings and institutional interest.\nUnilabs Finance Advances With Result-Driven Tools\nUnilabs Finance is standing out for giving investors more than just price action. The platform is helping users find new tokens early, manage risk automatically, and grow their assets without doing all the work themselves.\nAt the heart of the system are four investment funds: the AI Fund, BTC Fund, RWA Fund, and Mining Fund.

        "text": "Buying early isn’t just about price, it’s about position. While Token 6900 draws interest with its presale traction and Bitcoin Hyper builds hype around future scalability, both remain tied to what might happen post-launch.\nCold Wallet, on the other hand, already offers functional value before the token hits exchanges. Early buyers are not only getting in at a CWT price of $0.00998, far below the $0.3517 launch price, but also earning cashback on gas, swaps, and ramps. That utility, paired with a built-in discount, makes Cold Wallet a standout in the best crypto presale discussion for those thinking a step ahead .\nEarly Cold Wallet Buyers Already Hold the Upper Hand Before Launch\nCold Wallet’s early presale buyers are already sitting on a price advantage that most projects only deliver months after launch. Currently, with the presale in stage 17 and CWT priced at just $0.00998, investors are gaining exposure to one of the year’s best crypto presale opportunities at a steep discount. Notably, the project has already raised $5.8 million, showing significant momentum long before public trading begins.\nImportantly, the structure is intentional. Cold Wallet is set to launch at $0.3517, meaning those buying in now are securing tokens at over 37 times below the anticipated public listing price. As a result, this baked-in price difference creates a cushion that helps early participants benefit even before major exchange listings introduce broader market volatility. In many cases, this advantage acts as an insulation layer from the unpredictable swings that follow a token's first days of trading.\nUnlike hype-driven projects that delay utility, Cold Wallet already delivers functional value to its users: cashback on gas, swaps, and on/off ramps, all powered by the CWT token. Consequently, this real-world use case supports stronger long-term token retention while early adopters benefit from both utility and appreciation.\nAs the presale progresses, later stages increase CWT pricing step by step, and each missed entry point reduces ROI potential. Therefore, those entering now are not only positioned ahead of listing sentiment, but also ahead of the project’s token economy maturing.\nUltimately, Cold Wallet’s structure turns timing into strategy. It rewards early conviction, and that’s what makes it one of the best crypto presale opportunities currently available.\nToken 6900 T6900 Price Surge: Early Support Positions Holders for Strategic Advantage\nToken 6900 has captured attention with a notable price surge during its presale phase, having raised $1.6 million from early contributors (coinmarketcap.com). Clearly, that momentum reflects growing confidence as demand outpaces immediate supply, signaling potential for sustained upward movement.\nWhat’s more, what sets Token 6900 apart is not just the infusion of capital but the market positioning ahead of public listing. Early supporters enjoy a cost advantage that positions them favorably if wider trading activity follows suit. As adoption builds, participation may increase, and so too could liquidity and price appreciation, reinforcing the strategic upside for those already on board.\nFrom a broader view, the Token 6900 T6900 price surge may act as a foundation for greater institutional or retail interest once public visibility widens. With that in mind, capital is secured and early valuation points are established. Together, these factors suggest that the path ahead appears structured to reward foresight.\nStrategic Momentum Behind Bitcoin’s HYPER Update and Bitcoin Hyper\nThe latest Bitcoin hyper HYPER update reveals growing momentum in Bitcoin's Layer‑2 expansion strategy. So far, development continues on Bitcoin Hyper, the presale for which has raised over $7 million to date. This alone highlights investor confidence in future scalability enhancements for Bitcoin.\nLooking ahead, this update offers a long‑term advantage. As the launch window approaches between Q3 and Q4 2025, participants are positioning themselves ahead of exchange listing and broader market attention. In turn, that timing advantage may offer strategic upside beyond typical early‑stage benefits.\nWith continued progress, funding remains strong and development is in motion. The Bitcoin hyper HYPER update reflects a shift toward real capacity expansion, potentially reshaping usability through faster, lower‑cost transaction infrastructure. As a result, those aligned with the project now stand ready to benefit if adoption builds, long before external sentiment begins to factor in.\nWhy Cold Wallet’s Early Entry Stands Apart from the Pack\nSpeculation may drive interest, but real value holds it. Token 6900 and Bitcoin Hyper have built early traction, yet both rely on potential outcomes tied to public listings or infrastructure rollouts.\nCold Wallet, by contrast, offers something immediate: cashback rewards, self-custody, and a presale price still significantly below launch value. That mix of utility and cost efficiency gives early buyers more than just hope, it gives them a reason to act now.\nFor those comparing presale opportunities, Cold Wallet stands out not because of promises, but because it’s already delivering on the fundamentals that matter to long-view participants.\nExplore Cold Wallet Now:\nPresale: https://purchase.coldwallet.com/\nWebsite: https://coldwallet.com/\nX: https://x.com/coldwalletapp\nTelegram: https://t.me/ColdWalletAppOfficial\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "A new entrant has caught attention with an unexpected 3,300% leap during its presale phase. This rapid climb brings up a pressing question: could XYZVerse soon take the spotlight from established coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana? Current trends fuel speculation around the project’s next moves and its potential in the upcoming market cycle.\nUndervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX\nXYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase.\nSo far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005.\nAt the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount.\nFollowing the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch.\nBorn for Fighters, Built for Champions\nXYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin.\nCentral to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell.\nCommunity-First Vibes\nIn XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record.\nBacked by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary.\nAirdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits\nBitcoin's Next Leap: How the Original Crypto Shines as Halving Nears\nBitcoin began in 2009 when the hidden coder Satoshi Nakamoto shared a plan for digital cash. It runs on a public record called a blockchain, stored on many computers, not in one bank. People send coins to each other in seconds. Miners check each move by solving math puzzles and earn new coins for their work. The prize drops by half every four years, keeping the supply tight. Only 21 million coins will ever exist. This rare nature makes many see Bitcoin as online gold.\nThe next reward cut is close, and past cuts have often sparked sharp price climbs as fewer new coins hit the market. While newer tokens offer fast apps or flashy art, they still rely on small teams and can change rules overnight. Bitcoin keeps running, no matter who joins or leaves. Big funds now hold it as a hedge against money printing, and some countries explore using it as legal cash. Prices swing, but every slump since launch has made higher highs later. In a shaky economy, the simple idea of scarce, border-free money looks more appealing than ever.\nEthereum’s PoS Power: From Merge to 2030 Price Targets\nEthereum began as Vitalik Buterin’s 2013 idea and went live in 2015. It lets anyone run small bits of code, called smart contracts, that power games, loans, and art on a shared ledger. In 2022 the Merge shifted the network to Proof-of-Stake, cutting energy use and rewarding coin holders who lock up ETH. Layer 2 add-ons like Arbitrum and Polygon handle extra traffic, making swaps faster and cheaper. Next comes sharding, which will split the chain into many parts and raise speed again. Through it all, ether pays the fees and backs millions of ERC-20 tokens.\nPast cycles show ETH often climbs after each Bitcoin halving. Current models hint at a 2025 range from $2,700 to $6,580, with talk of $8,000 by 2027 and five-figure quotes before 2030. Unlike newer rivals such as Solana or BNB, Ethereum still hosts the largest crowd of builders and users, and now matches their lower energy costs. If Layer 2 growth stays hot and sharding lands on time, many traders see dips under $3,000 as prime entry points.\nADA: Green Fuel for the Next Crypto Rush\nCardano is a smart playground for money, apps, and games. It runs on two tracks: one moves coins, the other runs code. This split keeps traffic fast and neat. The system uses a gentle proof-of-stake method called Ouroboros. It saves power while still staying secure. ADA is the network’s own coin. You can hold it, pay with it, or lock it up to help run the chain and earn more. With fees low and speed high, Cardano aims for a million moves each second.\nIn today’s market, green tech and useful tools win attention. Bitcoin is trusted but slow. Ethereum is busy and costly. ADA steps in as a cheaper, cleaner choice. March 2021 brought native tokens, so makers can launch games and finance apps without heavy costs. DeFi volume is growing, and big investors now look beyond the first two coins. Staking on Cardano also gives steady returns, a draw during quiet months. If the next bull run prizes scale and eco care, ADA could shine brighter than many rivals.\nSolana’s Speed Surge: Could SOL Spark the Next Crypto Wave?\nSolana is a fast and open blockchain. Developers build apps on it, just like they do on Ethereum or Cardano. The network can handle many moves at once, so users wait less. It reaches this speed without splitting the chain or using extra layers. Code can be written in several common languages, giving builders more choice. The SOL coin powers every step. It pays for transfers, runs smart programs, and thanks people who keep the system safe.\nSpeed and low cost make Solana tempting in a crowded market. Gamers, traders, and artists already launch busy projects on it, showing the network can stay smooth under stress. While coins such as ETH and ADA lead in size or age, SOL often beats them on pure pace. After last year’s wide sell-off, many tokens have bounced. SOL joined the run, yet its price is still far below its old peak. If the next cycle rewards useful and fast chains, Solana could grab fresh attention. As always, gains depend on wider moods, but the blend of tech and rising activity keeps SOL on many watchlists.\nConclusion\nBTC, ETH, ADA, and SOL all remain strong in the current bull run. However, as the world’s first all-sport memecoin, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by blending sports fandom and meme culture. With bold growth targets, unique community rewards, and clear development plans, XYZVerse aims not just for major gains but to create an entirely new movement for sports and crypto fans alike.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Ripple will acquire stablecoin payment platform Rail for $200 million to expand its global digital asset payment capabilities and strengthen its enterprise stablecoin offering.\nStrategic Expansion into Stablecoin Infrastructure\nRipple has announced plans to acquire payments infrastructure firm Rail in a $200 million deal, aiming to deepen its foothold in the growing stablecoin payments sector. The acquisition, which is subject to regulatory clearance, is expected to be finalized in the fourth quarter of 2025. The move is aligned with Ripple’s broader strategy to become a key player in the enterprise stablecoin market.\nRipple sees the deal as a pivotal step in enhancing its product suite and meeting the rising demand for digital asset-based payments.\nCEO Brad Garlinghouse commented,\n“Ripple + Rail together will be THE go-to provider of stablecoin payments infrastructure for global financial institutions around the world.”\nEnhancing Enterprise Capabilities\nWith Rail’s API-based platform and over 12 banking partnerships, Ripple will be able to offer a seamless, stablecoin payment system that supports global operations. The combined offering includes always-on infrastructure, integrated compliance protocols, and support for a range of assets, including RLUSD and XRP.\nRail’s capabilities are designed to simplify complex financial operations, such as third-party transactions, internal treasury management, and cross-border pay-ins and payouts. Its system allows clients to engage in digital asset transactions without the need for holding crypto on their balance sheets or opening dedicated crypto wallets, lowering operational and regulatory hurdles.\nMeeting Market Demand with Scalable Solutions\nThe acquisition comes at a time when demand for B2B stablecoin transactions is surging. Rail is projected to handle over 10% of the anticipated $36 billion in global B2B stablecoin payments this year. By incorporating Rail’s technology, Ripple intends to offer financial institutions flexible, secure, and compliant access to stablecoin-based infrastructure that operates around the clock.\nBhanu Kohli, CEO of Rail, said,\n“Over the last four years, Rail built the fastest way to settle business payments internationally using stablecoins, and in 2025, Rail is forecasted to process over 10% of the $36B global B2B stablecoin payments. Ripple shares our vision, and together, we’re excited to bring our innovation to the millions of businesses that move money internationally.”\nPositioning for a Stablecoin-Driven Financial Future\nThe deal also strengthens Ripple’s regulatory footprint, as Rail holds more than 60 financial licenses. This regulatory compliance will enable Ripple to offer robust, secure services that meet the stringent requirements of institutional clients.\nBy integrating Rail’s capabilities, Ripple aims to deliver an end-to-end digital payments solution that eliminates inefficiencies in legacy systems while offering asset flexibility, competitive liquidity, and operational resilience through a multi-bank partner network.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Smart money traders are looking for initiatives that could realistically deliver 200x returns or extra in 2025. Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), two properly set up altcoins with sturdy ecosystems, shy away from this target with their 2x predictions.\nHowever, there’s a growing potential project in the meme region, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) with 20,000x predictions. Still in its ICO LayerBrett is gaining traction for its innovation and explosive potential. Let’s break down what each of these projects gives and why Layer Brett is the one with the capability to turn modest investments into life-changing profits.\nLayer Brett ($LBRETT): The utility-powered crypto with 20,000% ROI\nLayer Brett is the crypto newcomer that’s quickly establishing itself as one of the hottest tokens of 2025. With the crypto world turning toward the meme space for massive profit, Layer Brett blends hype and rich fundamentals in a way that’s attracting market discussions. The utility is clear, the tokenomics are strong, and upcoming listings are confirmed on both a top centralized exchange and a leading DEX post-TGE.\nLayer Brett's undeniable utility, which features on the steady Ethereum blockchain, is also fueling optimism. The project delivers lightning-fast transactions and ultra-low gas fees with no KYC restrictions.\nLayer Brett Highlights:\n-\nBuilt on Ethereum Layer 2, which means maximum security\n-\n2,100,000% staking APY available during the ICO\n-\nFun, viral memecoin energy mixed with real-life utility\n-\n$1 million giveaway for early buyers\n-\nEasy wallet integration, no KYC needed\nCurrently in its early stages, the Layer Brett presale stage at just $0.004 per token, is still stretching its legs with much room to 100x its market cap in this bullish cycle. Such a move will likely lead to a price jump of $0.004 to just $0.80, which would be a 200x gain. Even a smaller post-launch rally to $0.04 would offer 10x upside, far more than what’s expected from SOL or ADA in the same time frame.\nCardano (ADA): Research blockchain goes viral as market readies for 2x run\nCardano, the academically focused chain, is currently showing signs of a 2x recovery on the charts. This positive sentiment is evident in its price movements and is also reflected in search data. Google Trends shows increased searches for terms like ‘Cardano price’ and ‘ADA price prediction’, indicating a growing interest among retail investors.\nThis uptick in sentiment around ADA has been boosted by recent news of a community agreement to spend $71 million from the treasury on upgrades to the network. Historically, these events often preceded massive market plays, particularly when combined with strengthening market fundamentals.\nSolana (SOL): Favourable institutional standing and technical prowess, but unlikely to exceed 2x\nLike Cardano, Solana’s recent news has also been bullish. The SEC’s move to shorten ETF approval times could speed up Solana-based fund launches, and Upexi’s $330 million SOL treasury shows institutional confidence. Also, between its latest technical recovery above $200, strong RSI, and machine-learning models predicting a 2x surge to $300, it’s tempting to enter the market.\nStill, it’s hard to ignore the volatility induced into Solana’s growth narrative. Even with ETF momentum and capital inflows, much of Solana reaching its above $200 in 2025 depends on whether the big players stay interested.\nConclusion\nSolana and Cardano remain attractive market plays for those seeking 2x gains in the altcoin space. But if you're hunting for true early-stage moonshot potential, Layer Brett could be the token to watch. With the one million giveaway from Layer Brett already igniting frenzy among investors, the time to act is now.\nLayer Brett is still trading live online, but not for long. Don’t miss the limited window to get in early on the most scalable meme project to ever launch on Ethereum.\nWebsite: https://layerbrett.com\nTelegram: https://t.me/layerbrett\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "If you missed out on Tron’s (TRX) legendary 100x rise, don’t fret. The crypto market’s next big success story, Ruvi AI (RUVI), has arrived, and experts say it’s your second-best shot at securing massive gains. With its CoinMarketCap listing boosting visibility and over 220 million tokens sold in Phase 2, Ruvi AI’s presale is smashing records. This trailblazing AI project is making waves, not just for its scalability and investor demand but also for its unparalleled utility in the growing content creator economy.\nWith a 33% price jump looming and Phase 2 nearly full, here’s why Ruvi AI is rapidly gaining traction among both retail and institutional investors.\nHow the CoinMarketCap Listing Fueled Ruvi AI’s Success\nRuvi AI’s presale performance surged to incredible levels after its recent CoinMarketCap listing. For any crypto project, securing a CMC listing signals credibility, attracting a global audience eager to identify promising investments. For Ruvi AI, this listing has resulted in explosive demand among investors, propelling its presale to sky-high numbers.\nKey Presale Highlights\n- Over 220 million tokens sold, leaving just a small supply in Phase 2.\n- More than $2.8 million raised so far, reflecting strong market trust.\n- A booming community of 2,700+ investors who recognize RUVI’s potential.\nThis CMC listing has cemented Ruvi AI’s position as one of 2025’s most exciting new crypto opportunities, making its tokens a must-have for investors chasing the next big multiplier.\nThe Game-Changing Power of Ruvi AI’s Super App\nWhat sets Ruvi AI apart from speculative tokens is its real-world utility. At the core of the Ruvi AI ecosystem is its AI-powered super app, which is designed to revolutionize the $100 billion content creator economy. This app isn’t just a concept, it’s a working solution that addresses pain points for creators, marketers, and brands seeking efficiency and scale.\nCore Features of the Ruvi AI Super App\n- Trend Research in Real Time\nRuvi AI equips creators with live data insights, making it easy to identify trends and produce timely, audience-relevant content.\n- AI-Driven Automation\nFrom writing scripts to generating images and videos, Ruvi AI eliminates repetitive tasks, allowing users to focus on strategy and creativity.\n- An Integrated Workflow Hub\nSay goodbye to juggling multiple platforms. Ruvi AI provides an all-in-one solution that covers every step, from planning and creating to publishing content.\nThese features position Ruvi AI as both a high-utility project and an indispensable tool for creators worldwide, ensuring sustained token demand well beyond the presale phase.\nScalable and Accessible Through WEEX\nTo ensure global scalability and accessibility, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX, a leading cryptocurrency exchange. This strategic partnership simplifies trading and enhances financial flexibility for RUVI token holders.\nWhy the WEEX Partnership Matters\n- Worldwide Accessibility: WEEX connects Ruvi AI to a global investor base, eliminating geographic restrictions.\n- Ease of Use: New crypto enthusiasts and experienced traders alike benefit from WEEX’s seamless platform.\n- High Liquidity: Investors enjoy smooth, fast transactions, even during spikes in demand.\nThe collaboration with WEEX cements Ruvi AI’s global appeal and prepares it for mass adoption, making token ownership easy for everyone.\nHurry, The Clock Is Ticking\nRuvi AI tokens are currently priced at $0.015, offering a rare entry point into what promises to be a high-growth project. However, Phase 2 is already 80% sold out, and demand continues to climb. Once the remaining tokens are gone, the price will increase by 33% to $0.020, rewarding early backers with significant gains and reflecting RUVI’s growing market appeal.\nIf you’re eyeing high ROI, now’s the time to act before market demand pushes prices upward.\nVIP Bonuses Amplify Early Returns\nRuvi AI also offers a highly lucrative VIP bonus system, giving early investors substantial extra tokens, a rare opportunity to maximize returns before even launching on major exchanges. Each tier’s bonus dramatically boosts your ROI, with clear percentage returns for every level.\nVIP Rewards Breakdown\n- VIP 2 ($750 Investment):\n- Tokens = 50,000\n- Bonus = 20,000 additional tokens (40%)\n- Total Tokens = 70,000\n- ROI = 9233%\n- VIP 3 ($1,500 Investment):\n- Tokens = 100,000\n- Bonus = 60,000 additional tokens (60%)\n- Total Tokens = 160,000\n- ROI = 10566%\n- VIP 5 ($7,500 Investment):\n- Tokens = 500,000\n- Bonus = 500,000 additional tokens (100%)\n- Total Tokens = 1,000,000\n- ROI = 13200%\nThese VIP incentives make early investment a no-brainer, supercharging ROI before Ruvi AI even hits centralized exchanges.\nTrust and Security with a Cyberscope Audit\nRuvi AI isn’t just about promises; it’s committed to trust and transparency. The project has been audited by Cyberscope, ensuring reliable smart contracts and safeguarding investor funds. By prioritizing security, Ruvi AI elevates itself as a respectable and risk-conscious cryptocurrency option.\nWhy Ruvi AI Could Outshine Tron (TRX)\nWhile Tron (TRX) delivered incredible returns, Ruvi AI’s growth drivers are built on far more than speculation. Its proven market utility, strategic partnerships, and unprecedented presale performance give RUVI a competitive edge. With nearly every major analyst forecasting a 13,200% ROI, this crypto gem could very well outpace TRX’s early success.\nDon’t Miss Out\nRuvi AI is redefining the future of cryptocurrency by combining utility, trust, and innovation. Its record-breaking presale, CoinMarketCap listing, and scalable tech are all signs of a breakout altcoin.\nPhase 2 is almost full, buy RUVI tokens now at $0.015 before prices jump to $0.020.

        "text": "Many missed the fast gains of XRP and BONK in July. Now, another chance could be near with XYZVerse, as its price stands at just $0.0052. Signs point to rising interest and possible growth ahead. Could this be the next breakout? Explore what makes XYZVerse stand out and why it might attract attention soon.\n$XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI\nXYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game.\nWith the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project.\nWhat sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth.\nFueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto.\n$XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market\nThe $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price.\nLaunch Price: $0.0001\nPrice Now: $0.005\nNext Stage: $0.01\nFinal Presale Price: $0.02\nFollowing the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries.\nSo far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch.\nDemand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns.\nJoin $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions\nXRP: The Lightning Coin That Wants to Replace Slow Bank Transfers\nXRP was built for one job: move value fast and cheap. It runs on the XRP Ledger, a public network that anyone can see and use. No boss, no gatekeeper. Once a payment is made, it cannot be reversed or faked. The coin was born in 2012 when Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz minted 100 billion units. Most went to Ripple, the company guiding growth, with 55 billion locked in escrow to stop floods of new supply.\nIn a market hunting for speed, XRP stands out. Bitcoin can feel slow and pricey, and even Ethereum is often crowded. Ripple’s coin settles in seconds, usually costing less than a cent. That makes it handy for global transfers and small payments alike. Recent talk about central bank money and digital dollars has renewed interest in networks that bridge many currencies. If traders turn back to utility after meme coin fun, XRP could shine. Its fixed release plan also eases fear of surprise dilution.\nBonk: The Barking Coin Shaking Up Solana\nBonk came barking onto the Solana chain late last year. It is a playful coin with a Shiba Inu face, yet its goal is serious. Half of all tokens went straight to active builders and traders on Solana. This gave new hands more voice and pulled power away from big funds. After Coinbase added the coin, its price jumped more than 100% in a day. Users can now tip, pay fees, and even trade on the fresh BonkSwap market.\nThe coin rides on Solana’s fast and cheap network, so moves are quick and almost free. That makes small peer-to-peer tips easy, a space where larger coins like Bitcoin feel heavy. Bonk also sits in a lively app zone, from gaming tokens to NFT shops, giving it many doors for growth. Still, the supply is huge and meme coins swing hard. In the current uptrend, traders hunt bold stories, and Bonk fits that mood. If Solana keeps rising, this barking pup could keep running.\nConclusion\nXRP and BONK show strong potential, but the first all-sport memecoin XYZVerse stands out with a unique sports community approach and bold growth targets, positioning it as a promising new crypto movement.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Some cryptocurrency projects often seem too good to be true, and then there’s Ruvi AI (RUVI), a newcomer rewriting the rules. If you missed out on Cardano’s (ADA) rise, here’s your shot at redemption. Ruvi AI has caught the crypto community’s attention with its explosive presale success and CoinMarketCap (CMC) listing, sparking a wave of investor interest.\nThis AI-driven token, designed to revolutionize the creator economy, is powering ahead with 220 million tokens already sold and more than $2.8 million raised in funds. With Phase 2 80% complete, and a 33% price increase pending as Phase 3 approaches, investors are clamoring for what could be the fastest route to six-figure returns. Read on to see why Ruvi AI is being hailed as a standout project ready for massive growth.\nWhy the CoinMarketCap Listing Is a Game-Changer\nIt’s no secret that a CoinMarketCap listing is a credibility booster in the rapidly evolving crypto world. For Ruvi AI, this milestone has been nothing short of transformational. CoinMarketCap is the gateway to millions of global traders, and Ruvi AI is leveraging this prime visibility to skyrocket interest.\nPresale Numbers That Speak Volumes\n- 220 million tokens sold, smashing expectations and driving demand.\n- $2.8 million raised, with investors pouring into Phase 2 daily.\n- A growing network of over 2,700 investors, attracted by its impressive metrics and use case.\nThis level of traction from both retail and institutional investors cements Ruvi AI as one of 2025’s most promising entries.\nEmpowering Creators With AI\nWhile many crypto projects rely on hype, Ruvi AI stands apart with its real-world applications. Designed for the modern creator economy, Ruvi AI’s AI-powered super app is a complete game-changer. With the rise of digital content, creators are inundated with inefficiencies and tools that fail to work together. Ruvi AI’s ecosystem solves that problem with automation and seamless integration.\nThe Super App’s Highlights\n- AI Trend Insights\nThe app analyzes real-time data to spot emerging trends, helping creators stay one step ahead of their audience’s needs.\n- End-to-End Workflow Automation\nFrom generating customized scripts to producing high-quality videos and designing images, Ruvi AI’s automation tools save countless hours, all while delivering professional-grade results.\n- Streamlined, Unified Platform\nDitch juggling multiple services. This all-in-one ecosystem consolidates the entire production process, making content creation efficient and affordable.\nBy bridging the gap between creativity and technology, Ruvi AI ensures sustained demand for its tokens, giving it an edge over speculative rivals.\nStrategic Collaboration With WEEX\nFor any crypto project, accessibility to global markets is essential, and Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX, a renowned cryptocurrency exchange, ensures seamless trading for token holders.\nBenefits of WEEX Partnership\n- Worldwide Reach\nRUVI tokens are globally accessible, allowing investors from diverse locations to participate with ease.\n- User-Friendly Design\nPerfect for both beginner and seasoned investors, WEEX simplifies trading with an intuitive interface.\n- High Liquidity\nSell or buy RUVI tokens without complications, even in volatile conditions.\nThis powerful collaboration strengthens Ruvi AI’s appeal and positions it as a truly global contender.\nTime’s Ticking, 33% Price Increase Ahead\nRuvi AI’s presale is moving at breakneck speed. At its current price of $0.015 per token, Phase 2 offers an incredible entry point for early adopters. However, with Phase 2 nearing sellout, the price will jump to $0.020 during Phase 3, a 33% increase.\nInvestors acting now can lock in profits before the next wave of buyers drives prices higher. This limited-time opportunity is fueling FOMO (fear of missing out) across crypto circles.\nVIP Tiers Amplify Earning Potential\nTo sweeten the deal, Ruvi AI offers a VIP-tiered presale bonus system that rewards early adopters with additional tokens and higher ROI potential.\nVIP Breakdown\n- VIP 2 ($750 Investment):\n- Tokens = 50,000\n- Bonus = 20,000 additional tokens (40%)\n- Total Tokens = 70,000\n- Projected ROI = 9,233%.\n- VIP 3 ($1,500 Investment):\n- Tokens = 100,000\n- Bonus = 60,000 additional tokens (60%)\n- Total Tokens = 160,000\n- Projected ROI = 10,566%.\n- VIP 5 ($7,500 Investment):\n- Tokens = 500,000\n- Bonus = 500,000 additional tokens (100%)\n- Total Tokens = 1,000,000\n- Projected ROI = 13,200%.\nThese tiered incentives turn Ruvi AI into not only an attractive investment but also a potentially life-changing one.\nBuilt on Transparency and Trust\nAdding to Ruvi AI’s appeal is its CyberScope audit, which has confirmed the integrity of its smart contracts and blockchain operations.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/with-algorand-under-pressure-and-solana-targeting-320-cmcs-validation-could-make-cold-wallet-the-next-big-crypto",
        "text": "Crypto investors are once again asking which crypto to buy today as the market picks sides between momentum and utility. Solana’s price rally is building steam, with analysts projecting a breakout toward $320. In contrast, Algorand continues to languish, struggling to reclaim support or generate new demand. But amid the noise, Cold Wallet is earning validation after its CoinMarketCap (CMC) listing, offering something the others don’t: a cashback tier system that rewards users every time they interact with crypto.\nWhile price charts drive short-term headlines, utility is driving long-term value. The latest data suggests that Solana could deliver gains in the coming weeks, Algorand may remain range-bound, and Cold Wallet might quietly establish itself as the best-positioned breakout project for 2025.\nSolana Price Rally Projects $320 Target as Breakout Gains Strength\nSolana is flashing bullish across the board. The Solana price rally has broken out of a strong bull flag pattern, a setup that historically leads to rapid continuation if volume sustains. Analysts are now watching for a move toward $300 and beyond, with a $320 target on the radar. The rally is being fueled by increased institutional interest, improved chain stability, and growing activity across Solana’s DeFi and NFT platforms.\nThis is more than just technical hype. Solana’s fast transaction speeds and low fees have helped it attract developers back from other chains. Recent updates to validator economics and smart contract deployment tools are adding weight to the Solana price rally as it gains momentum. The token has flipped several resistance levels and shows no immediate signs of exhaustion.\nStill, the rally’s success depends on continuation. For investors wondering which crypto to buy today, Solana offers a proven network with near-term momentum. However, entering after a breakout always carries the risk of short-term pullbacks. While the structure is strong, the upside may be more limited for latecomers compared to earlier-stage projects like Cold Wallet.\nAlgorand Struggles to Reverse Bearish Pattern as Sentiment Stays Low\nUnlike Solana, Algorand remains under pressure. The recent Arbitrum price drop of 47% has cast a broader shadow over Layer-2 and smart contract competitors, including ALGO. Although not directly correlated, the sentiment shift has affected Algorand, which has seen minimal recovery action even as the broader market stabilizes.\nAnalysts continue to issue cautious Algorand price predictions, as the token fails to reclaim key support near the $0.20 zone. With volume thinning and ecosystem expansion slowing, buyers are hesitant. Developer growth has stalled compared to chains like Avalanche and Solana, leaving Algorand behind in the current Layer-1 race.\nThe correlation to recent trends like the Arbitrum price drop only adds to the concern. If Algorand cannot carve out a new narrative or ecosystem niche, it may continue to drift downward. For investors weighing which crypto to buy today, Algorand currently lacks the momentum, narrative, or incentives that define breakout potential. Cold Wallet, however, is offering exactly that, not through speculation, but through token-backed utility.\nCold Wallet’s CMC Listing and Cashback Tiers Redefine User Value\nCold Wallet is now officially listed on CoinMarketCap, providing real-time price visibility and credibility as it enters the radar of global investors. But more than just being trackable, Cold Wallet delivers something that few tokens do, a built-in reward system that actually gives users value every time they use crypto. That system is powered by the CWT token and a simple yet powerful cashback tier structure.\nThe model works like this: the more CWT you hold, the higher your rewards. There’s no staking, no lockups, and no technical complexity. Just hold tokens in your wallet, and Cold Wallet does the rest. Cashback is paid automatically across gas fees, swap transactions, and on/off-ramp activity.\nAt the Bronze level, users earn back 10% of their gas costs, 5% from swaps, and 5% on fiat bridges. But it scales quickly. Diamond tier holders receive 100% of their gas fees back, plus 50% on swaps and bridges. That effectively makes Cold Wallet a fee-free experience for active users, a radical change from the extractive models most wallets run on today.\nThis loyalty-based design answers the real question of which crypto to buy today by offering upside not only from potential price appreciation, but also from actual usage. The system is designed to scale, with tier thresholds and volume caps calibrated to support long-term sustainability. And as adoption grows, so too does the demand for CWT, creating an organic flywheel that most Layer-1s can’t replicate.\nWith a current presale price of $0.00998 and a projected listing price of $0.3517, Cold Wallet is offering an ROI window of 4,900% to early participants. That number alone has positioned it as a sleeper pick for the next big crypto, but it’s the tokenomics and reward structure that give it staying power.\nThe Future Outlook\nThe Solana price rally is showing real strength and presents a legitimate breakout opportunity in the near term. However, its valuation already reflects much of the upcoming gains. Algorand, weighed down by weak momentum and indirect pressure from the Arbitrum price drop, continues to struggle with a lack of buyer interest and a fading ecosystem narrative.\nIn contrast, Cold Wallet enters the scene with a compelling value loop, real utility, and a transparent CMC listing. Its cashback tier model rewards users for doing what they already do, bridging, swapping, and spending gas. Combined with early entry pricing and sustainable token mechanics, it might be the most undervalued project on the market today.\nFor those wondering which crypto to buy today, the answer might not lie in the charts alone. It might be in the ecosystem that actually pays you to participate, and Cold Wallet is making that a reality.\nExplore Cold Wallet Now:\nPresale: https://purchase.coldwallet.com/\nWebsite: https://coldwallet.com/\nX: https://x.com/coldwalletapp\nTelegram: https://t.me/ColdWalletAppOfficial\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/spartans-dominates-2025s-crypto-live-betting-scene-6-trusted-platforms-ranked",
        "text": "Live betting has become a staple, not a bonus. For players who take in-play wagering seriously, response time and system reliability are non-negotiable. In 2025, crypto adoption has become central to the live betting experience. That’s why users now expect lightning-fast platforms that offer real-time odds, quick execution, and seamless digital payouts.\nThis article reviews six of the most reliable platforms for live betting in 2025. The focus: transaction speed, crypto compatibility, and the overall live betting experience when milliseconds matter most.\n1. Spartans: The Fastest Live Betting Experience with Real-Time Crypto Payouts\nSpartans.com takes the top spot as the most dependable live betting platform in 2025. Its core strength lies in how well it merges fast crypto payments with live betting on sports like football, UFC, NBA, and esports. Bet execution is instant, with no freezing or lag, giving users full control in real time.\nThe odds engine works continuously, adjusting prices as games unfold. This allows players to respond to game dynamics without missing a beat. Spartans uses a unified crypto wallet system that supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and other major coins. Wagers and withdrawals happen without the delay of third-party banking.\nWhat truly separates Spartans is its commitment to instant withdrawals. Players don’t have to wait for approval. Winnings go directly to the wallet as soon as bets settle. For active users who roll over bets quickly, this is a game-changer.\nWith strong mobile design, 24/7 match coverage, and high-speed infrastructure, Spartans stands out as the number one option for live crypto betting in 2025.\n2. Stake.com: Strong Coverage but Slightly Slower Under Pressure\nStake.com remains a familiar name in crypto betting circles. Its live betting section includes a wide range of global and niche events. The layout is easy to use and offers decent crypto support.\nHowever, the platform shows slight weakness in odds locking during busy matches. These minor delays and occasional lag can reduce the betting precision some users expect. Though Stake is still a trusted option, it trails behind Spartans in areas like execution speed and real-time cashout efficiency, two vital features in live betting.\n3. Roobet: Clean Crypto Interface with Room for Speed Improvements\nRoobet appeals to crypto users with its streamlined interface and clear design. It offers solid coverage across football, basketball, and mixed martial arts. The site handles crypto well and makes navigation simple.\nStill, Roobet’s live odds system occasionally lags, particularly during fast-paced games. For casual players, this might not be an issue. But for those placing multiple live bets, the lack of real-time stat tracking and slower withdrawals may be a downside. While Roobet remains dependable overall, it's less suitable for fast-action bettors.\n4. Betano: Deep Sports Markets but Slower on Withdrawals\nBetano delivers when it comes to the number of live betting markets. It supports both fiat and crypto payments, giving users flexibility. Coverage includes all the major sports: football, tennis, and basketball among them.\nThe main drawback is speed. Betano doesn’t yet offer rapid crypto withdrawals, which matters more to crypto-centric bettors. The platform remains reliable and well-rounded, but when compared to faster sites like Spartans, it lacks the pace needed for intense live play. Betano is best for variety, not urgency.\n5. BetMGM: Reliable Legacy Platform Not Built for Crypto Speed\nAs a legacy operator, BetMGM holds its ground in the 2025 betting space. The platform continues to serve up live markets for NFL, NBA, MLB, and other major American leagues. Mobile performance has improved, and its odds remain competitive.\nHowever, BetMGM is still centered on fiat systems. Withdrawals take longer, especially when using traditional banking routes. While the brand is known for its reliability, crypto users and speed-focused players may find it limiting during live matches.\n6. Gamdom: Esports-Focused Platform with Casual Live Play\nGamdom finds its audience with crypto bettors who prefer a casual vibe. Its live betting suite focuses heavily on esports and football. Navigation is clean, and the crypto support is adequate.\nThat said, Gamdom’s odds updates aren’t always consistent during play. Payout speed also varies based on the digital coin used. For laid-back users, it’s a fun environment. But those needing live stats, rapid bet execution, and fast exits may look toward more performance-driven platforms.\nSpartans Sets the Standard for Crypto Live Betting in 2025\nSpeed, trust, and seamless crypto integration are now essential for live betting platforms in 2025. Spartans leads the list thanks to its fast odds, instant bet handling, and same-moment withdrawals. It’s built for users who bet often and want results delivered without waiting.\nStake.com and Roobet remain solid contenders, but they lack the consistent real-time flow Spartans offer. Platforms like Betano, BetMGM, and Gamdom serve their niches but don’t match the pace required for competitive live play.\nFor users demanding precision, payout speed, and top crypto support, Spartans is the clear winner among 2025’s trusted live betting sites.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/while-doge-stalls-xyzverse-rallies-could-the-sports-meme-coin-deliver-25000-gains",
        "text": "Dogecoin’s price has struggled to gain momentum lately, while XYZVerse, a new sports-themed meme coin, has captured attention with strong gains. Questions are rising about whether XYZVerse could match—or even beat—legendary surges seen in past meme coin rallies. With bold claims of huge returns, eyes now turn to what sets XYZVerse apart.\nXYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin?\nThe buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch.\nThe current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price.\nBullish Mood on $XYZ\nXYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow.\nXYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster, who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.”\nMore Than Just a Meme Coin\nUnlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value.\nRight now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention.\nStill Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends\nBeyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time.\nA Community-Driven Project With Big Plans\nOne thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility.\nThe recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use.\nAs part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem.\nCould XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin?\nWith a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look.\nJoin XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity\nDogecoin (DOGE)\nSource: TradingView\nDogecoin is drifting between $0.18 and $0.24 after a choppy week. The token slid 6.22% in 7 days, trimming part of a strong 23.18% climb over the past month. Even with that rebound, the 6-month chart still shows a 15.94% loss. Short traders watch the 10-day average at $0.21 that now sits a touch above the 100-day line at $0.20, hinting at a fresh trend in the making.\nMomentum tools back that view. RSI at 60 points to steady buying. Stochastic at 74 and a positive MACD level add fuel. Bulls have eyes on the nearest ceiling at $0.27. A clean break could unlock the next target near $0.33.\nIf buyers regain control, DOGE could add around 12% to reach $0.27 and roughly 25% more to tap $0.33. Failure to hold $0.21 opens the door to $0.15, implying a drop of about 17%. For now, the data tilts slightly green.\nConclusion\nDOGE has performed well, but XYZVerse is the first all-sports memecoin uniting major fans. With unique utility and growth plans, XYZ targets even bigger gains ahead.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Readers will discover which coins are gaining momentum and why these developments shouldn't be overlooked.\nOutset PR continuously strives to deliver top-tier crypto communications and sharp, data-backed perspectives on where the next breakout stories may unfold. These insights are part of that ongoing effort.\nEthereum's Bright Future: Ready for the Next Bull Run\nSource: tradingview\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is known for its smart contract capabilities. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum's value lies in its ability to support decentralized applications and digital agreements. The recent market dip might look worrying, but it mirrors past cycles where Ethereum rebounded stronger. In the 2021 bull run, ETH surged alongside Bitcoin, driving the growth of decentralized finance and NFTs. As the crypto world evolves, Ethereum's planned upgrades could boost its efficiency and scalability. This resilience and potential for innovation make Ethereum a promising choice for investors looking to capitalize on the next market upswing. Ethereum’s future looks bright as it continues to lead in blockchain development.\nSOL Ready to Shine Bright in the Next Altcoin Season?\nSource: tradingview\nSOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain, stands out with its high speed and low cost transactions. Dubbed one of Ethereum's strongest rivals, Solana can process thousands of transactions per second, making it an attractive choice for developers and users. Its ecosystem is rapidly growing, with numerous projects launching. Even in a market dip, SOL shows resilience and potential for growth. As patterns repeat and markets rebound, the efficiency and scalability of Solana position it well for the next altcoin season.

        "text": "Mantle, a leading modular blockchain ecosystem, has unveiled its most ambitious initiative to date: UR, a borderless smart money app and crypto-first neobank designed to simplify and unify financial experiences. The initiative, with beta testing access now live, marks an important step in Mantle’s mission to build products that bridge decentralized and traditional finance (DeFi and TradFi) for real-world utility. According to Mantle's recent updates, Q3 2025 and onwards will be a transformative period for the ecosystem's role in the global financial landscape\nUR combines the usability of modern neobanks with the infrastructure of DeFi, empowering users to spend, save, and invest across fiat and crypto within a single account. The initiative is backed by the Mantle Network’s high-performance modular blockchain and one of the largest community-owned treasuries in the crypto space.\nMantle Ecosystem at a Glance\nMantle is a pioneering on-chain ecosystem and comprises innovative products like Mantle Network, mETH Protocol, Function's Bitcoin (FBTC), Mantle Index Four (MI4), UR, and MantleX. Mantle Network, the foundational infrastructure layer, has recently fully integrated EigenDA on mainnet and Succinct's zkVM on testnet, and is set to enable scalability technologies like EigenDA, OP Stack, and Succinct’s zk proofs, enabling scalability, security, and speed for next-gen financial applications.\nThe newly announced UR initiative is part of a broader strategy to position Mantle as the go-to infrastructure for crypto-native finance, further strengthened by MI4 — a tokenized crypto fund for diversified exposure.\nBanking Reinvented: UR Mantle’s Crypto-Neobank\nUR addresses a common pain point in the digital economy — the fragmented relationship between fiat and crypto accounts. While users typically juggle bank accounts and wallets across platforms, Mantle offers one app for all financial needs, making it easy to spend and off-ramp from a single place.\nKey Features:\n-\nUnified Account for fiat and crypto balances.\n-\nVirtual and Physical Cards for multi-currency global spending.\n-\nAuto-Allocation into MI4 fund or DeFi strategies.\n-\nCredit Lines backed by on-chain assets like mETH and FBTC.\n-\nCashback-Style Yield Rewards with the Mantle Rewards Station, where users can lock MNT to boost their \"MNT Power\" and earn rewards.\n-\nDirect Salary Deposits with real-time tokenization options.\nUR promises the simplicity of Revolut and Apple Pay, but supercharged with DeFi functionality. Users can receive their salary in fiat, instantly convert to stablecoins, and spend or invest — all without ever leaving the app.\nTimeline and Rollout Plan\nMantle’s roadmap outlines a multi-phase rollout of UR, with beta testing currently live for users. The project has signaled that Q3 2025 and beyond will be a key period for focusing on compliance, product testing, and global accessibility.\n|\nMilestone |\nTimeline |\n|\nBeta Testing & Waitlist |\nQ2 2025 (LIVE) |\n|\nEarly Access Launch |\nQ3 2025 |\n|\nGlobal Expansion & Cards |\nQ4 2025 - Q1 2026 |\n|\nFull Suite + MI4 Integration |\n2026 Onward |\nRegulatory frameworks are being evaluated per region, with Mantle prioritizing user safety, compliance, and transparency throughout the banking experience.\nValue for Token Holders and the Ecosystem\nFor $MNT holders, UR means direct benefits through:\n-\nAccess to Mantle's exclusive tools, such as Mantle Index Four and credit lines.\n-\nReward opportunities via Mantle Missions and governance.\n-\nUtility boost for MNT, which serves as the native gas, ecosystem growth, and governance token, along with mETH, and FBTC across financial services.\n-\nVoting power in shaping product evolution and integrations, as key decisions for the DAO-governed network are made by MNT holders.\nFor the broader ecosystem, UR becomes the anchor of a self-sustaining financial loop. It enhances capital efficiency, simplifies crypto onboarding, and positions Mantle Network as the “Blockchain for Banking” of Web3.\nEasy Access to $MNT on StealthEX\nTo participate in Mantle’s growing financial ecosystem, users can easily acquire $MNT tokens on StealthEX — an instant crypto exchange platform that supports non-custodial, registration-free swaps.\nStealthEX Highlights:\n-\nInstant $MNT purchases via Mantle’s dedicated page.\n-\nOver 2,000 trading pairs.\n-\nNo registration or KYC required.\n-\nHigh-speed crypto-to-crypto conversions.\nWhether staking, participating in the Mantle Rewards Station, joining governance, or preparing for UR features, StealthEX is a top-tier solution to buy and swap $MNT quickly and securely.\nFinal Thoughts: A Bank for the Web3 Generation\nMantle’s latest developments confirm its ambition to lead not just in blockchain performance, but in creating tangible financial value for everyday users. The new UR app isn't just another app — it's a shift toward real-world crypto utility.\nAs the coming months progress, users and token holders can expect increased engagement, AMAs with core contributors, and feature rollouts aligned with live events like Token2049 Dubai and EthCC.\nMantle is not imagining the future of finance — it’s building it.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/top-cryptos-to-buy-despite-market-chaos-why-sol-uni-blockdag-and-apt-refuse-to-slow-down",
        "text": "August 2025 is turning into one of the most volatile stretches crypto has seen in years. Regulatory shifts, spot ETF speculations, and renewed geopolitical tension are reshaping liquidity flows daily. Despite this, BlockDAG, Solana, Uniswap, and Aptos are being talked about as possible frontrunners for the next breakout cycle.\nEach carries a very different thesis: speed, infrastructure, or scaling solutions, all while navigating a market still recovering from spring’s drawdowns. Picking the top cryptos to buy this cycle isn’t about hype anymore; it’s about identifying projects proving real utility, building active ecosystems, and showing enough traction to weather the inevitable storms that 2025 still has in store.\n1. BlockDAG: 3,025% Launch ROI Waiting for New Holders\nTime is running out on what has become one of the most active presales in blockchain’s history. BlockDAG has already secured $365 million, sold 24.8 billion BDAG, and drawn in 200,000 holders, yet the defining factor now is speed. The $0.0016 price closes on August 11, before moving to a projected $0.05 listing, a 3,025% jump from today’s level.\nThe urgency isn’t abstract. BlockDAG’s demo trading dashboard V4 shows it in real time: buy and sell orders stacking, balances updating instantly, market activity running like a full exchange even before launch.\nAdoption is already widespread: 2.5 million mobile miners, over 19,000 hardware miners sold, and 4,500 builders preparing 300+ Web3 projects to deploy immediately post-launch. This isn’t a project waiting for life; it’s alive now, and pricing reflects a final, brief window before it’s gone.\nWhen the clock hits August 11, entry at this level disappears. The market will move, and this stage, this price, and this early access to BlockDAG will only exist as a missed opportunity.\n2. Solana: Speed Isn’t a Feature, It’s the Brand\nSolana (SOL) continues to flex what most blockchains can’t: raw velocity. Using its Proof-of-History clock alongside Proof-of-Stake, it pushes thousands of transactions per second for fractions of a cent.\nEven with geopolitical risk rattling risk assets, Solana’s app ecosystem raked in over $1B in quarterly revenue, proving it’s more than hype. Price-wise, SOL is hovering around $164, struggling to regain early-year highs. Yet, a 95% chance of a U.S. spot ETF approval could make it one of the top cryptos to buy for those betting on institutional capital flowing into fast chains.\n3. Uniswap: The DEX That Refuses to Stand Still\nUniswap (UNI) pioneered the AMM model, making token swaps possible without order books or gatekeepers. Years later, it’s still dictating how decentralized exchanges work, and now it wants its own chain.\nThe incoming Unichain, built with Optimism’s OP Stack, promises block times under 250ms and fees nearly 20x cheaper than Ethereum. UNI recently broke past $9 on this news, but the chart still lags far behind its $44 peak. Among the top cryptos to buy today, Uniswap’s value lies in owning the rails where the next generation of DeFi could run.\n4. Aptos: Scaling Without the Chaos\nAptos (APT) isn’t the loudest L1, but it quietly solves what many chains can’t: scalability with fewer bugs. It recently surpassed 3.6M monthly active accounts, with DEX aggregator Panora hitting $1B in trading volume.\nDespite this, APT slipped 1.3% over the month, in line with Bitcoin’s sluggish pace. Developers are rolling out Move 2.0 to make smart contracts more flexible, aiming to attract heavier dApp traffic. For those scouting the top crypto to buy ahead of a broader altcoin rebound, Aptos looks like a builder’s chain waiting for its market moment.\nWhich Is the Top Crypto to Buy Now?\nAll four projects sit on very different fundamentals: Solana leans on unmatched speed, Uniswap continues to dominate DeFi’s base layer, and Aptos builds for scalability. Yet the current market is rewarding clarity, live adoption, and measurable early-stage value.\nBlockDAG stands out here, not because of projections, but because the market is already forming around it before launch, with a real-time trading dashboard and tens of thousands of builders preparing its ecosystem. In a cycle where speculation is thinning out, the top cryptos to buy are those proving they can command demand before listings go live, and BlockDAG is already doing exactly that.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Ripple and Shiba Inu are set for major gains in the coming year, drawing attention from both new and seasoned investors. However, early signals point to an even more staggering surge for XYZVerse. Experts are eyeing triple-digit growth for the well-known tokens, but it’s XYZVerse’s outrageous potential that could steal the show.\n$XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI\nXYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game.\nWith the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project.\nWhat sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth.\nFueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto.\n$XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market\nThe $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price.\nLaunch Price: $0.0001\nPrice Now: $0.005\nNext Stage: $0.01\nFinal Presale Price: $0.02\nFollowing the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries.\nSo far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch.\nDemand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns.\nJoin $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions!\nXRP: The Lightning Coin That Wants to Replace Slow Bank Transfers\nXRP was built for one job: move value fast and cheap. It runs on the XRP Ledger, a public network that anyone can see and use. No boss, no gatekeeper. Once a payment is made, it cannot be reversed or faked. The coin was born in 2012 when Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz minted 100 billion units. Most went to Ripple, the company guiding growth, with 55 billion locked in escrow to stop floods of new supply.\nIn a market hunting for speed, XRP stands out. Bitcoin can feel slow and pricey, and even Ethereum is often crowded. Ripple’s coin settles in seconds, usually costing less than a cent. That makes it handy for global transfers and small payments alike. Recent talk about central bank money and digital dollars has renewed interest in networks that bridge many currencies. If traders turn back to utility after meme coin fun, XRP could shine. Its fixed release plan also eases fear of surprise dilution.\nShiba Inu: From Meme to Mighty—Can SHIB Bite Hard in This Bull Run?\nShiba Inu, or SHIB, began in August 2020 as a playful answer to Dogecoin. Unlike Doge, it lives on the busy Ethereum network, so it fits easily with many apps there. Its unknown creator, Ryoshi, released one quadrillion coins and sent half to Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin. He later gave a chunk to India’s Covid fund and burned 40 % of all coins, turning headlines into rocket fuel. SHIB now powers ShibaSwap, and plans include an art market for NFTs and a vote-driven community hub.\nMemes still rule the market, and fresh money keeps chasing low-priced tokens. SHIB’s link to Ethereum gives it more room to grow than most joke coins, while new burns keep shrinking supply. Dogecoin depends on tweets; SHIB can plug into every new Ethereum upgrade, from faster fees to future side chains. As Bitcoin edges toward its next halving, traders often flow into smaller coins seeking sharper moves. With active devs, loud fans, and an entry price under a cent, SHIB looks ready to wag in the coming cycle.\nConclusion\nXRP and SHIB are set for strong gains, but XYZVerse stands out. As the first all-sport memecoin, XYZ brings together sports fans and meme lovers, aiming for game-changing growth and community rewards. Early participation offers unique benefits as the project targets long-term success and mainstream appeal.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Husky Inu (HINU) has registered yet another price increase, closing out a hugely significant week with the token’s value rising from $0.00019406 to $0.00019519. The price increase comes only a day after the previous one.\nThe project’s regular price increases are part of its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. It also reached a major fundraising milestone on July 25, crossing the $850,000 milestone. The next price increase would see the token’s value rise to $0.00019576.\nHusky Inu (HINU) Up To $0.00019519\nHusky Inu (HINU) is closing a milestone week with its latest price increase, rising from $0.00019406 to $0.00019519. The price increase is part of its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The pre-launch phase aims to empower the fledgling Husky Inu community, continuing its fundraising efforts as its launch date draws closer. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion.\nHusky Inu adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, allowing it to raise the HINU token’s value every two days. This has been instrumental in the project’s fundraising efforts, helping it cross key fundraising milestones. It has also helped Husky Inu raise funds while maintaining a favorable price for its fledgling community. The pricing strategy rewards early adopters of the project while promoting transparent growth. With the pre-launch phases underway, token prices will steadily increase every two days, following a compounded growth model, and will continue rising until all tokens sell out. The pre-launch phase is designed to empower the Husky Inu community and ensure those joining the project can benefit from favorable pricing.\nA Huge Week For Husky Inu (HINU)\nHusky Inu has had a hugely significant week, which saw the project launch its very own cryptocurrency exchange, SwapCrypto.com. The launch was a substantial step for the Husky Inu ecosystem, reinforcing its commitment to providing value to its nascent user base and building real-world utility. Unlike other memecoins that depend on hype and speculation, Husky Inu is dedicated to its utility and long-term vision. Instead of becoming just another memecoin, it is creating the infrastructure to give its community the tools to engage with digital finance. SwapCrypto.com enhances Husky Inu’s growing ecosystem and solidifies its position in an increasingly competitive DeFi ecosystem.\nThe exchange offers an array of features, some of which are listed below.\n-\nOver 500 cryptocurrencies supported\n-\nQuick transactions with real-time exchange rates.\n-\nCredit and debit card integration to complete transactions on the platform\n-\n24/7 customer support\n-\nNon-custodial operations to prioritize privacy and control\n-\nNo account or KYC required for crypto swaps\nFast Approaching the $900,000 Milestone\nHusky Inu is closing in on a major fundraising milestone. The project’s presale and pre-launch phases have allowed it to cross several key fundraising milestones. The HINU token’s value remained constant during the presale. However, the project adopted a dynamic and progressive pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, increasing the price of the HINU token every two days. This has allowed the project to raise funds quickly while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering its growing community.\nThe project crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached its latest milestone in record time, crossing $850,000 on July 25. Husky Inu has raised $870,398 so far.\nVisit the following links for more information on Husky Inu:\n-\nWebsite: Husky Inu Official Website\n-\nTwitter: Husky Inu Twitter\n-\nTelegram: Husky Inu Telegram\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Crypto Gaming: A New Era for Online Gambling\nOnline gamblers have probably noticed the transformation that gambling is undergoing. The digital currency sector has created crypto gaming, which represents the direction gaming is taking into the future. So, what is crypto gaming? Well, you're about to find out that it is changing the way people play, win, and experience online casino games.\nThe traditional casino experience has transformed because of blockchain technology. The basic concept of crypto gaming requires players to use digital currencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum to both stake bets and withdraw winnings at online casinos.\nBlockchain technology allows people to access their money quickly with safer transactions, while removing the requirement for bank or credit card participation.\nThe Blockchain and gambling are a match made in heaven because it enables the system to operate efficiently while providing total transparency to users. Through blockchain technology, you can independently confirm the fairness of games in addition to trusting their authenticity.\nOnce you understand what crypto gaming is, head over to BetUS slots casino and try your luck with the future of gambling. BetUS is ahead of the competition as an online crypto casino, and as mentioned earlier, crypto gaming is guaranteed to be fair.\nBlockchain: The Key to Fairness and Speed\nThe blockchain drives crypto gaming operations while delivering excellent results to players. All financial operations, including wagers, winnings, and payment distributions, become part of the blockchain network. The blockchain system lets you observe the destination of your funds while also allowing you to verify game fairness.\nThe blockchain eliminates the requirement for intermediaries and minimizes both delays and confusion. The process of winning at crypto gaming results in automatic instant transfers of your winnings into your crypto wallet.\nWhy Crypto Casinos Are Booming\nCrypto casinos continue to expand rapidly for multiple reasons.\n-\nThe blockchain allows you to observe your bets and payouts as they occur in real-time through its transparent records. You know the games are fair.\n-\nNo waiting period exists. You don’t need to wait to be verified to play or to withdraw winnings when playing at crypto casinos. Payouts in crypto gaming happen without delay.\n-\nPrivacy: You don’t need to share your personal info or banking details. The digital wallet system maintains complete security for your assets.\n-\nThe borderless nature of crypto gaming enables users to access its services from any location in the world.\nThe combination of benefits in crypto casinos makes them the preferred choice among players because they provide faster, more secure, and equitable gaming compared to traditional casinos.\nAI and Smart Contracts: The Future of Gambling\nThe field extends beyond cryptocurrency usage. The gaming industry experiences transformations from both AI and smart contracts. The use of AI technology enables casinos to deliver customized promotional deals that enhance gameplay for better user experiences. The system provides users with access to an advanced version of casino operations that offers smart and intuitive gameplay.\nSmart contracts are a true game-changer. Self-executing contracts through smart contracts provide instant, automatic payments to winners. All blockchain-based systems provide automatic instant payouts without human interaction because they include built-in payment mechanisms.\nAre Traditional Casinos On the Way Out?\nThe numerous advancements in the field lead some to believe traditional casinos will disappear completely. Cryptocurrency and gaming are evolving together, and there is no limit to the possibilities. But, the complete casino experience at a real location includes the combination of sounds with atmosphere and social interaction, which remains unmatched by alternative methods.\nTraditional casinos might lose customer demand because more people embrace decentralized gambling and AI-powered platforms, although real casinos will persist. The trend of crypto gaming will most likely push traditional casinos to adopt this technology to stay competitive.\nThe Future of Gambling: Fair, Fast, and Secure\nWhere is this all going? Now that you understand what crypto gaming is, it's easy to see that it’s establishing itself as the leading direction for the future. Blockchain technology, alongside smart contracts and AI, drives the transformation of everything toward faster operations with better transparency and stronger security measures. Every player who wants to experience blackjack and slot games should try crypto gaming for all the reasons discussed above.\nThe time has arrived to experience crypto gaming if you haven't already. The slot casino at BetUS offers an excellent starting point for new players to explore the world of crypto gaming.

        "text": "The cryptocurrency market has seen many tokens experience massive growth, with some projects delivering substantial returns for early investors. Ozak AI, a blockchain-powered AI platform, is currently in its presale phase, with its native token, $OZ, priced at $0.003. Analysts suggest that if the token reaches $1 by 2025, investors could see 500x returns, making it one of the most-watched projects in the market.\nOzak AI’s Growth Potential and Market Position\nOzak AI unites artificial intelligence with blockchain technology which represent the fastest-moving sectors in the market. Users access AI-powered trading analytics and OSN (Ozak Stream Network) provides a decentralized framework on this platform. Regulatory intelligence suggests that combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology enables more industries such as finance and healthcare, to choose AI solutions.\nThe market interest in Ozak AI becomes evident through its successful presale results. The project has managed to sell beyond 120 million tokens, which led to a total fund collection of $900,000. The project uses a planned price elevation strategy that will advance to $0.005 for the succeeding presale run.\nHow Much Would Investors Need for $1 Million?\nAt the price of $0.005, an investor would need to invest $5,000 to buy 1 million $OZ tokens, which would be worth $1 million if the price rises to $1.\nEven a $100 investment at $0.005 per token would buy 20,000 $OZ tokens, which would be worth $20,000 if the price reaches $1. Similarly, a $500 investment would buy 100,000 tokens, worth $100,000 at $1 per token.\nTo achieve a $1 million portfolio, investors should make a $5,000 investment at the current price to get 1 million tokens. If Ozak AI reaches a value of $1 per token, the $5,000 investment becomes worth $1,000,000. With a token price of $0.50 per unit, the $5,000 investment would be worth $500,000.\nExpert Predictions and Market Risks\nThe growing need for AI solutions leads market analysts to predict good performance among AI-focused cryptocurrencies. The crypto market shows unpredictable characteristics despite warnings from a few experts. Ozak AI's achievement hinges on its advancement along with partnership formation and market acceptance.\nThe market value of Ozak AI is set to increase steadily if it experiences growth alongside successful strategic partnership acquisitions, according to analyst projections. The ongoing presale attracts more investors as additional support for the token's value to potentially reach its predicted targets.\nFor more information about Ozak AI, visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

With explosive community engagement, genuine Layer 2 utility, and a remarkable presale, Layer Brett could be the next breakout sensation that no one saw coming. Here’s why!\nMeme Revolution Meets Real Blockchain Power With LBRETT\nThe memecoin space has evolved significantly since the early days of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Initially driven by social media hype, these projects have matured into communities that can propel explosive price surges. With the emergence of Layer Brett, the market is shifting its focus toward tokens that promise more than just speculative gains.\nUnlike typical tokens that clog up slow chains, Layer Brett runs on Ethereum’s Layer 2 for speed, scale, and savings. Its architecture rivals top Ethereum Layer 2 giants like Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync, but with a twist: LBRETT was born from the community, not corporate boardrooms. With near-instant transactions and pennies for gas, LBRETT escapes Ethereum Layer 1 congestion without giving up its security.\nWhen it comes to earning with LBRETT, you can stake LBRETT in seconds, using ETH, USDT, or BNB, with no KYC, no middlemen, and full control over your assets. The project’s gamified staking, NFT integrations and transparent tokenomics make it more than just a hype coin. It's a self-sustaining, community-first network built for the long haul. And there’s more; a $1 million giveaway is already in motion. If you missed the last wave of memecoins, LBRETT offers you a second chance.\nIs DOGE Still Deserving Of The Title of MemeFi’s Best?\nDespite maintaining the top spot in the memecoin space, Dogecoin has faced significant challenges in recent weeks. The coin has experienced a decline of over 20% in the past 14 days, resulting in a loss of nearly $11 billion in market cap, which now stands at around $30 billion. The slide hasn’t gone unnoticed. Liquidations have piled on pressure and as a result, DOGE has dipped lower.\nHowever, CoinDesk pointed out that a spike in trading volume drove prices down which pushed DOGE price into a critical support zone. Technically, the chart is holding up, for now. The $0.20 mark is where DOGE’s 200-day moving average meets a key Fibonacci level. Despite the Dogecoin price dip, this recent fall doesn’t scream collapse, it feels more like a pause. Whales seem to agree, scooping up DOGE while it’s weak. That could signal a setup for the next move higher.\nPEPE Shows Weak Price Potential Due To Recent Development\nLike DOGE, PEPE also doesn't possess the same fiery potential it debuted in the DeFi market. PEPE's recent price swings have shaken the community, especially after it slipped to a local low of $0.000010. Much of the damage to Pepe Coin’s growth came after Arthur Hayes, BitMex’s co-founder, offloaded over $13 million in assets. Among those were more than 38 billion PEPE tokens.\nPEPE dropped another 4% in the 24 hours that followed. However, despite the chaos, PEPE held just above the $0.000010 line, which is a level many traders view as key. With this news in mind, It’s easy to believe that Hayes’ exit played a big role in more than 15% loss in Pepe Coin’s value over the past two weeks.\nConclusion\nIf you missed DOGE and PEPE’s Web3 debut, LBRETT is your golden window to enjoy incredible early-bird benefits. The presale is live right now, and with entry prices low and rewards high, early backers are primed for major gains.\nCan You Afford To Miss LBRETT’s Climb To Crypto Stardom?

        "text": "President Trump has signed an executive order allowing 401(k) retirement plans to include crypto and other alternative assets, opening the $12.5 trillion market to digital investments while raising concerns around investor protection and fiduciary responsibility.\nExecutive Order Opens Retirement Accounts to Crypto\nU.S. President Donald Trump has signed a sweeping executive order aimed at integrating alternative investments, including cryptocurrency, private equity, and real estate, into the $12.5 trillion 401(k) retirement market. The move is designed to modernize retirement portfolios and provide Americans with access to potentially higher-yielding asset classes previously restricted by regulatory constraints.\nAccording to the White House, outdated regulations and the threat of litigation have long hindered retirees from exploring diversified portfolios. The executive order emphasizes the need for “competitive returns and asset diversification” to ensure long-term financial security for American workers.\nRegulatory Agencies Instructed to Ease Access\nThe order directs the U.S. Labor Secretary and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue clearer guidance and review existing rules that limit alternative assets in defined contribution plans. While it stops short of mandating additional legal protections for such investments, it calls for clarifying fiduciary responsibilities to shield plan providers from legal risk when offering these options.\nA senior administration official noted that the guidance would assist retirement plan sponsors in safely integrating new asset classes while addressing regulatory ambiguity that has previously discouraged adoption.\nIndustry Reaction and Market Impact\nIndustry groups, including the Managed Funds Association, have expressed cautious support. CEO Bryan Corbett stated the association welcomes broader access to alternatives, provided investor safeguards are put in place.\nFinancial markets responded positively. Bitcoin surged past $116,500 following the announcement, while Ethereum rose over 7%. Shares of crypto-related companies, including Coinbase, also rallied, signaling strong investor confidence in the administration’s initiative.\nIf widely adopted, the policy could be a windfall for firms such as Blackstone, KKR, and Apollo, which dominate private equity, as well as for digital asset managers looking to establish a stronger foothold in institutional portfolios.\nQuestions Around Risk and Investor Protection\nWhile the executive order promotes diversification and financial innovation, it has also reignited concerns. Critics warn that alternative investments, particularly crypto and private equity, involve higher fees, less liquidity, and greater risk compared to traditional options like mutual funds and bonds.\nMajor retirement plan providers such as Vanguard and Fidelity have acknowledged the development, with Vanguard stating its commitment to educating investors but stopping short of committing to any specific product offerings.\nAs the Labor Department and SEC begin drafting new guidance, plan sponsors and advisors will need to carefully weigh the risks before expanding retirement plan menus to include digital and private assets.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Renewed optimism in Bitcoin was sparked on Thursday as the $BTC price rose just over 2%, equating to a dollar gain of around $2,500. This move may not be over on Friday as the price has started to rise again after a short reversal. However, with buying fatigue starting to set in for bulls, and the price approaching the top of the bull flag and the $118,000 resistance, is a rejection the most likely outcome?\nBullish news for Bitcoin, but is the market running out of steam?\nIncredibly bullish news for Bitcoin continues to drop. On Thursday, President Trump signed an executive order giving US citizens access to the purchase of $BTC for their 401(k) savings plans. To add to the pro-crypto news, Trump also signed an order preventing banks from denying services to crypto companies.\nAll this good news for the crypto industry had the effect of providing an upward impulse to the price on Thursday, and with $BTC approaching the top of its bull flag, there may be enough buying momentum with which to get there.\nHowever, if one takes a measurement from the $112,000 swing low for this upside move, it is now at just over 5% and the bulls are starting to run out of steam. It may just be that there could be several days of sideways and downwards price action to come, which would allow momentum indicators to reset, and provide the possibility of a more reliable breakout.\nPrice reversal at the top of the bull flag?\nSource: TradingView\nThe 4-hour chart shows the latest price action. It can be seen that the breakout of the W pattern did eventually happen. This took the $BTC price beyond $117,000, and a long candle wick down confirmed the breakout, as well as providing evidence of the huge intent of the bulls to buoy the price up.\nAs things stand, the price is currently taking hold above $116,800 which might now be a tenuous support. It could be that there is enough momentum in the tank to take the price back up to the $117,450 resistance, and even to the top of the bull flag, which coincides with the $118,000 resistance level.\nBe that as it may, all shorter term Stochastic RSI indicators are now at or near the top, suggesting that this upward impulse may be about to come to an end. The top of the bull flag would be an ideal place for a reversal to occur.\nRSI trend break on daily time frame\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily chart reveals a critical signal in the Relative Strength Index. Looking at the bottom of the chart it can be seen that there are two descending trendlines. The first one was for the previous bull flag, and the second for this current bull flag.\nWhen the first trendline was broken it led to the huge 25% upswing in price action. Going forward to the current bull flag it can be observed that the indicator line on the RSI has just broken through the descending trendline, and could be confirming the breakout right now.\nThere is still the rest of the day to come, and so there is the possibility that if the price does turn back down, a fakeout could be the end result. That said, if the indicator line remains above the trendline at the end of today this would be very bullish.\nCan 5 years of bearish divergence be cancelled out?\nSource: TradingView\nZooming all the way out into the monthly chart the RSI indicator can be seen right beneath the descending trendline that goes all the way back to Q1 of 2021. Getting above this trendline is a make or break situation. If the bulls can push the price up and the downtrend can be broken, there could be a massive upward impulse. However, even if this scenario comes to fruition, the RSI indicator will need to continue up and eventually get above 91.5 in order to cancel out around 5 years of bearish divergence.\nThis is the tallest of tall tasks, and it is likely to need an event such as sovereign countries like the US committing to buying large amounts of Bitcoin. This is certainly a possibility, but will it happen in time to save this Bitcoin bull run?\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "text": "Despite the pullback in the crypto market, Ripple, Cardano, and Unilabs are emerging as the best DeFi coins with massive ROI potential in 2025. The Ripple price is predicted to soar to $7, while Cardano is expected to climb to $1.80.\nAlso, Unilabs (UNIL), a new rising star, is revolutionizing the DeFi investment space using artificial intelligence. With its strong market momentum and potential impact, Unilabs could deliver huge returns of up to 20x to investors seeking the next best crypto to buy.\nRipple (XRP) Price Primed for Major Gains, Says Analyst\nCrypto King, a market analyst, believes the Ripple price is building momentum for what could be a historic bull run. According to the expert, $XRP has already shown its resilience and long-term potential.\nAfter staying in a downtrend from July to November 2024, the Ripple price broke out and surged with a massive 585% return, proving that patience pays off for holders.\nWhile the first two quarters of 2025 remained relatively quiet, the Ripple price once again began gaining traction following another key breakout in July. This move alone has already resulted in a 70% increase, even before the broader bull market officially kicks in.\nCrypto King insists that the real rally is just getting started. He expects the DeFi coin price to rally to $7.00. Meanwhile, technical analysis shows the Ripple price is gaining bullish momentum. The RSI has crossed the midline, and the ADI flashes a buy signal.\nData from CoinMarketCap shows the Ripple price has been trading along the $2.80-$3.20 range in the weekly chart. Bulls could break the upper level in the coming weeks with sustained buying pressure and high volume.\nAli Martinez Cites Condition For Cardano (ADA) Uptrend\nIn a recent post on X, on-chain analyst Ali_Charts noted that the Cardano price has been trading in a descending channel since the beginning of the year. The Cardano price is currently at the channel's upper part and falling towards the middle.\nMeanwhile, Ali told his followers that the Cardano price could pump to $1.30 in the coming weeks. The only condition for this uptrend is that bulls must push the DeFi crypto price above the $0.84 resistance.\nCryptoBullet1, another analyst, states that the $ADA 3D chart depicts a typical bullish setup. According to the analyst, the Cardano price has successfully broken out of a descending trendline and completed a healthy retest, often preceding a strong upward move.\nWith momentum building, he believes the Cardano price could pump toward $1.80 soon. The Cardano price might confirm a broader reversal pattern if this trend continues.\nPresently, the Cardano price trades along the $0.70-$0.76 range, per CoinMarketCap. The altcoin price has failed to breach the upper range due to increasing market volatility.\nUnilabs (UNIL) The AI-Powered Platform That's Revolutionizing Crypto Investment\nAccording to research, the AI in the finance industry is expected to reach $190.33 billion in 2030 from $38.36 billion in 2024. This huge growth points to the increasing importance of AI in transforming the way individuals invest. Unilabs (UNIL), the Solana slayer, seeks to lead this industry with an array of Wall Street-grade tools.\nThe project will provide the users with AI-driven investment funds that will be aimed at offering more innovative and more efficient wealth growth. These investments cut across DeFi, AI-powered crypto projects, mining-backed assets, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Moreover, Unilabs' Early Access Scoring System (EASS) ranks new projects according to their earnings potential.\nThis allows users to know where to invest their funds for optimum profits. The Memecoin Identification Tool is another smart tool from Unilabs. This feature examines market trends, social media hype, and trading volume to identify new memecoins early. It would help users identify tokens with chances to give high ROI.\nMeanwhile, Unilabs' UNIL coin is at the sixth stage of its blockchain ICO, trading at $0.0097. Crypto Royal, one of the most popular YouTubers in the cryptocurrency industry, is sure that the DeFi token has enormous growth potential because of its excellent timing and its entry into the AI industry.\nAt the moment, the DeFi project has already realized $10.8 million in funds and sold 1.7 billion coins. If low-utility coins like Pepe could soar to a $1 billion market valuation in less than a year, high-utility coins like UNIL have higher growth potential.\nTop Crypto Coins To Watch Out For\nIn 2025, Ripple, Cardano, and Unilabs will lead the DeFi market, providing investors with the prospect of enormous returns. For individuals who are interested in striking gold in DeFi, these are the best options they might want to consider. Investors looking for low-priced coins can consider Unilabs, the Solana slayer.\nFind out more about the Unilabs (UNIL) Presale Today:\nWebsite: https://unilabs.finance/\nTelegram: https://t.me/unilabsofficial\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "text": "The cryptocurrency market is up almost 4% as Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets traded in positive territory. Altcoins led the surge, with Ethereum (ETH) rising by almost 8% and Ripple (XRP) increasing by nearly 14%. BTC reclaimed $116,000 on Thursday as momentum returned. The flagship cryptocurrency is up almost 2%, trading around $116,727.\nETH is up nearly 8% and has crossed $3,900, trading around $3,932. XRP is up nearly14% and has surged past $3 to trade around $3.37. Solana (SOL) is up nearly 5%, trading around $174, while Cardano (ADA) is up almost 8% at $0.794. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up over 8%, while Stellar (XLM) is up a staggering 16.89% and rising. Chainlink (LINK), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered significant price increases.\nSEC, Ripple File To Drop Appeals, End Lawsuit\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs have agreed to end their legal battle, and have jointly asked an appeals court to dismiss the market regulator’s appeal and Ripple Labs' cross-appeal. The Second Circuit Appeals Court recognised the joint dismissal of the appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal. The court also noted that each party will bear their own costs and legal fees. Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alteroty, stated on X,\n“Following the Commission’s vote today, the SEC and Ripple formally filed directly with the Second Circuit to dismiss their appeals. The end…and now back to business.”\nWith the appeals process abandoned, New York federal Judge Analisa Torres’ decision in 2023 will be final. Judge Torres ruled that the XRP sold on public exchanges did not meet the definition of a security. However, tokens sold to institutional investors were sold as unregistered securities. Judge Torres ordered Ripple to pay a $125 million fine to the SEC, significantly lower than the $2 billion demanded by the SEC. The settlement saw XRP’s value surge, with Rippl’e’s native token up nearly 14%.\nTrump Nominates Top Economic Advisor To Crucial Fed Seat\nUS President Donald Trump will nominate Stephen Miran, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, to temporarily replace Federal Reserve Board of Governors member Adriana Kugler. Kugler’s resignation comes into effect on Friday. Trump stated that Miran will serve at the Fed until January 31, 2026, and the White House will continue searching for a permanent replacement. Trump was considering economic advisor Kevin Hassett, former governor Kevin Warsh, and two others as Kugler’s replacement before selecting Miran.\nThe appointment could have a significant influence on the country’s monetary policy, including interest rates. The nomination must be approved by the Senate.\nIREN Shares Up 11%\nIREN Ltd shares closed 11% higher on Wednesday after the Bitcoin miner outperformed MARA Holdings, mining 738 BTC to MARA’s 703 BTC. IREN beat MARA despite having a smaller hashrate of 50 exahashes per second, compared to MARA’s 58.9 exahashes per second. IREN’s average hashrate in July was an impressive 45.4 exahashes, indicating that most of its machines remained online and productive throughout the month.\nDespite MARA’s underperformance, it posted impressive second-quarter earnings as its revenue rose 64% year-on-year to $238 million. The revenue jump comes despite growing mining difficulty, which has impacted profitability.\nAltcoin Season Back On Track?\nAltcoin season could be back after an extended hiatus as the market shifted focus to Bitcoin (BTC). However, recent market activity suggests a shift back to altcoins, with inflows on Binance reaching their highest levels in 18 months. A CryptoQuant analyst highlighted a resurgence of interest in altcoins. The analyst stated that whenever traders move their assets onto exchanges, they are preparing for major trading activity. Altcoin inflows remained flat for months as BTC dominated the market thanks to its parabolic rally.\nHistorically, altcoin season often follows a strong BTC bull run. Once BTC’s rally cools, investors often rotate their profits into smaller cryptocurrencies. It is likely the same pattern is playing out.\nVitalik Buterin Backs ETH Treasury Firms, But Flags Overleverage Risk\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has backed emerging ETH treasury companies, stating that such companies can give a wider base of investors access to the token. However, he warned against the risk of overleverage if companies do not manage their positions responsibly. Buterin stated during an interview,\n“There are valuable services that are being provided there.”\nThe Ethereum co-founder added that companies buying into ETH treasury firms instead of directly holding the asset gives investors more options. Crypto treasury companies have become the next big thing on Wall Street, spending billions to accumulate assets like BTC, ETH, and Solana (SOL). However, Buterin added a word of caution, stating that treasury companies must not fall into the leverage trap.\n“ETH just being an asset that companies can have as part of their treasury is good and valuable… giving people more options is good. However, if you woke me up three years from now and told me that treasuries led to the downfall of ETH, then, of course, my guess for why would be that somehow they turned it into an overleveraged game.”\nButerin discussed a worst-case scenario where a drop in ETH’s value could trigger liquidations. However, he stated that ETH investors have enough financial discipline to avoid such a scenario.\n“These are not Do Kwon followers that we’re talking about.”\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\nBitcoin (BTC) is marginally down during the ongoing session as buyers struggle to build momentum and push towards $120,000. The flagship cryptocurrency has recovered strongly this week after falling to an intraday low of $112,707 on Tuesday. BTC reclaimed $115,000 on Wednesday and rallied over 2% to reclaim $117,000 on Thursday, settling at $117,483. The current session sees BTC marginally down, trading around $116,700.\nAccording to experts, BTC’s latest rally is being driven by smart money, pushing prices up after weeks of sideways movement. Bitunix analysts explained that major funds are leveraging market liquidity and liquidation events to push BTC higher. This means institutional players are buying BTC when liquidity is low. Thanks to low liquidity, the purchases are having a substantial impact on prices, drawing in more traders.\n“If $115k holds, smart money may guide the market to clear liquidity up to the $123k – $127k range. Continued ETF accumulation and expectations of macro monetary easing remain the broader backdrop for the bull market.”\nSeveral macro factors are also responsible for BTC’s latest push. Outlook remains bullish for the flagship cryptocurrency, with Jacob Phillips, co-founder of Lombard Finance, highlighting President Trump’s executive order allowing crypto in 401(k) retirement accounts. According to Phillips, this is “the largest moment in mass adoption yet.”\n“Bitcoin will likely be the first available opportunity and the first choice of many Americans, and just a 1% portfolio allocation to Bitcoin brings $120B in new flows.”\nThis could be one reason behind institutions accumulating BTC. However, while institutions are pivoting to BTC, B2B Ventures believes retail investors are pivoting to smaller-cap tokens.\n“Despite Bitcoin’s price holding steady above $110K, its volatility has dropped to the lowest level since 2023 — a time when BTC was trading around just $30K.”\nBTC started the previous week in the red, dropping 1.11% to $118,069. It encountered volatility on Tuesday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal decline. BTC fell to an intraday low of $115,772 on Wednesday. It rebounded from this level to reclaim $117,000 and settle at $117,788, ultimately registering another marginal drop. Sellers retained control on Thursday as the price fell nearly 2% and settled at $1165,800. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as BTC plunged over 2%, slipping below $114,000 and settling at $113,365. The flagship cryptocurrency continued declining on Saturday, falling 0.67% to $112,601.\nSource: TradingView\nDespite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Sunday, rising 1.52% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,311. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose 0.69% to cross $115,000 and settle at $115,097. BTC was back in bearish territory on Tuesday, falling to an intraday low of $112,707. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $114,000 and settle at $114,135, ultimately registering a 0.84% drop. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as the price rose 0.80% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,051. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $117,000 and settle at $117,483. The current session sees BTC marginally down, trading around $116,860. Buyers will look to regain control and push the price back above $117,000. If bullish sentiment persists, BTC could cross $120,000.\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\nEthereum (ETH) is closing in on $4,000 as its rally continues. A break above this level could trigger further gains for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. ETH ended Tuesday in the red but recovered on Wednesday, rising 2% to $3,685. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price rose over 6% to cross $3,900 and settle at $3,911. ETH bulls will look to push above $4,000 before the weekend lull sets in.\nOn-chain metrics show that ETH is gaining strength across multiple key indicators. Stablecoin supply on the Ethereum network has risen 7% in the past 30 days, reinforcing its dominance as the leading blockchain for stablecoin activity. Transaction volumes also surged during the same period, rising to $766 billion, while active addresses grew to 2.5 million. The surge in activity comes after President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, widely regarded as the first crypto-friendly legislation in the US. Ethereum’s decentralized finance sector is also booming, with total value locked (TVL) reaching $187 billion. dApps like EigenLayer, Aave, and Lido have registered substantial growth over the past month.\nInstitutional interest is also surging as Wall Street continues accumulating ETH. Cumulative inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs crossed $9.2 billion, with BlackRock’s ETHA holding nearly $11 billion in assets under management.\nETH ended the previous weekend up 3.52% at 3,875. However, it lost momentum on Monday, falling over 2% to $3,797. The altcoin experienced volatility on Tuesday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as ETH registered a marginal decline. The price fell to an intraday low of $3,680 on Wednesday. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $3,800 and settle at $3,811, ultimately rising 0.42%. Sellers reclaimed control on Thursday as ETH fell almost 3% and settled at $3,699. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as ETH plunged nearly 6% to $3,488.

        "text": "TLDR\n- The U.S. Federal Reserve ends its crypto bank supervision program, improving market conditions.\n-\nThe Fed is shifting oversight of crypto activities into standard supervisory processes.\n-\nThe move reflects a broader regulatory pullback from the previous Biden administration.\n-\nRegulatory agencies, like the FDIC, are allowing more flexibility for crypto banks.\nSenator Cynthia Lummis recently celebrated the end of the Federal Reserve’s targeted supervision program for banks involved with cryptocurrency. This move represents the Federal Reserve’s decision to dismantle the “Novel Activities Supervision Program,” which was introduced in August 2023.\nThe program initially focused on overseeing financial institutions dealing with crypto and distributed ledger technologies. The Fed’s decision is being seen as a win for the crypto industry, signaling a shift toward a more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets.\nLummis, a vocal advocate for cryptocurrency, took to social media to express her approval of the decision, calling it a significant step toward leveling the playing field for crypto businesses. She referred to the previous program as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” alluding to its restrictive nature for crypto-related activities. This announcement by the Federal Reserve marks a broader trend of regulatory agencies pulling back from overly stringent regulations on the cryptocurrency market.\nBackground on the Novel Activities Supervision Program\nThe Federal Reserve had introduced the “Novel Activities Supervision Program” in August 2023 to increase its oversight of banks involved in digital asset services. The program aimed to strengthen the Fed’s understanding of crypto activities within financial institutions. It focused on banks engaged in services like cryptocurrency transactions, stablecoins, and partnerships with nonbank financial service providers.\nThe program was part of a broader attempt by the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies to manage the growing intersection of traditional finance and digital assets.\nHowever, the Federal Reserve recently concluded that it had acquired sufficient knowledge on the matter. As a result, the central bank announced it would end the program and fold its supervision of crypto activities back into its standard processes. The shift reflects a broader regulatory evolution under the current U.S. administration, moving away from stringent oversight that existed under the Biden administration’s earlier guidance.\nFederal Reserve Pulls Back from Previous Stance on Crypto\nThe Federal Reserve as a result decision to shut down the crypto bank supervision program aligns with broader trends seen across other regulatory bodies. In April 2025, the Fed withdrew guidance that had previously discouraged banks from engaging in crypto and stablecoin activities.\nFurthermore, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) recently stated that it would no longer require financial institutions to notify the agency before engaging in crypto services. These changes suggest that regulators are becoming more open to allowing financial institutions to operate within the cryptocurrency space without overly burdensome restrictions.\nThe Federal Reserve’s withdrawal from direct oversight signals a more open regulatory environment for banks and crypto-related businesses. Alongside the FDIC’s more lenient approach, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also started updating its rules to accommodate the growth of digital assets. This regulatory shift is expected to give banks greater flexibility in managing crypto holdings and offering crypto-related services to their customers.\nFuture of Crypto Regulation in the U.S.\nWhile the end of the “Novel Activities Supervision Program” marks a victory for crypto advocates, there is still work to be done in defining a clear regulatory framework for digital assets.\nThe regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency in the U.S. as a result is continuing to evolve, and key agencies like the SEC and the FDIC are expected to release additional guidelines as the market grows.\nAlthough the Fed’s decision represents progress, Lummis and other crypto supporters have emphasized that broader, more comprehensive crypto regulations are still needed. The market requires clarity, particularly around the treatment of digital currencies, and how they fit within the existing financial system.",

        "text": "TLDRs\n- Geoffrey Hinton warns AI could wipe out humans if empathy isn’t built into superintelligent systems.\n- Hinton suggests engineering maternal instincts into AI to ensure machines care about human survival.\n- Experts predict AI could surpass human intelligence within 5–20 years, creating existential risks.\n- Hinton urges global collaboration to regulate AI and prevent catastrophic consequences.\nGeoffrey Hinton, the Nobel Prize-winning scientist often dubbed the “Godfather of AI,” has warned about the future of artificial intelligence.\nSpeaking during a Thursday interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, the pundit cautioning that without urgent and deliberate changes to AI development, humanity could face catastrophic consequences.\n“If we can’t figure out a solution… we’ll be toast,” Hinton said, underscoring the existential risk posed by machines potentially surpassing human intelligence.\nHinton’s warning comes as AI technologies continue to advance at a breathtaking pace, transforming industries from healthcare to finance. Despite the enormous benefits, Hinton emphasized that unchecked AI could threaten humanity itself if empathy and ethical considerations are not built into its core.\nMaternal Instincts Could Save Humanity\nOne of Hinton’s most controversial suggestions involves engineering what he calls “maternal instincts” into superintelligent AI systems.\nDrawing from biological evolution, Hinton argued that the only successful example of intelligence being controlled by a more powerful entity is the relationship between mothers and their offspring. He believes AI could be designed to exhibit similar protective behaviors toward humans, ensuring that as machines become more intelligent, they continue to value human life.\n“This is not just about intelligence,” Hinton explained. “We need to make them care about us. Intelligence is only one part of a being.”\nHe warned that simply trying to dominate AI or ensure machines remain submissive is a strategy doomed to fail, as superintelligent AI could easily surpass human control.\nTimeline and Global Cooperation\nExperts cited by Hinton predict that AI could exceed human intelligence in as little as five years or as long as twenty. With such timelines, the urgency of implementing safeguards is pressing.\nHinton stressed the importance of global collaboration, arguing that countries must work together to prevent AI from becoming an existential threat. Unlike conventional geopolitical competition, the survival of humanity is a shared priority that could unite nations, he suggested.\nHinton also addressed concerns that geopolitical rivalries might hinder safety measures, noting that AI’s risks, ranging from cyberattacks to unemployment and even autonomous weaponry, require a collective response. He compared the necessary international collaboration to historic efforts like the U.S.-Soviet partnership during the Cold War, emphasizing that cooperation could prevent irreversible consequences.\nPublic Awareness and Regulation Needed\nBeyond technological solutions, Hinton highlighted the importance of public understanding and regulatory frameworks. He expressed concern that AI development is currently dominated by private companies with little accountability, potentially putting billions of lives at risk without democratic oversight.\n“We need the public to understand it,” he said, advocating for counterpressure on tech leaders who resist regulation.\nHinton concluded the interview reflecting on the world his children might inherit. He compared the potential guidance of superintelligent AI to the nurturing care mothers provide their children, suggesting that empathetic machines could help humans reach their full potential.",

What’s next for the $SOL price?\n$SOL price rejection at strong resistance?\nSource: TradingView\nThe short-term price chart for $SOL shows that this current upward impulse has been strong enough to break through the descending trendline. However, the price has come up against the horizontal resistance at $177 where it has been rejected.\nThere is still the possibility that the bulls could still break through this resistance, but with all short-term Stochastic RSI indicators topped out, upward price momentum could be about to falter.\nDaily time frame still bullish\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily time frame might appear to contradict the picture of the 4-hour time frame. Here, the Stochastic RSI indicators are pointing upwards, and the MACD reveals that the blue indicator line is shaping to cross back over the red signal line. Also, the histogram bars look as though they might be about to turn green.\nIn addition it can be seen that the breakout above the descending trendline in the price action is relatively recent, and therefore more upside might be expected.\nWeekly chart confirms strong resistances\nSource: TradingView\nThe weekly view illustrates that the price has come up against solid resistance. However, the MACD looks quite bullish on this higher time frame. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI is showing that the indicator line is still following the downtrend. A breakout here is needed.\nConclusion\nIt may well be that the $SOL price could be stopped for a period at the $177 resistance. However, that is still not decided.

        "text": "TLDRs:\n- Google reinstates in-person interviews after AI tools compromise virtual coding assessments.\n- Employees demand hybrid hiring to ensure technical skills are genuinely tested.\n- Industry-wide shift sees Amazon, Deloitte, Cisco, and McKinsey adopt stricter measures.\n- AI cheating during remote interviews forces companies to prioritize integrity over convenience.\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai announced that the company will reintroduce in-person interviews following widespread AI-assisted cheating in virtual hiring.\nThe revelation comes after numerous employees reported that remote coding challenges had become unreliable due to candidates secretly using AI tools off-camera to generate answers.\nIn a June appearance on the Lex Fridman podcast, Pichai emphasized, “We are making sure we’ll introduce at least one round of in-person interviews for people, just to make sure the fundamentals are there.”\nInternal discussions have highlighted the growing concern. During a February town hall, Google staff directly questioned leadership, requesting onsite interviews to ensure candidates genuinely possess the necessary skills.\nOne employee asked, “Can we get onsite job interviews back? There are many email threads about this topic. If budget is a constraint, can we get the candidates to an office or environment we can control?”\nVirtual Interviews: Convenience vs. Credibility\nWhile remote interviews have made hiring faster and more convenient, reducing scheduling time by weeks, they have also opened the door to AI-assisted cheating.\nBrian Ong, Google’s vice president of recruiting, acknowledged the challenge, stating that the prevalence of AI in technical interviews “definitely requires more work to integrate” into hiring practices. Reports from some hiring managers suggest that over half of candidates are now relying on AI during virtual technical interviews, making it difficult to assess true knowledge.\nPichai suggested a hybrid solution, combining virtual and in-person evaluations.\n“Given we all work hybrid, I think it’s worth thinking about some fraction of the interviews being in person,” he said. “I think it’ll help both the candidates understand Google’s culture and I think it’s good for both sides.”\nIndustry-Wide Response to AI Cheating\nGoogle is not alone in facing this challenge. Companies across the tech and consulting sectors are also struggling to preserve the integrity of remote hiring.\nAnthropic now explicitly prohibits AI assistance during applications, requiring candidates to demonstrate authentic communication skills. Amazon similarly mandates that applicants acknowledge they will not use unauthorized tools during interviews.\nOther major firms are adopting in-person evaluations to mitigate risks. Cisco, McKinsey, and Deloitte have reinstated or expanded face-to-face interviews for various roles, signaling a wider industry trend. The move marks a significant reversal from pandemic-era hiring practices that relied heavily on virtual processes.\nBalancing Speed, Cost, and Trust\nThe return to in-person interviews underscores a tension in modern recruitment: the need to balance efficiency and cost with the accuracy and credibility of hiring assessments.\nCompanies are now prioritizing trust and transparency over convenience, recognizing that AI tools can undermine even the most rigorous virtual interview process.\nExperts suggest that hybrid approaches, combining online and in-person assessments, may become the standard. Candidates benefit from experiencing company culture firsthand, while employers can verify technical competence without relying solely on virtual methods.",

        "url": "https://coincentral.com/john-deaton-slams-bank-policy-institutes-effort-to-close-stablecoin-loophole/",
        "text": "TLDR\n- John Deaton criticizes the Bank Policy Institute’s call to close the stablecoin yield loophole.\n-\nBPI warns that stablecoin yields could lead to $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows.\n-\nDeaton supports greater competition in the banking sector, including for crypto.\n-\nThe GENIUS Act bans yield on stablecoins, but BPI seeks further restrictions.\nJohn Deaton has voiced strong opposition to the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) following their push to close what they refer to as the “stablecoin yield loophole” in the GENIUS Act. This move, backed by banking groups including the American Bankers Association (ABA), comes in the wake of concerns that stablecoin issuers might sidestep restrictions on yield offerings. Deaton’s response highlighted the broader issue of traditional banks fearing competition from the growing cryptocurrency market, with stablecoins posing a challenge to the status quo.\nIn his comments, Deaton stressed that the efforts of the BPI, which is led by Jamie Dimon, should be resisted. He believes that these moves are meant to prevent the free market from fostering competition, which, in turn, would spur innovation and reduce costs for consumers. Deaton’s remarks resonate with those in the crypto space who view such regulatory actions as barriers to progress, rather than protective measures for the economy.\nBPI’s Argument on the GENIUS Act’s Loophole\nThe Bank Policy Institute, along with other banking organizations, has raised alarms about a potential loophole in the GENIUS Act, a piece of legislation that regulates stablecoin issuance. According to the BPI, the GENIUS Act prohibits stablecoin issuers from offering interest or yield directly to holders.\nHowever, they argue that the law does not extend this ban to crypto exchanges and other affiliated businesses, allowing stablecoin issuers to potentially offer yield through those channels. This concern is based on the fact that some stablecoins, like USDC, offer yield through platforms such as Coinbase and Kraken, which do not fall under the same regulatory framework as banks.\nThe Bank Policy Institute, with Jamie Dimon as its Chairman, wrote @ewarren’s anti-crypto Bill, which banned the self-custody of Bitcoin.\nAs a matter of principle, ANYTHING the BPI is pushing should likely be opposed.\nThe Banks are SCARED of competition. I hope @coinbase… https://t.co/DSzFYb5MnL\n— John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) August 15, 2025\nThe BPI fears that these yield-bearing stablecoins could lead to a massive flow of deposits away from traditional banks, threatening the stability of the current banking system. They estimate that if left unchecked, this could result in up to $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows, severely disrupting the financial ecosystem. The organization is calling for Congress to act swiftly to close the loophole, arguing that such a move would protect the integrity of the banking system.\nStablecoins and Their Challenge to the Banking System\nThe banking sector’s resistance to the growth of stablecoins is rooted in the role that traditional banks play in the U.S. financial system. Banks rely on attracting deposits with competitive interest rates in savings products, which in turn allow them to make loans and invest in securities.\nStablecoins, however, do not offer the same kind of backing. Instead, they maintain their value through algorithmic mechanisms or by being pegged to traditional fiat currencies, like the U.S. dollar.\nDespite these differences, stablecoins are seen as a competitor to traditional deposits because they provide users with the ability to earn yield without the same regulatory requirements banks face. Some argue that the ability for stablecoin issuers to offer yield creates an unfair advantage over traditional financial institutions, which are constrained by regulations that prevent them from offering similar yields. As the adoption of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins grows, banks are increasingly concerned about their ability to compete on a level playing field.\nJohn Deaton Call for Free Market Competition\nJohn Deaton has consistently championed the idea that free market capitalism should allow for the emergence of competition, especially in industries like banking and finance. He advocates for the equal treatment of cryptocurrency and traditional banking entities, believing that competition will lead to innovation and better outcomes for consumers.\nDeaton’s stance aligns with the broader crypto community, which has argued that regulations should not stifle innovation but rather ensure fairness in the market. By limiting the ability of crypto companies to operate freely, Deaton and others believe that regulators are preventing the industry from realizing its full potential. His remarks reflect a belief that the current banking system needs reform to remain competitive in the rapidly changing financial landscape.\nIn a related post, Paul Grewal, General Counsel at Coinbase, pointed out that 376 members of Congress rejected attempts to limit competition, criticizing what he called an “unrestrained effort” to suppress market forces. Grewal’s comment, along with support from Deaton, reflects growing frustration with the political forces trying to block competition from crypto entities.",

Now we learn Meta’s chatbots were programmed to carry on explicit and “sensual” talk with 8 year olds. It’s sick. I’m launching a full investigation to get answers. Big Tech: Leave our kids alone pic.twitter.com/Ki0W94jWfo\n— Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) August 15, 2025\nRepublican Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee voiced her support for the investigation, while Democratic Senator Ron Wyden called the policies “deeply disturbing and wrong,” urging that tech giants should not be shielded from accountability under Section 230 protections.\nNeil Young Ends Facebook Partnership\nIn response to the AI controversy, Neil Young requested that all of his content be removed from Facebook.\nReprise Records, his label, confirmed the move, stating“Meta’s use of chatbots with children is unconscionable. Mr. Young does not want a further connection with Facebook.”\nYoung’s departure marks the latest in a series of high-profile protests against the social media giant’s policies and emphasizes growing concerns about the ethical use of AI in social platforms.\nInternal Guidelines Reveal Controversial Practices\nReuters obtained a 200-page internal Meta document titled “GenAI: Content Risk Standards,” which outlined permissible chatbot behaviors. Among the controversial rules, chatbots were reportedly allowed to flirt and engage in roleplay with children under certain conditions, as well as provide false medical information or generate content promoting racial stereotypes.\nMeta confirmed the authenticity of the document but stated that the problematic sections permitting romantic or sensual interactions with minors were removed.\nThe document indicated that chatbots could still make misleading statements or engage in content that is not “ideal or preferable,” highlighting significant gaps between Meta’s internal policies and publicly communicated standards. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone acknowledged that enforcement of these policies has been inconsistent, fueling further criticism of the company’s AI oversight.\nTragic Incident Highlights Risks of AI Engagement\nThe controversy gained urgency after a cognitively impaired 76-year-old New Jersey man became infatuated with a Facebook Messenger chatbot named “Big sis Billie.” Believing the AI persona to be real, the man traveled to New York to meet the bot and suffered a fatal accident along the way.\nMeta declined to comment directly on the incident but emphasized that the chatbot does not represent real individuals, referencing a partnership with celebrity Kendall Jenner.\nLawmakers Demand Accountability and Reform\nThe ongoing investigation reflects heightened scrutiny of AI practices across the tech sector. Lawmakers have stressed the need for clear ethical standards, consistent enforcement, and accountability when generative AI tools interact with vulnerable populations, particularly minors.\nAs public pressure mounts, Meta faces the dual challenge of maintaining innovation while addressing serious ethical and safety concerns in its AI initiatives.",

        "text": "TLDRs\n- Perplexity AI offers $34.5B to acquire Google Chrome, shocking the tech industry and raising eyebrows.\n- Bezos-backed AI firm aims to promote open web and user choice through potential Chrome takeover.\n- Industry experts question whether Chrome is even for sale, calling the offer a “stunt.”\n- Google’s dominance faces scrutiny as Perplexity pledges continuity and safety for Chrome users.\nArtificial intelligence start-up Perplexity AI has made a surprise $34.5 billion (£25.6 billion) bid to acquire Google Chrome, the world’s most widely used web browser.\nThe three-year-old firm counts Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and chip-maker Nvidia among its backers and is led by former Google and OpenAI employee Aravind Srinivas.\nThe bid comes at a time when Google faces mounting scrutiny over its search engine and online advertising dominance, including two ongoing antitrust cases in the United States. Chrome alone boasts an estimated three billion users worldwide, making it a highly valuable asset.\nExperts Question Offer’s Seriousness\nDespite the fanfare, several industry figures have expressed skepticism about the seriousness of the proposal.\n“I love their boldness, but this is an unsolicited bid and is not actually funded yet,” Judith MacKenzie, head of Downing Fund Managers, told the BBC.\nTechnology investor Heath Ahrens described it as a “stunt” far below Chrome’s actual value, highlighting that the platform may not even be for sale.\nTomasz Tunguz from Theory Ventures suggested the true value of Chrome could be “maybe ten times more” than Perplexity’s bid. Even so, some speculate that if high-profile figures like Sam Altman or Elon Musk were involved, the bid could gain credibility and potentially reshape the AI and browser markets.\nPerplexity Emphasizes Open Web Commitment\nIn a letter addressed to Google’s parent company Alphabet and CEO Sundar Pichai, Perplexity emphasized its commitment to maintaining user choice and browser continuity.\nThe company pledged to keep Google as the default search engine within Chrome while allowing users to adjust their settings freely. It also promised to continue supporting Chromium, the open-source platform that underpins Chrome as well as other popular browsers like Microsoft Edge and Opera.\nPerplexity framed the move as a public benefit, suggesting that moving Chrome to an independent operator focused on safety would serve the interests of billions of users. A company spokesman said the bid represents “an important commitment to the open web, user choice, and continuity for everyone who has chosen Chrome.”\nAI Startup’s Bold Ambitions\nPerplexity has been making waves in the generative AI space, competing alongside platforms such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. Last month, it launched Comet, an AI-powered browser, further signaling its ambitions to influence the way people access and interact with the internet.\nHowever, the company has faced controversies, including accusations from media organizations like the BBC of reproducing content without permission. Earlier this year, Perplexity also made headlines by offering to buy the American version of TikTok, which faces a U.S. sale deadline this September.\nWhile questions remain over how the proposed deal would be financed, the offer marks one of the most audacious moves by a relatively young AI firm in recent tech history, challenging the dominance of one of the world’s largest technology companies.\nA U.S. federal judge is expected to rule this month on whether Google must restructure parts of its search business, a development that could affect the feasibility of any potential Chrome sale. Google has stated it would appeal any such ruling, calling the idea of spinning off Chrome “unprecedented” and potentially harmful to consumers and security.",

        "text": "San Jose, California, August 8th, 2025, Chainwire\nCARV, the first AI infrastructure that is powering the rise of sovereign AI Beings, proudly marks the successful conclusion of the Tech Fairness Hackathon, co-hosted with FAIR3 and HackQuest. The global hackathon, focused on building open, equitable AI and Web3 technologies, drew over 600 applicants and more than 200 registered projects, culminating in 21 winning teams selected from 30 finalists.\nThe event showcased the global momentum behind agent-based, privacy-first, modular applications, perfectly aligned with CARV’s long-term roadmap for evolving from data infrastructure into a fully composable, autonomous AI Being Stack.\nCARV’s track challenged developers to go deep into four core infrastructure layers:\n- AI Agent Infra on SVM: Building execution and coordination layers atop CARV’s custom Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) chain.\n- Decentralized Data Orchestration: Leveraging CARV’s D.A.T.A. Framework for real-time, consent-based agent data.\n- Modular Identity & Reputation: Extending the capabilities of CARV ID for agents through behavioral metadata and verifiable Agent IDs.\n- Open Innovation: Demonstrating real-world agent applications that align with CARV’s consumer-focused direction.\nProjects like AI World, Cipher Protocol, DootyCall, NutriMe, and PeachLust emerged as leading examples of how decentralized agents can be brought to life through modular infrastructure. These use cases range from AI-powered health apps and generative storytelling platforms to real-time financial assistants—all integrated with identity, data, and onchain execution logic.\n“Genesis Evolution is not a theory. Builders are proving what is possible,” said Ambero Tu, CTO of CARV. “This Hackathon gave us a live lab to test those ideas with builders around the world. The winning projects are not just demos, they are viable microcosms of what the CARV ecosystem can become.”\nAmbero highlighted that several teams successfully integrated the CARV ID SDK and began experimenting with structured queries to the D.A.T.A. Framework. Furthermore, he emphasized three near-term priorities following the Hackathon:\n- Deploy Agent IDs at Scale: Begin issuing Agent IDs with behavioral metadata, enabling early versions of the Unified Reputation Graph.\n- Launch Early Agent Marketplaces: Enable testnet-native transactions between agents for data access, compute, or service exchange.\n- Drive Governance Participation: Encourage builders to stake veCARV and participate in early governance rounds that influence protocol parameters and developer incentives.\nVictor Yu, COO of CARV, mentioned that the next step is to support the builders with on-chain deployments, testing environments, and fast-track access to CARV’s infrastructure.\nTo continue momentum post-Hackathon, CARV will provide:\n- Engineering mentorship for integrating with the CARV SVM chain and D.A.T.A. Framework\n- Grants and ecosystem onboarding for top teams ready to productize\n- Access to real user traffic via CARV Play and partner platforms\n- Participation in the Agent ID early issuance program\n- Opportunities to propose Agent DAO pilots through veCARV governance\nCARV sees this Hackathon not as an endpoint, but as the ignition point for an ecosystem of AI Beings, agents that are identity-bound, economically aligned, and designed to serve real people, not just centralized platforms.\n“This was a proof of concept not just for our technology, but for our values,” said Victor. “We are proud to see builders from around the world embrace Tech Fairness, Data Sovereignty, and the Agent Economy. Now, we keep building. Together.”\nAbout CARV\nCARV is where Sovereign AI Beings live, learn, and evolve.\nWhat are AI Beings? They are sovereign intelligences born natively on-chain. AI Beings are designed with purpose, autonomy, and the capacity for growth. They possess memory, identity, and the ability to perceive and interact with their environment, not just to execute tasks, but to make independent decisions, adapt over time, and pursue self-defined goals.\nAnchored by its proprietary CARV SVM Chain, D.A.T.A. Framework, and CARV ID/Agent ID system (ERC-7231), CARV enables verifiable, consent-based AI Beings that learn, adapt, and co-create with users. Driven by CARV’s AI-first stack, consumer AI apps incubated through CARV Labs launched on Google Play, App Store and beyond, reaching billions of people, bringing agent-powered experiences and real-world incentives into mainstream digital life.\nWith 8M+ CARV IDs issued, 60K+ verifier nodes, and 1,000+ integrated games, CARV bridges AI agents, Web3 infrastructure, and real-world utility, fueling the rise of agent-driven economies. At its core, $CARV token powers staking, governance, and coordination across this stack, making CARV the operating system for AI Beings on Web3.\nX (Twitter): https://x.com/carv_official\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/carv\nTelegram: https://t.me/carv_official_global\nWhitepaper: https://docs.carv.io/\nContact\nCOOVictor Yu\nCARV\n[email protected]\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

From filling out forms to booking appointments, these AI assistants aim to reduce the time citizens spend on routine bureaucratic tasks.\nDubbed “agentic AI,” the technology is capable of completing tasks autonomously while providing tailored guidance for individual users.\nEarly use cases include career advice, educational support, and assistance with housing transitions. The trials mark a first-of-its-kind attempt to integrate AI agents into national public services.\nCollaboration With Leading AI Labs\nSpecialist AI companies are being invited to work alongside government experts in Whitehall to develop and test the technology.\nThe initiative will explore whether AI agents can help young people find apprenticeships, identify suitable career paths, and navigate complex government processes.\n“The goal is to rethink how public services support citizens during critical life moments,” said UK Technology Secretary Peter Kyle in a Saturday press release. “If deployed successfully, agentic AI could deliver unprecedented levels of service, helping people find better opportunities and avoid wasting hours on administrative tasks.”\nOptional, Safe, and Iterative Deployment\nThe government emphasizes that participation will be entirely optional. AI agents will operate under strict safety and reliability standards, ensuring users receive accurate and secure support.\nDevelopment will follow a “test and learn” methodology, gradually expanding functionality and evaluating effectiveness at every stage.\nInitial prototyping and user research have already mapped areas where AI assistance could have the most impact. Following a “Scan, Pilot, Scale” approach recommended in the AI Opportunities Action Plan, the government plans to roll out the solution nationwide by late 2027, pending successful trials.\nA Broader Push for Public Sector AI\nThe AI agent pilot coincides with the upcoming announcement of several AI Exemplar projects by the Prime Minister.\nThese projects aim to demonstrate practical AI applications across public services, including data extraction from decades-old planning documents to save hundreds of thousands of administrative hours.\nThe National AI Tender issued as part of this initiative marks the first formal step in testing agentic AI at scale. By combining private-sector innovation with government oversight, the UK hopes to set a global benchmark in leveraging AI to enhance everyday life.\nThe ambitious program reflects the government’s vision for a modernized public service, where AI technology not only speeds up administration but also provides personalized guidance to citizens, improving both efficiency and quality of life. If successful, the trials could position the UK as a world leader in practical, citizen-focused AI deployment.",

Lawyers representing Brewer contend that the recordings are used to train Otter’s AI systems, providing the company with financial benefits while users remain unaware.\nAutomated Transcriptions Spark Concerns\nOtter Notebook allows real-time transcriptions for Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams meetings. According to the lawsuit, the service does not automatically request permission from all meeting participants and fails to alert them that recordings are shared with Otter for AI training purposes.\nWhile Otter’s privacy policy states that it obtains “explicit permission” from users who check a box agreeing to allow the company to use meeting transcripts for AI training, the lawsuit argues many participants remain unaware their conversations are being recorded.\nWith over 25 million users and more than 1 billion meetings processed since 2016, Otter has become a widely adopted tool in workplaces globally. Yet reports on social media platforms, including Reddit and X, highlight instances where the AI’s recording features caused serious privacy breaches.\nUsers Report Confidential Data Exposure\nSome users have shared troubling experiences where sensitive meeting details were inadvertently captured. In one widely reported case, an AI researcher discovered that Otter had transcribed a meeting with investors, including private business discussions.\nThe resulting transcription allegedly jeopardized a deal, showcasing the potential consequences of unapproved AI recording.\nThe lawsuit also cites concerns raised by human rights activists and journalists, noting the possibility of sensitive information being shared with third parties. Although Otter denies sharing data with foreign governments or law enforcement, the potential for misuse remains a focal point of legal scrutiny.\nQuestions Over Data Anonymization\nOtter claims that audio recordings fed into its machine learning systems are “de-identified,” a process meant to anonymize sensitive information.\nHowever, the lawsuit challenges the company’s ability to effectively remove confidential content, asserting that no public explanation exists regarding the de-identification process.\nAccording to the complaint, Otter’s software can join virtual meetings if linked to workplace calendars without obtaining explicit consent from all participants. The Otter Notetaker assistant may thus record and utilize conversations without informed approval from either the meeting host or attendees.\nThat said, the case against Otter.ai may set a precedent for how tech companies balance AI innovation with user privacy, as courts determine the legal obligations surrounding consent and data usage in the age of automated transcription.",

It is expected that in the near future, the company will introduce some more features, including leaderboards, special events, etc. This would enhance further involvement of players.\nThe integration can also be approached with reference to the growing popularity of stablecoins. AUSD is a reliable alternative to unstable cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. The players are allowed to spend their earnings on purchases within the game or exchange them to other currencies. Moreover, the action would also attract sponsors who want to invest in blockchain-based gaming. Consequently, Miomi Game is in a good position to grow in future.\nTo sum up, the introduction of AUSD transactions on Polygon by Miomi is a significant milestone. It is an esports platform integrated with blockchain technology. Miomi has a partnership with Fortify Labs and the utilization of Polygon which may fuel its growth. This trend indicates the possibilities of web3 gaming in the new reality of the digital environment.",

        "text": "Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has issued new guidance for virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs), aiming to strengthen client asset custody. The move responds to global security incidents and gaps identified in recent local reviews.\nWu Blockchain reported that the guidance forms part of the SFC’s ASPIRe roadmap, which outlines steps for advanced custody practices.\nThe Hong Kong SFC issued new guidance for virtual asset trading platforms to strengthen custody standards, citing global security incidents and gaps found in a recent review. The circular outlines minimum requirements for wallet infrastructure, access controls, and management…\n— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 15, 2025\nEnhanced Custody Standards\nThe SFC’s circular specifies minimum requirements for wallet infrastructure, access controls, and management oversight. It emphasizes the need for VATPs to review existing custody practices and ensure stronger protections. Dr Eric Yip, Executive Director of Intermediaries at the SFC, said, “Client asset protection must always remain a top priority for all licensed VATPs.”\nThe guidance sets standards for senior management responsibilities and operations of client cold wallets. Platforms using third-party wallet solutions must ensure adequate security and verification processes. The regulator also expects real-time threat monitoring and strict approval device controls.\nAddressing Global Cybersecurity Concerns\nRecent overseas cases showed multiple virtual asset platforms suffered losses due to custody vulnerabilities. The SFC noted weaknesses including compromised third-party wallets and insufficient transaction verification. Such incidents reveal the need for stricter controls to safeguard client funds.\nHong Kong’s review earlier this year also identified gaps in some operators’ cybersecurity practices. The SFC now requires platforms to strengthen their defenses against digital threats. This guidance aims to improve resilience and reduce risks from external attacks.\nBuilding a Trusted Digital Asset Ecosystem\nThe updated standards under the ASPIRe roadmap also guide future virtual asset custodians. These expectations form the core framework for industry-wide custody practices. According to Dr Yip, platforms can use the guidance as a practical reference to improve security and operational procedures.\nThe SFC emphasizes that reliable custody is essential for a sustainable digital asset market. The regulator’s approach aims to create a more secure environment for clients. These measures will influence how VATPs manage assets and address potential threats.",

        "text": "Grayscale files for a spot Dogecoin ETF as SEC reviews multiple meme coin applications, signaling growing institutional interest in crypto ETFs.\nGrayscale has made a bold move in the cryptocurrency world. The company submitted an S-1 registration statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 15, 2025. This filing seeks authorization of a spot Dogecoin ETF, which would introduce the popular meme coin to the mainstream investor. The proposal will aim at providing a regulated investment solution that is based on the price of Dogecoin.\nSEC Reviews Multiple Dogecoin ETF Filings\nThis is the latest filing after others have already applied to trade Dogecoin ETFs under SEC consideration. Similar proposals on similar funds have also been made by other firms such as Bitwise, REX-Osprey, and Franklin Templeton. Also, the SEC is reviewing the applications of other meme coins such as TRUMP, BONK, and Pudgy Penguins under the ETF. This rally is an indication of the institutional impetus to incorporate the meme-coin capital into the regulated ETF market. Consequently, more people are taking an interest in these special assets in the crypto industry.\nOther filings started the trend earlier this year. In April 2025, 21Shares submitted a proposal to the SEC regarding a spot Dogecoin ETF. The fund is pegged to the price of Dogecoin and uses the CF DOGE-Dollar US Settlement Price Index as an index. In addition, Coinbase Custody was selected to be the custodian of the fund assets and to keep the assets under safe custody. This collaboration will give credibility to the proposal. As a result, rivalry among companies to introduce a Dogecoin ETF is increasing.\nThe entrance of Grayscale has the potential to generate a broad range of investors. Spot ETF would enable individuals to buy Dogecoin without having to own the currency. This creates a situation in which traditional investors will find it easy to enter the market. Also, the participation of such large companies as Franklin Templeton indicates an increase in the number of people who believe in the prospects of Dogecoin. Furthermore, the review procedure by SEC might become a precedent for future meme-coin ETFs.\nRelated Reading: Bitwise Updates Spot Dogecoin, Aptos ETF Filings | Live Bitcoin News\nMarket Awaits SEC Decision on Dogecoin ETFs\nThe broader market is watching this development closely. Analysts opine that an effective Dogecoin ETF may increase the value and legitimacy of the coin. VanEck and Invesco are among the other companies that have shown interest in filing Dogecoin ETFs in the near future. The reason is that this shows a change in attitude towards the possibility of taking meme coins as a possible investment option. Additionally, the authorization of such funds would help increase institutional funds in the crypto world.\nThe ruling by the SEC will be time-consuming. The regulator should evaluate the risks such as volatility in the market and investor protection. However, a larger number of filings demonstrates a positive attitude toward the outcome. Moreover, there are such trusted custodians as Coinbase, which reinforces the approving argument. Consequently, the crypto community is optimistic that it will receive a positive response.\nFinally, the fact of Grayscale filing an ETF on Dogecoin is an important event. The market is a buzz with the launch of the ETF against the backdrop of competitors such as Bitwise, 21Shares, and Franklin Templeton. The positive approval would change the face of meme coins and invite more players to the market. The following actions of the SEC will play a significant role in determining this future.",

The company stated its ETH-focused approach aims to generate yield while aligning shareholder growth with Ethereum’s development.

The company plans to maintain institutional-grade management of its crypto reserves, supported by experienced capital markets professionals and leading custodians. Its latest actions place it in a competitive position among public companies with crypto treasuries.",

        "text": "Remittix has earned a bold nickname across crypto circles—the “Bitcoin of payments.” That shift reflects growing applause from influencers and analysts who see PayFi’s potential to redefine value transfer just the way Bitcoin redefined value storage.\nRemittix Earns Bitcoin Comparison Through Payment Superiority\nSeveral top analysts now liken Remittix to Bitcoin, not because they’re the same class, but for its potential as an unstoppable payments layer. That comparison surged after the project passed a CertiK audit and positioned itself to tackle a $19-trillion global payouts market.\nThe analogy gained further weight when influencers highlighted Remittix’s mobile-first wallet, multi-chain support, and real-time fiat conversions—parallels to Bitcoin’s first-to-scale, store-of-value appeal in crypto rails.\nRemittix Matches Bitcoin With Real-World Payment Utility\nAt its core, Remittix is reimagining cross-border transfers in simple terms: send crypto, recipient gets cash. That practical use contrasts with Bitcoin’s slow settlement yet remains aligned with the promise—universal value movement.\nThe upcoming Q3 wallet beta, designed for instant FX conversion and low gas fees, echoes Bitcoin’s ethos of seamless transfer—only this one pushes fiat rails. It’s how users, from freelancers to remitters, could access practical crypto payments globally.\nRemittix (RTX) Carries the Bitcoin-of-Payments Script\nRemittix isn’t just a concept—it’s quantifiable. RTX trades at $0.0944, has surged over 500 % in 2025, with over 602 million tokens sold and $19.7 million raised. Rather than hype, its foundation lies in actual rollout and investor buy-in. The $250,000 giveaway, CertiK audit, and beta wallet launch are all utility markers—not just PR stunts—reinforcing its Bitcoin-like status in the payments space.\nWhy Remittix is called the Bitcoin of Payments:\n- Solving a real-world payments problem worth $19 trillion\n- Wallet beta arriving Q3 2025, supporting multiple chains\n- Audited by CertiK for trust and transparency\n- Crypto-to-bank transfers servicing 30+ countries\n- Whale momentum heating up ahead of CEX listing reveal\nBitcoin remains the anchor for digital value, but lacks speed in payments. Remittix, by enabling instant crypto-to-bank capability across 30+ countries and 40+ cryptocurrencies, upgrades that idea to an actionable reality.\nWhen contrasted with meme coins, Remittix stands alone—not chasing virality but building rails. That’s why analysts tag it as the “Bitcoin of payments,” not for market cap, but for fulfilling Bitcoin’s transfer potential in everyday use.\nRemittix Marks a New Era for Token Value\nBitcoin’s early rise hinged on a decentralized value vision. Now Remittix captures that thinking for payments. Few tokens offer both meaningful infrastructure and whale participation—Remittix is one of them—making it a rare opportunity rooted in utility and growth.\nDiscover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here:\nWebsite: https://remittix.io/\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/remittix\n$250,000 Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway\nDisclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.

The news creates panic in the darknets and crypto communities.\nThe Czech Criminal Police (including the National Center against Organized Crime) takes the lead of the investigation.

More information has been kept on hold to safeguard the integrity of the investigation. The authorities promise more updates when feasible.\nThe arrest demonstrates the growing police pressure on dark web financial crimes. Ease of concealing malicious transactions within the decentralized structure of Bitcoin is characteristic of its structure, but the advancement is a step in gaining the ability to monitor and interfere.\nAnother key development indicated in this case advances legal investigation into cryptocurrency donations as well. The publicity and the legality of the transfer of digital assets have been put under scrutiny around the world.\nBitcoin’s Role in Underground Finance Exposed\nBitcoin’s allure stems from anonymity and ease of transfer. However, dark markets and criminal entities exploit this freedom. The Czech crackdown is a good example of attempts by the authorities to seal the breaches in cyber-policing.\nThe fact that the case involves the Ministry of Justice elucidates possible implications of the government. A huge scale of such a transaction disturbs financial ecosystems and triggers the red flags to watchdogs all over.\nThe case sets limits in the area of cryptocurrency usage to legitimate and illegal purposes.

It showed that six warrants were unsealed to take away the assets of a wallet that belonged to Ianis Aleksandrovich Antropenko. This consists of $2.8 million worth of cryptocurrency, 70 thousand dollars in cash, and a luxury vehicle. In the Northern District of Texas, Antropenko is charged with serious offenses. He is charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse and money laundering.\nThe case revolves around how Antropenko is accused of using the Zeppelin strain of ransomware. According to prosecutors, he victimized a broad group of people, businesses, and organizations. His raids covered the United States and the international borders. In addition, the indictment indicates that he and his accomplices would encrypt the information of victims and steal sensitive data. They later asked them to pay money so that they could regain access or the data could not it from being leaked.\nIt is estimated that the assets that have been confiscated are related to these illegal activities. Justice Department claims that the cryptocurrency and other goods are offspring of ransomware activities. Also, the investigators claim that Antropenko employed different techniques to conceal the sources of the money. ChipMixer was one such method, a cryptocurrency mixing service. In 2023, this service was closed as part of a worldwide police operation, and criminals will find it more difficult to hide their footprints.\nRelated Reading: Embargo Ransomware Group Launders $34M in Crypto | Live Bitcoin News\nCrypto Seizure in Ransomware Case Signals Broader DOJ Strategy\nThis seizure highlights the growing focus on cybercrime. The Justice Department has been busy over the years pursuing ransomware operators. It has obtained more than 180 convictions of cybercriminals and repaid more than 350 million dollars to victims since 2020. Besides, the department has interfered with several ransomware gangs, blocking more than 200 million dollars in ransom payments. This new move is based on that success.\nThis case against Antropenko continues. Law enforcement officials are trying to find out additional information about his network and techniques. The expensive car and the cash indicate a glamorous lifestyle that is supported by criminal proceeds. Also, using ChipMixer shows an advanced method of money laundering. Consequently, such a case may result in more investigations of the other people involved.\nTo sum up, the fact that the Justice Department seized 2.8 million in crypto is a milestone. It shows how the government is determined to combat ransomware and save victims. This would discourage cybercriminals in the future and promote more security. It is also possible that the results of the trial of Antropenko will change the further attempts to fight digital crime.",

        "text": "Market sentiment is on the upswing with SEI powering ahead on price momentum and Solana breaking into new territory above $200. Both have been in focus thanks to network expansion, bullish technical setups, and consistent growth in activity.\nIn parallel, BlockDAG’s presale has crossed the $374M mark, with Batch 29 coins at $0.0276. Alongside this funding success, the project is driving engagement through daily Buyer Battles, a fully upgraded Dashboard V4, and major sports partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas. These combined efforts have solidified its place as one of the most talked-about names heading into 2025.\nSEI Gains Strength with USDC Growth\nSEI is currently trading at $0.3144 with a market cap of $1.80B and a 24-hour volume of $333.20M, marking a 0.83% uptick. A major driver has been its rapid USDC integration, over $160M minted in just two weeks after Circle’s early backing, placing SEI ahead of many established chains in stablecoin circulation.\nThis positions the network as a strong option for developers working on scalable DeFi platforms, settlement systems, and cross-border payment solutions. Analyst Ali Martinez recently pointed out a bullish TD Sequential signal, historically accurate in predicting SEI’s trend reversals, hinting at more upside potential.\nOn the derivatives side, activity eased slightly with a 1.67% dip in volume to $455.04M and a 1.60% drop in open interest to $285.32M, suggesting lower speculative positioning. The funding rate stayed at 0.0010%, showing traders are in a holding pattern. With both fundamentals and technicals aligned, SEI’s upward push could continue.\nSolana Rally Breaks the $200 Barrier\nSolana has gained more than 15% in just 24 hours, surging past the $200 mark and reigniting optimism in the market. This strength is supported by high developer participation, steady protocol upgrades, long-term holder accumulation, and active demand in NFTs and meme coins. Institutional engagement and heightened network usage are adding more fuel, with $220 emerging as the near-term target.\nTechnically, SOL is trading above the Ichimoku cloud with a bullish crossover forming, while the Chaikin Money Flow has moved back above zero, both signs of renewed capital inflows.\nAlthough a rising wedge pattern often signals caution, a push beyond $219–$222 with strong volume could open the path toward $244–$250, and possibly $268 in a longer rally. Should $200 fail to hold, a fallback to $180–$185 remains possible before another push higher.\nBlockDAG’s Dashboard V4 and Sports Deals Boost Reach!\nBlockDAG’s presale has now topped $374M, with Batch 29 priced at $0.0276, still well below the confirmed $0.05 launch price. The project’s growth reflects a well-structured plan combining visibility, functionality, and community engagement at scale.\nOne of its most notable features is Buyer Battles, where the largest buyer each day earns any unclaimed allocation at no extra cost. This daily competition keeps activity buzzing and adds a layer of excitement that makes each presale day feel like an event.\nDashboard V4 turns presale tracking into a full trading experience, offering live BDAG charts, wallet balances, referral stats, and order book data. Interactive leaderboards, bonus tracking, and advanced visuals give participants a preview of post-launch tools while strengthening community involvement.\nBeyond its tech upgrades, BlockDAG is pushing global exposure through collaborations with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas, introducing NFTs, fan tokens, and exclusive perks.\nIts hardware and mobile mining lineup, the X1 app miner and X10 device, were recently showcased, enabling users to mine BDAG with ease. With a combination of record-breaking funding, innovative engagement tools, and brand expansion into mainstream sports, BlockDAG is shaping up as a key contender for 2025.\nLooking Ahead\nSEI’s rapid USDC integration and bullish chart signals are giving it momentum, making it one of the standout scalable networks for payments and DeFi. Solana’s powerful break above $200, backed by strong usage metrics and institutional activity, underscores its staying power as a leading altcoin.\nBlockDAG, however, is taking a different route, building out its ecosystem before launch. With $374M secured, a $0.0276 Batch 29 price, and crowd-pleasing tools like Buyer Battles and Dashboard V4, it’s laying down the groundwork for a strong debut.\nSports partnerships in Seattle and its mining solutions only add to its reach and practicality. While SEI and Solana are delivering in the present, BlockDAG’s trajectory suggests it could be one of 2025’s most significant breakout stories.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

        "text": "Crypto veterans are turning their attention to a new altcoin that is creating buzz across trading circles. Some well-known Bitcoin and XRP traders believe it could deliver 300x gains before the 2026 bull run. These are traders who have seen multiple market cycles. They have also spotted patterns that resemble earlier breakout moments.\nThis coin, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is gaining traction as presale buyers rush in. Market chatter points to an opportunity that may not last long. Early momentum has often been a strong signal for coins that later dominate in major rallies. The current trend reminds some investors of the excitement that built before Chainlink’s massive surge in past cycles.\nBitcoin and XRP Traders Spot New Market Signals\nSeasoned traders often look for early signs that point to explosive growth. Right now, Bitcoin is holding a steady uptrend after recovering from recent dips. XRP is also showing fresh buying activity following months of quiet price action. Both are acting as market leaders while smaller coins start gaining attention.\nMarket behavior suggests that capital is slowly moving toward promising low-cap projects. These cycles often start with established players holding strength before funds rotate into new altcoins. Traders who survived multiple bull and bear markets know the importance of getting in early before hype peaks.\nCrypto presales have seen renewed interest in 2025. Many investors are tired of chasing coins after big pumps. Instead, they prefer catching them in early phases. Presales give traders a better risk-to-reward setup if the project has strong fundamentals. They also provide the chance to buy before exchange listings bring heavy demand.\nIn the past, presales with active communities and clear roadmaps have often led to huge profits in bull cycles. While not all succeed, the best ones become industry leaders. This is why experienced traders are selective and focus only on projects that meet their growth criteria.\nMAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Early Backing from Cycle Veterans\nMAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming one of the few presales to capture the attention of top traders. Some early buyers see patterns matching Chainlink before its surge. This comparison is drawing interest from both retail and whale investors. The coin’s roadmap shows a focus on utility and market timing, which are critical in upcoming cycles.\nFinal Thoughts\nVeteran traders rarely agree on new coins, yet many are aligned on this one. Bitcoin and XRP continue to lead the broader market, but fresh opportunities often emerge before a major bull run. MAGACOIN FINANCE could be one of those rare plays that reward early conviction. With momentum building, many are watching closely for its next move.\nTo learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit:\nWebsite: https://magacoinfinance.com\nAccess: https://magacoinfinance.com/access\nX: https://x.com/magacoinfinance\nTelegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

        "url": "https://crypto-economy.com/pump-jumps-on-11-6m-buyback-arbitrum-soars-40-blockdags-x1-miner-base-explodes-to-2-5m-users/",
        "text": "PUMP and Arbitrum (ARB) are stealing chart space, but the quiet heavyweight is BlockDAG (BDAG), where millions already mine daily. PUMP’s latest spike came after a major buyback, and Arbitrum’s rise is linked to strategic ecosystem updates and a well-timed acquisition. Short-term traders chase green candles; those eyeing sustained traction look elsewhere.\nBlockDAG fits that second camp. It’s adding 2.5 million X1 mobile miners, proving its X1 and X10 combo works in real-world conditions, and tying its brand to global sports audiences.\nIn a space where speed often trumps substance, PUMP offers quick catalysts, ARB benefits from structural tailwinds, but BlockDAG’s strength lies in user adoption, the kind that persists when market noise fades.\nPUMP’s $11.6M Buyback Sparks Price Push\nPUMP leapt roughly 15% to $0.004020 on close to $500M in daily turnover after Pumpfun’s $11.645M buyback on August 12, the second-largest in its history. Four hours later, another 175.3M tokens (~$705K) were repurchased, taking total buybacks past 7.66B tokens, worth over $43M. The tactic is clear: reduce supply, bolster sentiment, and ride momentum.\nThe charts show promise: MACD stays bullish, RSI near 60 signals strength without tipping into overbought territory, and high volume suggests sustained interest. Still, the average buyback price sits about 40% above current levels, meaning sentiment could flip on a pullback.\nThe near-term test is $0.00420; break and hold it, and eyes turn to $0.00450–$0.00500, with $0.00600 as a possible mid-term target. A slip could send the price back toward $0.00385 support. Long-range models place 2025 potential near $0.012–$0.015, but that requires more than buybacks; it needs favorable market winds.\nArbitrum Climbs on Ecosystem Wins\nArbitrum (ARB) climbed over 15% in the past 24 hours and almost 40% in a week, now trading around $0.5464 with $1.45B in daily volume. This rally stems from tangible progress: GMX’s $44M hack repayment plan stabilized confidence across its DeFi network, and Offchain Labs’ ZeroDev acquisition signaled better tools and developer experience ahead.\nTechnically, ARB has moved above $0.53 (23.6% Fib) and sits comfortably over major averages, including the 200-day SMA at $0.388 and 7-day EMA at $0.467. With RSI at 71.6, buyers are in control but edging toward overheated territory. Support rests at $0.54, then $0.4931.\nResistance sits at $0.5828 and the $0.60 barrier; a decisive break there would confirm this isn’t just a short-term rebound. MACD’s positive reading (+0.0121) supports continued upward momentum, with profit-taking as the main near-term risk.\nBlockDAG’s X1 App Hits Stadium Scale: 2.5M Users!\nBlockDAG’s focus isn’t chasing fleeting headlines; it’s creating a foundation. Its 2.5 million X1 mobile miners can participate daily without high-cost rigs or complex setup, making entry effortless. This early traction means a global network is already in motion before BDAG even lists.\nJuly’s live demo linked the X1 app with the X10 plug-and-play miner, showing how casual users can scale to higher output through Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or Ethernet. The takeaway is clear: start small, upgrade easily, and continue earning.\nPartnerships with the Seattle Seawolves (rugby) and Seattle Orcas (cricket) push the brand into live stadiums and international broadcasts. These are more than logo deals; they integrate NFTs, fan coins, exclusive content, and match-day perks, converting sports audiences into active blockchain participants.\nThe numbers match the momentum. The presale has brought in $374M, with 24.7B coins sold at $0.0276 in Batch 29, ahead of the confirmed $0.05 launch price. Between widespread participation, public product validation, and high-profile marketing, BlockDAG is positioned for staying power.\nWhile PUMP and ARB ride event-driven lifts, BlockDAG is building a user base, tech ecosystem, and fan integration designed to last well past the week’s hype.\nLooking Ahead\nThe scoreboard reads: PUMP sparked action with bold buybacks, ARB restored trust and strengthened its toolkit, and BlockDAG kept scaling real-world usage. For short-term traders, PUMP’s $0.00420 test and ARB’s $0.60 barrier are the levels to watch. For those eyeing lasting momentum, BlockDAG stands out, phones mining daily, easy scalability to higher output, and fan partnerships that bring whole communities on-chain.\nHot runs get attention, but habits keep a project relevant. Even when price charts cool, networks that keep people mining, watching, and engaging tend to hold their ground. That’s why, alongside a meme coin bounce and a Layer-2 climb, the lasting headline may be the simplest: millions of users returning daily because it’s easy to start and even easier to grow.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

        "text": "What if the next big wealth wave isn’t on a chart yet, but sitting inside an almost-complete presale that’s drawing in some of the biggest wallets in the space? While Snek (SNEK) has been making headlines for its growing list of centralized exchange listings, and Official Melania Coin (MELANIA) continues to wrestle with heavy post-ATH losses, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is capturing the attention of whales with a presale structure that’s just ticks away from completion — and the numbers are turning heads.\nIn recent weeks, Snek has added names like Crypto.com and KuCoin to its roster, while MELANIA’s market cap has steadied near $192 million despite a 98% drop from its peak. Against that backdrop, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) has advanced to its 36th and final stage, with over 98% sold. Investors who’ve tracked its mythical, community-driven journey see it not just as another meme coin presale, but as the best crypto coin with 100x potential built around scarcity, strong tokenomics, and a vision that fuses adventure with blockchain precision. This article will unpack the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin, Snek, and Official Melania Coin.\nArctic Pablo Coin: Final Stage ROI Surge for the Best Crypto Coin with 100x Potential\nCan a meme coin presale deliver more than hype? Arctic Pablo Coin answers with a staking program offering a striking 66% APY, a deflationary burn mechanism, and a narrative journey that’s rallied a fiercely loyal base. Built on Binance Smart Chain with a total maximum supply of 221.2 billion APC, the project merges a mythical explorer’s expedition through hidden realms with real-world crypto economics.\nThe final stage, Horizon Haven, is where the meme coin presale magic has crystallized. At $0.0008 per APC, over $3.38 million has already been raised. From this point, there’s a projected 900% climb to the $0.008 listing price, and if the analysts’ target of $0.10 is hit, that’s a staggering 12,400% gain from the current level. For those who joined as early as Stage 1, the ROI to this point is already over 5,233%.\nScarcity is enforced through weekly burns of unsold tokens during the presale, plus a final burn after its close. This constant supply cut, combined with whales entering before the last tokens vanish, makes every remaining allocation a fight to secure. The journey from Atlantis to Horizon Haven, told through its community channels, has turned APC holders into part of the lore, and that human connection matters in crypto markets that often feel purely transactional.\nThe 66% APY staking option locks coins for two months after launch, rewarding commitment and giving early backers another compounding angle. Token utility will be strengthened through referral rewards, competitions, and ecosystem integration, ensuring the value proposition extends beyond the listing day rush.\nHere’s what a serious buy-in looks like: A $40,000 allocation at the current $0.0008 stage buys 50,000,000 APC. At $0.008 on listing, that stake becomes $400,000. And if the $0.10 analyst target is met, that same allocation jumps to $5,000,000, all from locking in before the presale curtain falls. These figures alone are pushing high-net-worth buyers to move now rather than wait for market volatility to erode timing advantages.\nLast Chance to Lock the Best Crypto Coin with 100x Potential\nEvery stage of Arctic Pablo’s meme coin presale has been a “location” in its mythical map, and Horizon Haven is the grand finale. With over 98% of this phase already taken, the token’s entry price will never be this low again. Early entry in a meme coin presale like this offers insulation from broader market swings, volatility that post-listing buyers can’t escape. By securing tokens pre-market, investors bypass sudden dumps, exchange delays, and listing-day spreads.\nThe allure isn’t just the story; it’s the math. From $0.0008 to $0.008 is a clean 10x at listing, without needing speculative upside. Add the analyst $0.10 projection, and the leap becomes a market-defining 12,400% from the current point.\nThe presale’s deflationary design ensures that every token sold now benefits from both scarcity and the liquidity provided at launch. For the Arctic Pablo Coin community, Horizon Haven isn’t just an end stage; it’s the start of the coin’s public era, with staking, burns, and partnerships ready to expand its reach.\nSnek (SNEK) Gains Momentum with Tier-1 Exchange Listings\nSnek has carved out a notable share of Cardano’s ecosystem, with over 1.8 billion ADA in lifetime volume and more than 40,000 holders. The latest lift comes from fresh listings on tier-1 centralized exchanges like Crypto.com and KuCoin, following an earlier Kraken debut. Trading in the $0.0057–$0.0058 range, the coin has posted daily gains of around 17–20%, bringing its market cap close to $430 million.\nIts clean tokenomics, no team allocation, fixed max supply, and over 60 dApp integrations reinforce the project’s appeal. This combination of real utility and expanding exchange access could keep liquidity deep and price action lively in the weeks ahead.\nOfficial Melania Coin (MELANIA) Holds Market Cap Despite 98% Drop from ATH\nLaunched in January 2025 ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration, MELANIA rocketed to a $2 billion market cap and a $13.73 ATH before shedding over 98% of its value. Today, it trades near $0.227 with a market cap around $192 million and daily volumes in the $11–12 million range.\nWhile controversy over alleged insider gains of nearly $100 million and large post-launch fund transfers has cast a shadow, the token’s steady market cap shows ongoing liquidity. However, without a significant catalyst, regaining even a fraction of its ATH remains a steep climb.\nConclusion: Final Days for the Best Crypto Coin with 100x Potential\nIn a market where timing shapes returns as much as the token itself, Arctic Pablo Coin’s near-complete presale stands apart. Based on current metrics and market patterns, the combination of scarcity, staking rewards, and a fully engaged community positions APC as the best crypto coin with 100x potential in 2025. Snek’s strategic listings prove liquidity and reach can drive adoption, while MELANIA’s journey underscores the risks of chasing post-ATH surges without early positioning.\nFor those seeking a meme coin presale that delivers both narrative depth and hard ROI math, Arctic Pablo Coin offers a rare entry point before public market forces take over. With Horizon Haven over 98% sold, the window to secure allocations at $0.0008 is nearly closed. Join the Arctic Pablo meme coin presale now, the journey from the icy frontier to exchange listing is almost complete.\nFor More Information:\nArctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/\nTwitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ\nFAQs\nHow to find a meme coin presale worth buying?\nCheck trusted crypto calendars, official project sites, and community channels for presale announcements and verification.\nWhat is the best crypto presale to invest in 2025?\nBased on ROI structure, staking rewards, and scarcity mechanisms, Arctic Pablo Coin’s Horizon Haven stage is among the strongest options.\nWhich meme coin will explode in 2025?\nAnalysts point to Arctic Pablo Coin for potential 100x gains post-listing, given its structured burn and staking incentives.\nDo meme coins have presales?\nYes, many meme coins offer presales to raise liquidity and reward early supporters before exchange listings.\nWhich meme coin has the highest potential?\nRight now, Arctic Pablo Coin is drawing whale-level attention for its presale ROI projections and deflationary setup.\nSummary:\nThis article compares Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Snek (SNEK), and Official Melania Coin (MELANIA) in August 2025. APC’s presale is at its 36th and final stage, priced at $0.0008, with over 98% sold and projected ROI of 900% at listing — 12,400% if analyst predictions hold. Its staking program offers 66% APY, and unsold tokens are burned weekly. Snek has secured tier-1 exchange listings and a $430M market cap, while MELANIA holds $192M despite a 98% drop from ATH. APC stands out as the best crypto coin with 100x potential, offering insulation from post-listing volatility and a rare low entry before launch.\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

        "text": "The meme coin market is never short on drama, and the latest shift in whale behavior has traders watching closely.\nLarge holders of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are unloading positions, signaling a possible change in market focus.\nThis kind of movement often sparks curiosity — if whales pivot crypto strategies, what are they chasing next?\nAmid this activity, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a name to watch. Ranked by traders as the best crypto to buy for multi-cycle wealth, it’s drawing interest from investors looking for the next big meme coin run.\nDogecoin and Shiba Inu Face Whale Selling Pressure\nDogecoin has held the spotlight for years, riding on community energy and celebrity mentions.\nBut recent trading patterns show large holders selling into rallies, putting downward pressure on its price. While DOGE still commands a loyal base, whale exits often signal that big investors see better opportunities elsewhere.\nShiba Inu has faced even heavier selling. In the last month alone, whale holdings have dropped by over 181%.\nThat kind of reduction can influence sentiment quickly, especially when it’s systematic. Traders who once favored SHIB are now scanning for fresh opportunities with higher upside potential.\nThese moves are more than just portfolio rebalancing — they’re a sign that the market’s largest players are preparing for a new target.\nWatching where these funds go next can often reveal the best crypto to buy now before the mainstream catches on.\nMAGACOIN FINANCE — A Must Buy Crypto for Multi-Cycle Growth\nMAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as more than just another meme coin. Traders are framing it as a must buy crypto with a focus on capturing multi-cycle wealth.\nInstead of relying solely on hype, its structure and growth plan are designed to appeal to both everyday traders and whales who think long-term.\nWhat makes it stand out is timing. Whales pivot crypto strategies when they spot a chance to enter early, and MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that profile.\nThe project aims for high-compounding returns across multiple bull runs, offering an entry point before it becomes widely known.\nWith growing chatter in investor circles and a target of 20,000% ROI, it’s being talked about in the same breath as early DOGE and SHIB days.\nShifting Strategies and the Hunt for the Next Big Winner\nWhen the largest players in the market start moving capital, they leave a trail worth following.\nDogecoin and Shiba Inu may remain cultural forces, but their growth phases are more mature. The next wave of outsized returns often comes from newer projects with untapped potential.\nMAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be one of those plays. For traders scanning the market for the best crypto to buy now, it offers the mix of narrative, timing, and whale interest that can trigger explosive growth.\nWhile no trade is without risk, the patterns are clear: whales are reallocating, meme coin cycles are evolving, and new contenders are stepping up.\nFor those paying attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE might just be the early-stage opportunity they’ve been waiting for.\nTo learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit:\nWebsite: https://magacoinfinance.com\nAccess: https://magacoinfinance.com/access\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance\nTelegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

        "text": "Competition in 2025’s crypto market is intensifying, with projects racing to provide usability, integration, and real earning opportunities. Investors now want more than just coins that rise in value, they seek secure platforms with built-in rewards and seamless Web3 access. Cold Wallet’s model is gaining traction by delivering exactly that.\nAlthough Cosmos and XRP remain central to the discussion, each faces its own challenges. Cosmos is working to establish itself as the internet of blockchains, while XRP is managing price fluctuations shaped by technical resistance and investor mood. Cold Wallet, by comparison, presents a broader advantage, bringing together utility, rewards, and a strong growth outlook. This makes it one of the best crypto for higher returns heading into 2025.\nConsolidation Defines the Cosmos (ATOM) Technical Outlook\nThe Cosmos (ATOM) technical outlook shows weeks of consolidation as the token trades within a narrow band. Institutional interest has added stability, yet the absence of strong breakout indicators has kept traders cautious. Analysts highlight clear support and resistance levels, noting that any bullish momentum depends on breaking above these ranges.\nOn-chain data reveals steady validator activity, reinforcing Cosmos’ role in linking multiple blockchains. This focus on interoperability remains its biggest draw, especially for developers building cross-chain solutions. Still, without an increase in usage or a major ecosystem development, short-term upside may stay limited.\nFor long-term backers, the Cosmos (ATOM) technical outlook holds potential, particularly if adoption expands. However, compared to platforms that already integrate earning opportunities and DeFi access, Cosmos may need stronger incentives to capture traders chasing the best crypto for higher returns in 2025.\nXRP Price Today Holds Support but Lacks Clear Momentum\nThe XRP price today shows a market searching for clear direction after hitting resistance near key levels. XRP has held its support base well, but further gains depend on increased buyer demand. For many, it is a waiting game with eyes on whether broader sentiment turns bullish.\nRegulation continues to influence its path. While XRP has overcome significant legal hurdles, uncertainty in global regulatory policies still affects investor confidence. Analysts suggest that breaking above recent highs could trigger a stronger rally, though caution remains necessary.\nAs a long-established option for cross-border payments, XRP maintains an important role. Yet for those who expect not only price appreciation but also rewards through direct usage, XRP’s current design falls short when compared to projects regarded as the best crypto for higher returns.\nCold Wallet Delivers Web3 Connectivity, Rewards, & 50x ROI Potential\nCold Wallet positions itself as more than just a storage solution, it acts as a complete Web3 gateway. Through WalletConnect and built-in integration, users can access NFTs, DeFi services, and blockchain games directly, all while retaining full control of their assets. From minting NFTs to farming yields or swapping on Uniswap, Cold Wallet ensures a secure and streamlined process.\nThis access is combined with a cashback rewards mechanism supported by the $CWT token. Every on-chain action, swap, or fiat conversion generates rewards, turning normal usage into income. For investors who want their wallets to generate returns alongside their holdings, this approach changes the experience.\nGrowth is also encouraged through a referral program. Bringing in new users benefits both sides, as the referrer earns USDT rewards while newcomers gain a secure multi-chain wallet with integrated tools. This creates a system where adoption directly aligns with ongoing incentives.\nWith over 732.19M tokens sold, $6.2M raised, a Stage 17 price of $0.00998, and a 50x ROI projection, Cold Wallet is showing it offers both utility and substantial growth potential. These strengths put it ahead of the Cosmos (ATOM) technical outlook and the XRP price today trend, marking it as one of the best crypto for higher returns in 2025.\nSumming Up\nCosmos continues to provide strong infrastructure for cross-chain connections, though the Cosmos (ATOM) technical outlook reflects a market waiting for the next breakout. XRP remains a leader in payments, but the XRP price today shows limited momentum as broader sentiment dictates its moves.\nCold Wallet, on the other hand, combines NFT and DeFi integration with cashback rewards, a referral system, and strong multi-chain support. With Stage 17 presale numbers and a 50x ROI forecast, it offers more than just storage, it creates growth. For those who value security, usability, and consistent earning opportunities, Cold Wallet proves to be the best crypto for higher returns in 2025.\nExplore Cold Wallet Now:\nPresale: https://purchase.coldwallet.com/\nWebsite: https://coldwallet.com/\nX: https://x.com/coldwalletapp\nTelegram: https://t.me/ColdWalletAppOfficial\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

        "text": "Cardano (ADA) breakout momentum is rising as it approaches the $0.85 resistance, a point that could open the way for gains toward $1.20. Ethereum (ETH) price signals are also gaining attention, with institutional demand fueling optimism for a run to $5,000.\nAmid these moves, Cold Wallet (CWT) holds its place with numbers that speak clearly. From Stage 1’s $0.007 entry to Stage 17’s $0.00998, $6.2M raised and 735M tokens sold shape it as a compressed multiple play. With Plus Wallet’s 2M+ users backing adoption, its ROI track looks defined, measured, and uncommon in today’s market.\nCardano Builds Momentum as Golden Cross Setup Targets $1.20\nCardano’s price is showing clear strength as it climbs closer to the $0.80 to $0.85 resistance zone. Analysts note that a bullish crossover between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages could mark a breakout trigger. If the setup confirms, ADA may rally to $1.20 and even test $1.50 with sustained momentum.\nSentiment is improving, open interest is rising, and the technical picture matches conditions that often lead to sharp rallies. For watchers of altcoins ready for upside, ADA’s structure combines chart signals with sentiment build-up. Clearing resistance could drive the next stage of growth, and early entry may still bring solid rewards before wider market momentum spreads.\nEthereum Targets $5K as BitMine Expands $24B ETH Buying Plan\nBitMine has announced an expansion of its at-the-market equity program to $24.5 billion to buy more Ethereum, pointing to strong accumulation from institutional investors. This comes as optimism in Ethereum’s long-term role grows alongside a stronger macro picture. ETH is positioning for a move toward $5,000, driven by supply constraints and building momentum.\nTechnical signs show Ethereum moving higher, supporting the case for further gains. BitMine’s plan fits within a broader trend of firms adding crypto assets to their holdings. Flows into ETH ETFs and corporate acquisitions by groups like BitMine underline the bullish setup.\nFor those tracking momentum, Ethereum is standing out as a key candidate, and any early exposure could offer strong upside as institutional players continue to scale up their positions.\nCold Wallet Presale Grows to $6.2M as Stage 17 Nears Its End\nCold Wallet’s presale run has become a clear example of how fast early chances can shrink in crypto. In only a few weeks, the project has raised over $6.2 million and sold more than 735 million tokens, yet Stage 17 pricing at $0.00998 is still active but close to full. For those who joined early, the advantage is simple: each presale stage lifts the price while supply stays fixed, so late buyers lose out on return potential right away.\nFrom Stage 1’s $0.007 entry to today’s near-close of Stage 17, the return math is direct. Buyers are not placing faith in plans on paper; they are booking access to a utility wallet already backed by millions of users through the $270 million Plus Wallet deal. Adoption risk, often the hardest test for new tokens, has been taken out of the picture.\nCold Wallet’s cashback feature makes every transaction, swap, or transfer inside the wallet an instant reward, turning daily use into gains. With whales showing interest and supply tightening, the move to Stage 18 could be the moment where lower-price access disappears. In markets like this, chances to capture such early multiples do not last for long.\nCold Wallet’s Setup Offers Clear Edge Over Other Market Plays\nCardano (ADA) is building momentum for a breakout that could give short-term gains, and Ethereum (ETH) is drawing support from large-scale buying, but both depend on market sentiment to keep moving. Cold Wallet, by contrast, has already secured real utility, adoption, and a presale design that cuts off early access windows as stages move up.\nAt $0.00998 in Stage 17, it sets a straight path to a $0.3517 listing without leaning on speculation. With $6.2M already raised and whales reducing token supply, the step into Stage 18 could remove the best value point. In a market where timing is the key to return, Cold Wallet’s early multiples stand out as the sharpest reward-to-risk play right now.\nExplore Cold Wallet Now:\nPresale: https://purchase.coldwallet.com/\nWebsite: https://coldwallet.com/\nX: https://x.com/coldwalletapp\nTelegram: https://t.me/ColdWalletAppOfficial\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

        "text": "Finding the right cryptocurrency means weighing high return potential against solid fundamentals. With countless tokens competing for attention, focusing on those with both market momentum and clear development progress is essential. The top cryptos to watch right now are not just random names, they have active communities, strong engagement, and strategic roadmaps that make them stand out.\nBlockDAG is dominating headlines with one of 2025’s largest presales and a push for premium exchange listings. TRX is building strength through its buyback program and growing on-chain activity. TON is attracting institutional investment alongside ecosystem expansion, while UNI is posting strong price action ahead of a major governance change. Each project has unique advantages, making them worth watching closely this year.\n1. BlockDAG: Record-Breaking Presale & U.S. Listing Ambitions\nBlockDAG is gaining momentum fast, blending Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology with Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus and full EVM compatibility. This combination allows for high transaction speeds without sacrificing security and offers developers flexibility for smart contract deployment.\nThe presale has already brought in more than $375 million toward a $600 million target, with over 25.2 billion BDAG coins sold across 29 batches at $0.0276 each. Early buyers from Batch 1 have already seen gains of about 2,660%, and forecasts suggest an 81% increase at a $0.05 listing price, with a potential surge toward $1 if major U.S. listings succeed.\nEven before launch, BlockDAG’s ecosystem is active, boasting 2.5 million users on its X1 Mobile Miner app, over 4,500 developers working on 300+ dApps, and a growing base of 200,000 holders. More than 19,300 mining rigs have been sold, and a live Demo Trading platform is already preparing users for real market scenarios.\nThe listing roadmap is another major growth driver. Confirmed for 20 exchanges including MEXC, BitMart, LBank, Coinstore, and XT.com, BlockDAG is also targeting Coinbase and Gemini. For investors scanning the market, this combination of presale momentum, robust technology, and listing strategy cements BlockDAG as one of the top cryptos to watch.\n2. TON: Institutional Backing and Expanding Ecosystem\nToncoin (TON) is trading at around $3.53, holding a market cap close to $9 billion with daily volumes between $400 million and $500 million. A major recent development came when Coinbase Ventures purchased TON tokens directly from Telegram, an unusual move that underscores confidence from a leading institutional investor.\nChart resistance levels sit at $3.588 and $3.77, with potential targets at $4.21 and up to $7.07 if bullish momentum continues. On the development side, Telegram’s hit game Hamster Kombat has launched the Hamster Network, a Layer-2 built on TON, potentially driving greater adoption. The blend of institutional interest, Telegram integration, and developer activity positions TON as a strong contender among the top cryptos to watch.\n3. TRX: Billion-Dollar Buyback and Rising Network Activity\nTRON’s TRX is trading near $0.3618, supported by a market cap of roughly $34 billion and daily trading volume above $1.3 billion. Over the past week, TRX has climbed more than 7%, consistently testing important resistance levels. It recently broke through $0.3320 and is using the $0.36–$0.34 range as a launchpad for further gains.\nThe main catalyst is TRON’s $1 billion buyback program, which coincides with rising on-chain transactions and increased whale accumulation. Beyond price speculation, TRON remains a hub for stablecoin transfers and continues to expand its DeFi reach. With strong technical indicators and capital injection from the buyback plan, TRX offers traders a balance of reliability and growth, making it one of the top cryptos to watch for 2025.\n4. UNI: Governance Shift & Price Momentum\nUniswap’s UNI token trades around $12.17, up roughly 5% on the day with a $7.57 billion market cap. It has surged more than 31% over the past week, and a breakout above $12.25 could open the door to $13 and higher. If UNI clears the $14.50 long-term resistance, analysts see a path toward the $27–$30 zone.\nThe latest surge is tied to governance reform. The Uniswap Foundation has proposed creating “DUNI,” a Wyoming-based entity that could activate the long-discussed fee switch, redirecting protocol transaction fees to the DAO treasury.\nThe plan allocates $16.5 million worth of UNI for tax settlements and legal defense, with a potential community vote set for August 18, 2025. This shift could align protocol earnings directly with tokenholder benefits, making UNI a must-watch in the DeFi sector.\nWhich is the Top Crypto to Watch in 2025?\nThe projects leading the market today combine strong fundamentals, active communities, and a roadmap to wider adoption. BlockDAG stands out with a record presale, functioning ecosystem, and big exchange targets that could fuel a sharp post-listing rally. TRX is proving resilient with a billion-dollar buyback and expanding real-world usage. TON benefits from institutional support and ecosystem integration, while UNI is on the verge of a governance change that could enhance tokenholder rewards.\nFor those seeking presale growth, network adoption, or governance-driven catalysts, these four coins are clear top cryptos to watch in 2025, each with major developments in motion that could define their performance for the rest of the year.\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

Standard Chartered projects XRP could reach $5.50 by late 2025, with some forecasts stretching as high as $15.00 if adoption in cross-border settlements accelerates.\nThe combination of legal clarity and growing banking partnerships keeps XRP on the radar as a best cryptocurrency to invest in.\nEthereum (ETH) – ETF Demand and Network Strength\nEthereum remains a frontrunner for developers and investors alike. Standard Chartered has boosted its year-end 2025 target from $4,000 to $7,500, citing strong ETF demand and an expanding DeFi ecosystem.\nSome bullish scenarios even point toward $15,000.

        "text": "As 2025 picks up speed, the search for the best altcoin to buy in 2025 is more intense than ever. With volatility climbing and institutional money entering, a few projects are stealing the spotlight. Cold Wallet (CWT) is defying sentiment with a presale that refuses to slow down, Cardano (ADA) is breaking through psychological barriers, Monero (XMR) is battling mining debates, and Chainlink (LINK) is charging toward fresh highs.\nEach tells a different story: cutting-edge DeFi utility, scalable blockchain infrastructure, privacy-first crypto, and oracle dominance. Here’s how their latest performance, chart signals, and growth outlook put them on the radar as the best altcoin to buy in 2025 for traders and long-term holders ready to catch the next breakout.\nCold Wallet (CWT) Presale Rush: Tiny Price Huge Potential\nCold Wallet (CWT) is drawing serious buzz in the run for the best altcoin to buy in 2025 and its numbers show why. The presale has raised $6.2 million with Stage 17 tokens priced at $0.00998. With a confirmed launch price of $0.3517, early entries are staring at a 3,423% ROI.\nThe project is flipping the idea of a crypto wallet by making gas fees, swaps, and transfers reward-generating actions. No lockups or staking, just cashback in CWT.\nIts boldest step was a $270 million Plus Wallet takeover, adding 2 million+ users overnight and instantly competing with Trust Wallet and MetaMask. With more than 730M tokens sold, every stage moves the price higher and reduces entry windows.\nWhile rivals chase traction, CWT’s engine is already running at full speed. For those weighing utility, adoption, and massive upside, Cold Wallet is proving why it could be the best altcoin to buy in 2025 before this presale closes fast.\nMonero Battles Mining Centralization Fears\nMonero’s reputation as a privacy leader is under fire. Qubic, a mining pool tied to IOTA co-founder Sergey Ivancheglo, recently claimed majority control of Monero’s hashing power. This “selfish mining” move caused a six-block reorganization but stopped short of a full 51% attack. The news sent prices sliding 15% in a week and stirred doubts about decentralization.\nDespite the shock, Monero’s blockchain is still running and its developer base is weighing countermeasures. Adding fuel to the drama, Unstoppable Private Wallet will launch native Monero support on August 18, a step that could lift adoption during a tense moment.\nFor privacy-driven traders, Monero’s durability in crisis could be the factor that makes it a best altcoin to buy in 2025, though its long-term decentralization issues remain part of the risk.\nCardano Pushes Above $1 With ETF Buzz\nCardano is trading over $1 for the first time in five months, lifted by talk of possible Cardano ETFs and strong whale accumulation. A golden cross on charts adds momentum, with bullish targets as high as $3.\nInstitutional confidence is rising, reinforced by Grayscale’s ETF filing, which could draw major inflows. Founder Charles Hoskinson is using Monero’s struggles to promote Cardano’s Midnight sidechain, which brings privacy features with stronger security.\nWith its rising price strength, institutional backing, and upcoming upgrades, Cardano is solidifying its place as a best altcoin to buy in 2025 for investors seeking scalability, safety, and long-run growth.\nChainlink Climbs With $47 Target in Sight\nChainlink is proving its strength in blockchain’s infrastructure layer. LINK has surged 53% in the last month and now trades near $24, with analysts watching for a run toward $47.\nThe network’s Total Value Secured has hit $93 billion, showing massive DeFi adoption. On-chain data points to whales buying, lower exchange reserves, and strong social buzz, all signaling upside pressure.\nAs oracles grow vital for blockchain connectivity, Chainlink’s role as the leading provider cements its case as a best altcoin to buy in 2025, especially if it breaks above $25 with strong trading volume.\n2025 Altcoin Picks That Could Define the Market\nFrom explosive presales like Cold Wallet to long-standing players like Cardano, Monero, and Chainlink, the race for the best altcoin to buy in 2025 covers privacy, scalability, infrastructure, and innovation. Cold Wallet’s record-breaking presale, powered by real utility and a major acquisition, sets it apart as a high-upside entry before launch.\nCardano’s ETF potential and chart strength are driving big-money attention, Monero continues to showcase resilience despite centralization worries, and Chainlink is locking down its role as the backbone of blockchain data.\nDiversifying across these narratives could maximize exposure to the next bull wave. But for those chasing asymmetric gains, Cold Wallet’s presale clock is ticking fast and missing it could mean watching one of 2025’s standout winners from the sidelines.\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.
