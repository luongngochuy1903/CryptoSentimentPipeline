Meanwhile, Intel has been awarded about $10.9 billion in Chips Act grants, including $7.9 billion for commercial manufacturing and $3 billion for national security projects.\nThe report noted, however, that it remains unclear if the idea has gained traction broadly within the administration or whether officials have broached the possibility with affected companies.\nIt added that the exact size of the stake remains in flux, and it remains unclear whether the White House will actually proceed with the plan. Intel and the White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's queries regarding the report.\nIntel, once a dominant force in the U.S. chip industry, has fallen behind global competitors in advanced chip manufacturing. Reviving the former U.S. chip champion has become a national priority in Washington, with reports about a potential government stake in the company first circulating last week.\nThe company has been the largest recipient of the 2022 Chips Act, passed with bipartisan support under the Biden administration, as part of efforts by Washington to revitalize U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing.\nThe bill allocated $39 billion in grants for American semiconductor manufacturing projects, with funding committed to many of the world's chipmakers such as TSMC and Samsung, as well as American chip companies such as Nvidia, Micron and GlobalFoundries.\nU.S. President Donald Trump, though supporting the general goals of the Chips Act, has been a vocal critic of the bill and even called for its repeal earlier this year. While republican lawmakers in Washington have been reluctant to act on that call, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in June that the administration was renegotiating some of the bill's grants.\nIf Intel's Chip Act funds were to be converted into a potential government stake in the company, it could decrease the total amount of capital infused into the company as part of any deal by Washington.\nHowever, it would serve as the latest example of the Trump administration's interest in building government-backed national champions in strategic industries.\nIntel has struggled to gain an advantage in the artificial intelligence boom and has yet to capture a significant customer for its manufacturing business despite spending heavily on it.\nSome analysts have argued that government intervention is essential for the struggling chipmaker and for the sake of U.S. national security. Others contend that Intel's problems are deeper than funding, and it is not clear how the government can help with that.\nAnalysts have also noted that Trump may be able to sway companies to buy Intel chips or assist indirectly, through tariffs and regulation.\nOn Tuesday, it was announced that SoftBank was investing $2 billion in Intel. According to LSEG, the investment is worth about 2% of Intel, making SoftBank the fifth-biggest shareholder. Masayoshi Son, Chairman & CEO of SoftBank Group, said: \"This strategic investment reflects our belief that advanced semiconductor manufacturing and supply will further expand in the United States, with Intel playing a critical role.\"\nIntel investors had initially welcomed news of the government investment, which resulted in a share rally of nearly 9% on Aug. 14. Shares of Intel fell over 3% on Monday on the Bloomberg report, but rebounded by more than 5% in overnight trading on the trading platform Robinhood following news of a Softbank investment.\nIntel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who was appointed in March 2025, met with Trump at the White House last week, after the U.S. president had called for his ousting due to his past ties to China.\nAfter the meeting, Trump had changed his tune on the Intel chief, saying he had \"an amazing story.\" It's unclear if a potential government stake in the company had been discussed at the time.\nRead the full Bloomberg story here.", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 05:38:05 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html", "tag": "economy"}, {"domain": "www.cnbc.com", "title": "SoftBank shares fall over 5% after it announces $2 billion investment in Intel", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/19/asia-stock-markets-today-live-updates-nikkei-225-asx-200-kospi-hang-seng-csi-300-sensex-nifty-50html.html", "text": "Investment firm SoftBank Group snapped its nine-day winning streak Tuesday after its shares plunged as much as 5.69% following its announcement of a $2 billion investment in Intel.

U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy even declared a loneliness epidemic in the U.S. in 2023, saying it was especially affecting young people.\nSome Gen Z workers are even returning to the office in a bid to expand their network. One recent Freeman survey of nearly 2,000 U.S. adults in professional jobs found that 91% of Gen Z said it would be nice to have a balance of virtual and in-person events to connect with others at their company and in their industry.\n\"In general, young people seek the social atmosphere because many of them just graduated college or are a few years out and are looking for similar social conveniences,\" Dan Schawbel, managing partner at Workplace Intelligence, explained.\nSome employers are catching on and trying to fill this gap. Canary Wharf, London's privately owned financial district, which houses companies like JPMorgan, Barclays, and Morgan Stanley, launched the Wharf Connect networking program in 2024 for professionals in the first 10 years of their career.\nPart of the area's return-to-office drive, Wharf Connect is accessible via an app and offers free events from LinkedIn workshops to pub quizzes. The initiative gets an average of 36 attendees per event and has seen 1,500 RSVPs since its inception last year.\n\"Part of the return-to-office push is that young people, especially, yearn for those connections, and relative to older generations, they are much more isolated and lonely, so return to office at least partially allows them to meet their coworkers,\" Schawbel said.\nLast week, I took a trip to Canary Wharf to attend a Xiao Long Bao (dumpling) masterclass at Taiwanese restaurant Din Tai Fung \u2014 an event organized by Wharf Connect. Walking into a dining room nestled at the back of the restaurant where the workshop was taking place, I was stunned to see how busy it was with over 50 young professionals in attendance and chattering away.\nThe event featured a hands-on dumpling-making session with the chef, accompanied by complimentary food and drinks.\nCNBC Make It spoke with three Gen Z attendees who shared how structured networking events are helping them find community.\nFilling a social gap\nTwenty-five-year-old Vivek Haria, a senior tax advisor at a financial services firm, has attended 10 Wharf Connect events.\nBefore starting his job in the Canary Wharf area, he was already seeking out social events or communities that would allow him to socialize and mingle outside of the workplace, but they left much to be desired.\n\"In fact, there were hardly any, and the ones I went to were pretty much a bit crap. Then I moved here, and this was the last place that I expected these kinds of events. It's definitely filled that gap. I've made some really good friends that I meet up with on weekends as well,\" Haria said.\nFor Sinny Wei, a 27-year-old human resources professional, moving from New Zealand to London meant she didn't have an established network or community in the U.K.\n\"For me, personally, it is difficult to make friends, because I've moved over here as well, so you've really got to put yourself out there a lot. I really do like it [Wharf Connect] for that as well,\" she said.\nWei said it's a good way to socialize informally, with free tickets, food and drinks being a great draw to the events.\n\"I've only been to two events, so maybe if you ask me after three events, I'll have made some friends by then,\" she said.\nHaria noted that, although he returned to the office, many of his colleagues weren't physically at the workplace. The Wharf Connect events makes going to the office worthwhile, because he has something to look forward to in the evenings, he noted.\n\"So I go into the office as many times a week as I can\u2026working from home after Covid has been a bit s--- like I'll go into the office three or four times a week and most of my team won't be in,\" Haria said.\nIn fact, a 2023 survey by employee background screening company Checkr, which polled 3,000 U.S. workers, found that 68% of managers were keen to continue remote and hybrid work in 2024, while only 48% of employees felt the same way.\nSenior professionals have less motivation to be in the office, according to Schawbel. With more established social lives, less of a need for mentorship, and better home office setups, older professionals are less drawn to the in-person workplace. This is creating a social void for younger workers.\nIn-person events are trendy now\nOrganized in-person events, from professional networking to speed dating, are in vogue right now, and they are very appealing for Gen Z \u2014 some of whom may have underdeveloped social skills.\n\"Covid, plus over-reliance on technology equals socially awkward,\" Schawbel said. \"I'm not saying everyone is socially awkward. I'm just saying it's a recipe to create socially awkward individuals.\"\nActivity-focused events enable young people to socialize in a structured environment, rather than forcing them to spark up conversations at random.\nDating giant Hinge is even funding free activity-based social events for young people in London, Los Angeles, and New York to make friends. Another example is social app Time Left, which arranges weekly dinners for strangers to meet up, with over 80,000 strangers brought together in 60 countries each month.\nMorayo Adesina, a 25-year-old equity research bank analyst, said that London changed after the Covid-19 pandemic, with many restaurants and bars not staying open as late \u2014 making it hard to get out of the house spontaneously.\n\"Speed dating has definitely become very popular amongst my friends. I just think in general, there's been, a real push to have different kinds of events,\" she said.\nWharf Connect has been an opportunity for Adesina to meet \"a lot of cool people\" and try new things. \"The events that they put on are quite fun, like it's not every day that I get to go to Din Tai Fung to do dumpling making or sushi making.\"\nSchawbel said that for many years, people have over-relied on technology to form connections, such as on dating apps or social media, but the abundance of options has created a sense of overwhelm. The rise of in-person events and the demand for them is a rejection of online culture, he added.\n\"They're resisting this digital age, because the digital age has become very cluttered and unreliable, therefore, they're yearning to connect in person more,\" Schawbel said.", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 05:00:01 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html", "tag": "economy"}, {"domain": "www.cnbc.com", "title": "American money pours into Europe\u2019s soccer giants as club valuations soar", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/19/american-money-pours-into-european-soccer-as-club-valuations-soar.html", "text": "European soccer is a bigger business than ever, with clubs in the continent's five top leagues raking in 20.4 billion euros ($23.7 billion) in revenue in the 2023-2024 season \u2014 and American investors have been eyeing a piece of that pie.\nU.S. investors now own, fully or in part, the majority of soccer teams in England's Premier League. That now includes four of the traditional Big Six clubs, with Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal all attracting U.S. investment.\nRapid growth in revenues has been the key attraction.\nIn the 1996-97 season, when the Premier League was established in England, revenues across the five biggest European leagues totaled 2.5 billion euros, according to Deloitte analysis.\nIn 2023-24, that figure ballooned by 750%.\nThat growth has led to sharp increases in valuations for Europe's biggest soccer teams. The Glazer family, which also owns the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, bought Manchester United for \u00a3790 million ($1.07 billion) in 2005. In 2024, a minority stake sale to billionaire Jim Ratcliffe pegged the club at around \u00a35 billion, or the biggest valuation in world soccer.\nKieran Maguire, associate professor in football finance at the University of Liverpool, told CNBC on Wednesday that the rising levels of U.S. ownership in European soccer have been driven by higher wealth aggregation Stateside.\n\"It's actually a bit of a no brainer \u2026 what else you can do with your cash? You can only have so many helicopters, you can only have so many super yachts.\"\nAccording to Maguire, the small number of top professional sports teams available to purchase has also contributed to rising demand, with investors unable to meet the multi-billion dollar price tags attached to NFL or NBA teams in the U.S. looking to European soccer as an alternative.\nPrivate equity\nMore than 36 of clubs in Europe's five biggest leagues now have private equity, venture capital or private debt participation through majority or minority stakes, including a majority of clubs in the Premier League, according to PitchBook research.\nThe data shows a sharp increase in M&A deal activity in European soccer clubs, from just 66.7 million euros in 2018 to almost 2.2 billion euros in 2024.\nMany private equity investors in soccer have looked to the multi-club ownership model to boost their investments. Speaking to CNBC, PitchBook Senior EMEA Private Capital Analyst Nicolas Moura said many U.S. investors want to \"build a variety of different football clubs,\" and that the model can have marketing and financial benefits.\nBut the increasing prevalence of multi-club ownership has risked the ire of regulators, with Moura saying that European soccer body UEFA is \"starting to crack down on clubs.\"\nThis summer, England's Crystal Palace was barred from participating in UEFA's Europa League competition due to a breach of multi-club ownership rules. American businessman John Textor owns a stake in the English club as well as in France's Lyon, which also qualified for the competition.\nMoura says the decision \u2014 which Crystal Palace labelled as an \"injustice\" \u2014 could become more of an issue as more clubs involved in multi-club structures move into Europe's top divisions.\nWhat's next?\nThe growth of soccer revenues has slowed in recent years, with Deloitte saying it sees income \"plateauing\" in the 2025-26 season on the back of slowing growth in the value of sports media rights.\nThat has left commercial revenue \u2014 up 6% in the 2023-24 season, per Deloitte \u2014 as a main driver, as clubs clinched new sponsorship deals and looked to utilize stadiums for non-soccer events.\nMoura says lots of U.S. private equity investors are \"looking to do their stands, their entire stadiums\" in a bid to diversify away from broadcast income.\nThe search for growth in commercial and match day revenues could see more clubs holding regular matches overseas. Spain's La Liga will take its first regular season game abroad this season, as current champions Barcelona prepare to play Villareal in Miami. Italy's Serie A is also considering an international game, with the country's governing body approving plans for a match in Australia. Until now, games in domestic leagues have not been allowed to be played outside of their home country, with global governing body FIFA considering a formal change to its rules on overseas matches.\nMaguire says Premier League clubs will eventually look to hold games overseas to compete with rival European leagues, and that the money generated will mean games \"will be sold to the fan base \u2026 effectively as a fait accompli.\"\nThe Premier League has not publicly entertained the idea of taking regular season games out of England, with CEO Richard Masters telling CNBC the league is \"very different\" from American peers when it comes to international games.", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 05:10:27 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html", "tag": "economy"}, {"domain": "www.cnbc.com", "title": "European markets set to open higher amid positive reaction to Trump-Zelenskyy talks", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/19/european-markets-on-aug-19-stoxx-600-ftse-dax-trump-talks-fed.html", "text": "LONDON \u2014 European stocks are expected to open broadly higher on Tuesday as global markets reacted positively to the outcome of talks between U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday.\nThe U.K.'s FTSE index is seen opening 0.18% higher, Germany's DAX 0.14% higher, France's CAC 40 up 0.16% and Italy's FTSE MIB flat.\nAt the closely watched talks on Monday, Trump said peace negotiations can take place while both countries are still fighting, dropping his earlier calls for a ceasefire.

And also lakes and rivers are favorable destinations,\" a spokesperson for the Slovenian Tourist Board told CNBC by email.\nTourism challenges\nWhile a shift in travel preferences may help to alleviate overtourism in Europe's traditional hotspots, the coolcations trend could have significant economic consequences.\nSouthern European countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal are all heavily reliant on tourism, with the latest available data showing the sector accounted for 18%, 12.3% and 11.9% of gross domestic product, respectively.\nLinda Jonczyk, a spokesperson for TUI, Europe's largest tour operator, said the company was seeing growing interest in Nordic destinations such as Iceland, Norway and Sweden due to the coolcations trend. Yet, bookings were still relatively low compared to other traditional summer hotspots.\n\"Classic sun and beach destinations around the Mediterranean continue to be high in demand \u2013 Spain, Greece and Turkey are and remain the undisputed favourites,\" Jonczyk told CNBC by email.\nFor its part, Portugal's national tourism authority said summer demand in key regions remains robust. A spokesperson for Turismo de Portugal said that while some regions in the north and center were managing localized wildfires, the vast majority of the country was unaffected.\n\"Portugal's tourism infrastructure is highly prepared to respond to such challenges, with contingency measures in place to ensure minimal disruption,\" Turismo de Portugal told CNBC by email.\n\"Airports and ports across the country are operating at full capacity, and the tourism sector remains strong \u2014 with summer arrivals in key regions matching or surpassing last year's numbers,\" they added.\nA 'climate risk zone'\nGlobetrender's Southan said she expects the coolcations trend to solidify over the coming years.\nShe predicted that by the late 2020s, the Mediterranean's peak travel season could shift to May-June and September-October, with July-August \"becoming a 'climate risk zone' for mass tourism.\"\n\"Southern destinations will increasingly invest in climate-resilient infrastructure \u2013 shaded public spaces, heat-adaptive hotels, wildfire prevention corridors \u2013 while promoting alternative experiences beyond the midday sun,\" Southan said.\n\"Meanwhile, northern Europe, once a niche summer escape, may need to manage its own version of 'overtourism' as hotter summers drive demand. For the travel industry, adapting to this new normal is no longer optional \u2013 it's the difference between thriving in a changing climate and being left behind.\"", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 05:07:44 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html", "tag": "economy"}, {"domain": "www.ft.com", "title": "No, Trump is not ushering in a new global trading order", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7514ce1b-14e7-4c2d-9aa6-252c6b6ed35a", "text": "No, Trump is not ushering in a new global trading order\nThen $75 per month.

He will be replaced by CPO Lee Klarich, who was part of the cybersecurity company's founding team. Klarich joins the board of directors and will be responsible for the company's technological vision and leading, organizational, product and engineering development.\nZuk founded Palo Alto Networks in 2005 and built it into one of the world's major cybersecurity players. The company's success has made him one of the wealthiest billionaires Israeli high-tech has produced, with estimated wealth of $1.6 billion by Forbes.\nPalo Alto said that Zuk is \"stepping away to turn his attention to a new set of challenges and untapped ideas he is passionate about pursuing.\" It is possible that the \"challenges\" that Zuk is seeking are in the Israeli media, an industry in which he has shown increasing interest in recent years but has struggled to make an impact. For example the failure of his liberal TV channel Relevant followed by his failure in talks to acquire Reshet 13.\nJust a few weeks ago, Palo Alto Networks announced that it is acquiring Israeli cybersecurity company CyberArk (Nasdaq: CYBR) for $25 billion - the second largest exit in Israeli history. The deal is mainly in Palo Alto Networks shares.\nDespite last night's dramatic announcement, Palo Alto Network's share price has been rising sharply in afterhours trading on Wall Street, probably because the company published strong second quarter results, beating the analysts' expectation of earning per share of $0.89 with $0.95.\n\"I started Palo Alto Networks with a radical idea\"\nIn his resignation announcement, Zuk said, \"I started Palo Alto Networks with a radical idea and the conviction to challenge a stagnant industry with a cybersecurity platform. Our vision has always been to lead from the front, and our recent intent to acquire CyberArk is a testament to that enduring ambition. With the most comprehensive security portfolio today, I am confident in Nikesh's leadership and thrilled to pass the torch to Lee Klarich . He is a phenomenal technologist who will carry that competitive fire into our next chapter. This has been an incredible journey, and I leave with deep satisfaction, knowing the company we built together is stronger than ever.\"\nZuk, 54, was born and raised in Rehovot. In the army he was the head of the development department in the 8200 intelligence unit and graduated with a B.Sc. in math from Tel Aviv University. After leaving the army he joined a small startup called Check Point Software.\n\"There were less than ten people there at the time,\" Zuk once recalled. \"In 1997, I moved to the US for the company and stayed there for a few years. Then I left, founded OneSecure, sold it for $45 million in shares, and left. That's when I founded Palo Alto Networks.\" Since then, his venture has become the most valuable cybersecurity company in the world with a market cap of $117.67 billion.\nPalo Alto Networks chairman and CEO Nikesh Arora said, \"Niir is a legend in cybersecurity, and his contributions are forever etched in our history books.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 19, 2025.\n\u00a9 Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 03:27:00 GMT", "author": "Meytal Vaizberg and Nevo Trabelsy", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725", "tag": "economy"}, {"domain": "www.benzinga.com", "title": "Circle-Backed Company's Yen Stablecoin Nears Official Approval In Japan: Report (UPDATED)", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/crypto/cryptocurrency/25/08/47176731/circle-backed-companys-yen-stablecoin-nears-official-approval-in-japan-report", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story has been updated to include comments from the Financial Services Agency of Japan\nJapan is set to approve the nation's first yen-denominated stablecoin, the country\u2019s market regulator confirmed Tuesday.\nJPYC Stablecoin On The Way In Japan\nA Financial Services Agency spokesperson told Benzinga that JPYC Inc., the stablecoin's issuer, has been registered as a regulated entity authorized to issue yen-backed stablecoins.\nJPYC also revealed in an X post that it has become the first fund transfer service provider in Japan to issue cryptocurrencies that are pegged 1:1 to the national currency.\nThe company said the stablecoin will be deployed on Ethereum ETH/USD, Avalanche AVAX/USD and Polygon POL/USD.\nThe news was first reported by Nikkei on Monday.

His move to Washington further cements his role as a reliable Trump defender, having backed the former president throughout a series of indictments and legal battles in recent years.\nBongino's Clashes Over Epstein Files\nBongino, meanwhile, has clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI leadership after the Justice Department reaffirmed last month that Epstein had no \"client list\" and that his 2019 jailhouse death was a suicide.\nThe findings angered Trump's base, fueling conspiracy claims that top Democrats were shielded.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has accused Elon Musk's SpaceX of benefiting from billions in U.S. government contracts while paying little to no federal taxes.\nWarren Accuses Musk Of Dodging Taxes\nOn Monday, Warren took to X, formerly Twitter, and said that \"Elon Musk's SpaceX is worth over $350 BILLION \u2013 after receiving billions in government contracts \u2013 but could be paying LESS in taxes than you.\"\nShe blamed Donald Trump's tax reforms, saying Republicans \"rigged the tax code with loopholes for billionaire corporations\" and demanded \"no more corporate handouts.\"\nHer remarks followed a New York Times report that SpaceX has avoided paying federal income tax on about $5 billion in taxable income since its founding in 2002 by using a legal tax strategy known as a net operating loss carryforward.\nThe provision, expanded indefinitely under Trump in 2017, lets companies offset future income with earlier losses.\nMusk Previously Defended Tesla's Tax Strategy\nMusk currently has a net worth of $375 billion, according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, making him the wealthiest individual on Earth.\nIn February earlier this year, Musk and Tesla Inc. TSLA VP of Finance Sendil Palani denied claims that Tesla evaded taxes, saying that the company legally carried forward past losses under IRS provisions.\nAt the time, Musk acknowledged Tesla didn't pay U.S. federal income tax for several years, including 2024, since most profits come from overseas sales, but highlighted the need for comprehensive tax reform to address excessive loopholes.\nSpaceX's Revenue Soars, Taxes Stay Low\nDocuments reviewed by the publication show that more than 75% of SpaceX\u2019s revenue in 2020 and 2021 came from federal contracts. Despite that reliance on taxpayers, SpaceX paid only minimal taxes \u2014 including $483,000 to foreign governments and $78,000 in state taxes in 2021.\nSpaceX's business is also booming. Revenue is expected to reach $15.5 billion in 2025, double the $7.4 billion reported in 2023.\nStarlink, its satellite internet service, now generates more revenue than its rocket division, with 2.5 million users and $8 billion in 2023 sales.\nWarren Broadens Criticism Of Musk\nWarren has previously also targeted Musk over what she describes as conflicts of interest and misuse of government influence. In June, her office released a report titled \"130 Days of Elon Musk,\" alleging more than 100 abuses of power during his time as a Trump administration adviser.\nShe has also criticized the Pentagon for awarding Musk's AI startup xAI a $200 million contract just days after its chatbot Grok was caught making antisemitic remarks.\nRead Next:\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nPhoto Courtesy: Sheila Fitzgerald On Shutterstock.com\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

The new Model Y also features an all-wheel drive setup and 19-inch wheels.\nTesla also offers its FSD, or Full Self-Driving capabilities, in the Model Y L for an additional 64,000 RMB or approximately $8,907, though the company doesn't call it the FSD system in the Chinese market.\nSource: Tesla China\nTesla's Model 3+, UK Monthly Lease Discounts Amid Poor Sales\nThe new Model Y L follows plans by the company also to launch a Model 3+ sedan in the Chinese market, which will reportedly offer over 500 miles of range on a single charge.\nMeanwhile, Tesla is also grappling with falling sales across multiple regions. Recently, the company reportedly began offering discounts on monthly lease payments in the UK amid a 60% drop in July sales for the company.\nNorway Bucks Global Sales Decline, BYD Tops Global EV Sales\nDespite the decline, Tesla's Norwegian sales have defied the global trend as the company recorded a 24% surge in units sold.

Why? What does he really stand for? | Oliver Eagleton", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/19/labour-right-wes-streeting-downing-street-health-secretary-nhs", "text": "Just over a year after Keir Starmer entered Downing Street, his political survival already looks uncertain. Perennially indecisive, unpopular with the public and unable to pass major legislation without rebellions, the prime minister has reportedly been put \u201con notice\u201d by senior figures within his party. Speculation about a potential successor is mounting.\nWhat would Labour\u2019s dominant faction \u2013 the neo-Blairite right \u2013 look for in a candidate? Their best bet would be an effective operator who doesn\u2019t carry too much political baggage, a decent communicator, free of Starmer\u2019s stumbling reticence, and a committed partisan of their cause: namely the free market and a strong state. They need someone who will go on the offensive for these values, rather than offering the bland apologetics that we have seen from the incumbent.\nFew fit the bill better than the health secretary, Wes Streeting, who has made no secret of his ambition to lead the country and appears to have spent years laying the groundwork with media rounds, donor events and backroom conversations. When Starmer\u2019s leadership of the Labour party was on the brink during the Beergate scandal, Peter Mandelson is said to have canvassed the Labour frontbench to anoint Streeting. \u201cIn the longer term,\u201d briefed one party source, \u201cWes is their guy, not Keir.\u201d\nBorn into a working-class east London family in 1983, Streeting has been fairly consistent in both his political style and outlook since he was in his early 20s. A pugnacious advocate of private enterprise, and an effective behind-the-scenes operator, his deft handling of the press allows him to stride into the limelight at crucial moments, with memorable one-liners that seem crafted to enrage his opponents. As president of the National Union of Students (NUS) in the twilight of the New Labour era, he inveighed against lecturers\u2019 strikes, remarking that \u201cstudents need industrial action by university staff like a hole in the head\u201d. He also broke with dominant student opinion by supporting tuition fees and criticising Palestine solidarity protests.\nFrom the NUS it was only a small step to parliament, where Streeting landed in 2015. The words \u201cfuture leader\u201d were immediately \u201cappended to his name like a Homeric epithet\u201d, according to one insider account. He vigorously opposed the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, repeatedly excoriating him in parliamentary meetings and working with the People\u2019s Vote campaign to chip away at his resistance to a second Brexit referendum. This earned him a place in Starmer\u2019s shadow cabinet once the right had regained control five years later. There, he made no bones about accepting hundreds of thousands of pounds from donors linked to the private healthcare industry. He insisted that the party needed to get tough on \u201claw and order\u201d along with \u201cdefence and national security\u201d; and he signalled a clear shift from the foreign policy of the Corbyn era by visiting Israel and meeting with ministers in its government.\nNow that Streeting is at the helm of the NHS, we are beginning to see how his hypothetical prime ministership might play out. Shortly after the last general election, he sketched out his vision for the health service in the pages of the Sun, writing that \u201cmajor surgery\u201d was needed to make it \u201cfit for the future\u201d: moving treatment out of hospitals, so as to focus on local care and prevention. This could not be achieved through public spending, Streeting warned, because \u201cthe money isn\u2019t there\u201d. It could only be done through hard-knuckled \u201creform\u201d.\nTrue to his word, Streeting has helped to normalise the state of perma-austerity at the health department, which will receive only an extra 2.8% annually in real terms over the coming years: less than the long-term historical norm of 3.7%, and far below the average increase of 6.8% under New Labour. This is nowhere near enough to solve the perpetual crisis in the sector, let alone make any real improvements in the quality of care.\nWithout meaningful investment, the levers that Streeting can pull to realise his goals are limited. There is reorganisation through measures such as the summary abolition of NHS England and mass job cuts. There is techno-optimism, allowing AI companies such as Palantir to run parts of the ailing service. And, most importantly, there is privatisation.\nStreeting has been working hard to ensure that \u201cmore treatments can be delivered through the independent sector\u201d, as an official briefing put it. Under his watch, an even greater portion of the NHS \u2013 including, potentially, sensitive patient data \u2013 is being handed over to profit-making companies. His plan to set up 300 \u201cneighbourhood health hubs\u201d is powered by corporate finance, in what is shaping up to be a frame-by-frame replay of the disastrous PFI initiatives of the 2000s. Research shows that the effect of these policies is to worsen health inequality. But this does not seem to concern the minister.\nBullish as ever, Streeting has said he is \u201cup for the fight\u201d that his plan will provoke. And that is what he now has. In recent weeks, resident doctors rejected his notion that \u201creform\u201d alone will magically resolve the service\u2019s deep-rooted problems of under-resourcing and understaffing. They refused to accept a pay deal that would amount to a 21% reduction in their salaries since 2008, and instead made a principled case for wage restoration. Streeting was intransigent. During the resulting five-day strike he launched a series of broadsides against the workers, insisting that they must feel the \u201cpain\u201d of the walkouts and vowing that they would \u201close a war with this government\u201d. Much like his \u201cbullet in the head\u201d rhetoric, the remarks showed that Streeting\u2019s main interest is in positioning himself as a crusader on behalf of the establishment rather than fixing the service he oversees. He is also keenly aware of the populist appeal of his rhetoric at a time when support for the doctors\u2019 struggle is in decline.\nThe other front on which Streeting has been fighting is the culture war. He has imposed a permanent ban on puberty blockers for trans children \u2013 despite a wealth of dissenting expert opinion including that of the British Medical Association, which disputes the scientific basis of the prohibition \u2013 and he has also barred those under 18 from changing gender markers on their NHS records, potentially making it more difficult for them to access vital services.\nThe irony, of course, is that while Streeting styles himself as the man to beat Nigel Farage, his politics is one of deference to big business, clampdowns on trans rights and incendiary rhetoric to provoke the left. These features are more typically associated with reactionary populism than with social democracy. Streeting\u2019s ascent reflects the fact that, in today\u2019s Labour party, the former is cannibalising the latter.\n-\nOliver Eagleton is an associate editor at the New Left Review and author of The Starmer Project: A Journey to the Right", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 05:00:09 GMT", "author": "Oliver Eagleton", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss", "tag": "politics"}, {"domain": "www.cbsnews.com", "title": "Judge gives Trump administration partial victory in \"Alligator Alcatraz\" case", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alligator-alcatraz-florida-everglades-judge-detainees-rights/", "text": "Judge gives Trump administration and Florida partial victory in \"Alligator Alcatraz\" case\nA federal judge on Monday tossed out part of a lawsuit brought by detainees at a temporary immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, handing a partial victory to the Trump administration and Florida state officials \u2014 though other challenges over \"Alligator Alcatraz\" are still pending.\nCivil rights attorneys had sued the Trump administration and the state of Florida, seeking a preliminary injunction to ensure that detainees at the facility have confidential access to lawyers. It's the second lawsuit challenging practices at Alligator Alcatraz, a controversial detention facility that the Trump administration has cast as a symbol of its crackdown on illegal immigration \u2014 along with a suit arguing the facility had skirted environmental rules.\nBut after a hearing on Monday, Miami-based U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz dismissed one part of their suit that alleged the government was violating the Fifth Amendment because it hadn't made clear for weeks which immigration court had jurisdiction over Alligator Alcatraz, preventing detainees from filing court petitions. Ruiz ruled that this claim is now moot because the government has since said publicly that the court at the Krome Detention Center in South Florida will hear the detainees' claims.\n\"The Court can do no more,\" Ruiz wrote.\nThe judge did not dismiss several other claims that the government is violating the First Amendment by allegedly making it difficult for detainees to talk to their lawyers, especially in confidential settings. Ruiz said that continues to be a \"live controversy.\" But he ordered the case to be transferred to a different federal court, because Alligator Alcatraz is technically within the boundaries of the Orlando-based Middle District of Florida.\nThe federal government has denied that defendants are blocked from meeting with attorneys.\nAlligator Alcatraz jurisdiction clarifications\nThe civil rights attorneys wanted Ruiz to identify an immigration court that has jurisdiction over the detention center so that petitions can be filed for the detainees' bond or release. The attorneys say that hearings for their cases have been routinely canceled in federal Florida immigration courts by judges who say they don't have jurisdiction over the detainees held in the Everglades.\nAt the start of Monday's hearing, government attorneys said they would designate the immigration court at the Krome North Service Processing Center in the Miami area as having jurisdiction over the detention center in the Everglades in an effort to address some of the civil rights attorneys' constitutional concerns. The judge told the government attorneys that he didn't expect them to change that designation without good reason.\nBut before delving into the core issues of the detainees' rights, Ruiz wanted to hear about whether the lawsuit was filed in the proper jurisdiction in Miami. The state and federal government defendants have argued that even though the isolated airstrip where the facility was built is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida's southern district is the wrong venue since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state's middle district.\nThe hearing ended without the judge making an immediate ruling. Ruiz suggested that the case against the federal defendants might be appropriate for the southern district because a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Miami is responsible for oversight of the detention center under an agreement between the state and federal governments.\nBut Ruiz also questioned whether the case against the state defendants might be better in the middle district, because all of the purported civil rights violations occurred at the facility itself, which is located in Collier County, several miles outside the southern district.\nAll parties have agreed that if the complaints against the state are moved to another venue, then the complaints against the federal government should be moved as well.\nSecond lawsuit seeks halt of operations at Alligator Alcatraz\nThe hearing over legal access comes as another federal judge in Miami considers whether construction and operations at the facility should be halted indefinitely because federal environmental rules weren't followed.\nU.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams on Aug. 7 ordered a 14-day halt on additional construction at the site while witnesses testified at a hearing that wrapped up last week. She has said she plans to issue a ruling before the order expires later this week.\nState says claims in lawsuit are false\nThe state of Florida has disputed claims that Alligator Alcatraz detainees have been unable to meet with their attorneys. The state's lawyers said that since July 15, when videoconferencing started at the facility, the state has granted every request for a detainee to meet with an attorney, and in-person meetings started July 28. The first detainees arrived at the beginning of July.\nBut the civil rights attorneys said that even if lawyers have been scheduled to meet with their clients at the detention center, it hasn't been in private or confidential, and it is more restrictive than at other immigration detention facilities. They said scheduling delays and an unreasonable advanced notice requirement have hindered their ability to meet with the detainees, thereby violating their constitutional rights.\nCivil rights attorneys said officers are going cell-to-cell to pressure detainees into signing voluntary removal orders before they're allowed to consult their attorneys, and some detainees have been deported even though they didn't have final removal orders. Along with the spread of a respiratory infection and rainwater flooding their tents, the circumstances have fueled a feeling of desperation among detainees, the attorneys wrote in a court filing.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 23:08:02 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/politics", "tag": "politics"}, {"domain": "www.cbsnews.com", "title": "Trump vows to try banning mail-in voting before 2026 midterm elections", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-ban-mail-in-voting-before-2026-midterm-elections/", "text": "Trump vows to try banning mail-in voting before 2026 midterm elections \u2014 can he do that?\nPresident Trump promised Monday to work to end mail-in voting and said work is already underway on an executive order to ban it before the 2026 midterm elections, although the Constitution does not give him this power.\n\"We, as a Republican Party, are going to do everything possible that we get rid of mail-in ballots,\" he said during an Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \"We're going to start with an executive order that's being written right now by the best lawyers in the country to end mail-in ballots.\"\nWhy does Trump want to ban mail-in ballots?\n\"Mail-in ballots are corrupt,\" the president said. He suggested the method is susceptible to voter fraud, claiming in California, \"it's so corrupt, where some people get five, six, seven ballots delivered to them.\" He has often insisted mail-in ballots can be tampered with or enable people to vote multiple times.\nBut soon after the 2020 election, Debra Cleaver, founder and CEO of VoteAmerica, a nonpartisan voter information site, dismissed the idea of widespread voter fraud as \"a myth.\"\n\"The outgoing ballots have a barcode, and then when you send your ballot in, you put it in a return envelope and that barcode has to match the barcode that was sent out in order for the ballot to be counted,\" she explained to CBS News.\nAfter that election, the director of the nation's cyber security agency, Christopher Krebs, called the 2020 vote \"the most secure in American history.\"\nIn 2024, when Mr. Trump won the presidential election, the U.S. Census Bureau said nearly a third of ballots nationwide were cast by mail.\nThe White House told CBS News in a statement that Democrats had \"eroded faith in our elections\" with policies like \"unfettered mail-in voting.\"\n\"President Trump wants to secure America's elections and protect the vote, restoring the integrity of our elections by requiring voter ID, ensuring no illegal ballots are cast, and preventing cheating through lax and incompetent voting laws in states like California and New York,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said Monday night.\nTrump's impending executive order to stop mail voting \u2014 would it be legal?\nIn a social media post earlier in the day, the president said of the impending order that it would \"help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections.\"\nHe claimed that the states \"are merely an 'agent' for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes,\" and that \"[t]hey must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.\"\nBut Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution says it's the states that have the authority to regulate elections, not the president, and this may be changed only by Congress.\nTrump claims U.S. is the only country that uses mail-in voting. Is that true?\nMr. Trump also claimed, \"We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting\" and argued, \"You will never have an honest election if you have mail-in. And it's time that the Republicans get tough and stop it, because the Democrats want it. It's the only way they can get elected.\"\nIn fact, more than 30 other countries allow voting by mail for some or all voters, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, an intergovernmental advocacy group based in Sweden. Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark are among them.\nMail-in voting in the U.S.\nIn the U.S., mail voting is widespread: 28 states allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot, while the rest require a a documented reason such as illness or military service.\nThe pandemic gave mail voting a huge boost in the 2020 elections. About 43% of voters cast their ballot by mail that year, according to a report by the Election Assistance Commission. In 2024, mail voting dropped off, representing just over 30% of the total votes cast \u2014 about 46.8 million votes. The commission said that last year's numbers still exceeded pre-pandemic levels.\nThe topic of mail-in voting came up during Mr. Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, too. After the two met Friday, the president told Fox News' Sean Hannity that \"Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said, 'You can't have an honest election, election with mail-in voting.'

But Schake\u2019s description goes too far. Despite Trump\u2019s tirades against allies, his administration\u2019s foreign policy remains quite conventional.\nThe U.S. global force posture under Trump is nearly identical to what it was under President Joe Biden, with Trump leaving the approximately 200,000 U.S. troops and hundreds of U.S. bases worldwide mostly as they were before he took office. Not a single U.S. alliance has been ruptured, and to the extent that disagreements occur between the United States and its allies, they center less on how those relationships should function and more on how much the allies are spending on their own militaries. Far from searching for alternatives to American power, allies in Europe and Asia are begging the United States to maintain its current level of support.\nInstead of worrying about the end of U.S. dominance in global affairs, one should question whether the juice of this dominance is worth the squeeze. Schake believes it is, but she neglects to mention any of the costs associated with continuing the status quo, foremost among them an unwillingness on the part of American officials to prioritize what issue is worthy of U.S. involvement. Other strains include a massive overextension of the U.S. military, an American defense-industrial complex unable to meet its work orders, and the propping up of security dependents rather than capable allies. None of that should just be swept under the rug.\nDaniel R.

The United States has been at the helm of each one, shaping the global economy in ways that advance U.S. interests. But with each successive shift, Washington has exerted its influence more unilaterally and aggressively, pushing partners away and creating room for adversaries to fill the breach.\nThe first great reordering came at Bretton Woods, where, in the summer of 1944, the United States used its position of strength following World War II to compel the rest of the world to accept a centrally managed international economic order built around the dollar. Harry Dexter White, the U.S. Treasury official viewed by many as the system\u2019s principal architect, believed an arrangement based on dollars and backed by gold at a fixed exchange rate would promote peace and prosperity through greater trade. Fixed currency parities would ensure global economic stability. Conveniently, this system would also make the United States the world\u2019s economic center of gravity and prevent currency devaluations that could harm American exports. Bretton Woods was multilateral in nature, but it favored the United States.\nU.S. President Richard Nixon forced a second reordering when he brought down the central pillar of the Bretton Woods monetary system: the dollar\u2019s convertibility into gold. This time, there was no pretense of cooperation. During the weekend retreat at Camp David, in 1971, when Nixon\u2019s team arrived at the decision to untether the dollar from gold, Treasury Secretary John Connally dismissed concerns that allies would be furious. \u201cWe\u2019ll go broke getting their good will,\u201d he chided Arthur Burns, the more internationally minded chair of the Federal Reserve. \u201cSo the other countries don\u2019t like it. So what?\u201d\nStill, in the months after breaking the global monetary order, Nixon\u2019s team shifted to a more internationalist position. George Shultz, who succeeded Connally as treasury secretary, talked tough in public but was the consummate diplomat behind the scenes. He worked closely with foreign counterparts to negotiate the removal of capital controls around the world, which he believed would further enhance American financial influence. The informal \u201cLibrary Group\u201d of finance ministers that Shultz convened in the White House library, in April 1973, eventually evolved into the G-7, a cornerstone of international economic diplomacy to this day.\nThe third reordering of the global economy, underway today, is even more explicitly unilateral. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs have targeted allies and adversaries alike out of a belief that the United States has unfairly borne the burdens of underwriting the global financial system and acting as the world\u2019s policeman. These actions are a body blow to what remains of the postwar global trading rules.\nTrump deserves some credit for forcing the world to grapple with the failures of the existing global trade order. Decades of deindustrialization have harmed large swaths of the American workforce and undermined U.S. national security by creating supply chain dependencies on potential adversaries. The World Trade Organization has presided over an era in which countries have showered their export sectors with subsidies, imposed nontariff barriers with impunity, and implemented protectionist measures that contradict the basic principles on which the WTO was founded. Dissatisfaction with the global economy has made anti-trade policies popular among both Democrats and Republicans and propelled the rise of protectionist political parties around the globe.\nTrump is not the first president in recent memory to express concerns about the harms global trade has caused in the United States. Despite his legacy as a free trader, U.S. President Ronald Reagan sought to stem the tide of American deindustrialization with 100 percent tariffs on certain Japanese products and import quotas to protect American industry. Every president since George W. Bush has taken steps to address the flaws of the international trading system around its edges, from Bush\u2019s 2002 steel tariffs to Joe Biden\u2019s decision to maintain most of Trump\u2019s tariffs on China\u2014and impose even greater levies in some cases.\nBut Trump is the first to attempt sweeping structural change. Unfortunately, his approach undercuts key partnerships the United States needs to shape the global economy and, in its more extreme incarnations that would alter the dollar\u2019s role, would cause substantial financial damage. Countries in Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia are already exploring new trade arrangements to limit their exposure to the United States. And the first tsunami wave of tariffs announced in April sent shivers through bond markets, leaving the global economy teetering on the brink before Trump\u2019s advisers convinced him to temporarily pause most of the new tariffs.\nTrump is right that the global trading system needs restructuring, but his proposed cure for global trade imbalances threatens to be worse than the disease. What the United States needs is a new system built on global cooperation that promotes fair trade and strengthens American competitiveness.\nTREATING THE SYMPTOMS\nTrump has been remarkably consistent over the years about his core economic gripe: the trade deficit. In 1987, he spent nearly $100,000 to purchase a full-page ad in three U.S. newspapers that said: \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to end our vast deficits by making Japan, and others who can afford it, pay.\u201d\nThe most serious version of this argument starts from the premise that other countries\u2019 industrial policies have generated artificially large surpluses that the United States has no choice but to absorb through a trade deficit. Because of the dollar\u2019s reserve currency status, the argument goes, the United States must serve as the world\u2019s buyer of last resort and foot the world\u2019s defense bills. This is why the Trump administration views the current global economic order as fundamentally \u201cunfair\u201d to the United States. As the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Stephen Miran, has argued, the deficit that Washington runs as a result of its global position has \u201cdecimated our manufacturing sector\u201d and driven the decline of the United States\u2019 industrial base. In this view, trade deficits are the original sin, and fixing the global economy starts and ends with deficits.\nThis framing misconstrues the true nature of the distortions roiling the global economic system. It also fails to account for the fiscal choices driving the United States\u2019 structural budget imbalance. Trade deficits and deindustrialization are symptoms, not causes. The underlying problem with the global trade and financial systems is their failure to prevent unfair practices that undercut the United States\u2019 ability to compete on a level playing field. Other countries, most notably China, offer massive industrial subsidies, overproduce exports, and disregard labor rules and environmental concerns. As a result, the United States is not manufacturing products even in sectors in which it has a true comparative advantage, especially high-tech products, contributing to the broader atrophy of the industrial base.\nThat does not mean the United States should try to manufacture everything. American manufacturers are unlikely to dominate the global markets for T-shirts and running shoes. But the United States could be a leading producer of advanced manufactured goods, such as sophisticated electronics and medical devices, if everyone had to play by the same set of rules.\nTrump\u2019s proposed cure threatens to be worse than the disease.\nIn recent years, corporate tax havens have also created trade distortions that harm American competitiveness by encouraging companies to move both manufacturing and high-value intellectual property away from the United States to low-tax jurisdictions. Ireland is now the third-largest exporter of digital services in the world\u2014in large part because of American-invented intellectual property. The way Apple operates highlights the problems with today\u2019s global trading system: the company innovates and designs its technology in the United States, manufactures it in China, and reaps the profits in Ireland. In 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) calculated that one-quarter of Irish GDP growth could be attributed to global iPhone sales, thanks to royalties paid to Apple\u2019s Irish subsidiaries, which own the relevant intellectual property. While shareholders in companies that move manufacturing to China and intellectual property to Ireland reap the rewards, the United States\u2019 industrial and tax bases lose out.\nThese challenges must be addressed, but an approach to trade that neglects allies is unlikely to succeed. As Kurt Campbell and Rush Doshi recently argued in these pages, China\u2019s economy is massive in terms of workforce, manufacturing capacity, and even the scope of its industrial policies. The United States needs allies to counterbalance China\u2019s economic weight\u2014and it is the only country that can build a coalition in response to China\u2019s anticompetitive behavior.\nThe European Union, the G-7, and others share American concerns about China\u2019s industrial policies and economic distortions on goods ranging from electric vehicles to steel. China\u2019s steel production generates vast amounts of carbon pollution, and the country operates with lower labor standards than advanced industrial economies in Europe and the United States. As tariffs hamper China\u2019s ability to export to the United States, more of Beijing\u2019s excess manufactured goods are washing up on the shores of Europe, Southeast Asia, and other global markets, threatening their domestic industries. The only effective way to prevent China from gaming the global trading system is to work with like-minded countries to put in place tariff and nontariff barriers to address China\u2019s trade distortions.\nDismissing allies and claiming total victimhood when it comes to global trade also overlooks the benefits that the United States has gained from the dollar\u2019s outsize role in the global economy. The dollar is on one side of nearly 90 percent of foreign exchange transactions and more than half of all global payments sent via SWIFT, the financial messaging platform used for much of the world\u2019s trade. Americans enjoy greater purchasing power and a higher standard of living thanks to how this system generates demand for U.S. currency, and American companies benefit because they can import components at a lower cost. The dollar\u2019s ubiquity gives the United States an arsenal of financial weapons that no other country can match: companies across the globe abide by U.S. sanctions because they have no other choice in a world in which the dollar is so central to international commerce.\nThe dollar\u2019s unique role also affords the United States lower borrowing costs by creating demand for U.S. Treasuries and other American assets. This makes it cheaper to finance everything from defense systems to social welfare programs. But as tariffs, a ballooning deficit, and macroeconomic uncertainty drive foreign investors away, the dollar is weakening\u2014and U.S. borrowing costs are growing alongside rising debt. Now is not the time to cast doubt on the dollar\u2019s global role.\nNEW RULES OF THE ROAD\nThe Trump administration is right to focus on manufacturing\u2014the United States needs more of it. But the current debate over the trade deficit overlooks a key element of the U.S. economy: services. Every time someone swipes a credit card with a Mastercard or Visa logo or queries large language models such as ChatGPT or Claude, it is a reminder of U.S. leadership in the global service economy. The U.S. trade surplus in services totaled nearly $300 billion in 2024, meaning that cutting the trade deficit doesn\u2019t need to rely on manufacturing alone.\nExpanding manufacturing and strengthening services are not mutually exclusive. As technology rapidly advances, manufacturing and services tend to complement each other. U.S. strength in technological and financial services enables the country to manufacture more advanced hardware. It is both an economic and a national security priority to continue creating high-quality service jobs and promoting services built on U.S. digital infrastructure.\nThe majority of Americans work in the service sector today. And although there is much to recommend high-quality manufacturing jobs, service industries offer excellent opportunities, too, including in many blue-collar professions. Service providers such as electricians and plumbers make on average $30 an hour, whereas American textile manufacturers earn an average of only $16 to $19 an hour.\nMoreover, most of the jobs created by onshoring manufacturing will not be on the factory floor. Much of China\u2019s formidable manufacturing advantage stems from robotics, automation, and the early adoption of AI. To compete with China, American factories will also need to be highly automated, especially in advanced manufacturing industries such as semiconductors, automobiles, and medical devices in which the United States is best positioned to compete.\nEmphasizing the importance of services does not undercut the case for reindustrialization as a way of creating jobs, but it does mean the jobs will look different from what many people imagine. The economist Enrico Moretti has found that every manufacturing job created in a given city generates 1.6 jobs in the city\u2019s \u201cnontradable\u201d\u2014that is, service\u2014sector. For high-tech manufacturing, the multiplier is even greater: each new manufacturing role produces nearly five new service-sector positions. Reindustrialization can help unlock that multiplier effect.\nAn industrial policy based entirely on punitive, unilateral tariffs will not promote the sustainable growth of the United States\u2019 industrial base. By raising prices without addressing the underlying drivers of trade imbalances, it may even undermine the political case for tackling the flaws in the global trading system.\nUnfortunately, the current institutions of global trade\u2014especially the WTO\u2014are not up to the task, either. The WTO has proved incapable of holding China accountable for its anticompetitive policies and has stood by fecklessly as Beijing exports its excess capacity to the rest of the world. The WTO\u2019s requirement of consensus to make decisions and the failure of its dispute-resolution mechanism have rendered the organization unable to effectively guide global trade.\nThe more significant issue with the WTO stems from the faulty assumptions on which it was founded. The creators of the WTO believed that the major players in the global economy would be market-oriented and that the spread of free trade would go hand in hand with the expansion of fair competition rules. With the benefit of hindsight, however, both assumptions have proved false. To combat the harms of deindustrialization, job loss, and supply chain dependencies, countries have increasingly turned away from free trade in favor of aggressive industrial policy.\nChina has been the major beneficiary of this breakdown of global trade rules. The United States and its allies still hold enough economic leverage to confront Beijing and stem the tide of unfair trade. But if they fail to act soon, China\u2019s size and deepening trade relationships\u2014by one count, China is the largest trading partner for 120 countries\u2014will cement a set of anticompetitive global trade norms.\nThe United States needs allies to counterbalance China\u2019s economic weight.\nAn effective strategy to restore American competitiveness and foster reindustrialization must start with a new set of meaningful global trade rules that target unfair practices and distorted competition. These new trade rules must distinguish countries that abide by high labor and environmental standards and refrain from anticompetitive, beggar-thy-neighbor policies from countries that don\u2019t. Think of it as a fair-trade customs union.\nThis fair-trade customs union would be built around a set of high standards needed to maintain fair competition. Only countries that upheld ambitious labor standards and environmental rules, the rule of law, and market-oriented regulations would be eligible for full membership. In exchange for membership, states would agree to refrain from pursuing anticompetitive policies such as offering widespread industrial subsidies, undercutting one another on corporate taxation, and dumping excess goods in foreign markets.\nNonmembers that upheld relatively high standards would be subject to meaningful but nonprohibitive trade barriers\u2014perhaps tariffs of up to five percent\u2014to incentivize them to join the union without imposing disproportionate costs. Countries that failed to meet these standards, however, would face significant penalties on trade between themselves and any member of the union. These consequences would protect the industrial bases of countries within the fair-trade union from being overwhelmed by cheap goods flowing from nonmarket economies. The goal would be to create a large common market among like-minded countries, which would enable them to take advantage of one another\u2019s markets and comparative advantages while excluding countries that insisted on breaking the rules and undercutting the standards needed for fair competition.\nAny market economies that are members of the WTO could seek to join if they were willing to apply the fair-trade union\u2019s rules and uphold its standards in their domestic markets. Decisions regarding the substance of these rules and standards, how to admit new members, and whether a current member should be expelled for noncompliance would be made on a majority basis, perhaps using a weighted voting formula like that of the IMF or World Bank based on GDP and other factors. The WTO\u2019s universal consensus mechanism has failed; a more flexible system is needed to allow rules to evolve over time alongside changes in the global economy. Although the biggest economies, especially the United States, would have more voting power in this arrangement, they would still need to work with other members to implement major changes.\nThe rules of the fair-trade union would also include a limited set of carve-outs for national security. Members could apply higher tariffs and offer industrial subsidies to support the domestic production of goods considered critical to their national security, such as semiconductors and missile systems. To avoid spiraling subsidies and overproduction, countries would be encouraged to coordinate and build symbiotic supply chains that further reinforced trade complementarities among member states. Even when national security necessitated the use of protectionist measures, the overarching goal of the union would still be to facilitate market competition based on innovation, cost, and quality.\nTo be sure, such carve-outs would create challenging borderline cases for goods such as steel that are relevant to national security but are also commonly used for other purposes. In these cases, union members would have to work together to decide how to classify goods. Ideally, union members would agree that as long as they could rely on supplies from one another, they could avoid exercising their carve-out privileges and would let markets function.\nThe union would also sponsor the development of a new data architecture to better track trade flows and enforce trade rules. Today\u2019s trade data is woefully inadequate for the complexities of modern trade. In some cases, it lacks the granularity needed to distinguish between different types of critical goods, such as semiconductors and batteries. It also does a poor job of capturing the globalized nature of supply chains, in which inputs can be manufactured in a variety of countries, collected and assembled into a partially finished good in others, and then shipped elsewhere for final assembly. Member countries of a new customs union would need to invest in systems to collect the detailed data that would allow the union to apply differential tariffs, enforce its rules, and prevent countries from avoiding penalties through the transshipment of goods through lower-tariff jurisdictions.\nIn addition, the union would need to develop a set of rules to prevent corporations from taking advantage of tax havens and depriving governments of the revenue they need to function. The global minimum tax agreement proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and endorsed by the Biden administration is a good model. It sets a minimum corporate tax level and allows countries to apply additional taxes on corporations that operate within their borders but domicile in jurisdictions with lower rates. Under these rules, if a company wants to do business with members of the fair-trade union, it needs to pay its fair share\u2014regardless of where it files its articles of incorporation.\nA RISING TIDE\nAlthough this fair-trade union is at odds with Trump\u2019s current approach of tariff threats and bilateral trade deals, it aligns with many of the administration\u2019s overall trade goals. And the evidence suggests that elements of the union could attract bipartisan support, whether picked up by the president or pursued by his successors. Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative in Trump\u2019s first term, has proposed a trade regime that would use high external tariffs and lower, frequently adjusted internal tariffs to achieve balanced trade among member countries. Michael Pettis, an economist popular among Trump\u2019s trade team, has suggested a similar idea based on the proposal John Maynard Keynes put forward at the Bretton Woods Conference before Harry Dexter White got the better of him.\nDespite the risks of Trump\u2019s current approach, his attacks on the existing trade order have opened a window during which structural change may be possible. The third great reordering of the global economy is an opportunity to imagine what a better trade system could look like. A new fair-trade customs union that built on American strengths and used cooperative leverage to promote true market competition would reverse the trend toward unilateralism and address the roots of the United States\u2019 trade imbalances. If Trump continues to pursue tariffs at all costs and does not reverse course, the opportunity will fall to the next set of political leaders, Democratic or Republican, to pursue this kind of solution.\nFixing global trade requires pressuring countries that do not want to play by market rules. But the long-term vision of a fair-trade union is not to divide the global economy forever. Instead, the goal is to expand to incorporate new members as more countries understand the benefits of playing by the rules and the costs of losing market access to a substantial share of the global economy if they do not. To ensure that the new union maintains its teeth, membership should be conditional on evidence that countries have already met a high bar. The lesson of China\u2019s accession to the WTO is that real change must precede market access, not the other way around.\nCutting the trade deficit doesn\u2019t need to rely on manufacturing alone.\nThe size of the U.S. market and Washington\u2019s willingness to establish and maintain a system that provides certainty and predictability to its partners are critical to getting other countries to participate. As other large economies joined, this incentive would only grow. Mature economies in Europe and North America would gain from being part of a coalition with the collective might to stand up to China. Emerging economies would benefit from access to an economic bloc representing a sizable share, if not the majority, of the global economy. Traditionally, these economies worked their way up the global value chain by manufacturing cheap commodity goods such as clothing and toys before moving to basic electronics and eventually to high-end, advanced products. But China\u2019s strategy of large-scale subsidies to businesses, massive industrial overcapacity, and demand repression is blocking this economic path for many developing countries. With China\u2019s export machine flooding emerging markets with goods such as electric cars and telecom equipment, domestic alternatives are crushed before they have a chance to grow.\nThis customs union would offer emerging economies an alternative: a set of wealthy consumer markets open to accepting their imports provided they follow the union\u2019s rules. Today, countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam have little reason to risk China\u2019s ire by openly aligning themselves with a Western economic bloc. If they committed to upholding fair trade, however, they would immediately be more competitive than China when trading with union member states. A country such as Vietnam, able to trade with key partners in the union without tariff barriers and protected from China\u2019s economic leverage, would have a path to evolve from a producer of low-cost goods and a hub for Chinese transshipment to an economy that moves up the value chain.\nAs more of the global market abided by these rules, the harder it would be to compete outside it. If it succeeded, this economic arrangement would present China with a clear choice: restructure its economy to engage fairly in the world economy or pay higher costs to trade with members of the bloc.\nThis union would impose some costs on the United States, but far fewer than a policy that raises tariffs on all of the United States\u2019 trading partners. Supporting domestic or \u201cfriend shored\u201d production among allies and partners would increase costs in the short term, but it would also shift more of the long-term benefits of trade to workers, support middle-class job creation in both manufacturing and services, and enhance the United States\u2019 national security.\nThe global economy is at an inflection point. The tariff spree will likely fizzle, but the underlying need to reform the international trading system will remain. The United States\u2019 position in the global economy depends on how leaders take advantage of this moment. It is not too late to seize the reins of the next great economic reordering and steer the world economy toward a system that lives up to the promise of free trade.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

Again and again, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, the government has used debt more vigorously than almost any other country to fight wars, global recessions, pandemics, and financial crises. Even as U.S. public debt rapidly climbed from one plateau to the next\u2014net debt is now nearing 100 percent of national income\u2014creditors at home and abroad showed no signs of debt fatigue. For years after the 2008\u20139 global financial crisis, interest rates on Treasury debt were ultralow, and a great many economists came to believe that they would remain so into the distant future. Thus, running government deficits\u2014fresh borrowing\u2014seemed a veritable free lunch. Even though debt-to-income levels jumped radically after each crisis, there was no apparent need to save up for the next one. Given the dollar\u2019s reputation as the world\u2019s premier safe and liquid asset, global bond market investors would always be happy to digest another huge pile of dollar debt, especially in a crisis situation in which uncertainty was high and safe assets were in short supply.\nThe past few years have cast serious doubt on those assumptions. For starters, bond markets have become far less submissive, and long-term interest rates have risen sharply on ten- and 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds. For a big debtor like the United States\u2014the gross U.S. debt is now nearly $37 trillion, roughly as large as that of all the other major advanced economies combined\u2014these higher rates can really hurt. When the average rate paid rises by one percent, that translates to $370 billion more in annual interest payments the government must make. In fiscal year 2024, the United States spent $850 billion on defense\u2014more than any other country\u2014but it spent an even larger sum, $880 billion, on interest payments. As of May 2025, all the major credit-rating agencies had downgraded U.S. debt, and there is a growing perception among banks and foreign governments that hold trillions of dollars in U.S. debt that the country\u2019s fiscal policy may be going off the rails. The increasing unlikelihood that the ultralow borrowing rates of the 2010s will come back any time soon has made the situation all the more dangerous.\nThere is no magic fix. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to place the blame for high rates on the Federal Reserve Board are deeply misleading. The Federal Reserve controls the overnight borrowing rate, but longer-term rates are set by vast global markets. If the Fed sets the overnight rate too low and markets expect inflation to rise, long-term rates will also rise. After all, unexpectedly high inflation is effectively a form of partial default, since investors get repaid in dollars whose purchasing power has been debased; if they come to expect high inflation, they will naturally require a higher return to compensate. One of the main reasons governments have an independent central bank is precisely to reassure investors that inflation will remain tame and thereby keep long-term interest rates low. If the Trump administration (or any other administration) moves to undermine the Fed\u2019s independence, that would ultimately raise government borrowing costs, not lower them.\nSkepticism about the safety of holding Treasury debt has led to related doubts about the U.S. dollar. For decades, the dollar\u2019s status as the global reserve currency has conferred lower interest rates on U.S. borrowing, reducing them by perhaps one-half to one percent. But with the United States taking on such extraordinary levels of debt, the dollar no longer looks unassailable, particularly amid other uncertainty about U.S. policy. In the near term, global central banks and foreign investors may decide to limit their total holdings of U.S. dollars. Over the medium and longer term, the dollar could lose market share to the Chinese yuan, the euro, and even cryptocurrency. Either way, foreign demand for U.S. debt will shrink, putting further upward pressure on U.S. interest rates and making the math of digging out of the debt hole still more daunting.\nAlready, the Trump administration has hinted at more drastic actions to deal with mounting debt payments, should gaining control of the Fed not be enough. The so-called Mar-a-Lago Accord, a strategy put forward in November 2024 by Stephen Miran, now head of Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, suggests that the United States could selectively default on its payments to the foreign central banks and treasuries that hold trillions of U.S. dollars. Whether or not the proposal was ever taken seriously, its very existence has rattled global investors, and it is not likely to be forgotten. A clause proposed for the huge tax and spending bill that was passed by the U.S. Congress in July would have given the president discretion to impose a 20 percent tax on select foreign investors. Although that provision was removed from the final bill, it stands as a warning of what might come if the U.S. government finds itself under budget duress.\nWith long-term interest rates up sharply, public debt nearing its post\u2013World War II peak, foreign investors becoming more skittish, and politicians showing little appetite for reining in fresh borrowing, the possibility of a once-in-a-century U.S. debt crisis no longer seems far-fetched. Debt and financial crisis tend to occur precisely when a country\u2019s fiscal situation is already precarious, its interest rates are high, its political situation is paralyzed, and a shock catches policymakers on the back foot. The United States already checks the first three boxes; all that is missing is the shock. Even if the country avoids an outright debt crisis, a sharp erosion of confidence in its creditworthiness would have profound consequences. It is urgent for policymakers to recognize how and why these scenarios could unfold and what tools the government has to respond to them. In the long term, a severe debt or, more likely, an inflationary spiral could send the economy into a lost decade, drastically weakening the dollar\u2019s position as the dominant global currency and undermining American power.\nTHEIR MONEY, OUR GAIN\nIt is crucial to understand that the Trump administration\u2019s economic policies are an accelerant, rather than the fundamental cause, of the United States\u2019 debt problem. The story really begins with President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, an era of deficit spending in which the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio was about a third of what it is today. As Vice President Dick Cheney said during the first George W. Bush administration, \u201cReagan proved deficits don\u2019t matter.\u201d It is an assumption that both parties appear to have taken to heart in the twenty-first century, despite far more worrying debt burdens. In fiscal year 2024, for example, the Biden administration ran a budget deficit of $1.8 trillion, or 6.4 percent of GDP. Except for the global financial crisis and the first year of the pandemic, that was a peacetime record, slightly exceeding the 6.1 percent of the previous year. President Joe Biden\u2019s deficits would have been larger still but for determined resistance from two centrist Democratic senators who bid down some of the administration\u2019s most expansive spending bills.\nDuring his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump pilloried Biden for his administration\u2019s massive deficit spending. Yet in his second term in office, Trump has embraced similarly large deficits\u2014six to seven percent of GDP for the rest of the decade, according to independent forecasts produced by the Congressional Budget Office and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The latter has projected that, by 2054, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio will reach 172 percent\u2014or an even higher 190 percent if the bill\u2019s provisions become permanent. Trump and his economic advisers claim that such forecasts are overly pessimistic\u2014that the projections for growth are far too low and those for interest rates far too high. Higher growth will bring in larger future tax receipts; lower interest rates mean the debt will be less costly to service. If Team Trump is right, both factors will actually lower deficits and tilt the trajectory of debt to income downward. Whereas in January 2025, the CBO projected an annual growth rate of 1.8 percent over the next decade, the administration has put the figure at 2.8 percent. The difference is significant: if the U.S. economy is growing at 1.8 percent annually, it will double in size (and presumably tax revenues) every 39 years. At 2.8 percent, it would double every 25 years. For Trump, assuming that kind of rapid growth has made it easier to finance a lot of budget giveaways.\nThere is a substantive basis for the Trump administration\u2019s growth projections, although it has little to do with the claimed benefits of the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d passed in July. Many prominent technology experts firmly believe that as long as the government stays out of the way, artificial intelligence companies will achieve Artificial General Intelligence, meaning AI models that can equal or outperform human experts at a wide variety of complex cognitive tasks, within ten years, leading to explosive productivity growth. Indeed, the progress of AI research has been breathtaking, and there are strong reasons for assuming that AI\u2019s effect on the economy will be profound. But in the medium term, widespread adoption of AI could be hindered by multiple bottlenecks, including outsize energy requirements, data regulations, and legal liabilities. Moreover, as AI allows companies in some sectors to lay off scores of workers, public discontent could encourage populist politicians to push through policies that\u2014along with aggressive limits on legal immigration, cuts in funding for scientific research, and the chaotic tariff war that are already underway\u2014could dramatically slow the effects of AI on growth.\nRegardless of when and how the AI revolution unfolds, it\u2019s possible that another major economic shock may not be far off. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a short-lived recession and the large-scale government response to it added debt roughly equivalent to 15 percent of GDP; in the case of the global financial crisis, the debt added was closer to 30 percent of GDP. It seems reasonable to assume that another shock approaching this magnitude\u2014a cyberwar or even a full-blown military conflict, a climate catastrophe, or another financial crisis or pandemic\u2014will come in the next five to seven years. One might view the more modest CBO growth projections as realistically balancing the odds that the economy could see fantastic growth, most likely driven by AI, with the odds of a new shock.\nHow fast the U.S. debt level grows will also depend on the interest rate. The CBO has estimated that the government will have to pay an average interest rate of 3.6 percent through 2055. (This average takes into account that the government borrows at both short- and long-term maturities.) Here, too, the Trump administration views the CBO as far too pessimistic. The president seems to believe that the economy can go back to the extremely low interest rates of his first term, when they averaged less than half the current rates and there was only very modest inflation. It is hard otherwise to understand why he would be pressing for the Fed to cut its short-term policy interest rates by as much as three percentage points.\nTrump\u2019s view should not be dismissed out of hand. Several members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which periodically reports where it believes the Fed\u2019s short-term policy rate will land in a couple of years, see much lower rates as the central scenario. Yet with the 30-year Treasury bill rate near five percent as of late July, market indicators do not signal that a sharp drop in long-term rates is coming. If they remain at or near this level, there are real risks to continuing to push up the debt, especially when the biggest crisis in the U.S. economy for now is a political one.\nMAGIC MOUNTAIN\nWashington\u2019s failure to deal with its runaway debt problem is in part the result of misguided (or at least oversold) economic theories that took hold over the last two decades. Throughout most of modern history, it was thought that prudent government debt management involved bringing down the ratio of debt to GDP during quiescent periods of growth in order to store fiscal ammunition for the next crisis. In the 1800s, the United Kingdom used debt to fight one war after another, taking advantage of the time in between to repair its finances. Likewise, although the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio was very high during World War II, it quickly declined in the years that followed; since the United States had just fought two world wars, policymakers feared there might be yet another. To pay for the Korean War, the Eisenhower administration famously raised taxes instead of relying mainly on debt. But in the years following the global financial crisis, the persistent very low interest rates that took hold caused a number of leading economists to question this orthodoxy.\nIn his influential theory of secular stagnation, the former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers posited that real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates would stay low indefinitely because of factors such as adverse demographics, low productivity growth, and chronically weak global demand. Others, such as the economist Paul Krugman and Olivier Blanchard, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, suggested that the secular stagnation cloud had a silver lining in that reliably low rates allow the government to use fiscal policy aggressively without worrying too much about the cost. Normal economic growth would continually swell tax revenues by more than enough to cover glacially rising interest bills on the national debt, the thinking went, at least on average over time. Indeed, so rosy was the interest-rate picture in the 2010s that some economists, including proponents of modern monetary theory, argued that there would be little risk to running larger deficits even when the economy was growing briskly. In this view, which was embraced by progressive politicians such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders, deficit spending was a low-cost means of paying for social investment, including ambitious climate protections and policies to reduce inequality.\nA once-in-a-century U.S. debt crisis no longer seems far-fetched.\nTo be fair, Democrats were hardly in universal agreement about any debt-driven approach. Even as he ran outsize deficits to pay for progressive priorities, Biden made clear that over the long run, he hoped to meet the cost by raising taxes, and he might have done so with a larger Democratic majority in the Senate. By contrast, Republican administrations continued to espouse the idea that budget deficits did not matter if they were used to pay for tax cuts, since higher growth would turn the deficits into surpluses over time. Although this claim was widely understood to be overstated, the general view, including on Wall Street, was that ultralow interest rates would save the day even if the extra growth from tax cuts proved insufficient.\nAs debt debates became highly politicized, economists who questioned the lower-rates-forever orthodoxy were shunned or ignored. Yet anyone looking at the long history of interest-rate fluctuations would have recognized that a return to higher rates was a distinct, indeed likely, possibility. Consider the interest rate on ten-year inflation-indexed U.S. Treasury bonds, which are often used as a measure of the real interest rate in the economy. The rate fell by roughly three percentage points between September 2007 and September 2012, a collapse that can hardly be explained by slow-moving trends such as demographic decline and falling productivity. A far more plausible explanation was the prolonged effects of the global financial crisis and its aftermath. As with other past financial crises, these effects would eventually end, and one might reasonably have guessed that the era of ultralow interest rates would end as well.\nTrue, some of the factors that contributed to very low interest rates are still present today, including aging populations in most advanced countries. But there are plenty of reasons to think that long-term interest rates will remain higher well into the future. Foremost, government debt is exploding globally, putting upward pressure on U.S. rates in a world of integrated capital markets. For example, the average net debt-to-GDP ratio for the G-7 countries has grown from 55 percent in 2006 to 95 percent today. In fact, the United States is not even the worst offender: Japan\u2019s net debt-to-GDP ratio is 134 percent (its gross public debt is a staggering 235 percent of GDP). For Italy, the ratio is 127 percent; France, 108 percent; and the United States, 98 percent. Other upward pressures on interest rates include the rise in many countries of populist parties, which are pushing for more domestic spending; AI\u2019s voracious appetite for electricity, which generates a huge demand for investment that has to be financed; tariff wars and the fracturing of global trade, which are forcing companies to invest in reshoring, with massive borrowing; and the ever-growing cost of adapting to climate change and responding to climate disasters. Although some economists, taking note of these trends, have begun to reconsider the seductive assumptions of the 2010s, there is little sign that Washington has. And with high interest rates, already vertiginous levels of debt, political upheaval, and challenges to Fed independence, there is now a real risk that a fresh economic shock could precipitate a broader collapse.\nTHE GREAT REPRESSION\nHow and when a debt crisis in the United States could unfold is now the $37 trillion question. In one scenario, the trigger will be a collapse of confidence by investors in U.S. Treasuries\u2014a \u201ccrack in the bond market,\u201d as Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, warned in May\u2014meaning a sudden spike in interest rates that revealed a larger problem. This is not as hyperbolic as it may sound; debt crises often build up steam quietly for what seems like forever before erupting unexpectedly. Alternatively, investors\u2019 growing fears about the safety of their money could cause a gradual rise in Treasury bond yields over many months or even years.\nRising interest rates do not in themselves constitute a crisis. But if driven by debt concerns, they will push down stock and housing prices, make business investment more challenging, and raise the cost of servicing government debt. If this process unfolded slowly, the government would have time to react. If it doesn\u2019t do so forcefully\u2014typically, by closing the current budget deficit and credibly committing to fiscal rectitude\u2014markets would smell blood, interest rates would go up even more, and the government would need to make even bigger adjustments to steady the ship. As long as the country remained stuck in this high-interest debt purgatory, business and consumer confidence would be low and growth would stall. The usual U.S. solution of running a giant deficit would likely backfire and lead to even higher interest rates. To escape this situation without crushing austerity measures, the government would almost certainly reach for heterodox options that are today more usually associated with emerging markets.\nFor one, the United States could default outright (in the legal sense) on its debt. It has done so before. In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt abrogated the so-called gold clause for U.S. Treasury debt, which guaranteed creditors that they could choose to be paid in gold, instead of dollars, at $20.67 per ounce. The next year, the conversion rate of dollars to gold was set at $35 per ounce, sharply devaluing the currency. In a highly controversial case, the Supreme Court ruled in 1935 that Roosevelt\u2019s abrogation of the gold clause in public debt was indeed a default. But under enormous political pressure from the president, the court simultaneously ruled that creditors were not entitled to compensation because no harm had been done. Really? For foreign central banks across the world that had been holding U.S. Treasury bonds on the assumption that they were as good as gold, the 1933 default was quite painful.\nGiven that the United States can print dollars rather than refuse to honor its debt, a far simpler option is to use high inflation to achieve a partial default. Of course, the independence of the Fed poses a significant obstacle to this, but not an insurmountable one in a true crisis. The Fed\u2019s independence is not mandated by the Constitution, and the president has many ways to induce it to lower interest rates. The first, clearly, is to appoint a chair who believes it will be in the national interest to radically cut interest rates, even if that creates inflation. This solution, however, has limits, starting with the fact that Fed chairs serve for four years, and the Supreme Court has indicated, in a May ruling, that the president cannot fire them over policy differences. Moreover, the Fed chair leads the Open Market Committee, which consists of the seven Fed governors in Washington, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four rotating representatives of the 11 other regional Federal Reserve Banks. These positions typically rotate infrequently; a full term for a Fed governor is 14 years, and only one position is guaranteed to open up in 2026.\nWith the cooperation of Congress, however, the president can do much more. For example, Congress could empower the Treasury to dictate the Fed\u2019s short-term interest rate target during a national emergency, including a debt crisis. This is more or less what happened in World War II and its immediate aftermath. It could also pack the Federal Reserve Board with new members, as Roosevelt threatened to do with the Supreme Court in the 1930s. A battle of that scale between the Fed and the president would take the country into uncharted territory. But even if the Fed submits and cuts rates sharply, inflation is not the get-out-of-jail-free card some believe it to be. Whereas a truly massive bout of hyperinflation, such as what happened in Germany after World War I, would effectively wipe government debt off the books, it would wipe out the rest of the economy, as well: ask the citizens of Venezuela and Zimbabwe, who have suffered epic hyperinflation in this century. More plausibly, a few years of 1970s-style inflation\u2014in 1979 inflation reached more than 14 percent per year in the United States\u2014would crater the value of long-term bonds but have less effect on short-term debt, which would have to be refinanced at higher interest rates. And such a prolonged spike would likely be very damaging to both the U.S. and the global economy.\nOne way to manage the effects of inflation is to use it in conjunction with financial repression. In this strategy, governments stuff public debt into the financial sector via banks, pension funds, and insurance companies, with the central bank typically buying massive quantities as well. By creating a vast captive market for public debt, the government can lower the interest rate it has to pay and significantly reduce the odds of any sudden flight from its bonds. Financial repression can be made more potent by restricting other assets people can hold or by imposing interest rate controls. This is not as exotic as it sounds: governments around the world have used financial repression for most of modern history. After World War II, governments leaned heavily on financial repression to help inflate their way out of massive public debts. Without financial repression, U.S. debt in relation to GDP would likely have continued to grow from 1945 to 1955; instead, it fell by more than 40 percent. In some countries, notably the United Kingdom, results were even more dramatic. Today, the strategy is especially widespread in emerging markets, but Europe used financial repression to hold the euro together during the European debt crisis, and Japan has used it on an even greater scale; the Bank of Japan alone holds Japanese government debt equal to nearly 100 percent of the country\u2019s income.\nSince the global financial crisis, the United States has also pursued some financial repression through financial regulations and Federal Reserve purchases of long-term Treasury bonds. In a pinch, it could do much more. Financial repression is particularly effective in a high-inflation environment, in which, ordinarily, markets would drive up interest rates on government debt. On the other hand, repression negatively affects long-term growth by absorbing bank financing that could be going to the innovative firms in the private sector. The use of financial repression to deal with high debt is hardly the only reason for Japan\u2019s miserable growth record over the past few decades, but it is certainly a leading one.\nAn inflationary spiral could send the economy into a lost decade.\nAs the Japanese experience has shown, financial repression would offer no panacea to the United States. It really only works on domestic savers and financial institutions that cannot easily avoid the implicit tax on their savings and income. If Washington used it in a large-scale way, foreign investors, who now hold close to a third of the U.S. debt, would try to flee, and it would not be easy to stop them without engaging in outright default. Moreover, the United States is highly dependent on its financial sector to drive its exceptionally innovative economy. And just as the costs of inflation fall most heavily on lower-income individuals, so, too, do the effects of financial repression, since the wealthy have workarounds.\nAlongside default, austerity, inflation, and financial repression, a prospective new option for dealing with high debt is emerging, whose costs and benefits are not yet fully understood. This involves a form of cryptocurrency called dollar stablecoins. Unlike conventional cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, whose dollar value fluctuates wildly, stablecoins are pegged to the dollar, typically at a value of one to one. New U.S. legislation passed by Congress in 2025 has attempted to provide a clear regulatory framework by requiring that U.S.-based dollar stablecoins hold a mix of Treasury debt and federally guaranteed bank deposits sufficient to (almost) pay off all coin holders in the event of a run. This requirement could potentially create a captive pool of stablecoins whose issuers hold large quantities of Treasury bills. To the extent that stablecoins compete for funds that might normally be allocated to banks, they provide a backdoor to routing bank deposits into Treasury debt. For now, it is unclear whether the new legislation will promote stability or undermine it, given a number of unresolved issues having to do with the risk of runs on stablecoins and how their circulation can be audited to prevent their use for criminal purposes or tax evasion.\nIn principle, the Federal Reserve can also issue its own stablecoin, or central bank digital currency. This, too, would compete with bank deposits and channel savings toward Treasury debt unless the funds were in turn used in lending to the private sector, a process that would create its own problems. A Fed digital currency would differ from stablecoins in other important ways. For one thing, it would, by design, be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, and presumably tracking its use would pose less of a concern. On the other hand, competitive private stablecoins would likely be far more innovative. Although none of the available options for dealing with unsustainable debt are particularly attractive, it is nevertheless important that the government begin to contemplate them seriously. Not only does Washington need to be prepared for the next shock when it comes, but politicians and policymakers must also recognize what will happen if the government continues to assume that the United States can never have a debt crisis.\nEND OF AN EMPIRE\nFor too long, the status quo approach in Washington has been to ignore the massive debt problem and hope that a return to miraculous levels of growth and low interest rates will take care of it. But the United States is approaching the point at which the national debt could undermine not only the country\u2019s economic stability but also the things that have sustained its global power for so many decades, including the military spending that it has leveraged in many ways to maintain the dollar\u2019s formidable influence over the global financial system since World War II. Whether in the case of Spain in the sixteenth century, the Netherlands in the seventeenth century, or the United Kingdom in the nineteenth century, no country in modern history has been able to sustain a dominant currency without also being a superpower.\nThe United States may avoid a debt crisis, and Trumpian and progressive economists who count on growth dividends ultimately outweighing the interest costs of higher debt may turn out to be right. But the debt policy that both the Republican and the Democratic Parties have engaged in over the first quarter of the twenty-first century amounts to a huge wager on long odds, especially if the country wants to remain a dominant power for the rest of this century and beyond. Given the current trajectory of deficits, it has become much more difficult to sustain the belief that no matter how high U.S. debt gets, it will have no effect on the country\u2019s capacity to fight financial crises, pandemics, climate events, and wars. And it will certainly be a drag on the country\u2019s growth.\nIt is impossible to predict how and when a U.S. debt problem may erupt and what the consequences will be: unpalatable austerity, high inflation, financial repression, partial default, or a mix of these. There are strong reasons to assume that inflation will have a pronounced part, as it did during the 1970s. Regardless, a debt crisis will be destabilizing for the United States, the global economy, and the dollar\u2019s reserve status. Left unchecked, it could erode the country\u2019s position in the world.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

This was not the beginning of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s imagined epoch of \u201cliberation\u201d under unilateral American greatness or a return to the Biden administration\u2019s dream of managed great-power rivalry. Instead, it was the true opening of the age of weaponized interdependence, in which the United States is discovering what it is like to have others do unto it as it has eagerly done unto others.\nThis new era will be shaped by weapons of economic and technological coercion\u2014sanctions, supply chain attacks, and export measures\u2014that repurpose the many points of control in the infrastructure that underpins the interdependent global economy. For over two decades, the United States has unilaterally weaponized these chokepoints in finance, information flows, and technology for strategic advantage. But market exchange has become hopelessly entangled with national security, and the United States must now defend its interests in a world in which other powers can leverage chokepoints of their own.\nThat is why the Trump administration had to make a deal with China. Administration officials now acknowledge that they made concessions on semiconductor export controls in return for China\u2019s easing restrictions on rare-earth minerals that were crippling the United States\u2019 auto industry. U.S. companies that provide chip design software, such as Synopsys and Cadence, can once again sell their technology in China. This concession will help the Chinese semiconductor industry wriggle out of the bind it found itself in when the Biden administration started limiting China\u2019s ability to build advanced semiconductors. And the U.S. firm Nvidia can again sell H20 chips for training artificial intelligence to Chinese customers.\nIn a little-noticed speech in June, Secretary of State Marco Rubio hinted at the administration\u2019s reasoning. China had \u201ccornered the market\u201d for rare earths, putting the United States and the world in a \u201ccrunch,\u201d he said. The administration had come to realize \u201cthat our industrial capability is deeply dependent on a number of potential adversary nation-states, including China, who can hold it over our head,\u201d shifting the \u201cnature of geopolitics,\u201d in \u201cone of the great challenges of the new century.\u201d\nAlthough Rubio emphasized self-reliance as a solution, the administration\u2019s rush to make a deal demonstrates the limits of going it alone. The United States is ratcheting back its own threats to persuade adversaries not to cripple vital parts of the U.S. economy. Other powers, too, are struggling to figure out how to advance their interests in a world in which economic power and national security are merging, and economic and technological integration have turned from a promise to a threat.\nWashington had to remake its national security state after other countries developed the atomic bomb; in a similar way, it will have to rebuild its economic security state for a world in which adversaries and allies can also weaponize interdependence. In short, economic weapons are proliferating just as nuclear weapons did, creating new dilemmas for the United States and other powers. China has adapted to this new world with remarkable speed; other powers, such as European countries, have struggled. All will have to update their strategic thinking about how their own doctrines and capabilities intersect with the doctrines and capabilities of other powers, and how businesses, which have their own interests and capabilities, will respond.\nThe problem for the United States is that the Trump administration is gutting the very resources that it needs to advance U.S. interests and protect against countermoves. In the nuclear age, the United States made historic investments in the institutions, infrastructure, and weapons systems that would propel it to long-term advantage. Now, the Trump administration seems to be actively undermining those sources of strength. As the administration goes blow for blow with the Chinese, it is ripping apart the systems of expertise necessary to navigate the complex tradeoffs that it faces. Every administration is forced to build the plane as it flies, but this is the first one to pull random parts from the engine at 30,000 feet.\nAs China rapidly adapts to the new realities of weaponized interdependence, it is building its own alternative \u201cstack\u201d of mutually reinforcing high-tech industries centered on the energy economy. Europe is floundering at the moment, but over time, it may also create its own alternative suite of technologies. The United States, uniquely, is flinging its institutional and technological advantages away. A failure by Washington to meet the changes in the international system will not only harm U.S. national interests but also threaten the long-term health of U.S. firms and the livelihoods of American citizens.\nTHE WORLD GLOBALIZATION MADE\nWeaponized interdependence is an unanticipated byproduct of the grand era of globalization that is drawing to a close. After the Cold War ended, businesses built an interdependent global economy on top of U.S.-centered infrastructure. The United States\u2019 technological platforms\u2014the Internet, e-commerce, and, later, social media\u2014wove the world\u2019s communications systems together. Global financial systems also combined thanks to dollar clearing, in which businesses directly or indirectly use U.S. dollars for international deals; correspondent banks that implement such transactions; and the SWIFT financial messaging network. U.S.-centered semiconductor manufacturing was spun out into a myriad of specialized processes across Europe and Asia, but key intellectual property, such as semiconductor software design, remained in the hands of a few U.S. companies. Each of these systems could be understood as its own \u201cstack,\u201d interconnected complexes of related technologies and services that came to reinforce one another, so that, for example, buying into the open Internet increasingly meant buying into U.S. platforms and e-commerce systems, too. At a time when geopolitics seemed the stuff of antiquated Cold War thrillers, few worried about becoming dependent on economic infrastructure provided by other countries.\nThat was a mistake for Washington\u2019s adversaries and, eventually, for its allies, too. After the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the United States began using these systems to pursue terrorists and their backers. Over two decades of cumulative experimentation, U.S. authorities expanded their ambitions and reach. The United States graduated from exploiting financial chokepoints against terrorists to deploying sanctions to target banks and, in time, to cutting entire countries, such as Iran, out of the global financial system. The Internet was transformed into a global surveillance apparatus, allowing the United States to demand that platforms and search companies, which were regulated by U.S. authorities, hand over crucial strategic information on their worldwide users.\nThe infrastructure of economic interdependence was turned against both the United States\u2019 enemies and its friends. When the first Trump administration pulled out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which the United States and other major countries, including in Europe, had negotiated with Iran in 2015 to limit its nuclear program, the United States threatened to sanction Europeans who continued to do business with the Islamic Republic. European governments found themselves largely unable to protect their own companies against U.S. power.\nThis was the context in which we first wrote about weaponized interdependence in 2019. By that point, many of the most important economic networks underpinning globalization\u2014communications, finance, production\u2014had become so highly centralized that a small number of key firms and economic actors effectively controlled them. Governments that could assert authority over these firms, most notably the U.S. government, could tap them for information about their adversaries or exclude rivals from access to these vital points in the global economy. Over two decades, the United States had built institutions to assert and direct this authority in response to a series of particular crises.\nSome of Trump\u2019s senior officials happened on our academic research and, to our amazement, liked what they saw. According to the historian Chris Miller\u2019s 2022 book, Chip War, when the administration wanted to squeeze the Chinese telecommunications manufacturer Huawei harder, one senior official seized on the idea of weaponized interdependence as a playbook to strengthen export controls against semiconductors, describing the concept as a \u201cbeautiful thing.\u201d\nEconomic weapons are proliferating just as nuclear weapons did.\nOur primary purpose, however, was to expose the ugly underbelly of such weaponization. The world that globalization made was not the flat landscape of peaceful market competition that its advocates had promised. Instead, it was riddled with hierarchy, power relations, and strategic vulnerabilities.\nMoreover, it was fundamentally unstable. American actions would invite reactions by targets and counteractions by the United States. The biggest powers could play offense, looking for vulnerabilities that they, too, could exploit. Smaller powers might seek to use less accountable or transparent channels of exchange, effectively building dark spaces into the global economy. The more the United States turned interconnections against its adversaries, the more likely it was that these adversaries\u2014and even allies\u2014would disconnect, hide, or retaliate. As others weaponized interdependence, the connecting fabric of the global economy would be rewoven according to a new logic, creating a world based more on offense and defense than on common commercial interest.\nU.S. President Joe Biden also used weaponization as an everyday tool of statecraft. His administration took Trump\u2019s semiconductor export controls to a new level, deploying them first against Russia, in order to weaken Moscow\u2019s weapons program, and then against China, denying Beijing access to the high-end semiconductors it needed to efficiently train artificial intelligence systems. According to The Washington Post, a document drafted by Biden administration officials intended to limit the use of sanctions to urgent national security problems inexorably shriveled from 40 pages to eight pages of toothless recommendations. One former official complained of a \u201crelentless, never-ending, you-must-sanction-everybody-and-their-sister . . . system\u201d that was \u201cout of control.\u201d\nSimilar worries plagued export controls. Policy experts warned that technology restrictions encouraged China to escape the grasp of the United States and develop its own ecosystem of advanced technologies. That did not stop the Biden administration, which in its final weeks announced an extraordinarily ambitious scheme to divide the entire world into three parts: the United States and a few of its closest friends as a chosen elite, the large majority of countries in the middle, and a small number of bitter adversaries at the bottom of the heap. Through export controls, the United States and its close partners would retain access to both the semiconductors used to train powerful AI and the most recent \u201cweights\u201d\u2014the mathematical engines that drive frontier models\u2014while denying them to U.S. adversaries and forcing most countries to sign up to general restrictions. If this worked, it would ensure a long-term American advantage in AI.\nAlthough the Trump administration abandoned this grand technocratic master plan, it certainly has not abandoned the goal of U.S. dominance and control of chokepoints. The problem for the United States is that others are not sitting idly by. Instead, they are building the economic and institutional means to resist.\nA TASTE OF YOUR OWN MEDICINE\nThe weapons of interdependence have been proliferating for several years and are now being deployed to counter U.S. power. As China and the European Union began to understand their risks, they, too, tried to shore up their own vulnerabilities and perhaps take advantage of the vulnerabilities of others. For these great powers, as for the United States, simply identifying key economic chokepoints is not enough. It is also necessary to build the state apparatus that can gather sufficient information to grasp the immediate benefits and risks and then put that information to use. China\u2019s approach is coming to fruition as it presses on the United States\u2019 vulnerabilities to force it to the negotiating table. By contrast, Europe\u2019s internal institutional weaknesses force it to vacillate, putting it in a dangerous position vis-\u00e0-vis the United States and China.\nFor China, the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden\u2019s 2013 exposure of U.S. surveillance practices demonstrated both the reach of the United States and the mechanics of the new era. Previously, Beijing had viewed technological independence as an important long-term goal. After Snowden, it saw dependence on U.S. technology as an urgent short-term threat. As our work with the political scientists Yeling Tan and Mark Dallas has shown, articles in Chinese state media began to trumpet the crucial role of \u201cinformation security\u201d and \u201cdata sovereignty\u201d to China\u2019s national security.\nThe real wake-up call came when the first Trump administration threatened to cut off ZTE, a major Chinese telecommunications company, from access to U.S. technology and then weaponized export controls against Huawei, which the administration had come to see as an urgent threat to U.S. tech dominance and national security. Chinese state media began to focus on the risks posed by \u201cchokepoints\u201d and the need for \u201cself-reliance.\u201d\nThese fears translated into policy actions as the Chinese Communist Party developed a \u201cwhole-of-nation system\u201d to secure China\u2019s technological independence, calling for \u201cbreakthroughs in major \u2018chokepoint\u2019 technologies and products.\u201d China also began to think about how it could better exploit its advantages in rare-earth mining and processing, where it had gained a stranglehold as U.S. and other companies fell out of the market. China\u2019s power in this sector comes not from a simple monopoly over the minerals, which the country doesn\u2019t fully possess, but from its domination of the economic and technological ecosystem necessary to extract and process them. Notably, these critical minerals are used for a variety of high-tech industrial purposes, including producing the specialized magnets that are crucial to cars, planes, and other sophisticated technologies.\nChina had already threatened to cut back its rare-earth supply to Japan during a 2010 territorial dispute, but it lacked the means to exploit this chokepoint systematically. After it woke up to the threat of the United States\u2019 exploitation of chokepoints, China stole a page from the American playbook. In 2020, Beijing put in place an export control law that repurposed the basic elements of the U.S. system. This was followed in 2024 by new regulations restricting the export of dual-use items. In short order, China built a bureaucratic apparatus to turn chokepoints into practical leverage. China also realized that in a world of weaponized interdependence, power comes not from possessing substitutable commodities but from controlling the technological stack. Just as the United States restricted the export of chip manufacturing equipment and software, China forbade the export of equipment necessary to process rare earths. These complex regulatory systems provide China not only with greater control but also with crucial information about who is buying what, allowing it to target other countries\u2019 pain points with greater finesse.\nThis is why American and European manufacturers found themselves in a bind this June. China did not use its new export control system simply to retaliate against Trump but to squeeze Europe and discourage it from siding with the United States. German car manufacturers such as Mercedes and BMW worried as much as their U.S. competitors that their production lines would grind to a halt without specialized magnets. When the United States and China first reached a provisional deal, Trump announced on Truth Social that \u201cFULL MAGNETS, AND ANY NECESSARY RARE EARTHS, WILL BE SUPPLIED, UP FRONT, BY CHINA,\u201d recognizing the urgency of the threat to the U.S. economy. China\u2019s long-term problem is that its state is too powerful and too willing to intervene in the domestic economy for purely political purposes, hampering investment and potentially strangling innovation. Still, in the short term, it has built the critical capacity to reimpose controls as it deems necessary to resist further U.S. demands.\nALL TALK\nWhether Europe can withstand pressure from Beijing\u2014and, for that matter, from Washington\u2014remains an open question. Europe has many of the capacities of a geoeconomic superpower but lacks the institutional machinery to make use of them. The SWIFT system, after all, is based in Belgium, as is Euroclear, the settlement infrastructure for many euro-based assets. European companies\u2014including the Dutch semiconductor lithography giant ASML, the German enterprise software firm SAP, and the Swedish 5G provider Ericsson\u2014occupy key chokepoints in technology stacks. The European single market is by some measures the second largest in the world, potentially allowing it to squeeze companies that want to sell goods to European businesses and consumers.\nBut that would require Europe to build its own comprehensive suite of institutions and independent stack of technologies. That is unlikely to happen in the short to medium term, unless the nascent \u201cEuroStack\u201d project, which aims to secure Europe from foreign interference by building an independent information technology base, really takes off. Even though Europe woke up to the danger of weaponized interdependence during the first Trump administration, it quickly fell back asleep.\nIn fairness, the EU\u2019s weaknesses also reflect its unique circumstances: it depends on an outside military patron. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has heightened Europe\u2019s short-term dependence on the United States, even as European countries struggle to bolster their defensive capacities. The Biden administration put a friendly gloss on economic coercion, coordinating with European governments such as the Netherlands to limit exports of ASML\u2019s machinery to China. At the same time, the United States provided Europe with the detailed intelligence that it needed to wield financial sanctions and export controls against Russia, obviating the need for Europe to develop its own abilities.\nEurope\u2019s lassitude is heightened by internal divisions. When China imposed a series of export restrictions on Lithuania to punish it for its political support of Taiwan in 2021, German companies pressed the Lithuanian government to de-escalate. Again and again, Europe\u2019s response to the threat of Chinese economic coercion has been kneecapped by European companies desperate to maintain their access to Chinese markets. At the same time, measures to increase economic security are repeatedly watered down by EU member states or qualified by trade missions to Beijing, which are full of senior officials eager to make deals.\nMost profoundly, Europe finds it nearly impossible to act coherently on economic security because its countries jealously retain individual control over national security, whereas the EU as a whole manages trade and key aspects of market regulation. There are many highly competent officials scattered throughout the European Commission\u2019s trade directorate and the national capitals of member states but few ways for them to coordinate on large-scale actions combining economic instruments with national security objectives.\nThe result is that Europe has a profusion of economic security goals but lacks the means to achieve them. Although European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has warned of \u201cthe risk of weaponization of interdependencies,\u201d and her commission has prepared a genuinely sophisticated strategy for European economic security, it doesn\u2019t have the bureaucratic tools to deliver results. It has no equivalent of the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which is capable of gathering information and targeting measures against opponents, or of China\u2019s new export control machinery.\nOne immediate test is whether Europe will use its purported big bazooka, the \u201canti-coercion instrument,\u201d or let it rust into obsolescence. This complex legal mechanism\u2014which allows the EU to respond to coercion through a broad set of tools, including limiting market access, foreign direct investment, and public procurement\u2014is supposed to allow Brussels to retaliate against allies and adversaries. The instrument was conceived as a response to the threat of Trump\u2019s first administration and hastily retrofitted to provide a means of pushing back against China.\nFrom the beginning, however, European officials made it clear that they hoped they would never have to actually use the anti-coercion instrument, believing that its mere existence would be a sufficient deterrent. That has turned out to be a grave misjudgment. The anti-coercion instrument is encumbered with legalistic safeguards intended to ensure that the European Commission will not deploy it without sufficient approval from EU member states. Those safeguards make other powers such as China and the United States doubt that it will ever be used against them. Its lengthy deployment process will give them the opportunity they need to disarm any enforcement action, using threats and promises to mobilize internal opposition against it. As with earlier European efforts to block sanctions, China and the United States can usually bet on the EACO principle that \u201cEurope Always Chickens Out\u201d in geoeconomic confrontations. Europe lacks the information, institutional clout, and internal agreement to do much else.\nThe anti-coercion instrument is the exact opposite of the \u201cDoomsday Machine\u201d in the film Dr. Strangelove, the classic Cold War satire. That machine was a disaster because it automatically launched nuclear missiles in response to an attack but was kept a closely guarded secret until an attack was launched. In contrast, European officials talk incessantly about their doomsday device, but Europe\u2019s adversaries feel sure that it will never be deployed; that certainty encourages them to coerce European companies and countries at their leisure.\nSELF-SABOTAGE\nEurope is hampered by structural weaknesses, but the United States\u2019 difficulties largely result from its own choices. After decades of slowly building the complex machinery of economic warfare, the United States is ripping it apart.\nThis is in part an unintended consequence of domestic politics. The second Trump administration imposed a hiring freeze across the federal government, hitting many institutions including the Treasury\u2019s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, which oversees OFAC, and leaving key positions unfilled and departments understaffed. Initial budget proposals anticipate an overall reduction in funding for the office, even as the number of sanctions-related programs has continued to rise. Although U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has expressed support for his department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, which is chiefly responsible for export controls, the agency lost over a dozen employees as part of the government\u2019s sweeping force reductions. OFAC and the BIS were never as all-seeing as their reputations suggested and sometimes made mistakes. Nonetheless, they provided Washington with an extraordinary edge. Other countries had no equivalent to OFAC\u2019s maps of global finance or the detailed understanding of semiconductor supply chains developed by key officials on Biden\u2019s National Security Council.\nSuch institutional decay is the inevitable consequence of Trumpism. In Trump\u2019s eyes, all institutional restraints on his power are illegitimate. This has led to a large overhaul of the apparatus that has served to direct economic security decisions over the last decades. As the journalist Nahal Toosi has documented in Politico, the National Security Council, which is supposed to coordinate security policy across the federal government and agencies, has cut its staff by more than half. The State Department has been decimated by job cuts, while the traditional interagency process through which policy gets made and communicated has virtually disappeared, leaving officials in the dark over what is expected of them and allowing adventurous officials to fill the vacuum with their own uncoordinated initiatives. Instead, policy is centered on Trump himself and whoever has last talked to him in the uncontrolled cavalcade of visitors streaming through the Oval Office. As personalism replaces bureaucratic decision-making, short-term profit trumps long-term national interest.\nThis is leading to pushback from allies\u2014and from U.S. courts. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney recently warned that \u201cthe United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony.\u201d U.S. federal courts, which have long been exceedingly deferential to the executive when it comes to national security issues, may be having second thoughts. In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade issued a striking decision, holding that the United States had overstepped its authority when it invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act\u2014the legal bedrock for much of U.S. coercive power\u2014to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico. That decision has been appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, but the judgment is likely just the first of many challenges. Notably, the trade case resulted from a complaint filed by conservative and libertarian lawyers.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s assault on state institutions is weakening the material sources of American power. Across core sectors\u2014finance, technology, and energy\u2014the administration is making the United States less central than it used to be. Trump and his allies are aggressively pushing cryptocurrencies, which are more opaque and less accountable than the traditional greenback, and forswearing enforcement actions against cryptocurrency platforms that enable sanctions evasion and money laundering. In April, the U.S. government lifted sanctions against Tornado Cash, a service that had laundered hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of stolen cryptocurrency for North Korea, according to the U.S. Department of Treasury. And the bipartisan American love affair with stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency, is pushing China and Europe to accelerate their efforts to develop alternative payment systems.\nEconomic interdependence has been turned against the United States.\nIn some instances, the Trump administration has reversed Biden\u2019s policies and promoted the diffusion of previously controlled technology. In a remarkable deal with the United Arab Emirates, the Trump administration agreed to facilitate the massive expansion of data centers in the region using advanced U.S. semiconductors despite continued relations between the UAE and China and warnings from policy experts that the United States should not depend on the Middle East for AI.\nMost recently, the spending bill that Trump and his congressional allies pushed through earlier this summer effectively cedes control of next-generation energy technology to China by doubling down on the carbon economy. Even as Washington works to counteract Chinese influence over critical minerals, it is eliminating measures aimed at minimizing U.S. dependence on Chinese supply chains in the crucial areas of renewable energy and battery development and radically defunding its investment in science. The result is that the United States will face the unenviable choice between relying on Chinese energy technology or trying its best to make do with the moribund technologies of an earlier age.\nOne might have expected that the United States would respond to the age of weaponized interdependence as it responded to the earlier era of nuclear proliferation: by recalibrating its long-term strategy, building the institutional capabilities necessary to make good policy, and strengthening its global position. Instead, it is placing its bets on short-term dealmaking, gutting institutional capacity to analyze information and coordinate policy, and poisoning the economic and technological hubs that it still controls.\nThis does not just affect Washington\u2019s ability to coerce others; it also undermines the attractiveness of key U.S. economic platforms. The use of weaponized interdependence always exploited the advantages of the \u201cAmerican stack\u201d: the mutually reinforcing suite of institutional and technological relationships that drew others into the United States\u2019 orbit. When used wisely, weaponization advanced slowly and within boundaries that others could tolerate.\nNow, however, the United States is spiraling into a rapid and uncontrollable drawdown of its assets, pursuing short-term goals at the expense of long-term objectives. It is increasingly using its tools in a haphazard way that invites miscalculations and unanticipated consequences. And it is doing so in a world in which other countries are not only developing their own capacities to punish the United States but also building technological stacks that may be more appealing to the world than the United States\u2019. If China leaps ahead on energy technology, as seems likely, other countries are going to be pulled into its orbit. Dark warnings from the United States about the risks of dependence on China will ring hollow to countries that are all too aware of how willing the United States is to weaponize interdependence for its own selfish purposes.\nTIME TO REBUILD\nIn the first decades of the nuclear age, American policymakers faced enormous uncertainty about how to achieve stability and peace. That led them to make major investments in institutions and strategic doctrines that could prevent nightmare scenarios. Washington, now entering a similar moment in the age of weaponized interdependence, finds itself in a particularly precarious position.\nThe current U.S. administration recognizes that the United States is not only able to exploit others\u2019 economic vulnerabilities but also deeply vulnerable itself. Addressing these problems, however, would require the administration to act counter to Trump\u2019s deepest instincts.\nThe main problem is that as national security and economic policy merge, governments have to deal with excruciatingly complex phenomena that are not under their control: global supply chains, international financial flows, and emerging technological systems. Nuclear doctrines focused on predicting a single adversary\u2019s responses; today, when geopolitics is shaped in large part by weaponized interdependence, governments must navigate a terrain with many more players, figuring out how to redirect private-sector supply chains in directions that do not hurt themselves while anticipating the responses of a multitude of governmental and\nnongovernmental actors.\nMaking the United States capable of holding its own in the age of weaponized interdependence will require more than just halting the rapid, unscheduled disassembly of the bureaucratic structures that constrain seat-of-the-pants policymaking and self-dealing. Successful strategy in an age of weaponized interdependence requires building up these very institutions to make them more flexible and more capable of developing the deep expertise that is needed to understand an enormously complex world in which Washington\u2019s adversaries now hold many of the cards. That may be a difficult sell for a political system that has come to see expertise as a dirty word, but it is vitally necessary to preserve the national interest.\nChina built a bureaucratic apparatus to turn chokepoints into practical leverage.\nWashington has focused more on thinking about how best to use these weapons than on when they ought not be used. Other countries have been willing to rely on U.S. technological and financial infrastructure despite the risks because they perceived the United States as a government whose self-interest was constrained, at least to some extent, by the rule of law and a willingness to consider the interests of its allies. That calculus has shifted, likely irreversibly, as the second Trump administration has made it clear that it views the countries that the United States has historically been closest to less as allies than as vassal states. Without clear and enforceable limits on U.S. coercion, the most dominant U.S.-based multinational firms, such as Google and J. P. Morgan, will find themselves trapped in the no man\u2019s land of a new war zone, taking incoming fire from all sides. As countries work to insulate themselves from U.S. coercion (and American infrastructure), global markets are experiencing deep fragmentation and fracturing. There is \u201ca growing acceptance of fragmentation\u201d in the global economy, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has warned, and \u201cmaybe even more troubling\u2014I think there\u2019s a growing sense that ours may not be the best fragment to be associated with.\u201d\nThat, in turn, suggests a deeper lesson. The United States benefited from its ability to weaponize interdependence over the last quarter century. It enjoyed the advantages of an international economy based on multilateral institutions and a technological regime built around its self-image as a liberal power, even while acting in unilateral and sometimes illiberal ways to secure its interests as it saw fit. Just a year ago, some American intellectuals and policymakers hoped that this system could survive into the indefinite future, so that unilateral U.S. coercive strength and liberal values would continue to go hand in hand.\nThat now seems extremely unlikely. The United States is faced with a choice: a world in which aggressive American coercion and U.S. hegemonic decline reinforce each other or one in which Washington realigns itself with other liberal-minded countries by forswearing the abuse of its unilateral powers. Not too long ago, American officials and many intellectuals perceived the age of weaponized interdependence and the age of American hegemony as one and the same. Such assumptions now seem outdated, as other countries gain these weapons, too. As during the nuclear era, the United States needs to turn away from unilateralism, toward d\u00e9tente and arms control, and, perhaps in the very long term, toward rebuilding an interdependent global economy on more robust foundations. A failure to do so will put both American security and American prosperity at risk.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

The plan identified ten sectors for investment, including energy, semiconductors, industrial automation, and high-tech materials. It aimed to upgrade China\u2019s manufacturing in these sectors and others, reduce the country\u2019s dependence on imports and foreign firms, and improve the competitiveness of Chinese companies in global markets. The overarching goal was to transform China into a technological leader and turn China\u2019s national champion firms into global ones. The government backed this vision with enormous financial support, spending one to two percent of GDP each year on direct and indirect subsidies, cheap credit, and tax breaks.\nChina has been wildly successful in these efforts. It not only leads the world in electric vehicles and clean technology power generation; it is also dominant in drones, industrial automation, and other electronics products. Its lock on rare-earth magnets produced a quick trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump. Chinese firms are on track to master the more sophisticated technological goods produced by the United States, Europe, and other parts of Asia.\nAnd yet China\u2019s model still has many skeptics. Lavish funding, they point out, has led to waste and corruption. It has created industries in which dozens of competitors manufacture similar products and struggle to make a profit. The resulting deflation makes companies wary of hiring new staff or raising wages, leading to lower consumer confidence and weaker growth. China\u2019s economy, which once looked poised to overtake the United States\u2019 as the world\u2019s biggest, is mired in a slowdown and may never match the American one in total output.\nThese problems are not trivial. But it is a serious error to think they are big enough to derail China\u2019s technological momentum. Beijing\u2019s industrial policy succeeded not simply because planners picked the right sectors and subsidized them. It worked because the state built out the deep infrastructure needed to become a resilient technological powerhouse. It created an innovation ecosystem centered on powerful electricity and digital networks, and it established a massive workforce with advanced manufacturing knowledge. Call it an all-of-the-above technology strategy. This approach has enabled China to develop new technologies and scale them up faster than any other country. Its model is unlikely to be pushed off course by sluggish economic growth or U.S. sanctions.\nChina\u2019s industrial and technological strength is now a permanent feature of the world economy. The United States should compete with China to keep its overall technological leadership and sustain the industries needed for broad-based prosperity and national security. But American policymakers must recognize that their current playbook\u2014export controls, tariffs, and scattershot industrial policy\u2014is ineffective. Simply trying to slow China down will not work. Washington must instead focus on building up its own systems of industrial strength by making patient, long-term investments not just in select, key industries but in energy, information, and transportation infrastructure. If it doesn\u2019t, the United States will face more deindustrialization and lose its technological leadership.\nBECOMING STRONG\nThe notoriously difficult N\u00fcrburgring racetrack is nicknamed the Green Hell for its twisting, 13-mile course through the mountains in western Germany. It is a track that tests even the steeliest drivers and the most advanced vehicles. The cars that have typically performed best are designed by celebrated German companies such as BMW, Porsche, and Mercedes, or by long-established manufacturers in Italy, Japan, and South Korea.\nBut in June 2025, the course saw a new speed record for electric vehicles, and the car that set it was not made by the typical champions. It was set by Xiaomi, a Chinese company better known for its moderately priced smartphones and rice cookers. It produced its first car only a year before. But Xiaomi nonetheless made the third-fastest car\u2014electric or otherwise\u2014ever to race through the Green Hell.\nXiaomi\u2019s triumph on the racetrack was a symbol of China\u2019s surprisingly swift rise to clean energy dominance. China made nearly three-quarters of the world\u2019s electric vehicles in 2024 and accounted for 40 percent of global EV exports. It has a lock on the solar supply chain. Chinese companies make most of the world\u2019s batteries, both for EVs and for other uses. And the country produces 60 percent of the electrolyzers used to extract hydrogen from water, which is the most effective way to produce clean hydrogen-based power.\nSimply trying to slow China down will not work.\nThe standard explanation for China\u2019s technological success is that the central government targeted various industries for support; provided hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, tax breaks, and low-interest loans to get these sectors going; and helped Chinese firms steal or copy technology from other states. This is part of what took place. But that story misses the bigger picture. China succeeded not only because it subsidized particular industries but also because it invested in the deep infrastructure\u2014underlying physical systems and human expertise\u2014that enables innovation and efficient production.\nSome of this infrastructure consists of transportation systems, such as roads, railways, and ports. Over the last 30 years, China has built a national expressway network twice the length of the American interstate system, a high-speed train network with more miles of track than the rest of the world combined, and a formidable network of ports, the largest of which, in Shanghai, moves more cargo in some years than all U.S. ports put together.\nBut if China had stopped there, it would not have reached today\u2019s technological heights. Other infrastructure systems have proved crucial. One is China\u2019s digital network. In its infancy, the Internet was widely thought to corrode authoritarian regimes because it removed their monopoly on information and made it easier for ordinary people to organize across large distances. In 2000, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared that controlling the Internet was like \u201ctrying to nail Jell-O to a wall.\u201d But China\u2019s leadership concluded the opposite. They bet that high-quality data infrastructure would strengthen the government by enabling it to better monitor and manage public opinion, as well as track people\u2019s movements, while hugely benefiting the country\u2019s industrial sectors and creating a high-tech ecosystem.\nSo China nailed Jell-O to the wall. It built a domestic Internet that rapidly connected virtually the entire population while blocking what its people could see from abroad. The gamble paid off. Thanks to Beijing\u2019s early and aggressive promotion of mobile phones, Chinese firms helped pioneer the mobile Internet. Top platforms such as Byte-Dance, Alibaba, and Tencent became world-class innovators. Huawei became the world\u2019s leading producer of 5G equipment. The Chinese population now uses smartphones constantly, and the Communist Party remains very much in charge.\nIT\u2019S ELECTRIC\nThe next key infrastructure system behind China\u2019s prowess is its electric grid. Over the past quarter century, China has led the world in building power plants, adding the equivalent of the United Kingdom\u2019s total supply every year. It now generates more electricity each year than the United States and the European Union combined. The country has invested heavily in ultrahigh voltage transmission lines, which can carry electricity efficiently over long distances, and in all types of battery storage. This abundant power supply has enabled the rapid growth of electricity-reliant transport systems, namely high-speed rail and electric vehicles.\nChina has overcome the obstacles that long prevented electricity from becoming the world\u2019s main energy and supplanting the direct combustion of fossil fuels: that it was hard to move, hard to store, and ineffective at fueling transport. As a result, China is well on its way to becoming the world\u2019s first economy powered mainly by electricity. Electricity accounts for 21 percent of energy use in the world as a whole and 22 percent of energy use in the United States. In China, electricity is nearly 30 percent of energy use, more than in any other large country except Japan. And this share is growing fast: about six percent a year, compared with 2.6 percent for the world as a whole and 0.6 percent for the United States.\nChina\u2019s electrification did not arise out of a master plan. Instead, it was the product of technocratic responses to discrete issues such as power shortages in industrial zones and the need to free up rail capacity for purposes other than moving coal. Now, however, rapid electrification serves a clear strategic purpose. It is a motor of industrial innovation\u2014\u201cpowering the future,\u201d as Damien Ma and Lizzi Lee put it in a July Foreign Affairs article. And the government is keenly aware that abundant, cheap electricity provides the country with a crucial edge in the power-intensive industries of the future, most obviously artificial intelligence. Beijing thus strives to ensure that its electricity system remains the biggest and best in the world.\nChina\u2019s most subtle piece of deep infrastructure is its more than 70-million-person industrial workforce\u2014the largest in the world. Thanks to the country\u2019s intense buildup of complex manufacturing supply chains, Chinese factory managers, engineers, and workers have decades of \u201cprocess knowledge\u201d\u2014hands-on knowledge, gained from experience\u2014about how to make things and how to make them better. This process knowledge enables iterative innovation, or constantly tweaking products so that they can be made more efficiently, at better quality, and with lower costs. It also enables scaling: Chinese factories can rally a large, experienced workforce behind making almost any new product. Finally, and most important, process knowledge allows China to create entire new industries. A factory worker in Shenzhen might assemble iPhones one year and Huawei Mate phones the next and then move on to build drones for DJI or electric vehicle batteries for CATL.\nProcess knowledge in the Chinese workforce may be Beijing\u2019s greatest economic asset. But it is hard to quantify. That is one reason why the rest of the world has persistently underestimated China\u2019s capabilities. Some analysts believe that China is the country that assembles most of the world\u2019s smartphones and other electronics because its workforce costs are low. In reality, the country remains the world\u2019s leader because its workforce has proved its worth in sophistication, scale, and speed.\nAnalysts also miss the red-hot ambition of China\u2019s entrepreneurs. The country is full of businesspeople with the optimism, the daring, or the foolishness to try disrupting sectors. Xiaomi\u2019s legendary founder, Lei Jun, gambled on EVs in 2021, announcing that his company, then valued at $80 billion, would invest $10 billion in them and that it would be his \u201clast major entrepreneurial project.\u201d On the German racetrack, it paid off. Lei was able to plug into an electronics ecosystem, battery partners, and an experienced workforce to make high-speed EVs in just a few years\u2019 time.\nTo see why American companies often struggle to do the same, compare Xiaomi\u2019s experience with that of Apple. In 2014, the computing giant considered developing electric vehicles. It was hardly a crazy idea. Apple had a market capitalization of $600 billion and a cash hoard of $40 billion, giving it far deeper pockets than Xiaomi. By conventional measures, it also had greater technological sophistication. But the United States does not have the energy system or the manufacturing capacity of China, so there was no easy infrastructure for Apple to tap into. As a result, in 2024, the company\u2019s board pulled the plug on a decade of EV development. That same year, Xiaomi expanded its manufacturing capacity and repeatedly raised its delivery target. Meanwhile, the American EV champion, Tesla, faces declining sales in all of its top markets, including China. Chinese buyers now believe that domestic brands are more innovative than Tesla, and more in tune with fast-changing consumer tastes.\nADVERSE REACTION\nIt is a mistake to underestimate China. But the country does face serious economic challenges, many of which arise at least in part from the very industrial policies that have led to its triumphs. China\u2019s technocrats have steered resources not just into high-productivity infrastructure but also into state-owned enterprises that contribute little to the country\u2019s vibrant tech ecosystem, rack up huge debts, and drag down the economy\u2019s efficiency. The politically driven constraints on some of the country\u2019s most creative entrepreneurs, such as Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, and Zhang Yiming, the co-founder of Byte-Dance\u2014who were humiliated when Beijing expanded its power over the consumer Internet\u2014have chilled private-sector confidence.\nUnregulated subsidies, meanwhile, have led to widespread graft. A prime example is China\u2019s semiconductor industry, which has received over $100 billion in direct state industrial policy support since 2014. Some of the projects funded by this money were outright frauds. Other projects were legitimate, but both businesspeople and government officials stole from them. More than a dozen senior chip industry figures have been jailed for corruption since 2022, including the head of Tsinghua Unigroup (which operates several important chipmakers) and the chief of China\u2019s national integrated circuit fund. Two sitting ministers of industry and information technology were fired for graft.\nChina\u2019s subsidies may also, at times, suppress innovation. Generous manufacturing spending helps promote the tech ecosystem, but it also enables less efficient firms to stay in business far longer than they would in a more market-driven economy. That lowers profits for everyone, as companies continually cut their prices to maintain market share. This, in turn, means that manufacturing companies cannot spend as much on research and development. In fact, they need to be cautious about hiring new staff or raising wages.\nChina nailed Jell-O to the wall.\nThe solar industry is a case in point. Owning the solar supply chain is a strategic triumph for the state, but companies producing solar modules mostly sell undifferentiated products, fighting for minuscule profits while cutting prices to the bone. The same is true for manufacturers of EVs, smartphones, and many other products, with too many companies making similar products at paper-thin margins. China\u2019s tech sectors are global success stories, but the companies in them are often miserable.\nIf China is too generous with tech and manufacturing businesses, then it is not generous enough with those providing services. Beijing chronically overregulates service sectors, cracking down on Internet companies that the government sees as engaging in monopolistic practices or threatening political or social instability. It tightly controls finance, health care, and education. As a result, job growth in these sectors has been weak, which means job growth in China as a whole has greatly suffered. Even in this industry-centric country, services employ about 60 percent of the urban workforce and have accounted for all net job creation in the past decade. With jobs hard to come by, wages rising little or at all, and the price of houses\u2014which are most Chinese people\u2019s main asset\u2014falling, Chinese consumers have become reluctant to spend. Private businesses, seeing weak demand, have in turn become even more reluctant to hire or raise wages.\nChina\u2019s current model, then, virtually guarantees slower economic growth. Thanks to the vicious circle Beijing has created, the economy now routinely struggles to reach its annual growth target of five percent and is constantly battling deflation. Meanwhile, because domestic demand is sluggish, more and more of the output of China\u2019s prodigiously productive manufacturing sector will need to be exported, leading to ever larger trade surpluses. China\u2019s trade surplus is already almost a trillion dollars, more than double the figure of just five years earlier.\nThe risks for Beijing are obvious. Slower growth means that the economy could become less dynamic, and tech firms could lose the ability or drive to keep innovating. Ever-rising trade surpluses could trigger much more severe and coordinated protectionism from the rest of the world, with dozens of countries joining the United States in erecting tariff barriers to Chinese imports.\nBut Beijing is likely to overcome these risks, just as it has overcome many challenges in the past. It has begun to recognize that subsidies are too high and has started withdrawing them. Smaller and less efficient players will exit the market. Consolidation is already visible in the electric vehicle sector, in which the number of companies has fallen from 57 to 49 since 2022. A third of EV producers now sell at least 10,000 cars a month, up from less than a quarter of producers three years ago. As for protectionism, most countries will find that there are simply no cost-effective alternatives to the products China exports. There are also ways to evade tariff barriers, such as by shipping goods through third countries or by setting up assembly plants in other states (as the Chinese car manufacturer BYD is doing in Brazil and Hungary).\nChinese officials, for their part, seem to believe that the costs of lower growth, deflation, and irritated trade partners are worth paying. \u201cWe must recognize the fundamental importance of the real economy . . . and never deindustrialize,\u201d said Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 2020, a year in which China\u2019s manufacturers met the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic by surging the production of medical equipment and consumer goods. The message was clear: Beijing\u2019s main goal is not fast growth but self-sufficiency and technological progress.\nCAN\u2019T STOP, WON\u2019T STOP\nWashington has not stood idly by as China\u2019s tech and manufacturing sectors progress. Alarmed by the ambitions of Made in China 2025, the first Trump administration breathed life into some of the most moribund offices inside the Department of Commerce, summoning a powerful bureaucratic apparatus to choke off China\u2019s access to critical materials. U.S. officials realized that China was highly dependent on Western technology inputs, such as leading-edge semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. They thus gambled that a full blockade of these technologies would severely slow China\u2019s technological engine. This was a bipartisan proposition: when U.S. President Joe Biden came into office, in 2021, he maintained his predecessor\u2019s restrictions. In fact, the Biden administration tightened export controls on advanced chips, especially those essential for artificial intelligence, and on semiconductor equipment.\nAnd yet the success of these controls has been mixed at best. In 2018, two big Chinese tech companies, ZTE and Fujian Jinhua, nearly collapsed after being cut off from American technology. But more capable businesses, aided by Washington lawyers and lobbyists, have been able to bounce back. (Trump recently lifted restrictions on leading-edge AI chips made by Nvidia, allowing the company to again sell its products to China.) Huawei was clearly battered after the Commerce Department sanctioned it in 2019. But by 2025, the firm announced that its previous year\u2019s revenues had recovered to 2019 levels. It is still recognizably the same company, one that excels at making 5G equipment and handsets. Except now, it is also one of China\u2019s leading semiconductor innovators, after it invested billions in replacing American chips.\nOther companies have done an even better job of weathering U.S. restrictions. SMIC, one of China\u2019s most important chip foundries, has doubled its revenues since it was sanctioned in 2020. It still lags far behind the industry-leading TSMC in profitability, but it has made certain technological breakthroughs, learning to produce seven-nanometer chips\u2014a technological breakthrough that was considered unlikely after its sanctions. Similarly, restrictions on AI technology did little to prevent the rise of DeepSeek, which has produced an AI reasoning model matched by only a few other firms, all in Silicon Valley.\nBeijing\u2019s main goal is not fast growth but self-sufficiency and technological progress.\nDeepSeek\u2019s success is not hard to understand. Chinese AI firms may not have access to the same leading-edge chips that American ones do, but they do have plentiful access to excellent talent, mature chips, as well as pools of data. They also have a near-unlimited supply of cheap electricity\u2014something their U.S. competitors lack. As a result, according to global technical benchmarks, Chinese large language models are, at most, six months behind American leaders, a gap that is steadily shrinking. Far from blocking China\u2019s progress, U.S. tech restrictions have triggered a Sputnik moment in China. Its companies are bigger, meaner, and significantly less dependent on U.S. companies than they were just a decade earlier.\nSome American officials realize that the United States cannot win just by attacking China\u2019s industries. The Biden administration\u2019s economic planners, for instance, created an industrial policy designed to help the United States advance its own strategic sectors. The country passed the CHIPS Act, which beefed up semiconductor production, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which subsidized clean technologies. But despite earmarking hundreds of billions of dollars, these endeavors have mostly foundered.\nThe reason for these failures is simple. The United States has not built up enough deep infrastructure of its own. Toward the beginning of his term, Biden unveiled an ambitious proposal to deliver Internet service to almost every American. But this \u201cInternet for All\u201d plan had not connected anyone before he left office. There is still no national network of EV charging stations, even though Congress earmarked billions to create one. And Washington has failed to dismantle the bureaucratic and regulatory barriers to building electric transmission systems, which make it hard for energy companies to take advantage of the tax credits the Inflation Reduction Act created for solar and wind projects.\nNow, those credits are poised to disappear. Trump\u2019s July budget reconciliation bill phases out his predecessor\u2019s solar and wind subsidies for most projects that haven\u2019t begun by the end of 2026. The CHIPS Act remains on the books, but the president has derided the law as \u201chorrible\u201d and \u201cridiculous.\u201d Trump\u2019s tariffs, meanwhile, have caused deep uncertainty among manufacturers, who are pausing investments while scrambling to maintain their supply chains. The White House claims that the tariffs will force manufacturers to make their goods on American soil once the restrictions take full effect. But the administration\u2019s analysis is faulty. Manufacturers depend on imports for many of their inputs, and they have proved reluctant to make big investment decisions based on Trump\u2019s wavering pronouncements. In fact, the country shed over 10,000 manufacturing jobs between April and July alone, just after Trump announced his plan to impose high tariffs on virtually every country.\nTrump, of course, is hardly unique in his failure to deliver. American politicians love to celebrate whenever a new mine or semiconductor facility opens. But the U.S. industrial sector continues to shrink amid product delays, layoffs, and falling production quality. Real manufacturing output, which had risen steadily until the 2008 financial crisis, plunged then and has never recovered. This shriveling is happening even in defense manufacturing. Despite an influx of cash, almost every class of U.S. naval ship under construction is behind schedule, some by as much as three years. Producers of artillery shells are only slowly ramping up manufacturing, even though Washington has depleted its stockpiles to help Ukraine. And U.S. efforts to wean its military off Chinese rare-earth minerals have faltered.\nThe United States does retain its advantage over China in several critical areas: software, biotech, and AI, as well as in its university-driven innovation ecosystem. But these institutions face an uncertain future. Since returning to office, Trump has set about defunding scientific research and depriving the country of skilled labor. Government agencies are now scrutinizing top universities, including Harvard and Columbia, and yanking government grants and threatening to revoke universities\u2019 tax-exempt status over exaggerated charges of anti-Semitism. The White House has slashed funding for the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s hostility toward immigrants has driven researchers who would come to the United States to look for positions at companies and universities elsewhere. Aggressive deportations are hurting America\u2019s construction industry. The country simply has not set up its innovation ecosystem well for the years ahead.\nBACK TO BASICS\nThe United States can, and should, reverse Trump\u2019s spending cuts and immigration restrictions as soon as is feasible. But competing effectively against China requires more than just removing self-imposed restraints. Washington\u2019s failings extend across administrations for a reason: American officials, Democrats and Republicans alike, have not taken China\u2019s competence seriously. \u201cChina doesn\u2019t innovate\u2014it steals,\u201d wrote Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton on social media in April, epitomizing how Americans trivialize Chinese accomplishments. Too many U.S. leaders continue to believe that a more exquisite export control regime will halt China\u2019s technological momentum. They are sending lawyers into an engineering fight. They need to realize that no matter how hard the United States squeezes, it will not break China\u2019s industrial and technological system.\nWhat Washington should do is strengthen its own capacity. That means starting the hard work of building up the United States\u2019 deep infrastructure. Washington should not try to replicate Beijing\u2019s massive and often wasteful investments in all systems. But it should do better than Biden\u2019s ad-hoc, sector-by-sector approach. And it must abandon Trump\u2019s strategy of hoping that the tariff cudgel will force a reshoring of industry, and his focus on old heavy industries such as steel.\nInstead, policymakers must start to think in ecosystem terms, as China has. The United States has long-standing strengths in entrepreneurship and finance, so state-led investments in modern deep infrastructure are likely to have big payoffs, just as investments in railroads and highways did in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Large-scale infrastructure projects can stimulate demand for different technologies and create the process knowledge needed to build them, which are crucial first steps in rebuilding the manufacturing base. A top priority should be building a bigger and better electricity system that makes use of nuclear power, natural gas, and renewable energy sources. To maximize its use of renewables, the United States should invest in building more battery storage and high-voltage transmission lines.\nWashington is sending lawyers to an engineering fight.\nThe United States will also need to find ways to reduce cost structures throughout its industries. Because it is a rich country with high wages and labor and environmental standards, it will never be able to compete with China or India in terms of availability of low-cost labor, and it should not try. But to be serious about rebuilding industry, Washington must display a commitment to making its markets attractive for capital-intensive sectors. Eliminating Trump\u2019s ruinous tariffs, which will make American manufacturing prohibitively expensive, is essential, as is providing abundant, cheap energy. Yet so is permitting reform that eliminates the excessive regulatory costs of new construction, ample government funding for basic research and development, and liberal immigration policies that enable companies to source the best talent from anywhere in the world. The last is not strictly a cost measure, but it is essential to rebuilding U.S. process knowledge. Much of that knowledge now exists abroad, and the United States must be willing to import it.\nAbove all, Washington should not underestimate what it is up against. Beijing has made achieving technological supremacy a top political priority. The subsidies it used to push technological progress produced plenty of waste, but that was a side-effect of achieving leadership in the industries of the future. To compete, the United States must also make a commitment to leading in these industries, and it must be more willing to accept mistakes and some waste as the price of success.\nChina\u2019s model has worked because its policymakers have gotten a lot of things right and have given Chinese entrepreneurs the conditions for success. The country may have problems, but it will continue to be effective. And the longer it succeeds, the more the United States and its allies will deindustrialize under pressure from Chinese firms in energy, industrial goods, and perhaps even artificial intelligence. If the United States is to compete effectively, its policymakers must spend less time worrying about how to weaken their rival and more time figuring out how to make their country the best and most vigorous version of itself.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s radical shift in economic approach has already begun to change norms, behaviors, and institutions globally. Like a major earthquake, it has given rise to new features in the landscape and rendered many existing economic structures unusable. This event was a political choice, not an inevitable natural disaster. But the changes that it is driving are here to stay. No guardrails will automatically restore the previous status quo.\nTo understand these changes, many analysts and politicians focus on the degree to which supply chains and trade in manufactured goods are shifting between the United States and China. But that focus is too narrow. Asking whether the United States or China will remain central to the world\u2019s economy\u2014or looking primarily at trade balances\u2014yields a dramatic underestimate of the scope and impact of Trump\u2019s changed approach and how comprehensively the prior U.S. framework undergirded the economic decisions made by almost every state, financial institution, and company worldwide.\nIn essence, the global public goods that the United States provided after the end of World War II\u2014among others, the ability to securely navigate the air and seas, the presumption that property is safe from expropriation, rules for international trade, and stable dollar assets in which to transact business and store money\u2014can be thought of, in economic terms, as forms of insurance. The United States collected premiums from the countries that participated in the system it led in a variety of ways, including through its ability to set rules that made the U.S. economy the most attractive one to investors. In return, the societies that bought into the system were freed to expend much less effort on securing their economies against uncertainty, enabling them to pursue the commerce that helped them flourish.\nSome pressures had been building within this system before Trump\u2019s ascent. But particularly in his second term, Trump has switched the United States\u2019 role from global insurer to extractor of profit. Instead of the insurer securing its clients against external threats, under the new regime, the threat against which insurance is sold comes as much from the insurer as from the global environment. The Trump administration promises to spare clients from its own assaults for a higher price than before. Trump has threatened to block access to American markets on a broad scale; made the protections that come with military alliances explicitly dependent on the purchase of U.S. weapons, energy, and industrial products; required foreigners who want to operate businesses in the United States to make side payments to his personal priorities; and pressured Mexico, Vietnam, and other countries to drop Chinese industrial inputs or investment by Chinese companies. These acts are on a scale unprecedented in modern U.S. governance.\nThe United States\u2019 withdrawal of its former insurance will fundamentally change the behavior of the country\u2019s clients and its clients\u2019 clients\u2014and not in the ways that Trump hopes. China, the country whose behavior most U.S. officials want to change, will likely be the least affected, while the United States\u2019 closest allies will be the most damaged. As other U.S. partners watch these reliant allies suffer, they will seek to self-insure instead, at great cost to them. Assets will become harder to save and investment abroad less appealing. As their exposure to global economic and security risks rises, governments will find that both foreign diversification and macroeconomic policy have become less effective tools for stabilizing their economies.\nSome argue that Trump\u2019s new posture will simply drive a potentially desirable realignment. In this view, although his program requires both governments and businesses to pay more for less, the world will ultimately accept its new normal, to the United States\u2019 benefit. This is a delusion. In the world Trump\u2019s program creates, everyone will suffer\u2014not least the United States.\nGANGSTER\u2019S PARADISE\nImagine that you were fortunate enough to inherit a piece of land by the ocean. It always offered great views and beach access. But you only invested in building a grand house on the lot when a well-regulated, reliable company came along that offered sufficient home insurance. You had to pay a pretty penny for it, of course. But that company\u2019s coverage also enabled the owners of nearby lots to build, inspiring the creation of a rewarding neighborhood with roads, water, cell towers, rising home values\u2014and most crucially, the guarantee that if you continued to pay premiums insuring you against floods and hurricanes, any further investments you made in your property would be at low risk.\nIn essence, this is the economic situation in which much of the world operated for nearly 80 years. The United States recouped enormous benefits by acting as the world\u2019s dominant insurance provider after World War II. By assuming this role, it also maintained some control over other countries\u2019 economic and security policies without having to resort to harsh threats. In return, countries that participated in the system were shielded from various forms of risk. Washington\u2019s military supremacy and the mechanisms of international order that it enforced allowed national borders to remain mostly settled; most economies could thrive without the threat of conquest. Between 1980 and 2020, incomes converged overall both between and within the states that took part.\nEconomic injustices persisted; at times, they were imposed by the United States. But broadly, this global insurance regime was a win-win for nearly everyone with regard to economic stability, innovation, and growth. Violence and warfare declined overall, and poorer states were better able to integrate their economies with higher-income markets that opened up to trade. This security may have rested on a communal illusion about how little military investment and action it would take to keep geopolitics stable. But that regime persisted for decades, in part because U.S. policymakers in both parties valued the system and in part because enough outside actors believed in it and benefited from it.\nNow that sense of safety is gone. Imagine, again, your hypothetical beachfront house. Some threats to your property have started to increase: sea levels are rising, and hurricanes are becoming deadlier. Instead of simply raising your premium, however, your insurer\u2014which you had long trusted and dutifully paid\u2014suddenly begins to refuse your claims for damage unless you pay double your official rate and slip the insurer something extra under the table, too. Even if you do pay what is asked, the insurer then writes to say that it is tripling the price of your general premium for less comprehensive coverage. Alternative insurers are not available. Meanwhile, your taxes begin to rise, and your day-to-day public services become less reliable because of the demands that disaster response is placing on your community.\nThe United States profited handsomely from being an insurance provider.\nTrump is not the only actor responsible for the breakdown of the economic regime that prevailed for 80 years. The list of contributing factors\u2014the underlying threats not posed by your home insurer, in the beach house analogy\u2014is long. The rise of China, and the United States\u2019 response, played a part. So, too, did climate change, the advance of information technology, and the U.S. electorate\u2019s understandable loss of trust in incumbent elites after the country\u2019s interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, the 2008\u20139 global financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBut the Trump administration\u2019s policies constitute a clear turning point. The president\u2019s supporters sometimes portray these as a mere repricing of risk: the free world\u2019s insurer is adjusting its fees and services to fit new realities and correct a previous tendency to underprice its offerings. This depiction is mistaken. The Trump administration has made clear that it wants the United States to operate a completely different kind of scheme, in which it weaponizes and maintains uncertainty in order to extract as much as it can for as little as possible in return.\nTrump and his advisers would argue that this is simple reciprocity or fair treatment for countries that, in their view, exploited the United States for decades. Yet those countries never extracted anything that remotely matched what the United States received: dirt cheap long-term loans to the U.S. government; disproportionately massive foreign investment in American corporations and the U.S. workforce; a near-global adherence to U.S. technical and legal standards that advantaged U.S.-based producers; reliance on the U.S. financial system for the vast majority of global transactions and reserves; compliance with U.S. initiatives on sanctions; payments for garrisoning American troops; widespread dependence on the U.S. defense industry; and best of all, a sustained rise in the American standard of living. Not only did the United States profit handsomely from being an insurance provider that others valued, but its allies also ceded many important security-related decisions to Washington.\nThe great thing about providing insurance is that for years at a time, you don\u2019t have to do or pay anything to collect your premiums. That is even truer for the form of economic insurance the United States provided globally than it is for a home insurance provider, because the very existence of the U.S. security guarantees reduced the real-world threats to policyholders. This reduced the claims paid out. But the Trump administration is jettisoning this profitable and steady business model in favor of one that reinforces the opposite cycle. Ever-fewer clients will become more at risk. Already, businesses, governments, and investors are fundamentally changing their practices to try to self-insure instead.\nFIGHT OR FLIGHT\nIn truth, Trump\u2019s approach will do the greatest damage to the economies that are most closely tied to the U.S. economy and took the previous rules of the game most for granted: Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. Take Japan: it had bet on the United States long term, investing substantially in U.S.-located production for over 45 years and transferring its technological and managerial innovations along the way. It has placed a larger share of its people\u2019s savings in U.S. Treasuries for longer than any other economy. Japan agreed to serve as the United States\u2019 floating aircraft carrier on the frontline with China, and it garrisons U.S. troops in Okinawa despite growing domestic opposition. Japan supported the first Trump administration in the G-7 and the G-20, followed the Biden administration in adopting parallel sanctions against Russia after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and, since 2013, has increased its military spending substantially in line with U.S. policy priorities.\nUntil this year, what Japan got in return was reliable platinum-tier coverage. Japanese investors and businesses were able to take it for granted that they could sell products competitively in the U.S. market, get their savings in and out of U.S. Treasury bonds and other dollar-denominated assets as needed, and safely invest in production in the United States. Japan\u2019s economic strategy heading into Trump\u2019s second term was based on the assumption that this coverage would continue, if at a higher price: in 2023 and 2024, Japanese companies announced investment plans that emphasized their readiness to put even more capital into U.S. industries, including uncompetitive ones such as steel, and forgo some market share in China to coordinate with the United States.\nThe trade deal announced in mid-July between the United States and Japan has increased the price tag for Japan well beyond that and diminished Japan\u2019s coverage. The 15 percent tariffs imposed on the country are ten times what they had been and affect autos and auto parts, steel, and other major Japanese industries. Japan committed to creating a fund that invests an additional 14 percent of the country\u2019s GDP into the United States\u2014its monies spent at Trump\u2019s personal discretion\u2014that will cede a share of any profits to the United States. This constitutes a huge downgrade in Japanese savers\u2019 expected returns and control compared with their prior private-sector investments, which were not subjected to such arbitrary U.S. government oversight. Explicit provisions requiring Japan to buy U.S. aircraft, rice, and other agricultural products, as well as support Alaskan natural gas extraction, expose the country to new risks. Even if Japan delivers on the agreement, it will remain vulnerable to Trump\u2019s potential decisions to unilaterally raise its premium and reduce its coverage even further. Meanwhile, Washington\u2019s recent accommodations to China on the semiconductor trade further diminish the benefits for Japan of pursuing an alliance-based economic path.\nU.S. allies will not accept a \u201crebalancing\u201d imposed on them.\nThe Trump administration expected that its key allies would simply pay any price for U.S. protection. So far, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom have followed an approach closest to the one that the Trump administration anticipated. In the near term, these countries have decided that their fates must lie with the United States, whatever the cost. But Trump underestimated the degree to which allies\u2019 closeness to the United States would lead them to register Washington\u2019s new stance as a shocking betrayal. The popularity of the United States has declined sharply: in the Pew Research Center\u2019s spring 2025 survey on attitudes toward the United States, the proportion of Japanese citizens who viewed the country favorably had slid by 15 percentage points from a year earlier; the country\u2019s favorability rating had plummeted by 20 points among Canadians and 32 points among Mexicans. This large and negative shift reflects the sense of disappointment that only those truly invested in a relationship can feel.\nNational security concerns, existing ties, and\u2014in the case of Canada and Mexico\u2014geographical proximity will limit the degree to which the United States\u2019 closest allies can undo their economic dependence. Yet they have more room to do so than advocates of Trump\u2019s economic approach appreciate. Canada has resisted Trump\u2019s attempts to unilaterally revise the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and impose asymmetrically high tariffs on Canadian goods. Prime Minister Mark Carney and all of Canada\u2019s provincial premiers announced in July that, to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on the United States, they had agreed to limit their concessions to Trump\u2019s escalating demands and actively pursue increased internal integration. Carney also vowed to expand trade with the EU and other entities.\nOther close U.S. allies such as Australia and South Korea will probably decide that in the near term, they have no choice but to throw in their lot with the United States. Over time, however, allies may well tire of the declining benefits that appeasement yields and reorient their investments. Like Canada, they will try to expand their ties with China, the EU, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). But this reorientation will yield a worse outcome for all these economies. They relied economically on the United States for good reason; if substitute markets, investments, and products were just as valuable, they would have chosen those in the first place. In the absence of fairly priced U.S. insurance, the value proposition changes.\nLEFT BEHIND\nThe seismic Trump shock has hit other major economic land masses, too. ASEAN and the EU were always less fully aligned with the United States on economic and security policy than the five most integrated allies were. The two blocs are diverse, with a variety of commercial specializations, advantages, and political orientations within their memberships. Yet they and their member states\u2014particularly Germany, France, the Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden, and Vietnam\u2014have also based their economic behavior on the insurance the United States previously provided. As a result, they came to play leading roles in U.S. supply chains and technology investment. Their governments and citizens poured money into the U.S. economy through foreign direct investment, purchases of Treasury bonds, and participation in the U.S. stock market. They agreed to join U.S. sanctions and export-control regimes, albeit less consistently, and directly supported the U.S. military.\nTrump has now subjected these countries to massive tariffs and tariff threats as well as bilateral requests for specific accommodations and side payments, such as demands that they purchase more U.S. natural gas or transfer industrial production to the United States. These economic players have more choice in how much effort they want to devote toward maintaining ties with the United States. And they are shifting their behavior more rapidly, strengthening economic linkages with one another and with China. ASEAN and the EU both had greater commercial ties to China than to the United States to begin with; that gap is widening, not only because the Chinese economy is growing but also because the United States is limiting its exports to and imports from China and its investment there. Over the past decade, the share of Chinese inputs into European and Southeast Asian industrial supply chains rose steeply as the United States\u2019 share fell.\nIt is not sustainable for the EU, and certainly not for ASEAN, to economically isolate China, and the gains from doing business with China will only increase as the United States leaves the scene. Commerce with China does not substitute for the insurance that the United States previously provided. But as the Trump regime makes the United States less competitive as a site for production and limits access to the U.S. market (shrinking that market\u2019s growth potential), an expansion of trade and investment with China can provide these blocs with a partial offset. As sizable economic entities in their own right, Asian and European countries have a far greater ability to pursue a different path, even though they will be spending more to self-insure than they used to. For instance, orders for Eurofighter jets as an alternative to U.S. combat aircraft have surged among NATO members such as Spain and Turkey. And the Indonesian government, in the spring of 2025, struck new economic deals with China, including an approximately $3 billion \u201ctwin\u201d industrial park project that will link Central Java with Fujian Province. The project is expected to create thousands of jobs in Indonesia at a moment when nothing of that kind is on offer from the United States. Indonesia\u2019s central bank and the People\u2019s Bank of China have also agreed to promote trade in local currencies, and the two countries have vowed to strengthen their maritime cooperation; both deals surprised U.S. policymakers.\nAdditionally (and crucially), Trump\u2019s economic policy is reinforcing and accelerating the separation of two clear tiers of emerging markets in terms of their resilience to macroeconomic shocks. During the 1998\u201399 and 2008\u20139 financial crises, even the largest emerging economies\u2014Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Turkey\u2014suffered badly. But they have become substantially more resilient, thanks to domestic reforms as well as new export and investment opportunities offered by richer countries (including China). During the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s subsequent enormous interest-rate increase, their economies did not suffer much financial damage. The largest emerging markets remained able to adjust their fiscal and monetary policies with some autonomy.\nDozens of lower- and middle-income economies, by contrast, accumulated debt at a devastating pace. Since 2000, the decline in real income in these countries has more than offset the gains they had made in the previous decade. Trump\u2019s new approach has further closed off their economic opportunities, and the way he has encouraged the larger emerging markets, particularly India, to adopt their own homeland-first policies only deepens poorer economies\u2019 isolation.\nCapital seeks opportunity, but also security. The U.S. withdrawal of economic insurance, and Trump\u2019s hard turn against foreign aid and development, will reinforce investors\u2019 preference for relatively stable locales. Thus, the poorest countries in Central America, Central and South Asia, and Africa are likely to become stuck in the economic lowlands with little means of exit while the larger, geopolitically significant emerging markets will, relatively speaking, become more attractive. Some of the poorest countries will make deals\u2014for instance, by providing the United States with preferred access to their resources or serving as destinations for U.S. deportees. That response, however, cannot yield the kind of sustainable growth that many emerging economies enjoyed under the old U.S. insurance regime.\nSOLID AND LIQUID\nPerhaps the most important change the United States has made to its insurance scheme, however, is to reduce the dollar\u2019s liquidity\u2014which diminishes the safety of the portfolios of savers worldwide. U.S. assets that were previously viewed as low-to-no-risk can no longer be considered entirely safe. This will have far-reaching ramifications for the global availability and flow of capital.\nDuring Trump\u2019s 2024 election campaign and since he took office, top officials in his administration have repeatedly threatened to trap investors in U.S. Treasuries by, for example, forcing countries and institutions to swap their current holdings for longer-term or perpetual debt, punishing governments that promote the use of currencies other than the dollar, and taxing foreign investors at higher rates than domestic ones. Trump administration officials have not yet followed through. But these threats, combined with repeated attacks on the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence and promises to depreciate the dollar, are steadily undermining the perceived stability of the dollar and Treasury bonds.\nThe underlying problem is that the world has more savings than it has safe places to stow them. Cash-rich surplus economies\u2014places such as China, Germany, and Saudi Arabia, as well as smaller but striking examples such as Norway, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014cannot keep all their savings at home for three reasons. First, their savers would lack diversification if a country-specific shock hits their economy. Second, forcing huge amounts of savings into these mostly small markets would distort asset prices, leading to bubbles, financial instability, and abrupt shifts in employment patterns. And third, such countries do not issue enough public debt, at least not enough that foreigners want to hold. This is why, for decades, the uniquely deep, broad, and apparently safe U.S. Treasuries market\u2014and dollar-denominated assets in general\u2014have absorbed the lion\u2019s share of the world\u2019s excess savings.\nU.S. assets that were once viewed as low-to-no-risk are no longer safe.\nAmong the many benefits that Treasury bonds and other U.S. public markets offered to global investors, the most attractive was ample liquidity. Investors could convert assets they had in these markets into cash with few or no delays or costs. The valuation of their investments remained stable, and unlike in smaller markets, even a very large transaction would not swing prices. Investors did not have to worry that their counterparties would not accept their form of payment. With the exception of known criminals and entities targeted by sanctions, everyone in the world could rely on both the stability and flexibility of dollar-denominated investments\u2014which in turn lowered the risk that businesses would face cash-flow crunches or miss opportunities.\nThe dollar\u2019s dominance, which went well beyond what the United States\u2019 GDP or share of global trade would have justified, constituted another win-win type of insurance. The United States collected premiums in the form of lower interest on its debt and steadier exchange rates. American and foreign asset holders both benefited. Even when a financial or geopolitical shock originated in the United States, investors assumed that the U.S. economy would remain safer than others. When U.S. markets directly triggered a worldwide recession in 2008, interest rates and the dollar fell and then rose together as capital from abroad flowed into the U.S. market.\nNow the dollar appears to be behaving the way that most currencies do, which is to move in the opposite direction to interest rates. Until April of this year, the dollar closely tracked the day-to-day movements of the U.S. ten-year Treasury interest rate. Ever since the administration\u2019s April 2 tariff announcements, the correlation between U.S. interest rates and the dollar has reversed, indicating that something other than day-to-day economic news is driving the dollar down.\nMultiple times this year, the Trump administration has announced a surprise policy change that provoked economic volatility: on April 2, the \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs; in May, the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d spending package; and, over the course of June, several threats to impose additional tariffs, as well as the U.S. bombing of Iran. In response to each of these events, the dollar fell while U.S. long-term interest rates rose, indicating a capital outflow in response to turmoil.\nSimilarly, throughout modern history, tariff impositions have led to currency appreciations, including during Trump\u2019s first term. This year, however, the dollar has depreciated as the president has imposed tariffs. This major break with the historical pattern suggests that global concerns about the instability of U.S. policy have begun to outweigh the usual flight to safety that pushes up the dollar.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s hostile and unpredictable approach toward U.S.-led military alliances has further eroded support for the dollar. Washington\u2019s new stance heightens the risk that it will sanction even allied foreign investors. And as the American-led alliances have less power to reassure, other governments are boosting their defense spending, which increases the relative attractiveness of their currencies. EU bond markets, for instance, are becoming bigger and deeper as debt-financed defense spending surges in northern and eastern Europe. The euro offers more benefit to Ukraine, the Balkan States, and some Middle Eastern and North African countries that aim to reduce their vulnerability to U.S. whims by seeking euro-denominated arms, trade, investment, loans, and development aid.\nDEBT COLLECTORS\nEuropean and other markets, however, cannot fully replicate the advantages that dollar-denominated assets formerly conferred. The world\u2019s investors, including American ones, will simply have fewer safe places to put their savings as U.S. assets become less liquid. This increased insecurity will drive up long-term average interest rates on U.S. government debt just when a lot more debt is being issued. All borrowers, private and sovereign, that participate in the U.S. financial system will feel the pinch of that interest-rate rise because all loans are priced off Treasury rates in some sense.\nSome savers, particularly Chinese ones, may seek to move assets out of U.S. markets. But that flight will put deflationary pressure on their home economies as their overall returns shrink and excess savings become bottled up in markets that already had a more limited set of investment opportunities. Meanwhile, the value of alternative assets\u2014nondollar currencies, commodities traditionally treated as stores of value such as gold and timber, and newer cryptocurrency products\u2014will surge. Because these assets are less liquid, these upswings will almost certainly lead to periodic financial crashes and greatly complicate the challenges governments face in using monetary policy to stabilize economies. This will be a loss for the world with no net gain for the U.S. economy.\nJust as persistent droughts motivate people to zealously guard access to their water supplies, a lack of liquidity in global markets encourages governments to ensure that their debt is funded at home rather than leaving it up to the market. These measures typically take the form of what is called financial repression: forcing financial institutions (and ultimately, households) to hold more public debt than they otherwise would, through some combination of regulations, capital outflow controls, and the forced allocation of newly issued debt. Financial repression tends to lower returns for savers and drives up their vulnerability to de facto expropriation.\nUltimately, the diminished availability of financing makes it harder for privately owned businesses as well as governments to ride out temporary downturns before exhausting their funding. They will have to accumulate reserves to cover dollar obligations (such as outstanding or interbank loans) in case of financial distress. If countries have to self-insure, both governments and businesses will become more risk-averse and have less available to invest, especially abroad, reinforcing the fragmentation of the world\u2019s economy.\nLOSE-LOSE\nWithout the insurance that the United States provided, new links between economies and pathways for investment will emerge. But they will be costlier to build and maintain, less broadly accessible, and less dependable. Countries will undoubtedly seek to self-insure, but those efforts will inherently be more costly and less effective than when risk was pooled under a single insurer. Navigating the world\u2019s economy was never a smooth road. But after the earthquake of Trump\u2019s economic regime change, the terrain has become much rougher.\nIn the end, money spent on insurance is money that cannot be spent on other things. Governments, institutions, and companies will have to pay simply to hedge against bad outcomes instead of funding good ones. Opportunities for investment and consumer choices will narrow. Growth in productivity (and therefore growth in real incomes) will slow as commercial competition, innovation, and global cooperation to create new infrastructure contract. Many of the poorest emerging markets will lose coverage against threats altogether\u2014at the very moment when the risks they face are sharply increasing.\nThis means a worse world for almost everyone. Amid this change, however, China\u2019s immediate economic environment will be the least altered despite Trump\u2019s previous claims that he would design his economic policies to target Beijing most aggressively. China is relatively well positioned to attempt to self-insure after a U.S. withdrawal. More than any other major economy, it had already begun to reduce its reliance on the United States for exports, imports, investment, and technology. Whether China will be able to capture new external opportunities in the United States\u2019 retreat will depend on whether it can overcome other countries\u2019 skepticism about its reliability as an insurer. Will it merely seek to run the same kind of protection racket as the United States\u2014or a worse one?\nIt is a tragic and destructive irony that, in the name of national security, the United States is now injuring the allies that have contributed the most to its economic well-being while leaving China far less disadvantaged. That is why Trump officials\u2019 belief that these close allies will simply accept the \u201crebalancing\u201d imposed on them is profoundly mistaken. These governments will be pragmatic, but that pragmatism will take a very different form than the Trump administration desires. For decades, they gave Washington the benefit of the doubt. Now they are losing their illusions and will offer less to the United States, not more.\nTrump\u2019s actions will alter China\u2019s immediate economic environment the least.\nThere will be opportunities in this new landscape. But they will involve the U.S. economy less and less. The most promising possibility is that European and Asian countries, excluding China, will join to create a new space of relative stability. The EU and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, an alliance composed of mostly Indo-Pacific states, are already exploring new forms of cooperation. In June, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, described these negotiations as an effort at \u201credesigning\u201d the World Trade Organization to \u201cshow the world that free trade with a large number of countries is possible on a rules-based foundation.\u201d These economies could also do more to guarantee mutual investment rights, create binding mechanisms for settling trade disputes, and pool their liquidity to respond to financial shocks. They could seek to maintain the function and influence of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization, protecting these institutions from paralysis as China or the United States seek to veto necessary initiatives.\nIf they want to sustain some fraction of the global economy\u2019s prior openness and stability, however, these countries will have to build blocs with a selective membership rather than pursue a strictly multilateral approach. This would be a poor substitute for the system over which the United States had presided. But it would be much better than simply accepting the economy that the Trump administration is now creating.\nAs for the United States itself, no matter how many bilateral trade deals it brokers, no matter how many economies appear\u2014at first\u2014to align with Washington at a high cost, the country will find itself increasingly bypassed in commerce and technology and less able to influence other countries\u2019 investment and security decisions. The U.S. supply chains that the Trump administration claims to want to secure will become less reliable\u2014inherently costlier, less diversified in their sourcing, and subject to more risk from U.S.-specific shocks. Leaving behind much of the developing world will not only increase migrant flows and trigger public health crises; it will prevent the United States from tapping potential market opportunities. The Trump administration\u2019s moves to drive away foreign investment will erode U.S. living standards and the U.S. military\u2019s capacity. European, Asian, and even Brazilian and Turkish brands will likely gain market share at American companies\u2019 expense, while technical standards for products such as automobiles and financial services technologies will increasingly diverge from U.S. norms. Many of these phenomena will be self-reinforcing, making them hard to reverse even after Trump leaves the White House.\nAs the song goes, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got till it\u2019s gone. The Trump administration has paved paradise and put up a casino, with what will soon be an empty parking lot.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

But the exact contours of today\u2019s contest remain the subject of debate. Some observers emphasize ideological precedents from the Cold War. Others focus on changing military balances. Still others highlight leaders and their choices. In truth, modern conflicts over the international system flow from a long-standing, if unrecognized, disagreement over the sources of power and prosperity. The dispute originates from geography, and it has produced two antithetical global outlooks: one continental and the other maritime.\nIn the continental world, the currency of power is land. Most countries, by geography, inhabit a continental world with multiple neighbors. Such neighbors have, historically, been each other\u2019s primary adversaries. Those with enough power to conquer others\u2014continental hegemons such as China and Russia\u2014believe the international system should be divided among them into huge spheres of influence. They funnel resources into their militaries to protect boundaries, conquer and intimidate neighbors in wealth-destroying wars, and entrench authoritarian rule at home to prioritize military over civilian needs. The result is a vicious cycle. To justify their repression and retain the throne, despots require a big enemy and manufacture security threats that lead to more wars.\nBy contrast, states with an oceanic moat have relative security from invasion. They can thus focus on compounding wealth rather than on fighting neighbors. These maritime states see money, not territory, as the source of power. They advance domestic prosperity through international commerce and through industry, minimizing the tradeoff between military and civilian needs. While continental hegemons gravitate toward finite-game, winner-take-all strategies that are ruinous to the defeated, those vested in the maritime order prefer the infinite game of wealth-compounding, mutually beneficial transactions. They view neighbors as trade partners, not enemies.\nThe maritime worldview goes back to the ancient Athenians, whose rimland empire depended on accruing wealth from coastal trade. Such states wish to treat the oceans as commons, so all can share them and safely trade. It is not a coincidence that Hugo Grotius, the founding father of international law, came from the Dutch Republic, a trading empire. And since World War II, commercially minded countries have developed regional and global institutions to facilitate trade, minimize transaction costs, and compound wealth. They have coordinated their coast guards and navies to eliminate piracy so that trade gets through. This has produced an evolving maritime, rules-based order with dozens of members that together enforce the regulations that protect them all.\nToday\u2019s competition is just the latest iteration of the continental-maritime conflict. Since World War II, the United States\u2019 strategy has reflected its position as a maritime power. Because of its economic structure, the country has an interest in maintaining trade and commerce. And thanks to its geography and strength, it can hinder countries from undermining the sovereignty of other states. China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, meanwhile, want to undermine the rules-based order because their leaders consider more liberal societies an existential threat to their rule and national security visions.\nThe United States can prevail in the second cold war, just as in the first, by hewing to the successful strategies of maritime power. But if it reverts to a continental paradigm\u2014by erecting barriers, threatening neighbors, and undermining global institutions\u2014it is likely to fail. It may then be unable to recover.\nTHE TRICKS OF TRADE\nThe United Kingdom developed the modern maritime playbook for countering continental powers during the Napoleonic Wars. London became the world\u2019s dominant power not by deploying its army to obliterate rivals but by growing rich from trade and industry while other European countries ruined each other militarily. All continental states had to maintain large armies either to conquer or to avoid being conquered. Often, they organized their economies around the needs of their army, not their merchants. But the United Kingdom, protected on every side by water and by its dominant navy, was less afraid of an invasion. It therefore did not need a large, expensive, potentially coup-generating ground force. It focused on compounding its wealth through commerce, relying on its navy to defend shipping lanes.\nAlone of all the great powers, the United Kingdom belonged to every successive coalition fighting France. After the Royal Navy defeated Napoleon at Trafalgar, he turned to an economic strategy. He imposed a continent-wide blockade on British commerce, known as the Continental System\u2014a strategy that Napoleon described as la France avant tout (France first). But this blockade hurt the economies of France and its allies far more than it did the United Kingdom, which had maritime access to alternative markets across the planet. The blockade led Napoleon to launch his ruinous invasion of Russia, which continued trading with the British.\nIn the continental world, the currency of power is land.\nRather than fighting Napoleon\u2019s large military directly, the United Kingdom used its growing wealth to fund and arm Austria, Prussia, Russia, and numerous smaller states, which together pinned down the bulk of Napoleon\u2019s forces on the main front in central or eastern Europe. The British then opened a peripheral theater on the Iberian Peninsula, what Napoleon called his \u201cSpanish ulcer,\u201d which had better sea than land access, so that attrition rates favored them. The cumulative casualties from this and the main front ultimately overextended Napoleon, dooming his military when his adversaries simultaneously ganged up. Virtually every European country suffered extensive war damage, but the British economy emerged unscathed. The same was true for the United States in both world wars.\nAfter the Napoleonic Wars, the Industrial Revolution introduced compounded economic growth. This tilted the playing field even more in favor of maritime powers. Suddenly, it was far easier to accrue power from industry, commerce, and trade than from wealth-destroying wars. Doing so depended on the external lines of communication provided by the seas rather than the internal lines that continental powers, such as Napoleonic France, leveraged to defend and expand their empires. As a result, today, the world order is maritime in nature\u2014even though few perceive it that way. Around half the world\u2019s population lives by the sea, coastal areas create roughly two-thirds of global wealth, 90 percent of traded goods (measured by weight) arrive at their final destination via oceans, and submarine cables account for 99 percent of international communications traffic. International bodies and treaties regulate trade. The seas connect everyone with everything. No one state can keep them open, but a coalition of coastal states can make them safe for transit.\nThis system has broadly benefited the world\u2019s people. Trading rules have minimized bottlenecks, reducing costs. Safe, open seas facilitate economic growth, raising living standards. People can travel, work, and invest abroad. Billionaires are the greatest beneficiaries of the maritime order because they have the most to lose to confiscation when the rules disappear, and because their economic interests are global. Countries vested in the maritime order are far richer than those that seek to undermine it. Even those intending to overturn this system have benefited from it. China, for instance, became rich only after it joined the maritime order when the Cold War ended. The Iranian and Russian economies are a fraction of what they could be if they followed international law and built institutions to protect their citizens instead of their dictators.\nCONQUER AND COLLAPSE\nIn the continental world, power is a function of territory. Neighbors are dangerous. Since strong ones may invade, continental hegemons work to destabilize nearby countries. In modern times, they do so by deluging them with fake news to fuel internal resentments and regional disagreements. Weak neighbors also pose a threat, as terrorism and chaos can bleed over shared borders. To protect themselves and increase their power, continental states often invade and ingest their neighbors, eliminating potential threats by wiping them off the map.\nIn their drive to increase in size and power, successful continental hegemons follow two rules: avoid two-front wars and neutralize great-power neighbors. But the continental theory of security provides no counsel for when to stop expanding and yields no permanent alliances. Neighbors understand that the hegemon promises long-term trouble. As a result, continentalists often find themselves overextended, alone, and, eventually, at risk of collapse. Both wars for territory and the destabilization of neighbors swiftly destroy wealth.\nGermany, for example, could have dominated the European continent economically during the twentieth century, given its more rapid economic growth rate relative to its neighbors. Instead, it fought two expansionist world wars. In both, it violated the rules for continental empire by fighting on multiple fronts against multiple great powers. The wars, far from cementing Germany\u2019s dominance, delayed its rise by generations at a massive cost in both lives and wealth across Europe.\nLikewise, Japan prospered under a maritime trading order. Then, in the 1930s, it adopted a continental paradigm and seized a large empire on the Asian mainland. As with Germany, its quest initially yielded territory but produced multiple enemies and military and economic overextension that destroyed both Japan and those it invaded. Postwar Japan then returned to a maritime paradigm of working through international organizations and under international law. This produced the Japanese economic miracle, in which a ruined country quickly became one of the world\u2019s richest. (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan had Cold War economic miracles thanks to the maritime system, as well.)\nOverextension was also central to the fall of the Soviet Union. That empire not only ingested Eastern Europe at the end of World War II; it imposed an economic model conducive to dictatorial rule but not to economic growth. It then expanded this program to as much of the developing world as possible. Ultimately, the lethargic Soviet economy could not sustain Moscow\u2019s imperial adventures and impracticable projects.\nIn World War I, every European power, including the United Kingdom, pursued continental strategies that required using massive armies to establish diverse empires with overlapping territory. Each state had different primary adversaries and primary theaters, even within each alliance system. This produced a series of uncoordinated, parallel wars. The European powers, including the United Kingdom, also struggled because they allowed army officers to oversee the war effort with inadequate input from civilian leaders who had insights into the economic underpinnings of power. Army officers doubled down on stalemated offensives for months, wasting hundreds of thousands of young lives rather than owning up to the profligacy of their strategy.\nArguably, no European country fully recovered from its World War I losses. The war destroyed the continental empires that had insisted on fighting it\u2014Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Russia. Despite their victory, France and the United Kingdom were worse off afterward. The United States emerged disgusted by European entanglements, paving the way for the original America Firsters, who enacted tariffs that deepened the Great Depression and set the stage for a world war rerun. By contrast, during the long peace between the Napoleonic Wars and World War I, Europe\u2019s affluence compounded. Likewise, when the United States followed the maritime paradigm to win World War II, unprecedented prosperity ensued. Unlike after World War I, Washington did not recede into isolationism. Instead, it assumed the mantle of leadership by helping partners rebuild and acting as the guarantor of an international system it created in cooperation with its postwar allies to preserve peace. These institutions succeeded in Europe until Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.\nTHE DOGS OF WAR\nMost countries are geographically continental. They lack an oceanic moat completely insulating them from threats. Only the maritime rules-based order offers such states full protection. Institutions and alliance systems integrate the diverse capabilities of the many to contain the threats from the few. They are the insurance program for the rules-based order. They cannot eliminate dangers altogether, but if members coordinate to maximize their economic growth and constrain the continentalists, they can minimize risks.\nBut the world still has many committed continentalists. Putin has made it clear he intends to expand Russia\u2019s borders. His initial objective is control over Ukraine, the hors d\u2019oeuvre before the main course. \u201cThere\u2019s an old rule that wherever a Russian soldier sets foot, that\u2019s ours,\u201d Putin said, laying out his menu. It features, at a minimum, central and eastern Europe, which Soviet troops occupied after World War II. His statement may also portend visions of power over Paris, which Russian troops reached at the end of the Napoleonic Wars.\nAs during the first Cold War, Moscow wants to break apart the West both from without and from within. Ever since the Bolshevik Revolution, Russians have excelled at propaganda. They used it to successfully market communism around the world, costing many countries decades of growth. Now, Russia is using propaganda to spread the fiction that NATO threatens Russia rather than the reverse. (NATO countries do not covet Moscow\u2019s territory; they want Russia to deal with its domestic dystopian mess and become a constructive member of the international system.)\nTrading rules have minimized bottlenecks, reducing costs.\nSocial media has radically increased Russia\u2019s ability to sow discord abroad, which it does by stoking hatred on both sides of divisive issues. Moscow has sought to transform the war in Ukraine into a wedge issue that divides the United States from Europe and different European states from each other, weakening both NATO and the EU. It helped promote Brexit, which has eroded the United Kingdom\u2019s ties with the continent. It helped create massive migrant flows by supporting the dictator Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces during the Syrian civil war and now by destabilizing Africa, sending refugees pouring into Europe. These inflows have been profoundly destabilizing, facilitating the rise of the continent\u2019s isolationist right.\nOther continental powers also wish to overturn the present global order. North Korea wants control of the entire Korean Peninsula, eliminating South Korea. Iran\u2019s primary theater is the Middle East, where Tehran seeks to extend its influence over Gaza, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria.\nThen there is China. The country\u2019s decision to integrate into the current world order in pursuit of wealth suggested that, despite its authoritarian government, it might be adopting a maritime outlook. It even built a large navy. But Beijing cannot reliably deploy that navy in wartime because of the narrow, shallow, island-cluttered, enclosed seas that surround its coasts. This makes it much like Germany, which built large navies it could not reliably use in either world war. The United Kingdom blockaded the narrow North Sea and Baltic Sea, eliminating Germany\u2019s merchant traffic and reducing its naval traffic mainly to submarines. In World War II, Berlin required the long French and Norwegian coastlines for more reliable egress for its submarines, but that was still insufficient for its navy, let alone its merchant marine. China is even more reliant on trade and imports than Germany was then, particularly energy and food. The economic bottlenecks from a shutdown of its oceanic trade would debilitate its economy.\nAs Ukraine has demonstrated with its sinking of Russian ships, drones can close narrow seas. China has 13 landward neighbors and seven seaward neighbors, and no shortage of disagreements with them. With submarines, shore artillery, drones, and planes, these neighbors can shut down China\u2019s merchant traffic and make its naval passage perilous. Many of its close coastal neighbors, by contrast, do not need to traverse the South China Sea to reach the open ocean\u2014Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand, as well as Taiwan, all have alternative coastlines on the open seas, making them difficult to blockade.\nLike Russia, China retains a continental outlook. In addition to territorial claims on Japan and the Philippines, and its threat to use force to take all of Taiwan, Beijing seeks territory from Bhutan, India, and Nepal. When Chinese citizens list their historic lands, they either name the Mongol Yuan dynasty, which extended all the way to Hungary, or the Manchu Qing empire, which encompassed the lands the Belt and Road Initiative is now peeling away from the Russian sphere of influence. The Chinese still have two names for themselves, either \u201cthe central kingdom\u201d or the even more grandiose \u201call under Heaven\u201d\u2014a complete world order unto itself and all the lands it conquers.\nBeijing, unlike Moscow, has not yet launched outright wars of aggression. But China is waging financial war with its predatory Belt and Road Initiative loans, which leave recipients massively indebted. It is conducting cyberwarfare, hacking into other countries\u2019 critical infrastructure and stealing their secrets. It engages in resource warfare by limiting rare-earth mineral exports, ecological warfare by damming Southeast Asia\u2019s Mekong River and South Asia\u2019s Yarlung Tsangpo River, and drug warfare by flooding the United States with fentanyl. It has even dabbled in irregular warfare, with incursions into Indian territory that killed Indian soldiers. This is a continental recipe for overextension.\nAVERTING CATASTROPHE\nTo confront the continentalists, the United States and its allies do not need to reinvent the wheel. The strategy that won the previous Cold War remains equally serviceable today. It begins with a recognition that this struggle\u2014like the last\u2014will be protracted. Rather than attempting a rapid resolution, which could have triggered nuclear war, the victors in the first Cold War managed the conflict for several generations. The same advice applies today: the maritime powers must be patient and keep the current conflict cold. They should particularly avoid hot wars in theaters lacking adequate maritime access, in states surrounded by hostile countries likely to intervene, and in states where the local population is broadly unwilling to provide assistance. These characteristics applied to Afghanistan and Iraq, and help explain Washington\u2019s unsuccessful conflicts there.\nInstead of fighting hot wars, the United States and its partners should leverage the great strength of the maritime world against the great weakness of the continentalists: their different capacities to generate wealth. They should exclude continentalists from the benefits of the maritime order by sanctioning them until they cease violating international law, put aside warfare, and embrace diplomacy. Unlike tariffs, which are taxes on imports to protect domestic producers, sanctions make targeted transactions illegal to penalize malign actors. Even porous sanctions, which shave growth rates by a percentage point or two, can produce devastating, long-term compounding effects\u2014as a comparison of sanctioned North Korea and unsanctioned South Korea illustrates. Sanctions are a form of economic chemotherapy. They may not eliminate the tumor, but they will, at a minimum, slow its progress. They can be particularly effective at setting back technological development, as the Soviets experienced.\nWashington and its partners should accommodate states that are not revisionists. The victors in the last Cold War understood that alliances are additive. Partners bring new capabilities that can help overwhelm enemies. Institutions then mobilize expertise to provide services and prevent problems that can help member states combat the continentalists. The United States should thus strengthen and expand its network. It should focus on maintaining not just its own prosperity but also that of its partners, so they can gang up on the bullies. Alliance systems should also aid those beset by the continentalists, whose resistance weakens their enemies. Just as the West armed Moscow\u2019s enemies until the Soviet Union withdrew from its war against Afghanistan, the West must now aid Ukraine for as long as it takes. The longer the Ukraine conflict continues, the weaker Moscow will become, opening itself up to possible Chinese predation.\nShould Russia\u2019s current regime fall, the resulting succession struggle will force it to reduce its foreign commitments\u2014as occurred with the Soviet Union during the Korean War, when Joseph Stalin\u2019s death led to that conflict\u2019s rapid conclusion. Should any of the continentalists cease coveting other countries\u2019 territory and instead peacefully contribute to improving international laws and institutions, then the United States and its partners should welcome them into the rules-based order. But if these countries do not change, containment is the answer. Washington prevailed in its earlier showdown with Moscow not with a dramatic military victory but by prospering while the Soviet Union endured an economic decline of its own making. In the 1980s, while Soviets waited in line for basic goods, Americans took family vacations. The present U.S. objective should be to keep other democracies and partners prospering while weakening the continentalists. The latter powers may not go away any time soon, but if they cannot match the economic growth rates of those upholding the maritime order, the relative threat will shrink.\nOWN GOALS\nThe stakes of the clash between the continental order and the maritime, rules-based order have never been so high. There are many nuclear powers, and the United States is increasingly unwilling to act as the ultimate guarantor of the present global system by supporting allies and extending its nuclear umbrella. If the conflicts in Ukraine, across Africa, and between Israel and Iran expand and merge, a catastrophic third world war might ensue. Unlike in the previous ones, everyone would be vulnerable to nuclear strikes and their toxic fallout.\nThe United States has already taken major steps to defeat its continental adversaries. It has imposed strict sanctions and export controls. It has funded and armed the countries facing down shared antagonists. But critics of the rules-based order are gathering strength. They see the system\u2019s many imperfections but not its even more important benefits\u2014including the catastrophes the rules avert. The rules-based order benefits individuals, businesses, and governments not only by facilitating trade flows but also by deterring malign behavior. Unfortunately, people rarely appreciate a disaster averted.\nToday, even top U.S. officials are critical of the present order. Over the last year, Washington has gravitated toward a continental approach. The United States will always have its natural moats\u2014the Atlantic and the Pacific\u2014to protect the mainland. But it also shares long borders with Canada and Mexico, and Washington is picking fights with both. It has berated numerous friendly democracies, levied tariffs on trading partners, and paralyzed international institutions that facilitate global economic growth by setting and enforcing the rules of the road. Musings from Washington about absorbing Canada, seizing Greenland from Denmark, and retaking the Panama Canal will, at a minimum, permanently alter Canadian and European shopping choices and vacation plans. At worst, they will rupture Western alliances.\nOverextension was central to the fall of the Soviet Union.\nBad strategy could transform the United States from the essential power to the irrelevant power, as former partners form new alliances that exclude Washington. Such a shift would take time, but if it happens, the changes will be enduring. Europeans will grow stronger together, leaving the United States weaker and alone. In the worst-case scenario, Washington could become a shared primary adversary for China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, with no allies left to help it. But even short of that, it may have to compete with Beijing on its own. If so, it may struggle to prevail. China has nearly three times as many people as does the United States and a much larger manufacturing base. It has nuclear weapons that can reach the American homeland, and might not have moral qualms about using them. The United States could also become less queasy about deploying its arsenal. If a state is about to lose a great-power conflict, after all, it may be incentivized to go nuclear, transforming a bilateral catastrophe into a global one.\nFor Washington, a scenario that leaves it alone and defeated would be a tragic conclusion to the last 80 years. At the end of World War II, it had earned friends across the globe. But that moral capital, gained at great cost, is being squandered. Like Napoleon\u2019s France avant tout, the recent reversion to America First is antagonizing allies everywhere. Undoubtedly, Washington\u2019s enemies would relish seeing the United States brought low.\nToo many Americans have taken the benefits of the maritime order for granted and harped on its imperfections, frittering away their many geographic and historical advantages in the process. Like the oxygen around them, they will miss the global order should it disappear. As the Athenian leader Pericles lamented long ago on the eve of a succession of Athenian mistakes that permanently ended that city\u2019s preeminence, \u201cI am more afraid of our own blunders than of the enemy\u2019s devices.\u201d\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

Since its inception in 1979, the Islamic Republic has not wavered in its anti-Americanism, and the United States has unfailingly responded by exerting greater pressure on Iran. The two have come close to outright conflict before. In 1987 and 1988, the United States destroyed offshore oil platforms and Iranian naval vessels and then mistakenly shot down an Iranian passenger plane. Iran interpreted those acts as the opening salvos of an undeclared war. Washington\u2019s attention, however, soon turned to Iraq and the Gulf War. But the hostility between Iran and the United States persisted and has only become more pronounced in the decades that have followed the 9/11 attacks. The 2020 killing of the Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, after a spate of Iranian provocations in the region, brought the two countries to the precipice. U.S. President Donald Trump pushed hostilities over the edge this year when the United States struck three Iranian nuclear sites with dozens of cruise missiles and 30,000-pound bombs.\nTehran and Washington seem to be implacable foes. The revolutionary regime in Iran has long cast the United States as its archenemy, the Great Satan that undermined the country\u2019s independence by backing a military coup in 1953 and the authoritarian excesses of the monarchy that followed. In 1979, the revolution\u2019s leaders worried that the United States would continue to interfere in Iran and stymie the great transformation underway. To prevent that outcome, the Islamic Republic decided that the United States should be extricated not just from Iran but from the broader Middle East. These assumptions set Tehran\u2019s foreign policy on a collision course with Washington. Iran has supported states and militant groups around the region with the aim of threatening the United States and its Israeli and Arab allies. In turn, the United States has pursued a strategy of containment and pressure that has included U.S.-led regional alliances, U.S. military bases, and a tight noose of sanctions suffocating Iran\u2019s economy. Finally, this year, that strategy widened to include overt American strikes on Iranian territory.\nMany observers perceive this history as a single, unbroken thread of conflict and hostility stretching from 1979 to the present. And yet today\u2019s hostility was not inevitable. More peaceful paths were possible, and indeed, with the right decisions in Tehran and Washington, Iran and the United States could still find ways to lower tensions and even normalize their relations. On several occasions in the twenty-first century alone, Iran and the United States had the opportunity to climb down from their mutual hostility. At each juncture, however, American or Iranian policymakers chose to foreclose those possible openings. But that history of missed chances does not condemn the two countries to a future of ever-deeper conflict. Instead, it offers a reminder that even today, Iran and the United States may yet be able to reconcile.\nThe 12-day war has demonstrably weakened Iran. Tehran\u2019s strategy is no longer sustainable in the wake of the battering that it has suffered. In this moment, Washington could continue boxing Iran into a corner and allow Israel to occasionally \u201cmow the grass,\u201d striking Iranian nuclear and military targets to keep punishing the country and block any progress toward building a bomb. Or it could see the aftermath of the 12-day war as an opportunity to engage in that fitful American pastime when it comes to Iran: diplomacy. Now, Washington has the chance to set its relations with Tehran on a different path, to pursue fresh bargains that could change both Iran\u2019s foreign and nuclear policies and the balance of power within Iran\u2019s ruling establishment. The U.S. and Iranian governments have failed to take those turnings before, but even now, policymakers should not be fatalistic. The past, no matter how freighted with lost opportunities, need not be prologue.\nA FALSE DAWN IN AFGHANISTAN\nFor at least a little while after 9/11, it seemed possible that relations between Iran and the United States could improve. Both Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Mohammad Khatami condemned the terrorist attacks, and Iranians held candlelit vigils in the streets of major cities and observed moments of silence in soccer stadiums. The strategic interests of Iran and the United States were suddenly aligned. Reeling from the assault, the United States maintained as its most urgent priority the elimination of al-Qaeda. Iran\u2019s Shiite clerical regime viewed the Sunni radicalism of al-Qaeda and its hosts, the Taliban, with deep concern. Only three years earlier, in 1998, the Taliban had killed up to 11 Iranian diplomats and journalists in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif, an atrocity that spurred Iran to mobilize troops on its border with Afghanistan. After years of antagonism, Iranian and U.S. officials found that they had some goals in common.\nIran had long backed the Taliban\u2019s principal foes, the Northern Alliance. Only days before the 9/11 attacks, al-Qaeda operatives posing as journalists killed Ahmad Shah Masoud, the Northern Alliance\u2019s legendary leader, an assassination that signaled an imminent Taliban offensive to wipe out the Northern Alliance once and for all and consolidate control of Afghanistan. Shiite Iran feared the regional ascendance of Sunni radicalism in the form of the puritanical Taliban, an ambitious al-Qaeda, and other militant factions, as well as further instability on its eastern border\u2014Iran was then, and remains now, home to many Afghan refugees. Some estimates in recent years have placed the figure as high as eight million, roughly ten percent of the population.\nThrough forms of cooperation that seem incredible today, Iran abetted the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps offered intelligence assistance to the United States and provided logistical support, facilitating battlefield coordination with Northern Alliance forces. U.S. diplomats Ryan Crocker and Zalmay Khalilzad attended meetings with Iranian counterparts and top IRGC officers, including senior commanders, possibly even Soleimani. Just over two months after the 9/11 attacks, the Taliban had been chased out of Kabul and other major cities. The Taliban\u2019s so-called emirate in Afghanistan was no more.\nIran and the United States could still normalize their relations.\nIran had a vested interest in shaping the government that would replace the Taliban. It worked closely with the United States at the Bonn conference in December 2001 that decided the future of Afghanistan. The two countries shared the same goals of crafting a new political order in Afghanistan that would unite and stabilize it through an inclusive democratic government. James Dobbins, who led the U.S. efforts at the conference, later credited his Iranian counterpart, the diplomat Javad Zarif, for building the consensus among all Afghan factions over forging a new constitution and holding democratic elections to form a new government in Kabul. And Zarif in turn credited Soleimani, the Revolutionary Guards commander, for securing compromises from the Northern Alliance to facilitate agreement in Bonn.\nIn retrospect, this rare collaboration was an opportunity to improve relations between Iran and the United States. Working together in Afghanistan could have served as a significant confidence-building measure, as well as the impetus for the de-escalation of tensions and then potentially even the gradual normalization of relations. Success in Afghanistan could have placed the relationship on a different course.\nThat did not come to pass. In January 2002, almost immediately after the Bonn conference, Israel intercepted an Iranian arms shipment to Hamas. For Iran, cooperation with the United States in Afghanistan did not constitute a reorientation of Iranian strategy that would apply to all aspects of Iran\u2019s regional policy. What happened in Afghanistan was just a tentative opening that had yet to fully bear fruit; Tehran would not so quickly reverse its Middle East policy, and it would still build up its proxies. U.S. President George W. Bush signaled outrage and alarm. He then decided against using the opening in Afghanistan to embrace Iran and gently push for change in its regional policy. Instead, he cast Iran as an implacable enemy and dispensed with the goodwill generated by developments in Afghanistan. In his State of the Union address in January 2002, Bush famously included Iran among the members of the \u201caxis of evil.\u201d\nFresh from what seemed a swift and sure victory in Afghanistan, a buoyant Washington devoted its energies to the prosecution of the so-called war on terror. And in that war, Iran could only be a target, not an ally; its cooperation in Afghanistan no longer counted for much. After all, as many U.S. officials believed, Islamist ideology became a global phenomenon because of the success of Iran\u2019s revolution in 1979 (never mind that the Iranian regime\u2019s resolute Shiism separated it from the Sunni militancy of groups such as al-Qaeda). Islamism, according to this view, would not be defeated until the Islamic Republic had been toppled. After the U.S. invasion of Iraq, in March 2003, many Iranians feared that it was only a matter of time before American forces came for them. In the words of Hassan Kazemi Qomi, Iran\u2019s first ambassador to Baghdad following the U.S. invasion and the fall of Iraq\u2019s ruler Saddam Hussein, \u201cAfter Iraq was Iran\u2019s turn.\u201d So Iran tried to placate the United States. In May 2003, Khatami, the country\u2019s reformist president, sent Washington a proposal for talks and a road map to resolve \u201call outstanding issues between the two countries,\u201d including, notably, Iran\u2019s nascent nuclear program and its broader policy in the Middle East. The White House did not even acknowledge receiving the offer.\nThe rebuff led the Islamic Republic to harden its positions and prepare itself for conflict. In stark contrast to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, the U.S. invasion of Iraq produced no opening with Iran, but rather placed the two countries at odds. With good reason, given the number of Bush administration officials who viewed Tehran as a grave threat, Iran believed it had to protect itself. In the chaos that followed the fall of Saddam, Iran possibly partnered with Syria to deepen the quagmire that the United States now faced in Iraq. The Sunni insurgency, supported by Syria, and the Shiite militias, supported by Iran, battled U.S. forces. As violence consumed Iraq, the American project there was doomed to failure.\nIranian leaders thus averted what they feared most: a triumphant U.S. military in Iraq continuing its campaign east into Iran. But American views of Iran only grew darker. Iran, for its part, concluded that it could best manage the American threat by bogging down U.S. resources in various theaters around the Middle East. Exhausted by protracted conflict, the United States would grow weary of the region and not seek war with Iran. Washington\u2019s decision to pull forces out of Iraq in 2011 seemed to vindicate this line of Iranian thinking. The more U.S. officials talked of leaving the region, the more Iran saw wisdom in its strategy.\nThis strategy also had the effect of transforming the balance of power within Iran. The security forces at the forefront of the fight against Washington gained control of Iran\u2019s foreign policy. In the crucible of Iraq, the Quds Force, the expeditionary division of the IRGC that oversees unconventional military and intelligence operations, grew from one of its smallest units into an expansive regional force that would dominate Iran\u2019s foreign policy decision-making. The Quds Force commanders, Soleimani and his deputy Esmail Qaani, had worked with U.S. counterparts in Afghanistan in 2001. During the Iraq war, they would turn the force into a military network to battle the United States across the Middle East.\nBREAKOUT OR BREAKTHROUGH?\nThe false dawn in relations with the United States after the 9/11 attacks convinced Iranian leaders that Washington would never be willing to accommodate revolutionary Iran. Tehran understood U.S. policies, including the building of military bases in Afghanistan, the Persian Gulf, and Central Asia and the strengthening of sanctions on the Iranian economy, as all aimed at engineering regime change in Tehran. In the immediate aftermath of the Iraq war, Iran\u2019s rulers surmised that they had to resist and deter the United States through enacting aggressive regional policies, building a nuclear program, and strengthening Iran\u2019s drone and missile capabilities. The country\u2019s economy, state institutions, and politics had to be organized in the service of that resistance.\nAnother revelation had further poisoned the well: Iran\u2019s desire to acquire nuclear weapons. Its nuclear program had come to light as the United States was preparing for the Iraq war. At the time, after the inclusion of Iran in the \u201caxis of evil,\u201d U.S.-Iranian relations were already on a downward slope. The discovery of a clandestine nuclear program only increased the prospect of conflict. Iran assumed that the United States would make this nuclear program a casus belli, as it had in its justification of the invasion of Iraq. Washington, for its part, did not want a member of the \u201caxis of evil\u201d to acquire nuclear capabilities. But by the end of the Bush administration in 2009, U.S. officials had grown disinterested in military solutions to their Iran problem as the United States continued to founder in Iraq. Diplomacy, not war, would have to contain Iranian nuclear ambitions. And so opened another opportunity for Iran and the United States to edge away from conflict toward a more peaceful relationship.\nThe United States could have taken this path sooner. In 2003, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom negotiated a deal with Iran that would have halted the growth of its still small nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The Bush administration forced the deal to collapse in 2004, insisting that Iran give up the entirety of its nuclear program and offering no concessions in return.\nNuclear diplomacy should be the floor, not the ceiling, of the relationship.\nIn hindsight, the veto proved a mistake. Unconstrained, Iran\u2019s nuclear program continued to expand as the anti-American bombast and Holocaust denial of the new Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, made diplomacy much more difficult. Tehran also grew further convinced that Washington was not interested in meaningful diplomatic engagement, even on the nuclear issue. Iran\u2019s chief nuclear negotiator in 2003, Hassan Rouhani, would try his hand at nuclear diplomacy when he became president in 2013, after he succeeded Ahmadinejad. But in 2004, he and other Iranian leaders concluded that the United States had so swiftly dismissed the European-negotiated deal because Iran\u2019s program was too small to be worthy of American diplomacy and concessions. Iran would need a much bigger program to compel the United States to the negotiating table. That presumption undergirded Iranian activities during the Obama, first Trump, and Biden administrations. And at each turn, failure to forge a lasting nuclear deal would only encourage Iran to expand its program even more.\nHad Washington supported the European effort, Iran\u2019s nuclear program would likely have remained small, and the deal itself might have had transformative consequences. It could have led Tehran to fear Washington less, and as a result, Iran would then have behaved differently in Iraq and not so readily courted American enmity. Instead, the U.S. veto further convinced Tehran that its reading of American intentions was correct. Washington would be impressed only by might. To deter the United States, Iran had to both build a larger nuclear program and widen its asymmetric warfare in Iraq and beyond.\nIran was right to assume that a larger nuclear program would change Washington\u2019s calculations. By 2011, Iran\u2019s program had grown significantly, and although estimates vary, it was still not close to the breakout stage. That failed to reassure Israel. Spooked by the pace of Iran\u2019s progress, Israel threatened to attack Iran to prevent it from getting any closer to a bomb. But the last thing the Obama administration wanted was entanglement in another Middle Eastern war. It determined that the only way to stop Iran from becoming a nuclear power was through diplomacy.\nPresident Barack Obama paved the way for negotiations by first increasing economic sanctions on Iran in 2010 but then adopting a different tone, making it clear to Tehran that Washington was not seeking regime change. Obama understood that sweeping ultimatums and coercion would not get Iran to dispense with its nuclear program. The United States thus agreed to negotiate limits on Iran\u2019s program in exchange for sanctions relief.\nFor their part, Iran\u2019s rulers were conflicted about Obama\u2019s offer. The IRGC and its political allies were skeptical that the Obama administration would differ much from its predecessor. They thought diplomacy would not yield meaningful results but would signal weakness and divert attention from the threat that the United States posed to Iran. But a moderate faction, led by Rouhani, who became president in 2013, argued that successful diplomacy with the United States would lower tensions, ease pressure on Iran\u2019s economy, and reset relations between the two countries. This faction hoped that diplomacy would yield the positive outcomes that had eluded Iran in its prior attempts at rapprochement with the United States: its cooperation in Afghanistan in 2001, its offer of talks in 2003, and the nuclear deal signed with Europe in 2003 but scotched after Washington refused to go along with it.\nTwo years of intense talks followed among Iran, China, Russia, the United States, and the three European powers that had negotiated the prior deal. They culminated in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. In exchange for sanctions relief, the JCPOA placed strict limits on the scope of Iran\u2019s nuclear activities for at least a decade and subjected those activities to stringent international inspections. There has been much debate since on whether the deal effectively curbed Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and whether the United States could have made sterner demands on Iran at the negotiating table\u2014a doubt echoed in Tehran by the deal\u2019s detractors there who believed that Iran had given too much away in exchange for too little. But the deal did roll back Iran\u2019s program, and in 11 separate reports, the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, attested to Iran\u2019s compliance with the terms of the JCPOA. The JCPOA was significant in another important way: it represented a breakthrough in U.S.-Iranian relations. After decades of hostility, the United States and Iran had finally concluded a deal and, at least as far as Iran was concerned, successfully implemented it.\nThe JCPOA was a major accomplishment in trust building. Had it lasted, the deal could have served as the basis for subsequent agreements on Iran\u2019s nuclear and missile programs and its regional policies. The relaxation of sanctions on the Iranian economy could have changed political dynamics within Tehran by strengthening the hand of moderate factions reliant on middle-class votes and weakening the influence of conservatives and hard-liners in foreign policy decisions. In time, relations between Iran and the United States could have moved toward greater normalization.\nAnd yet the deal did not deliver the widening thaw that some of its proponents hoped for. Agreeing to the JCPOA did not immediately change Iran\u2019s broader strategy. The IRGC and its political allies in the parliament and in powerful parastatal economic and political institutions thought that despite the diplomatic breakthrough, there was no evidence of fundamental change in U.S.-Iranian relations. The United States still posed an urgent threat and had made no effort to change that perception. Hard-liners in Tehran pointed to the furious domestic opposition to the JCPOA in the United States as proof that U.S. policy toward Iran would remain unchanged. In the months following the signing of the deal, Washington dragged its feet in lifting sanctions on Tehran, and that steadily soured the mood in Iran. Iranian hard-liners argued that it had all been a ruse to strip Iran of its nuclear assets, making it vulnerable to U.S.-backed regime change. Iran should therefore continue with those regional policies\u2014such as its commitment to supporting the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, the Houthi rebellion in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and various militias in Iraq\u2014that since 2003 had been indispensable in deterring American aggression.\nThe convulsions of the Arab Spring further complicated Iran\u2019s calculus. Tehran saw the popular unrest that swept across the Arab world as a new opportunity to expand its regional footprint. That opportunity came with new dangers. The fall of Assad in Syria, an Iranian ally, would have been a significant strategic loss. It would have isolated and weakened Iran\u2019s Lebanese proxy Hezbollah. A resurgent Sunni government in Syria backed by Western powers and other Arab powers could have rolled back Iran\u2019s gains in Iraq, too. Iran sensed that the United States was trying to hack off the tentacles of the octopus\u2014before chopping off its head in Tehran. Iran\u2019s rulers, particularly the IRGC and its political allies, concluded that the real aim of American efforts to topple Assad was the end of the Islamic Republic. The IRGC would resist that outcome at all costs. As its commander in charge in Syria put it, \u201cWhat we lose in losing Syria exceeds what we have at stake in Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen.\u201d Iran thus forcefully intervened in Syria to save Assad starting in 2011, and in the same year also threw its full support behind Houthi forces in Yemen that had gained the upper hand in civil war there.\nIran did not cause the JCPOA to collapse. The United States did.\nTehran, in effect, chose a precarious balancing act: it shrank its nuclear program but protected and expanded its regional footprint in confrontation with the United States and its Arab allies, notably Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Those allies saw little benefit in the nuclear deal but had much to fear from Iran\u2019s regional power play. They wanted the United States to focus on containing Iran\u2019s regional influence rather than just the country\u2019s nuclear program. They joined hands with Israel, which also opposed U.S. diplomacy with Iran, to lobby against the JCPOA in Washington almost as soon as the deal was signed in 2015. These efforts were rewarded when Trump formally removed the United States from the JCPOA in 2018.\nIran\u2019s foreign policy between 2014 and 2018 was deeply conflicted. In the words of Zarif, the foreign minister during that period, Iran was paralyzed by a struggle between diplomacy and the battlefield\u2014the latter being his euphemism for the IRGC and its regional strategy\u2014and it suffered for \u201cfavoring the battlefield over diplomacy.\u201d For its part, U.S. policy fixated on the actions of the Revolutionary Guards rather than on what nuclear diplomacy had just achieved. Washington did not consider then the possibility of using success at the negotiating table as the basis for influencing Tehran\u2019s regional posture. It succumbed to the idea that the JCPOA was insufficient because it had not encompassed Iran\u2019s regional policies. Rather than abandon diplomacy to punish Iran for its regional behavior, the United States could have held on to its diplomatic gains even as it pushed back against Iran\u2019s regional policies. In other words, it could have stayed in the JCPOA and used that leverage to pursue a further deal that would have curtailed Iranian aggression in the region.\nIf the United States had followed this path, Iran\u2019s nuclear program would have remained limited by the parameters established by the JCPOA; even after Israeli and American bombing, Iran\u2019s nuclear program is probably much closer to breakout than it was in the past decade, at least in terms of know-how and the ability to rebuild an advanced program. The longer the deal had stayed in effect, the more trust it would have built between Iran and the United States, which Washington could then have used to influence Tehran\u2019s regional behavior.\nA successful nuclear deal could have lowered Iranian perceptions of a threat from the United States. That, in turn, would have allowed Iran to roll back its troublesome regional activities and even discuss limits on its missile program. The economic gains that would have come with remaining in the JCPOA would have convinced Iran to comply with the deal and not use the cover of diplomacy for further provocations. Despite frustration in Tehran with the slow pace of sanctions relief, Iran did not cause the JCPOA to collapse. The United States did. That remains the most significant lost opportunity for repairing relations between the two countries.\nA FATEFUL WITHDRAWAL\nThe disintegration of the JCPOA drastically escalated tensions between Tehran and Washington. After scrapping the deal, Trump imposed intense sanctions on Iran as part of a campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure.\u201d The stated aim of that campaign was to force Iran back to the negotiating table. But Iran perceived Trump\u2019s ploy as nothing short of a bid to bring about regime change by strangling the country\u2019s economy and degrading its state institutions to encourage popular rebellion. Iran responded by vigorously resuming nuclear activity, enriching uranium beyond levels allowed by the JCPOA. It also took more aggressive actions across the Middle East in 2019, starting with an attack on oil tankers in the waters of the United Arab Emirates in May, then the downing of a U.S. drone in June, and then an attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia in September. This escalation of violence spurred a seismic event: Trump ordered the killing of Soleimani, the Quds Force commander, in January 2020, while the general was in Iraq. His death outraged Iranians. The Islamic Republic retaliated by striking a military base in Iraq that housed American troops. Iran and the United States then stood on the brink of war. In under five years, the hope of a new opening in relations had given way to open conflict.\nThe election of Joe Biden as president in 2020 and the return of a Democratic administration in 2021 could have halted the spiraling tensions. During the campaign, Democratic candidates, including Biden, had signaled their willingness to revive the JCPOA. Once in office, however, Biden demurred. Rather than revert to the Obama-era policy, he embraced Trump\u2019s position of maximum pressure. The administration insisted that Iran had to first fulfill all its obligations under the JCPOA, and only then would the United States consider returning to the deal. In the meantime, maximum pressure sanctions would remain in place. The early months of the Biden administration coincided with the tail end of Rouhani\u2019s presidency. Rouhani and his team had been architects of the JCPOA and wanted to see it restored. But they did not find a willing partner in Biden. What Tehran saw was continuity; Biden, like his predecessor, wanted regime change in Iran.\nThe United States did agree to talks with Iran in Vienna in April 2021. But by then, Iran had concluded that there would be no real change in U.S. policy. Iranian leaders announced that the country would start enriching uranium to 60 percent purity. The escalation was alarming because it would bring Iran much closer to breakout. In the face of this threat, the Biden administration changed course to put greater emphasis on talks with Iran, discussing concrete steps that would bring the United States back into the JCPOA and remove sanctions on Iran in exchange for its full compliance with its obligations under the deal. By then, however, the Rouhani presidency was at its end. He was soon to be replaced by a hard-line opponent of the JCPOA, Ebrahim Raisi.\nIt was in this context that Iran decided to back Russia\u2019s full-scale war on Ukraine in 2022. Iran had developed close intelligence and military ties with Russia during the Syrian civil war (Russia also took the side of Assad), but it now saw its strategic partnership with Moscow as vital to surviving determined American efforts to isolate and crush the Islamic Republic. This support for Russia, in turn, alienated Europe and gave Washington even more reason to pressure Tehran. U.S.-Iranian relations thus became entangled with the United States\u2019 and Europe\u2019s clash with an expansionist Russia. Had the Biden administration concluded a deal with Iran before Russia attacked Ukraine, Tehran would have seen too much at stake in its relations with Europe to contemplate helping Russia in Ukraine. But since Biden was not willing to break with Trump\u2019s policy to restore the deal agreed to by Obama, Iran decided it needed to strengthen its ties with Russia, and that in turn made the job of diplomacy all the more difficult. Both Iran and the United States trusted the other even less than before, and Washington had to contend with a more intractable Tehran. Indirect talks between Iran, the United States, and other JCPOA signatories could not produce a breakthrough. The Biden administration would not guarantee that a deal would last, since any agreement could be undone after a change of government, and the hard-liners at the helm in Tehran were unwilling to risk another U.S. withdrawal from a negotiated deal.\nFROM THE RUBBLE\nIn the subsequent years, Iran\u2019s regional position has unraveled significantly. After the Hamas attacks on Israel in October 2023, Israel has systematically pummeled Iranian proxies in the region, doing serious damage to Hamas in Gaza and defanging Hezbollah in Lebanon. The collapse of Assad\u2019s regime, in December 2024, left Iran without one of its most useful regional allies and raised the prospect of the emergence of an anti-Iranian, Sunni-led Syria. In 2024 and 2025, Israeli forces struck deep into Iranian territory, exposing huge intelligence vulnerabilities in Iran\u2019s security establishment as well as the Islamic Republic\u2019s relative inability to hurt Israel with its arsenal of missiles and drones. And yet even after the devastation unleashed on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites by Trump, much remains unknown about the state of the Iranian nuclear program and the possibility that Iranian leaders, bludgeoned into a corner, could still scramble to develop a bomb.\nIf Trump does not want Iran to follow the example of North Korea and become a nuclear state\u2014and does not want to continue to go to war with Iran to prevent that outcome\u2014then his administration must look for a diplomatic solution. Iran, likewise, does not want war with the United States, and it cannot quickly or easily build an arsenal of nuclear weapons to deter Israeli and U.S. attacks. Tehran has little choice but to take diplomacy seriously. Iran and the United States have been at similar junctures before, picking between confrontation and compromise. The two countries should embrace diplomacy not only to conclude an urgent deal on Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities but also to build trust and chart a new course for their relations. Nuclear diplomacy should be just the beginning\u2014the floor, not the ceiling, of the relationship.\nThe Trump administration believes that the 12-day war has inflicted enough punishment on Iran to force true soul-searching among Iranian leaders. But if Tehran is to arrive at the right conclusions\u2014and feel able to relinquish its nuclear ambitions and its aggressive regional policy\u2014then it must see diplomacy as a credible path to realizing gains that have thus far eluded it. As unlikely as it may seem, Trump\u2019s bombing campaign could lead to a breakthrough, but only if both countries can put their history of missteps behind them and approach diplomacy with vision and patience.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

I didn\u2019t do any ceasefires. And I know that it might be good to have, but I can also understand strategically why one country or the other wouldn\u2019t want it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut we can work a deal where we\u2019re working on a peace deal while they\u2019re fighting,\u201d Trump added.\n\u201cThey have to fight.

came as he hosted Zelenskyy and top European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, at the White House for high-stakes talks on ending the conflict,

for a War that has been going on for almost four years,\u201d Trump said on his Truth Social platform.\n\u201cVice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, are coordinating with Russia and Ukraine.\u201d\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte separately confirmed that Putin had agreed to the bilateral meeting, but did not specify a date or location.\nZelenskyy, who described his meeting with Trump as a \u201cvery good conversation,\u201d told reporters that he was \u201cready\u201d to meet the Russian leader one-on-one.\nMoscow did not immediately confirm that it had agreed to a summit, but Russia\u2019s state-run TASS news agency cited presidential aide Yuri Ushakov as saying that Putin and Trump \u201cspoke in favour of continuing direct talks\u201d between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations.\nThe proposals for a summit, which would be the first meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy since Moscow\u2019s invasion, came as the fraught issue of security guarantees for Ukraine took centre stage during the talks at the White House.\nThe specifics of what those guarantees would look like remained unclear on Monday.\nAsked if the US could send peacekeepers to Ukraine, Trump said that European countries would be the \u201cfirst line of defence\u201d, but that Washington would provide \u201ca lot of help\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to help them out also, we\u2019re going to be involved,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump said on Truth Social later that discussions had focused on which security guarantees would be provided by European countries with \u201ccoordination\u201d by the US.\nZelenskyy said that the guarantees would be \u201cunpacked\u201d by Kyiv\u2019s partners and formalised within the next week to 10 days.\nWhile Trump has ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine, his special envoy, Witkoff, said on Sunday that Putin was open to a security guarantee resembling the 32-member alliance\u2019s collective defence mandate.\nUnder Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, an armed attack against any one NATO member nation is considered an attack on all members of the alliance.\nSpeaking on Fox News after Monday\u2019s talks, Rutte called Washington\u2019s commitment to be involved in guaranteeing Ukraine\u2019s security a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d, but said the exact nature of that involvement would be discussed over the coming days.\nRutte said the discussions had not touched on the possibility of deploying US or European troops.\n\u201cWhat we all agree on is that if this war does come to end\u2026 it has to be definitive,\u201d Rutte said.\nKonstantin Sonin, a Russian exile and Putin critic who is a professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, said that meaningful security guarantees for Kyiv would need to include European troops on the ground.\n\u201cThis is all \u2018unacceptable\u2019 to Putin, so for European leaders, it is the question how to persuade President Trump that without such guarantees, the war, even if it stops now, will start again in the near future,\u201d Sonin told Al Jazeera.\nSonin said that Ukraine had been failed by \u201cwritten\u201d guarantees for decades, including during Moscow\u2019s 2014 invasion and occupation of Crimea.\n\u201cRussia has signed many international treaties recognising Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and borders \u2013 including Putin himself signing one such treaty in 2004 \u2013 and still violated all of these treaties, both in 2014 and 2022,\u201d Sonin said.\n\u201cThis is all to say that the sticking point is not the language in some documents,\u201d he added.\nThe issue of what territory Kyiv might be asked to give up in a peace deal also remained unclear after the talks at the White House.\nAhead of the meeting, Trump warned that the return to Ukraine of Russian-occupied Crimea would be off the table in any negotiated settlement.\nTrump has indicated that a deal to end the war would involve \u201csome swapping, changes in land\u201d between Russia and Ukraine.\nRussia controls about one-fifth of Ukraine, according to open-source estimates. Ukraine, which took control of a large swath of Russia\u2019s Kursk region during a surprise counteroffensive last year, is not believed to hold any Russian territory at present.\nSpeaking on Fox News, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that both Moscow and Kyiv would have to make concessions for a deal.\n\u201cObviously, land or where you draw those lines \u2013 where the war stops \u2013 is going to be part of that conversation,\u201d Rubio said.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not easy, and maybe it\u2019s not even fair, but it\u2019s what it takes in order to bring about an end to a war.

It passed the Illinois Senate in April.\nThe legislation requires crypto companies and exchanges to maintain adequate financial resources, implement cybersecurity and anti-fraud measures, provide investment disclosures and follow customer service standards similar to traditional financial services.\n\u201cAt a time when fraudsters continue to evolve, and consumer protections are being eroded at the federal level, Illinois is sending a clear message that we won\u2019t tolerate taking advantage of our people and their hard-earned assets,\u201d Pritzker said.\nCrypto ATM regulations signed\nThe Illinois governor also signed The Digital Asset Kiosk Act (SB 2319), which specifically targets cryptocurrency kiosks or ATMs by requiring operators to register with state regulators, provide full refunds to scam victims, cap transaction fees at 18%, and limit daily transactions to $2,500 for new customers.\n\u201cThe people of Illinois deserve reliable, consistent safeguards, no matter the financial service they utilize for their hard-earned money,\u201d said Representative Edgar Gonzalez Jr.\nRelated: Coinbase faces lawsuit over alleged breaches of Illinois biometric privacy law\nAbout $272 million was lost in Illinois crypto fraud cases in 2024, making it the fifth-highest state nationwide for losses, according to the FBI.\nTrump tirade continues\nThe governor\u2019s office continued to attack Trump\u2019s crypto policies, saying that his administration had \u201cactively deregulated the crypto industry at a time when consumers are increasingly at risk of fraud.\u201d\nThey specifically cited Trump\u2019s April signing of a bill that overturned a revised rule from the Internal Revenue Service that expanded the definition of a broker to include decentralized finance exchanges.\nIllinois strategic Bitcoin reserve axed\nEarlier this year, the state quashed a bill suggesting it invest in Bitcoin\n.Illinois state Representative John Cabello introduced House Bill 1844 in January to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the state treasury to buy and hold the asset for five years.\nThe bill failed to pass voting at the committee level, according to Bitcoin Laws.\nMagazine: Coinbase calls for \u2018full-scale\u2019 alt season, Ether eyes $6K: Hodler\u2019s Digest", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 04:08:56 +0100", "author": "Cointelegraph by Martin Young", "source": "https://cointelegraph.com/rss", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "crypto.news", "title": "Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy loosens stock sale limits to sustain Bitcoin strategy", "url": "https://crypto.news/michael-saylor-strategy-stock-sale-limits-bitcoin-2025/", "text": "Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy loosens stock sale limits to sustain Bitcoin strategy\nMichael Saylor\u2019s Strategy Inc. is adjusting its financing playbook, easing restrictions on stock sales just weeks after pledging tighter rules.\n- Strategy Inc. eased its self-imposed limit on stock issuance, allowing sales even when its shares trade below the 2.5x Bitcoin holdings threshold.\n- The company added 430 BTC last week, bringing total holdings to 629,376 BTC with more than $26 billion in unrealized gains.\n- Despite strong Bitcoin reserves, Strategy\u2019s stock is down 22% since November, raising concerns over dilution and demand for its preferred equity program.\nAccording to an Aug. 18 report by Bloomberg, the change gives the Bitcoin-heavy company greater flexibility to raise funds as its share premium over Bitcoin (BTC) holdings narrows.\nStrategy\u2019s stock issuance rules shift\nPreviously, the company had promised not to issue new shares if its stock traded at less than 2.5 times the value of its Bitcoin holdings, a buffer Saylor termed the \u201cmNAV premium.\u201d That limit was intended to reassure investors concerned about dilution. Exceptions were only allowed to cover debt interest or preferred equity dividends.\nUnder the updated policy, Strategy will permit stock issuance below the 2.5x threshold \u201cwhen otherwise deemed advantageous to the company.\u201d Analysts like Brian Dobson of Clear Street said the additional language allows Saylor to be more opportunistic in financing Bitcoin purchases.\nThe shift comes as demand for the firm\u2019s preferred stock program, a novel perpetual equity product Saylor unveiled in July, faces uncertainty. Investor appetite has been tested by falling premiums on Strategy\u2019s shares and increasing competition from Bitcoin ETFs and other crypto-treasury firms.\nSlower purchases, strong holdings\nStrategy\u2019s pace of Bitcoin accumulation has moderated. The company disclosed on Aug. 18 that it bought 430 Bitcoin for $51.4 million in the prior week, following a 155 BTC purchase the week before. In total, Strategy now holds 629,376 BTC, acquired at an average price of $73,320. With Bitcoin trading near all-time highs around $119,666, the firm sits on more than $26 billion in unrealized gains.\nDespite these gains, Strategy\u2019s stock has fallen 22% since reaching a record in November, lagging Bitcoin\u2019s 23% rally over the same period. Short sellers like Jim Chanos have questioned whether the firm\u2019s four series of preferred stock offerings can offset reduced at-the-market equity sales.\nThe latest revision shows how quickly Saylor\u2019s bold financing strategy is being tested. While easing restrictions may reassure the company\u2019s ability to keep building its Bitcoin reserves, it also highlights investor concerns about dilution and long-term sustainability.", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 05:03:22 +0000", "author": "Leon Okwatch", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "crypto.news", "title": "Starknet v0.14.0 set to go live on mainnet Sep. 1", "url": "https://crypto.news/starknet-v0-14-0-upgrade-live-on-mainnet-2025/", "text": "Starknet v0.14.0 set to go live on mainnet Sep. 1\nStarknet is preparing to roll out one of its most significant upgrades yet, with version 0.14.0 scheduled for mainnet activation on Sep. 1.\n- Starknet v0.14.0 will activate on Sept. 1, bringing decentralized sequencing, pre-confirmations, and a new fee market.\n- The upgrade introduces faster transaction confirmation times, updated mempool design, and RPC 0.9.0 with improved statuses.\n- Recent developments include the launch of Extended DEX, Bitcoin staking proposals, and a July transition to STRK as the gas token.\nThe update, approved by community vote and confirmed in an Aug. 18 post on X, brings decentralized sequencing, faster confirmations, and a new fee market to the Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 network.\nDecentralized sequencing and pre-confirmations\nAt the core of v0.14.0 is the move toward decentralized sequencing. Using Tendermint consensus, the network will alternate between multiple independent sequencers instead of relying solely on one. This change improves censorship resistance, ensures fair transaction ordering, and boosts fault tolerance.\nTo improve user experience with sub-second latency, the upgrade also adds a new transaction status called \u201cpre-confirmations.\u201d This system offers smoother performance even under high network traffic, with the majority of transactions achieving near-final confirmation in less than a second.\nBlock times will remain between 4 to 6 seconds, but pre-confirmations allow users to see results much more quickly, making this upgrade a major step in lowering wait times for routine transactions.\nFee market and technical enhancements\nStarknet (STRK) v0.14.0 employs a fee structure based on Ethereum\u2019s EIP-1559, with a minimum base price for layer-2 gas set in FRI. This change reduces costs and increases predictability by cutting the connection between Ethereum gas prices and Starknet fees.\nAlong with adding new transaction statuses to RPC 0.9.0 and updating the mempool architecture, the release also makes multi-block processing possible to increase proving efficiency. The roadmap shows that future updates will progressively decentralize sequencer operations, even though StarkWare will still be in charge of them in this version.\nTo ensure a seamless migration, there will be a brief outage of roughly 15 minutes during the switch to v0.14.0, during which time transactions will be temporarily paused.\nRecent Starknet ecosystem developments\nThe upcoming upgrade follows a series of ecosystem milestones. Extended, a perpetual trading decentralized exchange with over 50 trading pairs and leverage of up to 100x, debuted on the Starknet mainnet on Aug. 12. . Earlier this month, the community voted on SNIP-31, a proposal introducing Bitcoin (BTC) staking through tokenized assets such as WBTC and tBTC.\nIn its July recap, Starknet announced improvements to its mempool, the launch of the fee market, faster block times, and a shift to sole support for V3 transactions using STRK as the gas token.\nAll of these advancements point to Starknet\u2019s drive for decentralization, scalability, and wider Ethereum rollup ecosystem adoption.", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 04:59:49 +0000", "author": "Leon Okwatch", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/",

value for customers via reduced friction.\u201d\nThe venture capitalists acknowledged the path toward mainstream acceptance of crypto and stablecoins has \u201ctaken longer than expected,\u201d but that path \u201cnow appears to be inevitable.\u201d\nPalihapitiya has mixed results with past SPACs\nPalihapitiya led several high-profile SPACs during 2020 and 2021, including successful mergers involving Social Capital Suvretta Holdings I and Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings V, now operating as SoFi Technologies.\nHowever, other SPACs led by Palihapitiya, such as Social Capital Suvretta Holdings II, III, and IV, were liquidated, giving him a mixed record.\nSPACs face challenges because they are bound by strict time limits to find a private company to merge with, often struggle to identify companies worthy of high valuations, and operate under considerable regulatory scrutiny.\nPalihapitiya once denounced crypto as dead in America\nThe naming of Palihapitiya\u2019s American-themed SPAC comes two years after he declared the crypto industry \u201cDead in America,\u201d pointing the finger at former SEC Chair Gary Gensler for pursuing dozens of high-profile lawsuits against crypto firms.\nRelated: Ether ETFs smash records as crypto products see $3.75B inflows\nCritics labeled Gensler\u2019s crackdown part of \u201cOperation Choke Point 2.0,\u201d an

Paul\u2019s bid to dismiss a proposed class-action lawsuit over his defunct non-fungible token (NFT) project CryptoZoo should be allowed, a Texas judge said.\nMagistrate Judge Ronald Griffin advised an Austin federal court on Thursday that the class group had not sufficiently tied Paul to their claims that they lost money by buying into the CryptoZoo project.\nThe recommendation could see a federal judge drop the suit unless the class group updates it.\nThe group is made up of CryptoZoo buyers who first sued Paul and others allegedly tied to the project in February 2023, alleging it was a \u201crug pull\u201d that promised perks which never materialized.\nStill, Griffin said the group should be allowed to amend all but one of its 27 claims against Paul. A claim alleging Paul committed commodity pool fraud should be permanently dismissed, the judge said.\n\u201cMental gymnastics\u201d needed for commodity pool fraud claim\nJudge Griffin said in his 75-page report that his recommendation to dismiss the lawsuit\u2019s commodity pool fraud claim came as the court \u201cdoes not follow Plaintiffs\u2019 logic.\u201d\nThe class group argued that CryptoZoo NFTs were an option contract as they started as \u201ceggs\u201d that \u201chatch\u201d into animals, which then can be bred with others to create hybrid animals that could be traded.\n\u201cIn other words, because purchasers buy CZ [CryptoZoo] NFTs unaware of their value until they hatch, and because the CZ NFT animals can be bred with others to create hybrid NFTs, an option contract is thereby formed,\u201d Judge Griffin wrote.\n\u201cThe mental gymnastics required to come to this conclusion are truly dizzying,\u201d he added. \u201cPlaintiffs do not explain \u2014 nor can the Court understand \u2014 how their purchases of CZ NFTs create option contracts or contracts for future delivery.\u201d\nOther claims fail to tie in Paul\nJudge Griffin said that the lawsuit failed to properly connect Paul to the 26 other claims made against him, saying they hadn\u2019t yet shown evidence that he directly and personally benefited from CryptoZoo\u2019s collapse.\nThe lawsuit brought claims of fraud, unjust enrichment, negligence, breach of contract, fraud conspiracy, aiding and abetting fraud and breaches of consumer law in multiple states, among others.\nJudge Griffin said in some cases the complaint gave \u201conly fragments of facts accompanied by vague attributions of conduct to \u2018Defendants\u2019\u201d or looked to \u201cjam together two pieces of different puzzles in the vain hope of producing a final, cohesive product.\u201d\nThe judge added, \u201cUnfortunately, the caselaw does not support this tactic.\u201d\nPaul refunded CryptoZoo buyers\nThe class group sued Paul and CryptoZoo co-founders Eduardo Ibanez and Jake Greenbaum in 2021, and Paul alleged in January 2024 that the duo conned him, causing CryptoZoo\u2019s collapse, which Judge Griffin urged the court in July to rebuff.\nRelated: Digital Currency Group sues subsidiaries over $1.1B promissory note\nIn January 2023, Paul promised to make a plan for

This move is expected to enhance Bitdeer's competitive position and unlock substantial value for its customers and shareholders.\nChallenges and Strategic Adjustments\nDespite its growth, Bitdeer faced challenges such as increased costs of revenue, which surged to $142.8 million, primarily due to heightened costs associated with SEALMINER sales and higher depreciation expenses. These factors contributed to the lower gross margin of 8.2%, down from 24.6% in the previous year.\nLooking ahead, Bitdeer remains optimistic about continued growth in its self-mining hashrate and financial performance improvement, supported by strategic infrastructure investments and technological advancements.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 04:56:10 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "Blockchain.News", "title": "VeChain Enhances Governance with VeBetterDAO Proposal Updates", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/vechain-enhances-governance-with-vebetterdao-proposal-updates", "text": "VeChain has announced a series of updates to its VeBetterDAO governance framework, aiming to enhance proposal quality, balance participation, and boost engagement among stakeholders. According to VeChain Official, these changes are designed to address challenges within the existing governance system while strengthening the overall process.\nIdentified Challenges\nThe recent proposal highlighted several issues with the current governance system, such as the absence of entry barriers, which led to an influx of low-value or duplicate proposals. Additionally, ambiguous proposals slowed decision-making, and the flat 2% quorum of all VOT3 tokens for proposal support made it difficult for smaller stakeholders to participate. Furthermore, supporters faced a disadvantage as their locked VOT3 tokens did not yield rewards, discouraging their backing of proposals.\nImplemented Changes\nTo address these issues, VeChain has introduced a set of new requirements and adjustments. A significant change is the requirement of a Moon-level GM NFT to create proposals, ensuring long-term commitment from authors and reducing spam. Additionally, a mandatory \u201cList of Changes\u201d section categorizes amendments as Removed, Modified, or Added Features. Future updates will include the use of B3MO as an AI agent for proposal reviews and the creation of Discourse threads before proposal submissions.\nAdjustments to current parameters include a Maximum Support cap of 5 million VOT3 tokens to prevent disproportionate influence by large holders. VOT3 tokens used to support proposals will now count toward voting power in weekly allocation voting rounds, allowing users to remain eligible for rewards during the lock-up period. This ensures active governance participation is not penalized while maintaining a meaningful cost for voting and endorsement.\nImportance of Community Engagement\nGovernance is crucial for VeBetterDAO's sustainability and growth. The new changes aim to create a healthier governance ecosystem by ensuring broad participation, informed engagement, and shared accountability. VeChain remains committed to fostering an environment where every stakeholder can contribute meaningfully, aligning with its mission to drive sustainable innovation.\nAnother Step Forward\nThe implementation of these governance refinements marks a significant step forward for the VeBetter ecosystem. By combining higher submission standards, fairer thresholds, and aligned incentives, the process is now better equipped to handle proposals that genuinely benefit the ecosystem.

The report surveyed 400 U.S. healthcare consumers across various demographics, with TrustCommerce analysts gleaning new insights.\nAmong individuals above 60, healthcare payments with debit cards are in pole position, with 38.7% of respondents choosing the method at the time of service. Cash-based payments come in second place at 6.75% while digital wallets make up 6.5% with 2.25% of respondents preferring checks.\nFor after-service payments, 45.25% of respondents above 60 indicate a preference for credit card-based payments. The TrustCommerce survey reveals that debit cards come in second place at 36.25% while digital wallets, cash, checks, and bank transfers make up 7.5%, 7%, 2.25%, and 1.75% respectively.\nIt also noted that patients are more likely to adopt digital payment systems for doctor and specialist visits, medicine prescriptions, and lab tests. However, analysts pointed out that patients\u2019 preferences are largely consistent before, during, and after medical services.\n\u201cI think there is sometimes a mistaken perception that older consumers don\u2019t want to use digital payment methods, but clearly that is not the case,\u201d said John Welch, Chief Product Officer at TrustCommerce.\nSeveral factors are powering the trend of senior citizens turning to digital payment systems to settle healthcare costs. Rising healthcare costs are forcing users to explore flexible options, with several respondents citing convenience and accessibility as key factors.\nFurthermore, several older patients have shown a changing preference to allow service providers to store their credit card information as tokens for future use. However, some respondents have cited security concerns and difficulty using advanced technologies in payments.\nUS-based digital payments to spike\nWhile healthcare is recording upticks in digital payments, a study has predicted that U.S. digital payments will record over $3.8 trillion in volume before the end of 2025. Credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets are tipped to drive the surge in transaction volume, while a slew of government initiatives will contribute to the projected numbers.\nOutside of payments, the global healthcare system is undergoing major upheavals, buoyed by next-gen technologies. Several technology giants are steamrolling toward the launch of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered solutions for healthcare amid grim warnings over the inherent risks associated with mainstream usage.\nLeveraging Cloud\nElsewhere, Siloam Hospitals Group, Indonesia\u2019s largest private hospital chain, has announced plans to digitize its operations wholesale, using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.\nSiloam Hospitals has moved critical operations to the AWS Cloud, citing increased efficiency and improved productivity across the board. The pivot to the AWS Cloud extends to Siloam\u2019s information systems, billing platforms, and proprietary MySiloam digital app.Siloam\u2019s executives have highlighted a streak of early wins stemming from the transition of services to AWS Cloud. Siloam Hospitals Group CEO Caroline Riady announced that the pivot will enable real-time data access, advanced scalability, military-grade security, and lay the groundwork for AI utility.\nThe report reveals several key AWS services powering Siloam Hospitals\u2019 digitization. For core app deployment, Siloam Hospitals will use Amazon Elastic Container Services (Amazon ECS), while Amazon RDS Aurora and Amazon ElastiCache will provide advanced data processing functionality.\nFurthermore, Amazon EventBridge will offer streamlined communication for Siloam Hospitals\u2019 microservices. Additionally, Siloam has integrated AWS Lambda, AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS), and AWS Backup for serverless backend automation and compliant data protection.\nIntegrating AI functionalities into existing operations is at the center of Siloam Hospital\u2019s transformation. Leaning on AWS Cloud, Siloam has deployed AI for inventory management to automate data capture and auto-summarization of medical records to support doctors\u2019 documentation of patients\u2019 histories.\n\u201cWith AWS, we are reimagining how healthcare works in Indonesia,\u201d said CEO Caroline Riady. \u201cWe\u2019re giving time back to our doctors, clarity to our decisions, and better outcomes for our patients.\u201d\nAcross Indonesia, AI is recording impressive adoption rates among private enterprises and government agencies. To emphasize this point, Indonesia launched an AI Center of Excellence, seeking a sovereign infrastructure, triggering innovation, and boosting adoption metrics.\nAI in healthcare receives a jolt\nSince large language models (LLMs) hit mainstream acceptance, several technology giants have pursued AI solutions for the healthcare sector. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is proceeding with its healthcare chatbot after scoring a streak of early wins with general chatbots, while other Big Tech firms are exploring emerging technologies for early disease detection and administrative functionalities.\nA report predicts that AI in healthcare will reach a market capitalization of $613 billion by 2024, driven by technology innovation and heavy private sector support. However, multiple studies have warned of potential flaws in AI-powered health solutions, with the World Health Organization advocating for strict guardrails to mitigate risks.\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership\u2014allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

The plan was first unveiled at the July meeting of the Government\u2019s Steering Committee on Science, Technology, Innovation, and Digital Transformation.\nUnder the initial plans, the Ministry of Public Security will lead the efforts to integrate e-prescriptions with the country\u2019s digital ID system. The Ministry will seek interoperability between pharmacy networks, the national health data coordination system, and hospital-issued prescriptions.\nThe Ministry of Public Security will begin a pilot project in September to test the viability of the offering. Upon public rollout, patients can see their medicine prescription on the VNeID mobile application, allowing them to order pharmaceutical products online.\nAlready, things are in motion for the mainstream rollout of the offering. Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of Health has issued an order for all hospitals to issue outpatient prescriptions digitally by October 1.\nInsiders with knowledge of the matter disclosed that other medical facilities will begin issuing electronic prescriptions at the start of 2026. Meanwhile, the VNeID app has expanded its reach to healthcare since launch, including a \u2018Health Record\u2019 section for users offering a raft of functionalities.\nDigital ID app users can access an electronic check-up book, medical appointment reminders, and a pharmacy directory. However, the pharmacy directory only supports the sale of non-prescription drugs via the VNeID app.\nWhile the incoming e-prescription features have received plaudits for stifling fake prescriptions and providing a history of patients\u2019 treatment plans, several critics have poked holes in the system. Firstly, there are fears that the e-prescriptions feature will overload the VNeID app, while others warn that home deliveries can lead to drug misuse in the absence of a doctor\u2019s guidance.\nVNeID gathers significant steam in Vietnam\nSince the launch of the digital ID system, Vietnam has racked up impressive milestones with a cross-section of citizens onboarded. Last month, the government opened the digital ID to foreigners, enabling access to several government-backed services.\nA report has chronicled a spike in the number of foreign digital ID applications since the service extension. Vietnam is slowly embracing emerging technologies, with several sectors turning to blockchain to improve processes.VNA and Yonhap strike an AI and emerging technology partnership\nSouth Korea\u2019s Yonhap News Agency (YNA) and the Vietnam News Agency (VNA) have inked a partnership deal to collaborate on digital transformation, leaning on a raft of emerging technologies.\nThe newly minted cooperation agreement places artificial intelligence (AI) at the core, with parties pledging improved information exchange. The deal was signed during the Vietnam-RoK Economic Forum in Seoul, and South Korea Prime Minister Kim Min Seok and Party General Secretary T\u00f4 L\u00e2m were in attendance.\nBoth Yonhap and the VNA will pursue a collaborative effort for AI-driven journalism, offering advanced functionalities and mutual benefits for all parties. Yonhap and the VNA will explore the possibilities of AI-powered news translations to improve the reach of both news outlets.\nAware of the scourge of AI-generated fake news, the arrangement will involve fact-checking solutions for readers of both platforms to stifle the spread of misinformation. Furthermore, parties are pledging to collaborate on datasets relevant to regional contexts.\nMeanwhile, other key areas of cooperation will include AI-based tagging of legacy content and personalized news distribution to readers based on their preferences. Yonhap CEO Hwang Dae-il disclosed on the sidelines of the Vietnam-RoK Economic Forum that the partnership will be the foundation of a smooth bilateral relationship between Vietnam and South Korea.\nAlready, VNA General Director V\u0169 Vi\u1ec7t Trang highlighted existing cooperation between the news agencies, leading to timely coverage of key economic events in both countries.\nBuilding on the existing relationship, parties are eyeing a potential collaboration for shared cloud infrastructure to power the AI pivot. Furthermore, there are ambitious plans for capacity building and talent exchange between both parties, with executives mulling the prospects of joint workshops.\nAt the core of the plans is the strict adherence to ethical guidelines governing journalism, with parties pledging to reduce bias and over-reliance on AI-generated content. Meanwhile, Malaysia has turned to AI to future-proof journalism, cracking down on fake news and other malicious deepfake content.\nA steady march toward emerging technology\nAmong the duo, South Korea has pulled ahead in terms of AI innovation and adoption. South Korea\u2019s AI advances correlate with heavy government spending and a concerted push to introduce emerging technologies into public utilities.\nOn the other hand, Vietnam has achieved notable successes with AI through key sector integrations. Early in the year, high-ranking government officials reiterated the desire to pursue national digital transformation, targeting AI while unfurling training programs to deepen the talent pool.\nWatch | Mark Thiele: Ownership of healthcare data crucial", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 03:00:00 +0000", "author": "Wahid Pessarlay", "source": "https://coingeek.com/feed/", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "cointelegraph.com", "title": "Google increases TeraWulf stake to 14%, becomes biggest shareholder", "url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/google-largest-shareholder-terawulf-ai-data-center-fluidstack?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound", "text": "Tech giant Google has become the largest shareholder of TeraWulf, holding 14% of the shares, after receiving more stock in exchange for increasing its backstop in the lease deal between the Bitcoin miner and AI infrastructure provider Fluidstack.\nTeraWulf disclosed in a shareholder call on Thursday that it inked a 10-year colocation lease agreement with Fluidstack.

Large-scale holders of Chainlink (LINK) and Ethereum (ETH) have been steadily increasing their positions, while also targeting smaller-cap assets that could deliver outsized returns. One project drawing particular attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts now describe as a potential 2025 \u201cmoonshot\u201d thanks to a mix of whale accumulation and growing demand for Ethereum-based treasuries.\nWhale Activity Signals High-Conviction Bet\nMitrade\u2019s latest analytics report shows that over $1.4 billion in capital has been rotated into the crypto market by whale wallets in just the past week. A substantial portion has gone into Chainlink and Ethereum, strengthening bullish sentiment around both projects. Yet beneath the surface, another trend is forming: whales are accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE at an increasing pace.\nAnalysts suggest this isn\u2019t a coincidence but a calculated play. While Ethereum and Chainlink provide stability and long-term growth, smaller-cap tokens often deliver the exponential upside investors crave during an altcoin cycle. Forecasts point to MAGACOIN FINANCE offering 43x to as high as 70x ROI, with some projections even calling for gains of up to 12,000% if momentum continues into late 2025.\nMAGACOIN FINANCE Positioned for Breakout\nWhat sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its ability to combine strong fundamentals with early-stage growth potential. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, it offers DeFi staking features that align with the surge in ETH treasury demand. With institutions pouring $663 million into ETH ETFs in a single week, projects tied closely to Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem are benefiting from a powerful tailwind.\nThis positioning, coupled with HashEx-certified security and an ongoing CertiK audit, gives MAGACOIN FINANCE an added layer of credibility often missing in meme-driven coins. Analysts note that whales accumulating now are likely anticipating exchange listings and staking expansions later this year, which could drive the next wave of adoption.\nEthereum Treasury Demand Reshaping the Market\nEthereum\u2019s rise is more than just a price story. Institutional adoption through ETFs has created a treasury-building trend, where corporations and funds are diversifying into ETH-based assets. This has led to an increased appetite for projects that offer utility within the Ethereum framework. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits this narrative perfectly, aligning itself with Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem while offering an alternative route to yield generation.\n2025 Moonshot Potential\nWith Bitcoin consolidating, capital is clearly rotating into both established altcoins and emerging projects with strong communities. History has shown that these market conditions often precede an altcoin season, where smaller-cap assets outperform dramatically. For many investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the kind of early-entry opportunity that could echo the explosive growth once seen with XRP, SHIBA INU, and DOGE.\nThe mix of whale activity, Ethereum\u2019s institutional-driven momentum, and a credible roadmap positions MAGACOIN FINANCE as a prime candidate to define the next leg of the 2025 bull market.\nTo learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit:\nWebsite: https://magacoinfinance.com\nAccess: https://magacoinfinance.com/access\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance\nTelegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

With XRP\u2019s outlook now clearer, attention has quickly shifted toward the next big movers. Cardano and Shiba Inu are already under the spotlight, but many analysts are also watching emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which could hold even greater upside potential.\nCardano: A Slow but Steady Climber\nCardano has earned a reputation as one of the most research-driven projects in the crypto space. With its methodical approach, peer-reviewed development, and upcoming upgrades such as Hydra scaling, ADA continues to attract serious institutional attention. Some are even speculating about a potential ETF, which could further validate Cardano as a blue-chip asset in the crypto world.\nWhile ADA is seen as fundamentally strong, its large market cap of around $33 billion makes the chances of explosive short-term growth limited. Analysts see Cardano as more of a steady climber, with predictions suggesting it could hold between $1\u2013$2 if broader bullish sentiment continues.\nShiba Inu: The Meme Powerhouse\nShiba Inu takes the opposite route. Known for its community-driven hype, SHIB thrives on speculation and viral momentum. Its relatively smaller market cap, hovering near $9 billion, makes it more likely than Cardano to pull off a dramatic run if social media buzz and investor FOMO align.\nHowever, SHIB\u2019s weakness lies in its fundamentals. Despite launching Shibarium, its utility remains modest, with little traction in DeFi. For investors, SHIB is a high-risk, high-reward gamble \u2013 capable of explosive moves but reliant on hype rather than real-world adoption.\nThe Case for MAGACOIN FINANCE\nBeyond these well-known players, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining recognition as a fresh altcoin contender. Analysts have highlighted it as one of the few projects with the potential for breakout growth similar to early-stage meme coins like Shiba Inu, but with a stronger roadmap and utility expansion in play. Early investors are already pointing to forecasts of over 7,800% potential ROI, making MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out as a project that blends speculative upside with long-term development goals. As presale supply continues to sell out rapidly, scarcity is building, giving it an edge as one of the most sought-after opportunities in the current cycle.\nWhich Altcoin Wins the Race?\nUltimately, the decision depends on investor strategy. Cardano offers slower, institutional-backed growth rooted in real-world use cases. Shiba Inu provides a chance at a hype-driven rally fueled by its loyal community. MAGACOIN FINANCE, however, is drawing attention as a new entry with one of the most aggressive upside projections in the market today.\nThe post-XRP rally has reignited optimism across altcoins, and while no project is without risk, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a top contender for those seeking the next big breakout story.\nTo learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit:\nWebsite: https://magacoinfinance.com\nAccess: https://magacoinfinance.com/access\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance\nTelegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

Bitcoin is steady above $119,000, but the real action is shifting toward high-performing altcoins. Solana has become the clear leader of the rally with analysts projecting a path toward $420, while Avalanche is joining the breakout with growing strength. Alongside these two, analysts are highlighting one emerging name, MAGACOIN FINANCE, as part of the top three altcoins to buy now for big upside.\nSolana (SOL) on Track for $420\nSolana has staged an impressive comeback after its Q2 slump. Currently hovering near $190, the token has climbed more than 20% in just a week. Network activity is thriving, with TVL above $10 billion and daily users increasing rapidly. Institutional interest is also on the rise, with speculation of a Spot Solana ETF fueling strong inflows.\nFrom a technical perspective, SOL\u2019s charts are showing a powerful cup-and-handle setup. Analysts say a break above $250 could trigger a run toward $420 this year, while some long-term projections even stretch to the $6,300 range. Nearer term, a peak in the $270-$280 zone is expected in September.\nAvalanche (AVAX) Showing Strength\nAvalanche is another altcoin catching investor attention. Although it has been consolidating in the mid-$20s, the project\u2019s expanding subnet ecosystem and enterprise applications point to strong fundamentals. If AVAX can break above the $30 resistance, analysts believe a rally toward $34-$38 is on the table by the end of Q3. A return to its all-time highs would mark a massive upside opportunity, reinforcing its position as one of the leaders of this bull run.\nThe New Factor That Could Shake Up the Market\nWhile Solana and Avalanche are grabbing headlines, smart investors are also looking at earlier-stage opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a standout presale project, with analysts projecting potential gains of over 7,800% for early investors. Each funding round has sold out quickly, signaling strong demand. Compared to the early days of some of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting attention for its growing ecosystem and investor rewards. With presale allocations running low, analysts highlight it as one of the 3 best altcoins to buy now before broader market rotation accelerates.\nOther Altcoins to Keep on the Radar\nEthereum continues to surge above $4,600, strengthened by spot ETF inflows and its dominant role in DeFi. Injective (INJ) has been gaining ground thanks to its fast, low-cost cross-chain trading infrastructure, while Cardano offers a steadier play with ongoing upgrades and strong network stability around $0.92.\nThese projects underline the depth of opportunity in the current bull market, but timing and diversification remain crucial.\nConclusion\nSolana\u2019s run toward $420 and Avalanche\u2019s breakout potential are leading the way in this altcoin rally, while Ethereum, Injective, and Cardano provide additional options for investors. Yet, for those seeking early-stage growth with massive upside potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a high-reward play that could define this cycle\u2019s breakout success.\nTo learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit:\nWebsite: https://magacoinfinance.com\nAccess: https://magacoinfinance.com/access\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance\nTelegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

Companies such as Guotai Junan International and Tianfeng International are preparing to upgrade their licenses for virtual asset services.\nOutlook for Digital Assets in the Region\nThe debut of 24/7 crypto trading by CMB International reflects the increasing role of banks in digital finance. The service allows investors to participate in markets that never close, matching the global pace of cryptocurrencies.\nCMB International has confirmed that expansion will be gradual. It plans to increase asset offerings while maintaining strict risk controls and compliance.\nWith this step, Hong Kong strengthens its role in Asia\u2019s financial landscape.

In early August, investors are looking at 18x returns with its mainnet launch on the horizon. With a successful presale and a fast-growing ecosystem, here is how LYNO can turn pre-support into genuine wealth.\nLYNO Early Presale & Growth Drivers\nOne-of-a-kind chances to invest are available at LYNO early bird presale phase at a price of only $0.050 per token. The project has been receiving high interest due to its cross-chain arbitrage system and the use of AI-related characteristics. LYNO is scalable, supported by 15 EVM blockchains and a growing demand of DeFi. With less supply of tokens, the increasing demand may stimulate prices to explode, giving a payoff to early investors.\nAI-Powered DeFi Profits with Big Rewards for Early Investors\nLYNO AI is the decentralized, AI-powered cross-chain arbitrage protocol that increases trading P&L by intelligently automating trading strategies and executing instantly. It leverages four major layers, such as flash loans and dynamic profit settlement, and is efficient and scalable. The holders of the tokens enjoy governance, staking rewards, and up to 60% of protocol profits. LYNO has a good incentive around a Cyberscope audit in addition to a token giveaway of 100,000 tokens to those who attend a presale event. The early presale period is the best period to purchase tokens before the second-phase boom in prices and demand.\nAudited Presale with 100K Token Giveaway for Early Backers\nThey keep It\u2019s simple: LYNO has already prepared a presale that is transparent and totally secure; it supports ETH, USDT, and USDC with safe ERC20 transfers and live Chainlink price feeds, and no manual input or guesswork. To reward users, LYNO will hold a time-limited giveaway of LYNO tokens; a total of 100,000 tokens will be given away, and ten beneficiaries will get 10,000 LYNO each. Participants should be awarded with the completion of social tasks and investing at least $100 in the presale in order to qualify\u2014reward one who is interested and active.\nConclusion: A Rare Window for High-Potential Gains\nLyno is gearing up to become a leader in the DeFi sector, with innovative AI, cross-chain capabilities, and a well-developed token economy. Having an audited presale, good incentives, and a potential to get an 18x return on investments in early August, LYNO is a unique chance to get a step ahead. The current price is the greatest, and as the project moves toward mainnet and its demand starts growing, first movers can become the winners of this new market game changer.\nFor more information about LYNO, visit the links below:\n- Website: https://lyno.ai/\n- Twitter/X: https://x.com/Lyno_AI\n- Telegram: https://t.me/lyno_ai", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 04:23:06 +0000", "author": "Sophia Bennett", "source": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/feed/", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "www.livebitcoinnews.com", "title": "Top 4 Crypto Cloud Mining Sites in 2025: The Ultimate Beginner\u2019s Guide to Bitcoin Mining", "url": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/top-4-crypto-cloud-mining-sites-in-2025-the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-bitcoin-mining/", "text": "In 2025, cryptocurrencies continued to lead global digital financial innovation, attracting a large number of both novice and experienced investors. However, beginners often face numerous challenges entering this field, including obscure industry terminology, high technical barriers to entry, and a rapidly changing market environment.

W has shown a bullish divergence on higher timeframes, which many analysts see as a possible turning point. Trading activity and on-chain data are also being examined as market participants look for confirmation of a shift in momentum.\nWormhole Technical Patterns and Market Signals\nSeveral analysts have pointed to bullish setups on Wormhole charts. Crypto Rover noted that $W is showing a weekly bullish divergence between price and RSI. The RSI moved higher while the token set lower lows, which is often watched for reversal signs.\nTraderPA also stated that $W has been trading in a multi-month consolidation phase and suggested a sharp bounce could follow. He remarked that the token has the potential for a \u201c3x\u201d move once momentum shifts. Open4profit pointed to an inverse head and shoulders formation, describing it as a pattern suggesting momentum change.\nOn the weekly timeframe, $W traded at around $0.25 in mid-August after declining from earlier highs near $0.40. RSI climbed from oversold levels below 30 to near 45, signaling increased buying activity despite price weakness. Resistance remains near $0.35, while traders also monitor $0.22 as a support level.\nAnalyst Views and On-Chain Metrics\nMicha\u00ebl van de Poppe described $W as one of his preferred tokens and pointed to bullish divergences across multiple timeframes. He emphasized that the token appeared \u201con the edge of breaking out\u201d and noted that the Wormhole team continued to deliver new features.\nRecent developments include the introduction of Portal Earn, a service allowing users to bridge, swap, stake, and earn rewards.

At the same time, open interest fell by 8.7% to $39.04 million, suggesting that some traders closed positions instead of adding new ones. Long positions faced more liquidations than shorts, showing that the market remains unstable even as overall sentiment leans positive.\nRetail and professional traders remain heavily long on Binance and OKX, though the long-short ratio overall stands at 0.92. Futures open interest climbed 12% to $30 million as of August 17, 2025, which shows that leveraged positions continue to build. The $W/USDT pair also rose 7% in 24 hours to $0.28, attracting interest from swing and short-term traders.", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 02:08:57 +0000", "author": "Samuel", "source": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/feed/", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "www.livebitcoinnews.com", "title": "Missed Solana at $10? Don\u2019t Miss Ozak AI at $0.005 \u2013 Price Prediction Suggests $2.80 by 2026", "url": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/missed-solana-at-10-dont-miss-ozak-ai-at-0-005-price-prediction-suggests-2-80-by-2026/", "text": "The move of the crypto world is extremely fast, and with some projects such as Solana (SOL), riders who bought early on at just $10 sit on a life-changing profit of thousands of dollars. In August of 2025, Solana is now trading at 180 dollars\u2014a tremendous 19x gain by initial holders. However, Ozak AI ($OZ), an Ethereum-based AI token in its fourth presale stage, might be the breakout opportunity in this cycle. Starting at only $0.005 per one Ozak AI token, the project has already managed to sell more than 160 million tokens and raise over 2 million dollars, and the early investors are anticipating the earnings in the double digits as the launch date draws near.\nClear ROI Math: Why $2.80 is a Game-Changer\nThe presale started at $0.001, so the earliest investors are sitting on a 400 percent profit in the initial round (started at $0.001; $0.005 is a five-fold increase). With the close to the fourth phase, the next level of price will increase to $0.01, which is also far lower than the planned $1 price at launch, which will provide endorsing entrants by its rational potential of 200x. Great momentum in its market, growth in the AI industry and actual adoption make Ozak AI potentially go up to 2.8 dollars by 2026, which translates to a 560x increase ($2.80 / 0.005).\nTo have an effective result, a $250 investment at $0.005 = 50,000 tokens. At $1, that is $50K, and at $2.80, it is $140K. This kind of upside potential was similarly held by Solana when it rewarded the early true believers after the price of SOL rose from $10 to more than $190.\nYoutube embed:\nWhat Sets Ozak AI Apart? Real Tech and Real Use Cases\nWhereas meme tokens depend only on hype, Ozak AI will deliver punchy usefulness by synthesizing complex AI analytics with blockchain. Zones are key features and include:\n- Ozak Stream Network (OSN): Provides real-time, low-latency cross-chain crypto data, needed in trading and analytics.\n- Prediction Agents (PAs): Smart bots built on neural networks and ARIMA algorithms that can be customized and that provide tradable trading and investing market signals.\n- Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN): Offers scalable, secure and distributed infrastructure to run data, reduce fees and not get stuck in blockchain bottlenecks.\nThe native gas is the $OZ token, which can be used in the processes of accessing services and customizing the agents and going through the governance process. Utility and demand are directly related to the further evolution of the ecosystem.\nTransparent Roadmap, Strong Audits, and Growing Partnerships\nThe Ozak AI team has shared a roadmap based on milestones, which encompasses:\n- Q3 2025: The beta version of the customizable Prediction Agent dashboard.\n- Q4 2025: OSN and DePIN are completely integrated with the big exchanges.\n- May 2026: Open developer API, AI analytics platform, and SDK.\nCertiK and SolidProof performed security audits, guaranteeing greater confidence of institutional and retail investors. Collaborations with Hive Intel and Manta Network also increase the scope of practical and technical connections of Ozak AI.\nConclusion\nNot only does Ozak AI permit early investors to obtain outsized returns, but it also has, thus far into its development, passed a real, audited product, a solid roadmap and a demonstrated presale fundraising track record. Ozak AI is trading in a prime position to take advantage of the latest influx of investors looking to generate AI-driven profits in the crypto space in a follow-up run to Solana, following its largest rise in history to $10. Do your own due diligence, but don\u2019t wait any longer until the next price change\u2014such a chance may not come again.\nFor more information about Ozak AI, visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.

One of the latest signals comes from JPMorgan, which has connected the rapid rise of stablecoins to Ethereum\u2019s expanding role as the backbone of tokenized finance. This connection has reinforced bullish sentiment across the altcoin sector, with investors searching for the next standout opportunities. Among the most discussed is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale project that many early backers believe could rival the explosive gains of past cycle giants.\nStablecoins Driving Ethereum\u2019s Next Phase\nJPMorgan\u2019s research points to a direct link between stablecoin adoption and Ethereum\u2019s dominance in decentralized finance. With more than $160 billion in stablecoin circulation, demand for scalable and secure blockchain infrastructure continues to grow. Ethereum, despite competition from Solana and other networks, remains the leading settlement layer for stablecoins, smart contracts, and tokenized real-world assets. The bank\u2019s analysts suggest that this trend could push Ethereum\u2019s valuation to new heights as institutional and retail adoption deepen.\nThe stablecoin boom isn\u2019t just strengthening Ethereum\u2019s position \u2014 it\u2019s reshaping investor strategies. As confidence grows in Ethereum\u2019s long-term role, capital is beginning to flow into high-upside projects that could benefit from the next wave of adoption.\nWhy Investors Are Watching This Rising Star\nAmid this shift, MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured major attention as one of 2025\u2019s standout presales. The project is being recognized for its scarcity-driven model, with supply limited and demand climbing rapidly. Early participants have already seen allocation rounds sell out in record time, signaling strong momentum. Analysts note that forecasts estimate MAGACOIN FINANCE could reach up to 10,500% gains before the cycle peak, making it one of the few presales investors are prioritizing for multi-year growth potential.\nWhat sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its commitment to utility expansion and ecosystem development, ensuring that early backers aren\u2019t just betting on hype but on a foundation designed for long-term relevance. This blend of scarcity, community growth, and development has made it a focal point in crypto investment circles this year.\nEthereum\u2019s Outlook for 2025\nAs Ethereum\u2019s utility widens through stablecoins, DeFi, and real-world asset tokenization, expectations for its price continue to build. The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. has opened the floodgates for institutional inflows, adding another layer of demand. If stablecoin adoption keeps accelerating at the pace JPMorgan suggests, Ethereum could see a stronger-than-expected run heading into 2026.\nInvestors who are bullish on Ethereum\u2019s growth trajectory are also diversifying into promising altcoin projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, creating a dual strategy that combines the security of established assets with the explosive upside of emerging opportunities.\nConclusion\nJPMorgan\u2019s analysis linking stablecoin adoption to Ethereum growth highlights just how much potential remains in the crypto sector. Ethereum looks poised to benefit from its dominant role, but investors seeking outsized gains are turning to presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where scarcity and strong demand point to significant upside. If the forecasts prove accurate, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be one of 2025\u2019s most profitable plays, making it a top contender in the race for the next breakout success.\nTo learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit:\nWebsite: https://magacoinfinance.com\nAccess: https://magacoinfinance.com/access\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance\nTelegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.
