It was founded by the restaurateur Nick Jones, who has a 5% stake, although the biggest investor is the US retail billionaire Ron Burkle, who holds 40% of the company. Richard Caring, the owner of the Ivy restaurant chain, has a 21% stake. All three will retain their stakes, as will the US investment bank Goldman Sachs, which has 8%.\nThe new investors will pay $9 a share for about 15% of the Soho House & Co shares that trade publicly. The company said the deal implied an enterprise value of about $2.7bn, although that included $700m of debt.\nThe offer leaves the value of its shares \u2013 at about $2bn \u2013 well below the $2.8bn level it achieved shortly after listing in 2021. The company has traded below $9 a share since May 2022, although it said that offer represented an 83% premium to the price before investor interest was revealed in December.\nMCR Hotels is the third-largest hotel operator in the US, with more than 150 sites including the High Line hotel and the TWA at JFK airport, both in New York. It is converting the BT Tower in London\u2019s Fitzrovia into a hotel, after reaching a deal last year to buy it for \u00a3275m.\nSoho House operates 10 locations in London, and 48 that are either open or planned around the world, ranging from Paris and Istanbul to Bangkok and Mumbai. It has four clubs in Los Angeles and three in New York. While it is listed in New York, its main office is in London.\nIt attracts a celebrity clientele, with Kate Moss, Kendall Jenner and Ellie Goulding among those spotted at its clubs. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan, met on a blind date in 2016 at its 76 Dean Street house in London.\nHowever, the company has had to balance the rapid and expensive global expansion of the chain with the difficulty of retaining the feeling of exclusivity demanded by the 213,000 members who must pay an annual fee of up to \u00a32,920 a year for access to every property.\nIts share price has dropped from above $14 in August 2021 to $7.64 on Friday. The company has lost a cumulative $739m in the four years it has been listed, although it has made a net profit in its past three quarters.\nIts struggles have attracted attention from activist investors who push for improvements in companies. Third Point, the hedge fund run by the billionaire Dan Loeb, had argued that Soho House should seek other investors to try to push for a competitive bidding process.\nThe Wall Street short sellers GlassHouse had previously raised concerns about Soho House\u2019s accounting, although these were rejected by the company.\nAndrew Carnie, the chief executive of Soho House & Co, said the deal \u201creflects the strong confidence our existing and incoming shareholders have in the future of Soho House & Co\u201d, despite a \u201cbackdrop of challenging economic conditions and global uncertainty\u201d.\nThe company argues that it has become a more efficient business in the past two years, allowing it to increase in size more profitably. Revenue has doubled in the past three years.\n\u201cReturning to private ownership enables us to build on this momentum, with the support of world class hospitality and investment partners,\u201d Carnie said. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of what our teams have accomplished and am excited about our future, as we continue to be guided by our members and grounded in the spirit that makes Soho House so special.\u201d", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:35:37 GMT", "author": "Jasper Jolly", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss", "tag": "economy"}, {"domain": "www.theguardian.com", "title": "Reeves considers replacing stamp duty with new property tax", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/aug/18/rachel-reeves-stamp-duty-property-tax-council-tax", "text": "The Treasury is considering a new tax on the sale of homes worth more than \u00a3500,000 as a step towards a radical overhaul of stamp duty and council tax, the Guardian has been told.\nAs Rachel Reeves prepares the ground for tax rises in this autumn\u2019s budget, senior ministers have tasked officials to study how a new \u201cproportional\u201d property tax could be implemented and model its impact before reporting back to ministers, who have been briefed on the proposals.\nOfficials are initially examining a potential national property tax, which would replace stamp duty on owner-occupied homes, sources said. They are also studying whether, after the national tax, a local property tax could then replace council tax in the medium term in an effort to repair battered local authority finances.\nNo final decisions have been made. A national tax could be implemented during this parliament, while it is understood an overhaul of council tax would take longer, at least requiring Labour to win a second term in office.\nThe policy options are being considered as part of a large tranche of work within the Treasury aimed at tapping into the vast cumulative rise in house prices in recent years that risks entrenching inequalities and making council tax \u2013 which is based on early 1990s property values \u2013 more unfair.\nIf the plans came to fruition, they could provide valuable political cover for Reeves, both in terms of raising extra revenue without breaking Labour\u2019s pledge to not raise levies on working people and as policies that would be likely to appeal to many of the party\u2019s MPs and members.\nThere has been increasing pressure on the chancellor to consider more wealth-based taxes, notably from the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, and the additional tax on more expensive homes could be presented in this light.\nThe national tax would be paid by owner-occupiers on houses worth more than \u00a3500,000 when they sell their home. The amount paid would be determined by the value of the property, with the rate set by central government, which would directly collect the proceeds via HMRC. It would not replace stamp duty on second homes.\nCurrent rates of stamp duty vary depending on whether someone is a first-time buyer and are banded in steps upward depending on the value of the property being bought and sold.\nIt would take time to phase in a replacement to stamp duty, and a range of options are being considered for phasing in changes. The revenue raised by stamp duty on primary residences varies considerably from year to year, depending on housing market conditions. In the last financial year it raised \u00a311.6bn, according to government figures. Over time, it is believed the new national property tax would be a more reliable, consistent source of revenue and ultimately raise the same amount as stamp duty.\nThe levy would only affect about a fifth of property sales, compared with about 60% with current levels of stamp duty, which is paid by the buyer of a home. The average price of a home in the UK was \u00a3272,664 in July, according to Nationwide.\nSources said that Treasury officials are, in part, drawing on the findings of a 48-page report from the centre-right thinktank Onward, which was published in August last year.\nOnward\u2019s report proposes a dual approach of a national and local \u201cproportional property tax\u201d on property, based on its value. It is written by Tim Leunig, who worked as a government adviser for more than a decade and was closely involved with devising the furlough scheme during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nLeunig wrote: \u201cThese proposals would make it easier and cheaper to move house, for a better job, or to be near family, as well as being fairer. It should not be the case that a terrace house in Burnley pays more than a mansion in Kensington \u2013 and it wouldn\u2019t be under these proposals.\u201d\nThe government has already showed signals of adopting some of the steps towards council tax Leunig laid out in his report: \u201cThe first step would be to end the overfunding of various councils in affluent areas of inner London, particularly Westminster, Wandsworth and Kensington and Chelsea councils.\u201d This is similar to the approach laid out this summer in a consultation on how to redistribute from richer to poorer councils.\nThe idea of a new local annual property levy to replace council tax was also proposed by Onward. That plan would result in owners, rather than the residents, of a property worth up to \u00a3500,000 paying varying rates of tax dependent on the value of their home. They would pay a minimum of \u00a3800 a year and the funds this generates would go directly to local councils, whose finances have been severely stretched in recent years.\nRayner has already raised the prospect of ramping up redistributions of funds to address regional inequalities, which she has argued are exacerbated by the existing council tax system, which replaced the poll tax in 1993.\nA spokesperson for the Treasury said: \u201cAs set out in the plan for change, the best way to strengthen public finances is by growing the economy \u2013 which is our focus. Changes to tax and spend policy are not the only ways of doing this, as seen with our planning reforms, which are expected to grow the economy by \u00a36.8bn and cut borrowing by \u00a33.4bn.\n\u201cWe are committed to keeping taxes for working people as low as possible, which is why at last autumn\u2019s budget, we protected working people\u2019s payslips and kept our promise not to raise the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, employee national insurance or VAT.\u201d\nEconomists from the right and left of the political spectrum have heavily criticised stamp duty and council tax.\nIn June, the government launched a consultation on how to reform the allocation of funds raised by council tax. Labour said the \u201cfair funding review\u201d aims to fix the \u201cbroken funding system we inherited\u201d which has \u201cleft local authorities across the country in crisis\u201d.\nThe strategy has already met a backlash after it emerged deprived inner-city London councils stand to lose millions of pounds.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies, an economic thinktank, has said that while reform was very much needed, the proposed changes in the government\u2019s funding review appeared to run counter to an \u201cexpectation that deprived and urban areas would win at the expense of more affluent and rural areas, the government\u2019s baseline funding reform proposals are not particularly redistributive to poor, urban areas of England\u201d.\nWhile any wealth-related tax could provoke strong criticism from rightwing opponents, ministers have shown willingness to ignore such criticism for policies that generally affect wealthier people, such as adding VAT on private school fees and changes to inheritance tax for some farms.\nIf billed as a part of a longer-term replacement of stamp duty, this could also be helpful given the existing levy is unpopular and widely seen as a blunt tool and a block on the property market.\nUsing property taxes as a replacement for council tax would be complex to implement and almost inevitably require a second term in office, but there is an increasing acceptance among all the main parties that the current system for local government funding is obsolete and unviable.\nLabour has already committed to the biggest shake-up of council structures in England for decades but does not want to oversee the predicted series of local authorities declaring effective bankruptcy, especially as many will be run by the party.\nThe Guardian last week revealed that the Treasury was also looking at ways to raise more money from inheritance tax in an attempt to ease pressure on the country\u2019s finances, in the run-up to Reeves\u2019s autumn budget.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:04:42 GMT", "author": "Anna Isaac and Peter Walker", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss", "tag": "economy"}, {"domain": "www.theguardian.com", "title": "Monzo plans to launch UK mobile phone service", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/aug/18/monzo-plans-to-launch-uk-mobile-phone-service", "text": "Monzo is looking to launch its own mobile phone service in the UK, in a move that could heighten competition among big phone groups and secure further revenue for the growing digital bank.\nThe online-only lender, which was launched in 2015, is in the early stages of developing a digital sim card: a software version of the insertable chip used to connect a phone to cellular networks and the internet.\nThat could open the door to lucrative mobile phone contracts with new and existing customers, putting pressure on incumbents such as VodafoneThree and the BT-owned operator EE. Big phone providers are already facing competition from financial firms including Revolut and the buy-now-pay-later provide Klarna, which are also trying to take a slice of the mobile phone market.\nA spokesperson for Monzo said: \u201cMonzo is known for transforming products \u2013 and an entire industry \u2013 to deliver a great experience for customers. So when we heard from our customers that mobile contracts can be a pain point we set out to explore how we could do this the Monzo way, and are in the early stages of developing this idea.\u201d\nThe move, which was first reported by the Financial Times, would help diversify revenues for Monzo, which has already gone from a scrappy newcomer luring millennials with its sleek app and hot coral pink card, to a fully licensed bank with more than 13 million UK customers and more than 3,900 staff.\nIt could help increase the company\u2019s valuation before an anticipated initial public offering. Monzo was last valued at \u00a34.5bn in October 2024 when employees sold stock to existing investors. This followed a funding round in May the same year that raised \u00a3500m.\nWhile its valuation has lagged significantly behind its rival Revolut, which was last valued at $45bn (\u00a333.6bn), Monzo has focused most of its growth in the UK and gained a coveted banking licence from British regulators in 2016. Revolut has only been granted a restricted licence and, 12 months on, has yet to have its application fully authorised despite government efforts to hasten the process.\nMonzo was recently embroiled in controversy and fined \u00a321m over weak financial crime controls. An investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority found that the controls were lax enough that customers were able to register for accounts using \u201cobviously implausible UK addresses when applying for an account\u201d, including 10 Downing Street, Buckingham Palace and Monzo\u2019s own headquarters.\nThe bank\u2019s chief executive, TS Anil, said last month that the FCA fine drew a line under issues he said had been resolved and were \u201cfirmly in the past \u2013 with our learnings at the time leading to substantial improvements in our controls\u201d.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:58:20 GMT", "author": "Kalyeena Makortoff Banking correspondent", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss", "tag": "economy"}, {"domain": "www.theguardian.com", "title": "UK metals firms threaten to sue government over tariffs on steel imports from Asia", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/18/uk-metals-steel-imports-asia", "text": "UK metals companies have threatened to take legal action against the government over tariffs on raw steel imports from Asia which they claim have caused a \u201ctsunami\u201d of problems for the industry.\nEarlier this summer, the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, reduced the amount of raw steel from Vietnam and South Korea that can be imported tariff-free in a move designed to protect UK raw steel makers, which face competition from cheap imports.\nIn a letter to Reynolds, a group of manufacturers who use raw steel to make industrial products threatened to sue the government after the cut took effect in July, leaving shipments already paid for liable to a 25% tariff. Reynolds is expected to reply to the letter this week, after asking for more time to respond.\nManufacturers behind the legal letter said Reynolds gave just 24 hours\u2019 notice of the quota cut, leaving thousands of tonnes of imported steel stranded at UK ports. They said steel already on ships from east Asia had been \u201cbought and paid for\u201d but would now attract a tariff on entry to the UK.\nThe Confederation of British Metalforming (CBM), which represent companies that forge, weld and roll raw steel to make industrial products, said its members faced a \u201ctsunami\u201d of problems, from higher costs to delayed shipments. It said disruptions in deliveries \u201care reverberating throughout domestic industry\u201d.\nPaul Whitehouse, the managing director of Steel & Alloy Gonvarri Industries, based near Birmingham, said he would need to pay more than \u00a3500,000 in tariff surcharges.\nWhitehouse said: \u201cThe government has shot itself in the foot. It wants to help the steel industry, but acting in this way, giving just 24 hours\u2019 notice, has only increased our expenses. We work on very small margins \u2013 1% to 2% \u2013 and these extra costs matter.\u201d\nThe main producers of raw steel in the UK are Tata Steel\u2019s operations in south Wales and British Steel\u2019s plant in Scunthorpe, which was taken over by the government in April after it became concerned that its Chinese owner, Jingye, was planning to let its blast furnaces cool.\nSpeciality Steel UK (SSUK), which employs 1,500 people and is part of the Liberty Steel Group owned by Sanjeev Gupta, is also under threat of closure.\nUK steel businesses have struggled to find domestic buyers after a collapse in demand from longstanding customers. Car production has fallen in the UK and activity in the commercial construction sector, another large user of steel, has slowed this year.\nA regime of quotas and tariffs already exists, protecting UK raw steel makers from cheap Chinese imports and restricting imports from the EU.\nPressure has mounted since February when many steel-producing countries began seeking new markets for their products amid threats by Donald Trump of hefty tariffs on imports to the US. Washington\u2019s steel tariffs have also dented UK exports to the US.\nThe government said its decision followed a recommendation by the Trade Remedies Authority (TRA). However, the metal industry accused Reynolds of ignoring changes set out by the independent body.\nA review by the TRA recommended a cap of 40% on tariff-free imports from \u201cother\u201d countries that make raw steel, including Vietnam, Thailand and South Korea. But Reynolds reduced the cap to 15% and said it would apply the next day.\nThe industry had been expecting the new rules to be implemented in October, giving them time to find new suppliers.\nThe CBM president, Stephen Morley, said steel was being stockpiled at ports \u201ccreating a domino effect, with businesses facing additional costs, logistical challenges, and uncertainties about the future of their operations\u201d.\nHe said his members were in favour of measures safeguarding UK steel production, but added that Reynolds had \u201cexacerbated the existing pressures on firms already grappling with the aftermath of the current economic climate\u201d.\nMembers of the CBM are understood to be clubbing together to fund a judicial review of Reynolds\u2019s decision after sending him a pre-action protocol letter.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: \u201cWe do not comment on potential or ongoing legal proceedings.\u201d", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:32:18 GMT", "author": "Phillip Inman", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss", "tag": "economy"}, {"domain": "www.cnbc.com", "title": "When 'invest like the 1%' fails: How Yieldstreet's real estate bets left customers with massive losses", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/18/yieldstreet-real-estate-bets-customer-losses.html", "text": "When Justin Klish stumbled upon an ad for Yieldstreet in February 2022, he said, it was the company's tagline that stuck in his head.\n\"Invest like the 1%,\" the startup said.\nThe ad spoke to his desire to build wealth and diversify away from stocks, which were then in freefall, Klish said. Yieldstreet says it gives retail investors such as Klish access to the types of deals that were previously only the domain of Wall Street firms or the ultrarich.\nSo Klish, a 46-year-old financial services worker living in Miami, logged on to Yieldstreet's platform, where a pair of offerings jumped out to him.\nHe invested $400,000 in two real estate projects: A luxury apartment building in downtown Nashville overseen by former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann's family office, and a three-building renovation in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York. Each project had targeted annual returns of around 20%.\nThree years later, Klish said he has little hope of ever seeing his money again. Yieldstreet declared the Nashville project a total loss in May, according to an investor letter, wiping out $300,000 of his funds. The Chelsea deal needs to raise fresh capital to avoid a similar fate, according to another letter. Both letters were reviewed by CNBC.\n\"There isn't a day that goes by without me saying, 'I can't believe what happened,'\" Klish told CNBC. \"I lost $400,000 in Yieldstreet. I consider myself moderately financially savvy, and I got duped by this company. I just worry that it's going to keep happening to others.\"\nDistributed risk\nYieldstreet, founded in 2015, is one of the best-known examples of American startups with the stated mission of democratizing access to assets such as real estate, litigation proceeds and private credit. To do so, it gathers funds from thousands of investors such as Klish, who typically put in at least $10,000 each for projects vetted by Yieldstreet managers.\nThe startup's central premise is that the world beyond public stocks and bonds \u2014 often called alternative assets or private market investments \u2014 provides both smoother sailing and the possibility of higher returns, a win-win proposition. This month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order designed to allow private market investments in U.S. retirement plans.\nBut Yieldstreet customers who participated in its real estate deals in recent years say they've learned the flip side of the private markets: They face huge losses on investments that turned out far riskier than they thought, while their money has been locked up for years with little to show for it besides frustration.\nThe company said in a statement that its real estate equity offerings from 2021 and 2022 were \"significantly impacted\" by rising interest rates and market conditions that pressured valuations industrywide.\nThis article is based on dozens of investor letters that were sent to customers by Yieldstreet and reviewed by CNBC.\nThe documents show investors put more than $370 million into 30 real estate projects that have already recognized $78 million in defaults in the past year. Yieldstreet customers who spoke to CNBC say they anticipate deep or total losses on the remainder.\nThe breadth of Yieldstreet's struggles in real estate \u2014 its biggest single investment category \u2014 hasn't previously been reported.\nCNBC's analysis covers a wide swath of deals that the company offered between 2021 and 2024, but doesn't include every project, of which there were at least 55, according to Yieldstreet.\nThe troubled projects vary. They include apartment complexes in boomtowns such as Atlanta, Dallas and Nashville, Tennessee; developments in coastal cities including New York, Boston and Portland, Oregon; apartment buildings in the Midwest and single-family rental homes across Florida, Georgia and North Carolina.\nOf the 30 deals that CNBC reviewed information on, four have been declared total losses by Yieldstreet. Of the rest, 23 are deemed to be on \"watchlist\" by the startup as it seeks to recoup value for investors, sometimes by raising more funds from members. Three deals are listed as \"active,\" though they have stopped making scheduled payouts, according to the documents.\nAdditionally, Yieldstreet shut down a real estate investment trust made up of six of the above projects last year as its value plunged by nearly half, locking up customer money for at least two years.\nYieldstreet's overall returns in real estate have plunged in the past two years; the category went from a 9.4% annual return rate in 2023 to a 2% return rate in the company's most recent update on its website.\nBut only customers participating in a specific fund get information about its performance, and Yieldstreet labels its investor updates \"confidential,\" warning customers that the information in them can't be shared without consent from the startup. While not uncommon in the private markets, those limitations make it hard for investors to know if their experience is unique.\nKlish said he began to worry about his investments in early 2023 when updates became late and began to hint at deteriorating market conditions.\nFrustrated by those delays and what he described as a lack of candor from Yieldstreet about his sinking investments, Klish turned to forums on Facebook and Reddit for a sense of the bigger picture. There he said he found a few dozen other customers who shared their Yieldstreet experiences.\n\"When I dug into the other deals, I realized that this is systemic,\" said Klish. \"Almost every single deal is in trouble.\"\nIn July, Klish filed a complaint, which CNBC has reviewed, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleging that Yieldstreet misled its investors. Klish said he has yet to receive a response to his complaint.\nMissing ships, busted tie-up\nYieldstreet calls itself the leading platform offering access to the private markets, a category that has boomed over the past decade as professional investors seek sources of yield beyond stocks and bonds.\nFounded 10 years ago by Michael Weisz and Milind Mehere, the company has well-known VC backers including Khosla Ventures, Thrive Capital and General Catalyst. Yieldstreet was part of a wave of fintech startups created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, including Robinhood and Chime, with a populist message.\n\"Our mission at Yieldstreet is, how do we help create financial independence for millions of people?\" Weisz said during a 2020 CNBC interview. \"You do that by helping people generate consistent, passive income.\"\nWeisz, who became CEO of Yieldstreet in 2023, brought experience in litigation finance, where hedge funds lend money to plaintiffs for a slice of the payout if the lawsuit wins. Mehere, a former software engineer who had co-founded online marketing startup Yodle, was the more technical of the pair.\nYieldstreet declined to make the co-founders or other executives available for this article.\nIn early 2020, Yieldstreet announced a partnership with BlackRock, the biggest asset manager in the world. The startup said at the time that its new Prism fund would contain a mix of its private market assets with conventional bond funds managed by BlackRock.\nHere is the 2020 interview with Yieldstreet co-founder Weisz:\nThe move seemed to signal that Yieldstreet was primed for mainstream success. BlackRock had spent 18 months vetting the company before agreeing to the tie-up, Yieldstreet's co-founders told CNBC at the time.\nThe month after its public announcement, though, Yieldstreet had tougher news to share. It was becoming clear that customers in another one of its product lines \u2014 loans backed by commercial ships that are torn apart for scrap metal \u2014 would suffer losses, the firm told them in March, according to a Wall Street Journal report.\nYieldstreet lost track of 13 ships in international waters that backed $89 million in member loans, according to an April 2020 lawsuit filed by the startup against the borrower in that project, which it accused of fraud. In October 2020, a British court sided with Yieldstreet in the lawsuit against the borrower, a Dubai-based ship recycler.\nThe episode scared off BlackRock, which ended the partnership weeks after it was announced, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked to remain unnamed so they could speak freely about private conversations.\nA Yieldstreet spokeswoman at the time told The Wall Street Journal that the BlackRock launch was initially successful but the fund \"was then faced with the market environment caused by Covid-19.\"\nThree years later, the SEC fined Yieldstreet $1.9 million for selling a $14.5 million marine loan to investors even when it had reason to believe the borrower had stolen proceeds from related deals. Yieldstreet also didn't use \"publicly available\" methods to track the ships it was relying on for collateral, the SEC said.\n\"YieldStreet aims to unlock the complex alternative investments market for retail investors but failed to disclose glaring red flags it had about the security of the collateral backing this offering,\" an SEC official said in a 2023 release accompanying the settlement, for which the company neither denied nor admitted to the agency's findings.\nStill, the company continued to rack up assets on its platform, in part by ramping up activities in real estate. By 2023, real estate funds made up 26% of all investments on the platform, the largest asset category and well ahead of runners-up such as private credit, Yieldstreet said at the time.\nLate that year, Yieldstreet announced it had acquired Cadre, a startup co-founded by Jared Kushner that focused on broadening access to commercial real estate. The companies declined to disclose terms of the deal, but Yieldstreet said the combined entities' \"investment value\" was nearly $10 billion.\nIn May 2025, Yieldstreet replaced Weisz as CEO with Mitch Caplan, a former E-Trade chief who joined the startup's board in 2021. That's the year the venture firm where Caplan serves as president, Tarsadia Investments, took a stake in Yieldstreet. The company declined to say why Weisz was replaced.\nIn July, Yieldstreet announced a $77 million capital raise, led by Tarsadia Investments.\n'Difficult news'\nYieldstreet continued to make moves in real estate well after a seismic shift that made the industry far harder to navigate had begun.\nIn early 2022, the Federal Reserve kicked off its most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in decades to combat inflation, turning the economics of many projects from that period upside down. The value of multifamily buildings has dropped 19% since 2022, according to Green Street's commercial property index.\nProjects that Yieldstreet put its customers into struggled to hit revenue targets amid price competition or had problems filling vacancies or raising rents, and thus began to fall behind on loan payments, according to investor letters.\nCombined with the use of leverage, or borrowing money that amplifies both risks and returns, Yieldstreet investors suffered complete losses on projects in Nashville, Atlanta and New York's Upper West Side neighborhood, the letters show.\n\"After exhausting all options to preserve value, YieldStreet determined there was no reasonable path to recovery,\" the firm told customers who invested $15 million in the Upper West Side deal. \"We sold our position for $1.\"\nIt's unclear if Yieldstreet, which makes money by charging annual management fees of around 2% on invested funds, itself suffered financial losses on the defaults.\nIn at least a half dozen cases, Yieldstreet went to its user base again in 2023 and 2024 to raise rescue funds for troubled deals, telling members that the loans combined the protections of debt with the upside of equity.\nBut if the project was doomed, a bailout loan was, at least in one case, effectively throwing good money after bad. A $3.1 million member loan to help rescue the Nashville project, located at 2010 West End Avenue, was wiped out in just months.\n\"We are reaching out to share difficult news,\" Yieldstreet told investors of the Nashville project and its member loan in May. \"Following multiple restructuring attempts, the property has been sold to Tishman Speyer ... resulting in a complete loss of capital for investors.\"\nIn a statement provided in response to CNBC's reporting for this article, Yieldstreet said it has offered 149 real estate deals since inception and has delivered positive returns on 94% of matured investments in the category.\nThat 94% figure likely doesn't include the distressed projects that CNBC has identified, since those funds aren't yet classified as matured while Yieldstreet seeks to salvage projects on its watchlist. The watchlist designation doesn't always result in the loss of investor funds, Yieldstreet said in another statement.\n\"Of the nearly $5 billion invested across the platform, a set of real estate equity offerings originated during 2021\u20132022 were significantly impacted by rising interest rates and broader market conditions that pressured multifamily valuations across the industry,\" Yieldstreet said through a spokeswoman.\nAdverse selection\nOn its website, the startup says it offers only about 10% of the opportunities it reviews, signaling its discernment when it comes to risk.\nBut several professional investors pointed to the possibility that, instead of securing only top-quality deals in real estate, Yieldstreet may be getting ones that are picked over by more established players.\n\"There's no question you've seen deals that institutions have passed on that went to the platforms because retail investors might have less discipline than the institutional ones,\" said Greg Friedman, CEO of Peachtree Group, an Atlanta-based commercial real estate investment firm.\n\"It's a reflection of a lack of discipline in underwriting and market conditions going against them,\" Friedman said of Yieldstreet's track record. \"Anything done after 2022, they should have done more carefully knowing that we are in a higher-rate environment.\"\nIn late 2022, Yieldstreet even told investors that real estate was a \"safe(er) haven\" asset during periods of rising rates and high inflation. By then, the Fed's intent to squash inflation with higher rates was well understood.\n\"Real estate can be an effective inflation hedge, carries low correlation to traditional markets, and has even benefitted in times of market downturns, generating outsized returns,\" the startup said in a blog post at the time.\nIn the post, Yieldstreet gave the example of the Alterra Apartments, a multifamily project in Tucson, Arizona, where it said rent increases and a contractual cap on interest rates protected it from the Fed hikes.\nBut this year, Yieldstreet told investors in the $23 million deal that the Tucson development was in technical default and headed for a full write-off.\n'Mind-boggling'\nCustomers interviewed by CNBC accuse the company of downplaying investment risks and say that its disclosures around performance can be sloppy or misleading.\nMark Underhill, a 57-year-old software engineer, said he invested $600,000 across 22 Yieldstreet funds and faces $200,000 in losses on projects that are on watchlist and have never made payouts.\n\"With any investment, there's a risk of loss,\" Underhill said. \"But there's no consideration of these type of gut-punch losses. They talked about how their deals were backed by collateral, and they gave you all these reasons that make you feel there's something left if the deal goes south.\"\nUnderhill, who was treated with chemotherapy for multiple myeloma last year and travels the American West in a camper van, said his losses are forcing him to work beyond his expected retirement date.\n\"The thing that is mind-boggling is, how did they fail so badly on so many deals in so many markets?\" Underhill said.\nThe offering sheet for the Upper West Side project said sales prices would have to plunge 35% for Yieldstreet members to see any losses, a worse hit than what New York experienced during the 2008 recession, Klish wrote in his July complaint to the SEC.\nBut the project defaulted even though prices in the area didn't fall by that much, Klish wrote.\nIn another example, while participants in the Nashville deals got letters showing a complete loss, or a -100% return, Yieldstreet's public-facing website listed a 0% internal rate of return, or IRR, giving the false impression that investors got all their capital back.\nAfter CNBC asked Yieldstreet for comment on the discrepancy, the website was updated to reflect the -100% return.\nThe company also stopped issuing quarterly portfolio snapshots after early 2023, making it harder for prospective investors to see how Yieldstreet's overall investments are performing.\nSo besides marketing materials, customers are mostly left to rely on the company's disclosures about its performance as a gauge of whether to invest with the startup.\nYieldstreet says it updates its metrics quarterly, and its website shows a 7.4% internal rate of return through March 2025 across all investments. That period likely excludes the impact of the Nashville defaults, which were disclosed in May 2025.\n'Winter is coming'\nYieldstreet's real estate woes threaten to wipe out decades of savings for Louis Litz, a 61-year-old electrical engineer from Ambler, Pennsylvania.\nSeeking income and stability, Litz put $480,000 into Yieldstreet funds, he said. Three of those projects have defaulted, while seven developments are on watchlist, he said.\n\"At least half of this stuff is going under,\" Litz said. \"I'm 61, so there's no way I can really recover.\"\nUnder its new CEO, Caplan, Yieldstreet has decided to pivot away from a business model of mostly offering bespoke investments like the ones that cratered for its real estate customers.\nThis month, Yieldstreet said that it officially became a broker-dealer, allowing it to offer funds from outside asset managers including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group. The plan is to become a distribution platform where 70% of funds are from these established Wall Street giants, Caplan said this month.\nThe move is worlds away from the confidence that Yieldstreet co-founder Weisz had in the company's original model.\nIn the 2020 CNBC interview, Weisz said that he often reminded his staff that \"winter is coming\" and to prepare for turbulence.\nYieldstreet would protect its customers from losses because of the underlying collateral the firm was investing in: real buildings with tenants in sought-after locations all over the country, Weisz said.\n\"I'm not here to tell you that Milind and Michael are the world's smartest investors and there's never going to be something that goes wrong,\" Weisz said, referencing himself and his co-founder. \"We understand that when winter comes, there will be challenges, but we take comfort in knowing that there's underlying collateral.\"\n\"Anybody could put money out,\" Weisz said. \"It's about bringing it back home.\"\n\u2014 CNBC's Gabriel Cortes contributed to this report.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:27:56 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html", "tag": "economy"}, {"domain": "www.cnbc.com", "title": "Novo Nordisk offers diabetes drug Ozempic for less than half the price for cash-paying U.S. patients", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/18/novo-nordisk-offers-diabetes-drug-ozempic-for-steep-cash-discount.html", "text": "Novo Nordisk on Monday said it now offers cash-paying U.S. patients its blockbuster diabetes treatment Ozempic for less than half its monthly list price, as drugmakers face mounting political pressure to lower prices in the country.\nPatients can pay $499 in cash per month for three dose sizes of Ozempic. They can get the price through platforms including the drug's official website, Novo Nordisk's patient assistance program and the company's recently launched direct-to-consumer online pharmacy, the latter of which also ships the injection directly to patients' homes.\nDrug savings company GoodRx will also offer Ozempic and its weight loss counterpart Wegovy for $499 per month, making the discounts available at more than 70,000 pharmacies nationwide, according to a Novo Nordisk release.\nNovo Nordisk's cash-pay offering will expand access to eligible Type 2 diabetes patients who don't have insurance coverage for the weekly injection. In March, the company began to offer Wegovy for half its list price to cash-paying Americans.\nOzempic's list price before insurance and other rebates is almost $1,350 per month, and has been a frequent target of political and public blowback in recent years. The new offer comes after President Donald Trump in July sent separate letters to Novo Nordisk and 16 other drugmakers, calling on them to take steps to lower medication prices in the U.S. Among other suggested actions, he urged them to adopt models that sell medicines directly to consumers or businesses.\nThe efforts aim to make Ozempic and Wegovy available to more people, while also ensuring that patients use the branded medication instead of cheaper compounded copycats. Those drugs exploded in popularity during a now-resolved U.S. shortage of Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, the active ingredient in both drugs.\nWhile Ozempic \"is well covered in the US, let's not forget that there are some patients who pay out-of-pocket for this vital medicine,\" Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations and global business development at Novo Nordisk, said in the release. \"We believe that if even a single patient feels the need to turn to potentially unsafe and unapproved knockoff alternatives, that's one too many.\"\nEli Lilly has similarly moved to slash the price of its popular obesity and diabetes drugs for cash-paying patients.

It is the first utility in the U.S. to sign a power purchase agreement with an advanced reactor like Hermes 2, according to the companies.\nHermes 2 is the first deployment under an agreement that Google and Kairos signed last year to launch the startup's nuclear technology at a commercial scale. The reactor's output is the equivalent of the consumption of about 36,000 homes. The electricity will help power Google's data centers in Montgomery County, Tennessee, and Jackson County, Alabama.\nGoogle, Kairos and TVA said their collaboration will move the U.S. a step closer to deploying advanced nuclear reactors by making sure consumers are not on the hook for the cost of building the plant.\nKairos and Google will bear the financial risk associated with building the first-of-a-kind project, the companies said. TVA, meanwhile, is providing the revenue stream the plant will need to operate through the power purchase agreement.\n\"We think this solves the problem of making sure that consumers don't carry that first-of-a-kind cost and risk,\" TVA CEO Don Moul told CNBC. \"But it also allows innovators like Kairos Power and thought leaders like Google to bring this to market.\"\nHermes 2 is expected to start operating at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in 2030. Kairos received a construction permit for the reactor from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in November 2024. It will need to apply for an operating license with the NRC before the plant can start operations.\nTVA declined to disclose how much it will pay for electricity from Hermes 2 when asked by CNBC. Kairos declined to disclose the estimated cost of the plant.\nBuilding nuclear again\nThe U.S. has basically stopped building nuclear plants due to the huge cost overruns and delays that plague the industry. The last two reactors built in the U.S. at Plant Vogtle in Georgia cost $18 billion more than expected and started operations seven years behind schedule in 2023 and 2024. The project's problems contributed to the bankruptcy of industry stalwart Westinghouse.\nStartups like Kairos believe their smaller plants will prove to be faster and more affordable to build than large reactors like those at Vogtle, helping to usher in a new era of nuclear construction in the U.S. Despite these promises, utilities have been reluctant to commit to small advanced reactors over concerns about the initial price tag.\nTechnology companies like Google, meanwhile, are investing in advanced nuclear because they want reliable, carbon-free power to meet the demand from artificial intelligence while adhering to their environmental goals. Google has placed orders with Kairos for reactors totaling 500 megawatts of power that are targeted to come online through 2035.\n\"We specifically want to help commercialize,\" Amanda Peterson Corio, Google's global head of data center energy, told CNBC. \"We want to see how can we take this from something small to something bigger that we can deploy at scale. That's really what the Hermes 2 project is doing.\"\nOne of Kairos' goals with Hermes 2 is to create a standardized reactor design which will help cut the cost of future deployments, CEO Mike Laufer told CNBC. Kairos will also develop the supply and manufacturing infrastructure needed to launch at scale through the construction of Hermes 2, he said.\n\"We'd be ready to deploy multiple reactors in series at the same sites in a very cost-efficient way to deliver that power at affordable rates in the not too distant future,\" Laufer said. Kairos and Google are exploring options on where future plants will be deployed, he said.\nOak Ridge, TVA nuke hub\nKairos' technology is different than the reactors currently operating in the U.S. Its reactor design uses liquid salt as the coolant rather than light water, which allows the plant to operate at near atmospheric pressure. This means Kairos can use thinner and less expensive materials because the reactor is not under high pressure. Operating at low pressure also has safety advantages.\nThe 50-megawatt plant is also much smaller than the reactors in the current U.S. fleet that average 1,000 megawatts in output, which is enough to power an entire city. The Kairos reactor will increase its output to 75 megawatts when it launches on a commercial scale, Laufer said.\nHermes 2 will be deployed near Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which has a long history in nuclear science dating back to the Manhattan Project during World War II. TVA was established by Congress during the Great Depression as a public corporation to electrify the region. The utility remains owned by the federal government.\n\"This kind of sets the stage for east Tennessee to really be what we see as a regional hub for innovation for nuclear construction and operation, and that's going to be valuable for the nation as well,\" Laufer said.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:50:39 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html", "tag": "economy"}, {"domain": "www.cnbc.com", "title": "'Job hugging' has replaced job-hopping, consultants say", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/18/job-hugging-job-hopping.html", "text": "The so-called great resignation has become the \"great stay.\" But experts say workers aren't just staying \u2014 they're \"job hugging.\"\nJob hugging is the act of holding onto a job \"for dear life,\" consultants at Korn Ferry, an organizational consulting firm, wrote last week.\nSuch clinging is a stark contrast from the historic rate of job-hopping that workers exhibited in 2021 and 2022, but makes sense given current labor market trends.\n\"There is this stagnation in the labor market, where the hires, quits and layoff rates are low,\" said Laura Ullrich, director of economic research in North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab. \"There's just not a lot of movement at all.\"\n'Uncertainty in the world'\nThe rate at which workers are voluntarily leaving their jobs has lingered near lows unseen since around 2016, outside of the initial days of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe so-called quits rate is a barometer of workers' perceptions of the broader labor market, Ullrich said. In this case, they may be nervous about getting another job or aren't enthusiastic about their ability to find one, she said.\n\"There's quite a bit of uncertainty in the world \u2014 economic, political, global \u2014 and I think uncertainty causes people to naturally\" remain in a holding pattern, said Matt Bohn, an executive search consultant at Korn Ferry.\nHe equated the dynamic to skittish investors who sometimes sit on the sidelines, waiting for an investment opportunity.\nThe job market has also gradually cooled amid a regime of higher interest rates, which makes it more costly for businesses to borrow money and expand their operations.\nThe hiring rate over the past year or so has plunged to its lowest pace in more than a decade (excluding the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic) \u2014 meaning those who want to look for a new job may have a relatively tough time finding one.\nJob growth in recent months has also slowed sharply, which economists point to as evidence of a broader economic slowdown.\nMore CEOs reported plans to shrink their workforce over the next 12 months than expand it \u2014 the first time that's occurred since 2020, according to a Conference Board quarterly poll published earlier this month.

Employers may also decide such workers are no longer meeting their performance standards, he added.\nAdditionally, a lack of movement in the job market may make it harder for new entrants like recent graduates to find work, Ullrich said.\nCorrection: This article has been updated to correct the timing of the Korn Ferry and Conference Board reports.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:10:22 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html", "tag": "economy"}, {"domain": "www.cnbc.com", "title": "Versant to rename MSNBC, drop famed peacock logos in Comcast separation", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/18/comcast-versant-rename-msnbc-peacock-logos.html", "text": "MSNBC will change its name later this year and drop the storied peacock image from its branding \u2014 the first real public-facing changes in Versant's upcoming separation from Comcast's NBCUniversal.\nThe political news network will be renamed My Source News Opinion World, or MS Now, Versant Chief Executive Officer Mark Lazarus wrote in an internal memo to employees that was seen by CNBC.\nIn January, Lazarus told a group of MSNBC staffers that the network wouldn't change its name.

At the same time, the burden of investing for retirement has shifted to workers.\nFor much of the 20th century, the American retirement system relied on what economists call the three-legged stool: Social Security, employer pensions and personal savings.\nBut one of those legs, Social Security, has a looming funding shortfall that has left some workers concerned about what kind of retirement benefits they may receive.\nAnother leg, pensions, has rapidly declined for private sector workers. In 1989, 63% of full-time workers at companies with more than 100 employees had pensions, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As of early 2023, only about 15% of private industry workers did.\nWorkers now largely depend on 401(k)s and other defined-contribution plans, which rely on them to determine how much to contribute and how to invest those funds.\nSome younger workers are rising to the challenge. Younger workers today often have more money in retirement accounts by age 30 than boomers did, according to Federal Reserve research.\n\"Millennials are saving at a higher rate at this age than Gen Xers or Boomers,\" said Christine Mahoney, global pensions leader at the pension consulting firm Mercer. \"So I guess I would say if they're nervous and it's making them save, that's not necessarily a bad thing.\"\nBut personal savings may not be enough. Unexpected medical bills, market downturns or job losses can quickly derail even disciplined savers, leading to what experts call 401(k) \"leakage.\" Add in the growing weight of student loan debt, and retirement becomes even harder to afford for some workers.\nIs working longer the solution?\nSome policymakers and economists say extended careers could help Americans close their retirement gaps.\n\"We have more options for extended work lives today than we've ever had before, and Americans are taking advantage of them,\" said Andrew Biggs, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\nThe number of employed Americans age 65 and older grew 33.2% between 2015 and 2024, according to a CNBC analysis of BLS data.\nBiggs also emphasized that older workers continue to bring value to the labor force. \"There's great demand for older workers,\" he said. \"They still have a lot of skills, a lot left to give, and so they can be valuable to employers.\"\nBut others say that perspective doesn't align with how the labor market actually works.\n\"The labor market doesn't always want you when you want the labor market,\" said Ghilarducci. \"Employers have the biggest role in the decision about whether or not you work and what the quality of your work is.\"\nWatch the video above to learn more about why Americans may end up working longer than their parents and whether planning to work longer will actually help people in retirement.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:00:01 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html", "tag": "economy"}, {"domain": "www.economist.com", "title": "Five dangerous fault lines divide Trump and Zelensky", "url": "https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2025/08/18/five-dangerous-fault-lines-divide-trump-and-zelensky", "text": "Five dangerous fault lines divide Trump and Zelensky\nThey are likely to feature in the Oval Office showdown\nOn August 18th Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, will enter the White House to meet Donald Trump and discuss ending the war in Ukraine.

As of June 2025, the fund held stakes in 61 Israeli companies. Last week the fund announced that it had sold holdings in 17 companies due to various economic criteria, and now it is reporting that it has sold its holdings in six additional companies. Norwegian financial newspaper \"E24,\" reports that the fund now holds shares in only 38 Israeli companies, and the amount of the investments has been reduced by at least $400 million.\nThe wealth fund, which manages about $2 trillion worldwide and before the disinvestment managed about $2 billion in investments in Israel, did not disclose the names of the six companies from which it is currently in the process of disinvesting. It announced that it will do so as soon as the sale process is completed. In the past year, the fund also sold its holdings in Bezeq and Paz due to their activities in the territories. Decisions on disinvestment due to alleged violations of international law are made by the fund's ethics committee, which reviewed its Israel investments following a request from the government earlier this month.\nNot selling all its Israeli holdings\nThe Norwegian sovereign wealth fund's CEO Nicolai Tangen said last week that the fund, \"Plans ending its investments in additional Israeli companies,\" as has been announced today. However, the fund announced that it is not selling all its investments in Israel. During the restructuring of investments announced last week, the fund announced that it was also terminating its relationship with the financial institutions that manage its investments in Israel, and that it would manage them independently.\nTangen was responding to the public uproar in Norway in recent weeks, when a group of Palestinian activists protested that the fund held shares in Beit Shemesh Engines, which it alleged has links to the Israeli Air Force. The government said that the companies in the wealth fund\u2019s portfolio should be \"seriously reviewed,\" and the fund pledged to do so by August 20. Tangen took \"personal\" responsibility for not examining the investments sooner and continued to rely, he said, on the Israeli financial institutions that managed the investments.\nThe issue has become politically charged, with more than 65% of Norwegians supporting the complete sale of all of the fund's investments in Israel, according to surveys. Norway goes to the polls next month, with its center-left government struggling to hold on to power. The left-wing opposition in Norway, as well as public opinion, has turned sharply against Israel since the Hamas terror attacks of October 7 and the war in Gaza.\nThe fund's statement quoted in Norwegian media said, \"(Israel\u2019s) violations have become more serious since October 7, 2023, and they have become even more serious in 2025. The ethics committee has therefore tightened its requirements for companies involved in the (Israeli-Palestinian) conflict. Accordingly, the fund recommended in July to divest investments from six additional Israeli companies that are considered to be contributing to Israel\u2019s violation of international law.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 18, 2025.\n\u00a9 Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:00:00 GMT", "author": "Assaf Uni", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725", "tag": "economy"}, {"domain": "en.globes.co.il", "title": "Rafael teams with Lulav Space on precise drone interception", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001519239#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Israeli defense electronics company Rafael Advanced Defense Systems has signed a collaboration agreement with Haifa-based startup Lulav Space for the development of a drone interception system, sources close to the matter have told \"Globes.\" For Rafael, this is a major project that could be a force multiplier for it in the field.\nLulav Space, founded in 2021 by engineers from the Beresheet 1 Space IL project, is developing precise guidance and navigation systems based on vision and image analysis. The company has raised $1.5 million from Angular Ventures, and has become a prominent player in the field of space exploration sensors - its systems are lighter, more efficient and cheaper than those based on radar or lidar (laser-assisted measurement).\nThe sensors Lulav Space has developed can operate in all satellite orbits from a low altitude of 200-2,000 km (LEO), to an altitude of 36,000 km (GEO). The company has been chosen to provide landing sensors for the \"Beresheet 2\" mission, which was suspended in April.\nIn March, Israeli aerospace company Parazero Technologies (Nasdaq: PRZO) signed a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) to acquire Lulav Space. The deal, which is subject to due diligence and final agreements, was due to be completed in the second quarter. The purpose of the Lulav acquisition was to add autonomous guidance capabilities and EO/IR sensor systems (Electro-Optics/Infrared) for ParaZero's anti-UAV protection system DefenseAir.\nThe main advantage: navigation without GPS\nLulav's autonomous navigation capabilities are not dependent on GPS, which is a critical advantage in airspace saturated with disruptions. Measures such as jamming (disruption of communications) or spoofing (injecting false signals) directly harm the control and navigation capabilities of drones and UAVs.\nIn jamming, communication between the operator and the vehicle is disrupted, until the drone lands or crashes when the battery runs out. In spoofing, an incorrect signal is sent that diverts the drone from its course. Israelis suffered the consequences of such disruptions during periods of escalation with Hezbollah and Iran, when civilian navigation applications like Waze were disrupted.\nAlong with the new collaboration, Rafael recently established a dedicated directorate for threats at extremely low altitude ranges, within the company's Air Defense Division. The division responsible for Iron Dome, David's Sling and the Spider system, which was recently chosen by the Romanian Ministry of Defense in a deal worth \u20ac1.9 billion, will also integrate the Iron Beam laser defense system into Israel's multi-layered air defense array, towards the end of 2025. \"This cooperation creates synergy between Rafael's R&D capabilities, knowledge and operationally proven systems - and the flexibility, creativity and technological innovation of Lulav Space,\" explains Rsafael VP and Managing Director C-UAS & Low Altitude Air & Missile Defense Systems Yossi Margalit. \"This combination will allow us to quickly develop interception solutions for an evolving range of enemy scenarios, cheap and effective solutions at a level never before seen on the global market.\"\nLulav Space cofounder and CEO Dr. Noam Leiter says that the company sees the agreement with Rafael as a leap forward. \"It allows us to bring to move ahead with the unique capabilities we have developed - technology that will help break into new markets and reduce barriers to entry, especially in terms of price. We are currently working with the director of the Israel Low Altitude Defense Administration on integrating a variety of new applications with advanced technology for intercepting drones and UAVs, from the level of a single threat to protection against a swarm of threats.\"\nIs demand moderating following the war?\nRafael is working to expand its collaborations with various Israeli startups, and not only in the field of air defense. On deep tech, for example, which has raised more than $560 billion in the last decade in the US, the company is collaborating with Israeli investment company Elron Ventures to enable tech startups to reduce the risk gap between early development and commercial implementation.\nLooking ahead, Markets and Markets estimates that the market for dealing with UAVs is expected to grow from $4.5 billion annually today to $14.5 billion by the end of the decade. Rafael hopes that the new partnership will help it capture a major share of this developing market.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 18, 2025.\n\u00a9 Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:03:00 GMT", "author": "Dean Shmuel Elmas", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725", "tag": "economy"}, {"domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "Newsmax pays $67 million to settle defamation case linked to 2020 election coverage", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2025/08/18/nx-s1-5506062/newsmax-pays-67-million-to-settle-defamation-case-linked-to-2020-election-coverage", "text": "Newsmax pays $67 million to settle defamation case linked to 2020 election coverage\nNewsmax will pay $67 million to settle one of the last outstanding defamation lawsuits against a news organization for airing false claims that the 2020 election was rigged.\nDenver-based Dominion Voting Systems \u2013 the same voting-technology company that had received a $787 million settlement from Fox News over its election coverage \u2013 brought the lawsuit against Newsmax.

It will also remove NBC\u2019s peacock symbol from its logo as part of the change, which will take effect later this year.\nThe name change was ordered by NBC Universal, which last November spun off cable networks USA, CNBC, MSNBC, E! Entertainment, Oxygen and the Golf Channel into its own company, called Versant. None of the other networks are changing their name.\nMSNBC got its name upon its formation in 1996, as a partnership then between Microsoft and NBC.\nName changes always carry an inherent risk, and MSNBC President Rebecca Kutler said that for employees, it is hard to imagine the network under a different name. \u201cThis was not a decision that was made quickly or without significant debate,\u201d she said in a memo to staff.\n\u201cDuring this time of transition, NBC Universal decided that our brand requires a new, separate identity,\u201d she said. \u201cThis decision now allows us to set our own course and assert our indepedence as we continue to build our own modern newsgathering organization.\u201d\nStill, it\u2019s noteworthy that the business channel CNBC is leaving \u201cNBC\u201d in its name. MSNBC argues that CNBC has always maintained a greater separation and, with its business focus, is less likely to cover many of the same topics.\nStill, the affiliation between a news division that tries to play it safe and one that doesn\u2019t hide its liberal bent has long caused tension. President Donald Trump refers to the cable network as \u201cMSDNC,\u201d for Democratic National Committee. Even before the corporate change, NBC News has been reducing the use of its personalities on MSNBC.\nSome NBC News personalities, like Jacob Soboroff, Vaughn Hillyard, Brandy Zadrozny and Antonia Hylton, have joined MSNBC.

A new report from The Conference Board shows a sharp decline in usage of the words \u201cdiversity,\u201d \u201cracial,\u201d \u201cgender,\u201d or \u201cDEI\u201d in corporate filings of the largest U.S. public companies.\nMore than a third of S&P 100 companies have stopped using the term \u201cequity\u201d altogether. And use of \u201cDEI\u201d declined 68% from 2024 to 2025 in the major filings of S&P 500 companies, according to the report. The study was based on an analysis of public companies\u2019 2025 Form 10-Ks, the legally required annual reports that provide a summary of a company\u2019s financial performance and business operations.\nIt\u2019s not surprising at a time when many large companies have announced rollbacks of their DEI programs in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive orders. I\u2019ve heard from many C-Suite executives who\u2019ve wondered whether keeping these initiatives\u2014many enacted in response to the murder of George Floyd and the nationwide racial reckoning that followed in 2020\u2014opened them up to heightened legal risk.\nEven if some companies are continuing their diversity and equity efforts, they\u2019re less likely to trumpet that on their 10-K form, said Ani Huang, senior executive vice president of the HR Policy Association, a nonprofit public policy organization. \u201cIf in the current environment, it\u2019s something that could actually wind up harming the company or putting a target on their back or triggering political consequences that are not in line with what the actual goal is, they just won\u2019t use that disclosure,\u201d she explained.\nReports of workforce demographic data, which many U.S. public companies have voluntarily disclosed in recent years, have also fallen. The share of companies disclosing data on women in management dropped by 16%, and those reporting the overall share of women in their workforce fell by 14%.\nBoard diversity disclosure fared similarly.

The message was meant to intimidate and was an illustration that 21st-century war is waged not just on land, sea and air but also in cyberspace and the reaches of outer space.\nDisabling a satellite could deal a devastating blow without one bullet, and it can be done by targeting the satellite\u2019s security software or disrupting its ability to send or receive signals from Earth.\n\u201cIf you can impede a satellite\u2019s ability to communicate, you can cause a significant disruption,\u201d said Tom Pace, CEO of NetRise, a cybersecurity firm focused on protecting supply chains.\n\u201cThink about GPS,\u201d said Pace, who served in the Marines before working on cyber issues at the Department of Energy. \u201cImagine if a population lost that and the confusion it would cause.\u201d\nSatellites are the short-term challenge\nMore than 12,000 operating satellites now orbit the planet, playing a critical role not just in broadcast communications but also in military operations, navigation systems like GPS, intelligence gathering and economic supply chains. They are also key to early launch-detection efforts, which can warn of approaching missiles.\nThat makes them a significant national security vulnerability, and a prime target for anyone looking to undermine an adversary\u2019s economy or military readiness \u2014 or deliver a psychological blow like the hackers supporting Russia did when they hijacked television signals to Ukraine.\nHackers typically look for the weakest link in the software or hardware that supports a satellite or controls its communications with Earth. The actual orbiting device may be secure, but if it\u2019s running on outdated software, it can be easily exploited.\nAs Russian forces invaded Ukraine in 2022, someone targeted Viasat, the U.S.-based satellite company used by Ukraine\u2019s government and military. The hack, which Kyiv blamed on Moscow, used malware to infect tens of thousands of modems, creating an outage affecting wide swaths of Europe.\nNational security officials say Russia is developing a nuclear, space-based weapon designed to take out virtually every satellite in low-Earth orbit at once. The weapon would combine a physical attack that would ripple outward, destroying more satellites, while the nuclear component is used to fry their electronics.\nU.S. officials declassified information about the weapon after Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, issued a public warning about the technology. Turner has pushed for the Department of Defense to provide a classified briefing to lawmakers on the weapon, which, if deployed, would violate an international treaty prohibiting weapons of mass destruction in space.\nTurner said such a weapon could render low-Earth orbit unusable for satellites for as long as a year. If it were used, the effects would be devastating: potentially leaving the U.S. and its allies vulnerable to economic upheaval and even a nuclear attack.\nRussia and China also would lose satellites, though they are believed to be less reliant on the same kinds of satellites as the U.S.\nTurner compared the weapon, which is not yet ready for deployment, to Sputnik, the Russian satellite that launched the space age in 1957.\n\u201cIf this anti-satellite nuclear weapon would be put in space, it would be the end of the space age,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt should never be permitted to go into outer space. This is the Cuban Missile Crisis in space.\u201d\nMining the moon and beyond\nValuable minerals and other materials found on the moon and in asteroids could lead to future conflicts as nations look to exploit new technologies and energy sources.\nActing NASA Administrator Sean Duffy announced plans this month to send a small nuclear reactor to the moon, saying it\u2019s important the U.S. does so before China or Russia.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a race to the moon, in a race with China to the moon,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cTo have a base on the moon, we need energy and some of the key locations on the moon. \u2026 We want to get there first and claim that for America.\u201d\nThe moon is rich in a material known as helium 3, which scientists believe could be used in nuclear fusion to generate huge amounts of energy. While that technology is decades away, control over the moon in the intervening years could determine which countries emerge as superpowers, according to Joseph Rooke, a London-based cybersecurity expert who has worked in the U.K. defense industry and is now director of risk insights at the firm Recorded Future.\nThe end of the Cold War temporarily halted a lot of investments in space, but competition is likely to increase as the promise of mining the moon becomes a reality.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t sci-fi. It\u2019s quickly becoming a reality,\u201d Rooke said. \u201cIf you dominate Earth\u2019s energy needs, that\u2019s game over.\u201d\nChina and Russia have announced plans for their own nuclear plants on the moon in the coming years, while the U.S. is planning missions to the moon and Mars. Artificial intelligence is likely to speed up the competition, as is the demand for the energy that AI requires.\nMessages left with Russia\u2019s Embassy in Washington were not returned.\nDespite its steps into outer space, China opposes any extraterrestrial arms race, according to Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for China\u2019s Embassy in Washington. He said it is the U.S. that is threatening to militarize the final frontier.\n\u201cIt has kept expanding military strength in space, created space military alliances, and attempted to turn space into a war zone,\u201d Liu said. \u201cChina urges the U.S. to stop spreading irresponsible rhetoric, stop expanding military build-up in space, and make due contribution to upholding the lasting peace and security in space.\u201d\nWhat the US is doing about security in space\nNations are scrambling to create their own rocket and space programs to exploit commercial prospects and ensure they aren\u2019t dependent on foreign satellites. It\u2019s an expensive and difficult proposition, as demonstrated last week when the first Australian-made rocket crashed after 14 seconds of flight.\nThe U.S. Space Force was created in 2019 to protect American interests in space and to defend U.S. satellites from attacks from adversaries.\nThe space service is far smaller than the more well-established services like the Army, Navy or Air Force, but it\u2019s growing, and the White House is expected to announce a location for its headquarters soon. Colorado and Alabama are both candidates.\nThe U.S. military operates an unmanned space shuttle used to conduct classified military missions and research. The craft, known as the X-37B, recently returned to Earth after more than a year in orbit.\nThe Space Force called access to space a vital national security interest.\n\u201cSpace is a warfighting domain, and it is the Space Force\u2019s job to contest and control its environment to achieve national security objectives,\u201d it said in the statement.\nAmerican dominance in space has been largely unquestioned for decades following the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union. But the new threats and competition posed by Russia and China show the need for an aggressive response, U.S. officials say.\nThe hope, Turner said, is that the U.S. can take steps to ensure Russia and China can\u2019t get the upper hand, and the frightening potential of space weapons is not realized.\n\u201cYou have to pay attention to these things so they don\u2019t happen,\u201d Turner said.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:46:23 +0000", "author": "David Klepper, The Associated Press", "source": "https://fortune.com/feed/fortune-feeds/?id=3230629", "tag": "economy"}, {"domain": "www.benzinga.com", "title": "If You Invested $1000 In This Stock 5 Years Ago, You Would Have This Much Today", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/insights/news/25/08/47186484/if-you-invested-1000-in-this-stock-5-years-ago-you-would-have-this-much-today", "text": "Krystal Biotech KRYS has outperformed the market over the past 5 years by 12.38% on an annualized basis producing an average annual return of 26.0%.

The two leaders described their meeting as \"productive,\" without providing specific details at their press conference.\nTrump has pushed to end the 3.5-year war that has left 1 million killed and wounded since his 2024 presidential campaign. He wants to end a conflict that has crippled the Russian and Ukrainian economies, disrupted much-needed energy supplies, and strained EU-US ties.\nFollowing the talks, West Texas Intermediate oil opened the week at $62.59 per barrel, nearly 1% lower compared to Friday\u2019s closing price, before fully retracing the loss.\nPutin Agrees To Ukraine Security Guarantee\nDuring the post-meeting press conference in Anchorage, Putin didn't signal any willingness to end the war. He reiterated his point that the \"root causes\" of the invasion must be eliminated, pointing to NATO's eastward expansion.\nTrump noted at the press conference that \"there's no deal until there's a deal.\" Putin added that he hoped that Europe would accept the US-Russian talks as \"constructive\" and \"not try to disrupt the emerging progress.\"\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday on ABC that \"both sides\" were going to have to make concessions to end the conflict.\nWhile Trump and Putin negotiated, Russia continued its bombardments against civilian infrastructure in eastern Ukraine. In response, Ukraine used drones to strike Russian territory.\nTwo days after the summit, Special US envoy Steve Witkoff said that Putin agreed to allow the US and Europe to offer Ukraine a security guarantee. It would resemble NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the war.\n\"We were able to win the following concession: That the US could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,\u201d Witkoff said on Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u2018State of the Union\u2019.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU will move forward next month with its 19th sanctions package against Russia if the Kremlin refuses to halt its war.

They said Ukraine has received \"nothing\" out of the talks.\nWolfgang Ischinger, former head of the Munich Security Conference, wrote on X: \"1:0 for Putin \u2013 no new sanctions. For the Ukrainians: nothing. For Europe: extremely disappointing.\"\nKaja Kallas, the EU High Commissioner for Foreign and Security Policy, noted that \"the harsh reality is that Russia has no intention to end the war anytime soon.\"\nRussia \"faces a very angry UK and Europe, who want to break Putin's hold on power, and force a change in government,\" Theodore Karasik, a Non-Resident Fellow, Jamestown Foundation, Washington DC, told European Capital Insights. \"Russia has prepared for this.\"\nRussian Officials Applaud Trump's Peace Efforts\nRussian officials, in contrast to their European counterparts, welcomed the peace talks.\nDmitri Medvedev, the deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, wrote on Telegram that the summit resumed a \"full-fledged mechanism for meetings\u2026without threats or ultimatums.\" Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova pointed to \"the red carpet that greeted the Russian president in the US.\"\n\"Putin was brought out of the cold in Alaska,\" Lutsevych said. \"Rather than limiting space to wage war in Europe, Trump offered him the opposite \u2013 a delay in imposing secondary sanctions on his oil export customers.\"\nTrump said after the summit in an interview with Fox News that he would hold off imposing sanctions on China for buying large amounts of Russian oil. Trump didn't discuss India, which is subject to a 50% tariff on US imports, including a 25% penalty for imports from Russia.\nPutin Faces A Difficult Economic Situation\nPutin, though, faces an increasingly difficult situation \u2013 the war has hurt the country's economy. Russia has started to struggle with the weight of international sanctions and the human and financial costs of the war.\nThe economy has slowed this year, compared to last. Russia\u2019s gross domestic product expanded by 1.9% in April of 2024, following a 1.1% rise the previous month. It is significantly down from the start of the year.\nInflation remains persistently high at 8.8% July and 9.9% in June. It has eased from 10.3% in March, according to data from Trading Economics.\nRussia will spend 8% of its gross domestic product ($172 billion) on military and national needs in 2025, according to Alexandra Prokopenko, an expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\"The Russian economy is slogging along, but has several structural problems that the government is trying to deal with now,\" Karasik said. \"Russia will be \u2018ok' for the next few years, but the war can't go on indefinitely.\"\nDisclaimer:\nAny opinions expressed in this article are not to be considered investment advice and are solely those of the authors.

Check the chart here.\nThat's the take from Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, who said the economy \"is too resilient and inflation is not close enough to 2.0% for Fed officials to muck around with easing.\"\nThe S&P 500 \u2013 as tracked by the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO \u2013 has jumped 3.4% since August 1, when a weaker-than-expected jobs report triggered bets on easier monetary policy. The index closed at another record high last Thursday, highlighting the bullish mood among stock investors.\nYet markets are already pricing in a cut, and the potential policy shift is adding fuel to Wall Street's fire.\nInflation Says A Rate Cut Is Not Needed\nHowever, last week, signs of inflationary pressures re-emerged, questioning the urgency of a Fed move in September.\nThe July Consumer Price Index held steady at 2.7% year-over-year, but it was the Producer Price Index that delivered a jolt. Prices at the wholesale level surged 0.9% month-over-month, the largest monthly increase in three years, pushing the annual rate to 3.3%\u2014well above expectations of 2.7%.\nThat development could be a red flag.\nYardeni said that \"Trump's tariffs aren't pushing inflation higher (so far), but they may have caused inflation to stall around 3.0% rather than falling to the Fed's 2.0% target.\"\nHow Much Higher Can Stocks Go?\nIf the Fed cuts interest rates, stock market valuations may reach bubble territory.\nThe Buffett Ratio\u2014calculated as the ratio of total market cap to GDP\u2014rose to a record 3.1 in mid-August.\nThe S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio hit 22.5 that week, just 11% away from the Tech Bubble peak of 25.0 in 2000.\nSince the April lows, tech and AI-heavy sectors are up 50.7%, while the S&P 500 gained 28.2% as of last Friday.\nYardeni warns that \"the only problem with melt-ups is that they are followed by meltdowns,\" drawing comparisons to the late 1990s' Tech Bubble and subsequent crash.\nFed Credibility Is Now At Stake\nIf the Federal Open Market Committee proceeds with a rate cut at its September 16-17 meeting despite elevated inflation, Yardeni says it could damage the Fed's credibility as an inflation-fighting institution.\nThat may trigger a response from the so-called \"Bond Vigilantes\"\u2014market participants who demand higher yields to compensate for inflation risks.\n\"It is up to them to maintain law and order in the credit markets now that the sheriff isn't doing so,\" Yardeni said.\nBond yields would remain elevated, frustrating President Trump's push to lower mortgage rates and revive the housing market.\nLast year, when the Fed cut rates, the 30-year mortgage rate paradoxically rose from 6.08% at the end of September to 6.95% by early February 2025.\nThe Fed now walks a tightrope.\n\u201cFor the Fed, a stock market meltup increases the likelihood of financial instability,\u201d Yardeni said.\nEase too early, and it may inflate an asset bubble. Hold rates steady, and it risks political pressure from the White House.\nWith inflation still hovering around 3% and economic activity resilient, a September rate cut might not be needed. However, if it does happen, markets could take off\u2014for better or worse.\nRead now:\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

For instance, you might experience mild headaches, backaches or other pain that takes days or weeks to heal. Regardless of how severe your injuries are, you may rack up significant medical debt to treat them, and there are many ways to help manage that debt.\nWork With Your Medical Provider\nMost hospitals have programs that provide charity assistance to those who can't afford their bills. This means that your debt might be forgiven even if it isn't paid as part of a settlement or judgment against the party that caused your injuries. Even if your debts aren't forgiven, your medical provider might be willing to provide a discount or otherwise work with you to ensure that you can pay your bills in a timely manner.\nDo You Have Insurance?\nIf you have medical insurance, your coverage provider may pay for most or all of the bills related to your accident. Most policies have out-of-pocket limits that cap how much you owe in a given year. For instance, if your maximum out-of-pocket is $5,000, you would only have to pay $5,000 even if your overall bills came to $100,000 or $1 million.\nBankruptcy May Help\nMedical debts can often be included as part of a bankruptcy proceeding. This means that they can be wiped out in the event that you can't afford what you owe because you can't work or because you take a pay cut after the wreck. Depending on your income and the type of assets that you own at the time of filing, it may be possible to have eligible debts discharged without losing property or making payments to creditors.\nBorrow Money from Friends or Family\nFriends, family members or colleagues may be willing to gift or lend funds to help you cover costs related to an accident. Any funds raised may be used to cover direct expenses such as medical bills or indirect costs such as the need to hire people to drive you to work or buy your groceries.\nPersonal Injury Claims Can Take Time\nIt's important to note that these strategies can be effective even if you do plan to pursue a personal injury claim at some point. This is because it can take months or even years to settle a case. Factors such as the severity of injuries, complicated liability and the complexity of the accident can impact the amount of time it takes to process your claim. Therefore, it's critical that you know and understand your options for staying financially afloat in the interim.\nIf you have been hurt in an accident, you may be entitled to compensation from one or more parties. However, there is no guarantee that you'll receive anything or that you'll receive it anytime soon. An attorney may be able to help you understand your rights or help create a strategy for paying medical bills without the benefit of a personal injury award.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:54:57 +0000", "author": "Jacob Mallinder", "source": "https://www.finance-monthly.com/feed/", "tag": "economy"}, {"domain": "www.finance-monthly.com", "title": "Judy Garland Net Worth 2025: Her Shocking Fortune & Hollywood Legacy Revealed", "url": "https://www.finance-monthly.com/judy-garland-net-worth/", "text": "Judy Garland may have been Hollywood\u2019s brightest star, but at her death she left behind just $40,000\u2014an astonishingly small fortune for the voice of The Wizard of Oz.\nFew Hollywood stars have inspired as much awe, heartbreak, and timeless admiration as Judy Garland. Known to millions as Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, she was one of the most iconic performers of the 20th century\u2014yet at the time of her death in 1969, Garland\u2019s net worth was a shockingly modest $40,000.\nHer story is one of glittering fame mixed with financial turmoil. Despite singing alongside Frank Sinatra and sharing the silver screen with Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland never achieved the financial stability that her talents deserved. Instead, a combination of studio contracts, personal struggles, and financial mismanagement left her with a surprisingly fragile estate.\nEven today, more than five decades later, fans continue to ask how such an extraordinary woman\u2014whose voice could fill concert halls and whose performances lit up Hollywood\u2014ended her life with so little compared to the fortune she generated for others.\nJudy Garland\u2019s $40,000 Net Worth at Death \u2014 What the Numbers Really Show\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s documented about how Judy Garland earned, spent, and ultimately left an estate widely reported at roughly $40,000 in liquid assets in June 1969\u2014and where those figures come from.\nWe know that Garland\u2019s money came in waves across film, television, records, and stage.\nMGM film salaries\nGarland signed with MGM as a teenager and, by 1939, was starring as Dorothy. Contemporary reporting and later retrospectives put her \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d pay at $500 per week, about $9,600 total across the shoot\u2014modest next to co-stars like the Tin Man and Scarecrow, and far below Clark Gable\u2013level studio pay at the time. The Los Angeles Times has cited that $500/week figure, which aligns with other historical accounts. According to the Los Angeles Times, \u201cGarland earned $500 a week\u201d on Oz.\nTelevision: The Judy Garland Show (1963\u201364)\nWhen network television came calling, the checks finally looked like superstar checks. Archival coverage recounted by Television Heaven notes Garland\u2019s $300,000 salary for 26 episodes (plus $140,000 earmarked for key production hires) on CBS\u2019s The Judy Garland Show, with press at the time touting the overall package as the biggest talent deal TV had ever attempted.\nWikipedia\u2019s bibliography on the series similarly summarizes the CBS offer reported in the press as a headline-making deal. CBS structured the series contract around a $300,000 star salary line and substantial production commitments.\nRecords and touring: the Carnegie Hall peak\nGarland\u2019s live career produced one of the most celebrated concert albums ever. Judy at Carnegie Hall (recorded April 23, 1961) spent weeks at No. 1 on the album chart and won Album of the Year and Best Female Vocal Performance at the 1962 GRAMMYs\u2014making Garland the first woman to win Album of the Year.\nThe GRAMMY artist page confirms the wins; Britannica and Carnegie Hall\u2019s own archive summarize the album\u2019s historic chart run. While per-album royalty statements aren\u2019t public, this was the commercial and critical apex of Garland\u2019s recording career, and it generated meaningful artist royalties and performance income in the early 1960s. The album topped charts and took home the industry\u2019s highest honors.\nBig-ticket stage engagements\nGarland\u2019s top-of-the-marquee status also commanded premium nightclub and theater fees through the 1950s\u201360s (for example, well-publicized Las Vegas residencies in the mid-50s). Exact nightly or weekly guarantees vary by engagement and aren\u2019t comprehensively documented in public ledgers, but the pattern is unambiguous: the stage paid handsomely when she was healthy\u2014and punished her finances when cancellations or disputes arose. Summary histories outline this late-career cycle of lucrative bookings and costly setbacks.\nHow so much of it disappeared\nTax liens and garnishments\nThe single clearest through-line in Garland\u2019s money story is debt to the U.S. government. By the early 1960s, the IRS had placed liens on her home and income streams, and in July 1967, federal tax agents seized most of her earnings on closing night of a blockbuster run at New York\u2019s Palace Theatre to cover back taxes. Contemporary reporting summarized in standard references details the seizure and liens; it\u2019s one of the most widely cited episodes in accounts of her finances. According to Wikipedia\u2019s chronology (sourced to period press and biographies), IRS actions hit her assets and live earnings directly.\nLegal disputes and alleged mismanagement\nMultiple biographies and archival summaries describe prolonged disputes with managers and agents, along with claims of mismanagement and embezzlement that left Garland covering expenses far beyond her personal spending. While individual lawsuit settlements aren\u2019t all public, the pattern\u2014high gross income offset by high advances, commissions, legal fees, and claw-backs\u2014recurs across reputable historical summaries.\nLifestyle and support obligations\nUnlike some peers who parked earnings in passive assets early, Garland\u2019s finances were frequently mobilized to support family, fund comebacks, and service debt. Public auction records and later family interviews also describe posthumous sales to raise cash, consistent with an estate that lacked large, liquid reserves.\nLos Angeles Times real-estate coverage documents properties associated with Garland (e.g., homes she owned or lived in), but those sales occurred decades later under different owners\u2014useful for provenance, less so for reconstructing her 1969 balance sheet. A Hollywood Hills home associated with Garland later sold for $4.675 million (2020), illustrating the long-term appreciation of properties tied to her name rather than cash she held at death.\nWhat she had\u2014and didn\u2019t\u2014at the end\nLiquid assets at death\nModern summaries routinely state that Garland died with about $40,000 in liquid assets after obligations\u2014an estimate that originates in entertainment-finance roundups and pop-history explainers that rely on a mix of probate reporting and secondary compilations. Because probate files aren\u2019t universally digitized, most recent pieces cite digest outlets (often themselves citing earlier biographies).\nFor example, The List cites the $40,000 figure and notes substantial IRS obligations being paid from her estate, while also referencing contemporary reporting that she had earned the inflation-equivalent of tens of millions during her lifetime. According to The List, drawing on long-running entertainment finance databases, Garland\u2019s liquid estate was roughly $40,000 even after a career of very large gross earnings.\nPosthumous debts and how they were handled\nStandard references recount that Liza Minnelli helped coordinate repayments of her mother\u2019s debts with support from friends including Frank Sinatra, and that Sidney Luft organized a 1978 auction of ~500 personal items to raise funds for Garland\u2019s heirs\u2014again, consistent with an estate that had assets of sentimental and collectible value but limited cash. Those details are summarized in the Wikipedia biography\u2019s estate section. According to Wikipedia, family and friends worked down tax and other obligations, and the 1978 auction brought in additional funds for her children.\nBottom line\nThe public record shows enormous gross earning power but chronically fragile net finances: big studio checks, a landmark TV deal, and a historic live album and tour counter-weighted by tax enforcement, legal fees, and volatile health and work patterns.\nThat\u2019s how an artist whose peak projects topped charts and won GRAMMYs plausibly left an estate with only tens of thousands in liquid cash\u2014even as her legacy (and the long-term value of memorabilia and properties associated with her name) continued to grow in the decades after 1969. According to the sources above, the $40,000 figure reflects liquid assets after debts, not a life\u2019s worth of earnings.\n| Category | Details | Estimated Value |\n|---|---|---|\n| Film & TV Earnings | Contracts with MGM and various studios, notable films including The Wizard of Oz | $25,000 |\n| Music & Royalties | Albums, singles, streaming, and licensing agreements | $10,000 |\n| Real Estate | Homes and personal residences | $3,000 |\n| Personal Assets | Jewelry, wardrobe, memorabilia | $2,000 |\n| Total Net Worth | All categories combined | $40,000 |\nEarly Life - The Making Of A Star\nJudy Garland was born Frances Ethel Gumm on June 10, 1922, in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. She was the youngest of three daughters in a family already immersed in show business. Her parents, Frank Gumm and Ethel Gumm, ran a vaudeville act, and from an early age Judy was exposed to singing, dancing, and performing on stage.\nHer formal education was limited due to her early entry into show business. By the age of 2, she was already performing with her sisters in their family act, \u201cThe Gumm Sisters,\u201d touring local theaters and vaudeville circuits. Her natural talent, stage presence, and affinity for performance quickly set her apart.\nGarland\u2019s passion for entertainment was evident from childhood. According to Biography.com, she idolized performers like Al Jolson and Shirley Temple, drawing inspiration from their energy and charisma. This early immersion in showbiz laid the foundation for what would become a legendary career in film, music, and stage.\nJudy Garland\u2019s Career - How She Became A Legend\nJudy Garland\u2019s career spanned over four decades, marked by iconic roles and groundbreaking achievements. She first rose to prominence in the 1930s at MGM Studios, appearing in a string of musicals that showcased her extraordinary singing and acting abilities as per IMDB. Garland\u2019s early films included \u201cBroadway Melody of 1938\u201d and \u201cBabes in Arms\u201d, where she performed alongside future stars like Mickey Rooney.\nHer defining role came in 1939 as Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz, which cemented her status as a Hollywood legend. Garland\u2019s performance of \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d earned her a Special Academy Award Juvenile Oscar, and the film\u2019s enduring popularity turned her into a cultural icon.\nThroughout the 1940s and 1950s, Garland starred in acclaimed musicals such as \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis\u201d (1944) and \u201cEaster Parade\u201d (1948), often working alongside Fred Astaire and delivering performances that showcased her versatility as a singer, dancer, and actress.\nGarland also enjoyed a successful concert career, headlining in venues like Carnegie Hall and embarking on international tours that drew critical acclaim. Her live recordings, including the 1956 Judy at Carnegie Hall album, remain some of the most celebrated in music history and won multiple Grammy Awards, highlighting her enduring influence in the entertainment industry.\nDespite personal struggles and professional challenges, Judy Garland\u2019s legacy as one of the greatest performers of the 20th century endures, with her influence still evident in contemporary film and music.\nReal Estate: Judy Garland\u2019s Hollywood Homes\nJudy Garland\u2019s residences in Los Angeles reflected both her celebrity status and personal life. Here's a look at some of her notable properties:\nBel Air Estate \u2013 1231 Stone Canyon Road\nIn 1938, at age 16, Garland commissioned architect Wallace Neff to design a custom-built home in Bel Air. This 5,513-square-foot, two-story residence featured traditional East Coast-style architecture with five bedrooms, five-and-a-half bathrooms, and original elements like a wrought-iron banister and dark-stained hardwood floors according to Architectural Digest.

Then you know how it feels to be bombarded by countless groups offering \"95% win rates\" and \"risk-free profits.\" The reality? Not all signal providers are made equal\u2014some are legit, but others are complete scams.\nThe secret to success is in comparison. There are Telegram groups for gold trading, forex scalping groups, and some that mix several asset classes. You need a step-by-step approach to get the best fit. We outline the critical factors to review before you can entrust any Forex signals group with your trades.\n1. Track Record & Reputation\nA provider's reputation is your initial filter. Look for:\n- Member count & activity \u2013 Big groups (10K+) aren\u2019t necessarily better, but active discussion indicates legitimacy.\n- Online reviews \u2013 See Forex forums (ForexFactory, BabyPips) and Trustpilot for impartial views.\n- Social proof \u2013 Are traders sharing verified screenshots of their profits, or is everything hype?\nWarning: Most groups disclaim their signals as \"not financial advice\"\u2014a red flag if they also promise unrealistic returns.\n2. Pricing: Free vs. Paid Signals\n- Free signals \u2013 Excellent to test the accuracy of a provider, but tend to be inconsistent. (Search: best free forex signals Telegram)\n- Paid signals \u2013 Should justify their cost with transparent performance data. Avoid groups demanding upfront fees without proof of success.\nPro Tip: Some premium groups offer free trials\u2014use them to verify quality before committing.\n3. Performance Transparency & Win Rate\nA \"90% win rate\" is meaningless without evidence. Require:\n- Confirmed trading history (MyFXBook, FX Blue, or TradingView screenshots).\n- Real-time updates \u2013 Signals must be timestamped to prevent cherry-picking.\n- Average risk-reward ratio \u2013 Even a 70% win rate can lose money if losses exceed profits.\nAvoid groups that:\n- Post only \"winning trades\" and conceal losses.\n- Refuse to give long-term performance information.\n4. Signal Frequency & Trading Style\n- Scalping (10+ signals/day) \u2013 Takes up all screen time.\n- Swing trading (3-5 signals/week) \u2013 More suitable for part-time traders.\n- High-impact news signals \u2013 Some groups focus on trading economic events.\nAsk yourself: Is their strategy compatible with your risk tolerance and timeline?\n5. Reasoning Supporting Recommendations\nThe top providers detail their trades:\n- Technical analysis (e.g., *\"EUR/USD breaking key resistance at 1.0950\"*).\n- Core drivers (e.g., \"FOMC meeting likely to weaken USD\").\n- Clear entry/exit levels \u2013 No ambiguous calls like \"Buy gold now.\"\nRed flag: Groups that use \"insider info\" or push you into spontaneous trades.\nTelegram Trading Signals vs. Personal Research: A Trader\u2019s Guide\nFor forex traders, particularly newcomers, the promise of the top free forex signals Telegram channels provide is hard to resist. Instant trade suggestions, professional analysis, and a sense of community can seem like a recipe for instant success.\nYet, depending on signals alone\u2014without your own research\u2014is a dangerous bet. Here\u2019s how to get the balance just right.\nThe Case for Telegram Signals\nConvenience\nFree Telegram signals deliver real-time trade setups, saving you hours of analysis. \u23f3\nLearning Tip\nWatching entry/exit points from experienced traders can help tighten up your strategy.\nCommunity Support\nMost groups provide discussions, making you comprehend market logic.\nHowever, Be Careful\nNot all signal providers are created equal. Scams and exaggerated performance claims are widespread.\nWhy Independent Research Matters\nSignals should supplement\u2014not replace\u2014your own due diligence.\nCheck Performance\nRequire verified track records (Myfxbook, FX Blue). No evidence? Next.\nLearn the Strategy\nFollowing signals blindly educates nothing. Study why a trade is successful (or not).\nMarket Context\nSignals are not nuanced. Macro trends, news events, or liquidity changes can trump any setup.\nBest Practices for New Traders\n1. Test Before Trusting\n- Demo-trade signals for at least a month.\n- Consistency trumps one-time wins.\n2. Cross-Check\n- Match Telegram signals with your personal technical/fundamental analysis.\n3. Risk Management\n- Even the most excellent free forex signals Telegram channels\n- Never risk more than 1-2% of a trade.\nFinal Insights\nIn summary, identifying the most effective free forex signals Telegram channels can take your trading strategy to the next level, with AnabelSignals being a beacon of hope in terms of accuracy and reliability.\nYet, even the most accurate signal should never substitute for diligent independent research and a keen understanding of market volatility.\nProfitable trading is predicated upon disciplined risk management\u2014never invest what you cannot afford to lose.\nAs a novice or experienced trader, integrating quality signals (such as those from AnabelSignals) with your own analysis provides assurance of a balanced strategy in tackling the dynamic forex market.\nAlways remember: In trading, knowledge and caution are equally vital as the signals themselves.\nFAQ: Best Free Forex Signals on Telegram \u2013 Your Questions Answered\nForex trading signals on Telegram have become increasingly popular among traders who want to capitalize on market movements.

In this article, we\u2019ll break down how this Hollywood icon built his fortune, highlight key career milestones, and explore the legacy he leaves behind in the entertainment world.\nTerence Stamp\u2019s $10M Net Worth Breakdown\nAt the time of his death in August 2025, Terence Stamp's net worth was estimated at approximately $10 million, according to multiple sources including Hollywood Life and The Econimic Times.This substantial fortune was the result of his illustrious six-decade career in film, television, and theater, as well as his savvy investments and diverse income streams.\nCareer Earnings and Film Contracts\nStamp's acting career spanned over 60 years, during which he secured lucrative contracts for his roles in various films. Notably, his portrayal of General Zod in the Superman films and his role in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert garnered significant attention and remuneration. While exact figures for each contract are not publicly disclosed, it's known that leading roles in major productions during his peak years commanded substantial salaries, often ranging from $1 million to $5 million per film, depending on the project's budget and his involvement according to the Los Angeles Times.\nRoyalties and Streaming Revenues\nAs his films continued to be popular through syndication, DVD sales, and streaming platforms, Stamp earned ongoing royalties. While specific annual earnings from these sources are not detailed in public records, it's common for actors with a legacy in popular films to receive consistent income from such channels. Given the enduring popularity of his roles, particularly in the superhero genre, it's reasonable to infer that Stamp's royalty and streaming revenues contributed a significant portion to his net worth.\nInvestments and Real Estate\nWhile Terence Stamp earned the bulk of his wealth from his illustrious acting career, his approach to real estate was unconventional. Rather than amassing a sprawling property portfolio, Stamp preferred a minimalist, flexible lifestyle, often staying in friends\u2019 homes, guesthouses, or short-term rentals. He did, however, make one notable real estate investment: a Southern California property famously dubbed the \u201cStamp House.\u201d\nBuilt in 2004, Stamp funded its construction for over $400,000 on a property originally associated with novelist Lynda La Plante. Although the home was later sold in 2015 amid personal and legal complications, the investment reflected his occasional interest in real estate as part of his net worth strategy.\nIn the United Kingdom, Stamp alternated between staying in residences across Notting Hill and Knightsbridge, as well as short-term accommodations in luxury hotels, reflecting his preference for mobility over ownership. While exact valuations of his real estate holdings remain private, the Stamp House alone represents a significant financial outlay, and the prime locations he frequented suggest that property-related assets contributed meaningfully to his overall $10 million net worth.\nPersonal Assets\nTerence Stamp\u2019s refined tastes extended to personal possessions. He favored minimalism over extravagance, rarely amassing large collections, but he did own select luxury vehicles and a few classic cars, typically valued in the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nHis personal effects, including fine art and carefully chosen jewelry, though not publicly appraised, likely added to his wealth. These assets, combined with his strategic real estate investments and career earnings, rounded out a net worth that reflected both financial prudence and an appreciation for quality over quantity.\nLegacy and Estate\nUpon his passing, Stamp's estate is likely to be inherited by his family, including his nephews and ex-wife Elizabeth O'Rourke . The distribution of his estate included his real estate holdings, personal assets, and any residuals from his film and television work. While the exact value of the estate's assets is not publicly disclosed, it's reasonable to assume that the total value aligns closely with his estimated net worth at the time of death according to the Hindustan Times.\nTerence Stamp's $10 million net worth at the time of his death reflects a lifetime of successful acting, strategic investments, and a lifestyle that balanced luxury with discretion. His legacy continues to influence the entertainment industry, and his financial success serves as a testament to his talent and business acumen.\n| Category | Details | Estimated Value |\n|---|---|---|\n| Film & TV Earnings | Roles in classic films, streaming royalties, and contracts | $5,000,000 |\n| Real Estate | Properties in UK and US, including Los Angeles home | $3,000,000 |\n| Personal Assets | Luxury cars, jewelry, art collections | $1,500,000 |\n| Investments & Other | Stocks, bonds, and other strategic investments | $500,000 |\n| Total Net Worth | $10,000,000 |\nTerence Stamp's Early Life: An East End London Kid Who Made It To Hollywood\nEarly Life and Upbringing\nTerence Henry Stamp was born on July 22, 1938, in Stepney, East London, to Ethel Esther (n\u00e9e Perrott), a seamstress, and Thomas Stamp, a tugboat stoker. As the eldest of five children, Stamp grew up in a working-class environment, experiencing the hardships of post-war London. The family relocated to Plaistow, West Ham, Essex (now part of Greater London), where Stamp attended Plaistow County Grammar School.\nHis father\u2019s long absences due to his work in the Merchant Navy meant that Stamp was primarily raised by his mother, grandmother, and aunts. Despite the challenges, Stamp developed a passion for acting early on. He idolized American film stars like Gary Cooper and James Dean, whose performances deeply influenced him. His mother took him to see Beau Geste (1939) when he was just three years old, igniting his dream of becoming an actor.\nEducation and Entry into Acting\nAfter completing his education, Stamp worked in various advertising agencies in London, gradually earning a decent salary. In the mid-1950s, he also worked as an assistant to professional golfer Reg Knight at Wanstead Golf Club in east London. During this period, he honed his skills in communication and presentation, which would later serve him well in his acting career. In his autobiography, Stamp Album, he reflected positively on this phase of his life, appreciating the experiences that shaped his character.\nStamp's breakthrough into acting came when he won a scholarship to train at the prestigious Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London. This opportunity marked the beginning of his professional acting journey. He started his career in 1960 with a role in Wolf Mankowitz's production of This Year Next Year at the West End's Vaudeville Theatre. His early performances were characterized by a brooding intensity, earning him the nickname \"the master of the brooding silence\" from The Guardian.\nTerence Stamp: A Career Defined by Iconic Roles and Unforgettable Performances\nTerence Stamp's illustrious career spanned over six decades, marked by a series of transformative roles that showcased his versatility and depth as an actor. From his early breakthrough to his later acclaimed performances, Stamp left an indelible mark on cinema.\nBreakthrough and Early Success\nStamp's film debut came in 1962 with Peter Ustinov's Billy Budd, where he portrayed the title character. His performance earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and a BAFTA nomination for Best Newcomer, propelling him into the spotlight.\nIn the same year, he starred opposite Laurence Olivier in Term of Trial, further establishing his presence in British cinema. His subsequent roles in The Collector (1965) and Modesty Blaise (1966) showcased his ability to tackle diverse characters, earning critical acclaim and solidifying his status as a leading actor of the 1960s.\nHollywood Stardom and Iconic Roles\nStamp's international fame soared with his portrayal of General Zod in Superman (1978) and its sequel Superman II (1980). His commanding performance as the villainous Kryptonian earned him a place in cinematic history and a dedicated fanbase according to People.\nThe 1990s marked a resurgence in Stamp's career with standout performances in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994), where he portrayed Bernadette, a transgender woman, earning BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations. He also starred in The Limey (1999), a crime drama directed by Steven Soderbergh, which garnered critical acclaim and several award nominations as per ABC News.\nLater Years and Continued Recognition\nIn the 2000s and beyond, Stamp continued to take on diverse roles in films such as Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace (1999), The Haunted Mansion (2003), Elektra (2005), Wanted (2008), Get Smart (2008), Yes Man (2008), Valkyrie (2008), Big Eyes (2014), and Last Night in Soho (2021) according to Time.\nHis performances remained marked by depth and nuance, earning him continued respect and admiration in the industry. In addition to his acting career, Stamp was a prolific writer, authoring several memoirs, a novel, and cookbooks, further showcasing his multifaceted talents.\nTerence Stamp's career is a testament to his exceptional talent and enduring impact on the film industry. His ability to embody a wide range of characters, from villains to complex protagonists, has left a lasting legacy that continues to inspire actors and filmmakers alike. Stamp's contributions to cinema and literature ensure that his influence will be felt for generations to come.\nReal Estate Portfolio: A Life of Nomadic Elegance\nTerence Stamp, renowned for his roles in Superman and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, led a life as unconventional as his film career. Despite his substantial net worth, estimated at $10 million at the time of his passing in August 2025, Stamp never conformed to the typical celebrity lifestyle. He chose a minimalist, nomadic existence, often staying in friends' homes or luxury hotels rather than owning property according to Business Upturn.\nA Life Without Permanent Roots\nStamp's approach to living arrangements was notably unconventional. In the United States, he often stayed in guesthouses in Ojai, California, or apartments once owned by his brother in New York City and the Hamptons. In London, he alternated between friends\u2019 residences in areas like Notting Hill and Knightsbridge. Occasionally, he treated himself to stays in luxury hotels, such as The Savoy, but these were short-term arrangements rather than ownership.\nThe \"Stamp House\" Saga\nIn 2004, Stamp invested over $400,000 to build a house in Southern California, known as the \"Stamp House.\" This decision stemmed from a verbal agreement with novelist Lynda La Plante, who suggested that Stamp could build a home on her property. However, after La Plante's divorce, the entire property was sold in June 2015, including the house Stamp had funded. Despite assurances, Stamp never received reimbursement for his investment or a share of the proceeds from the sale according to Courthouse News.\nA Philosophy of Minimalism\nStamp's lifestyle was characterized by a preference for simplicity and freedom according to The Guardian. He once stated, \"I don't own a house. I don't have a permanent address. I don't have a car. I don't have a bank account. I don't have anything.\" This philosophy allowed him to remain unencumbered by material possessions, focusing instead on his work and personal experiences.\nTake a look at some of our other Net Worth articles you may like:\nCarl Dean Net Worth: The Untold Story of the $20 Million Fortune of Dolly Parton's Husband.\nParis Jackson Net Worth 2025: Inside Her $150M Fortune & Unpacking Her Complex Inheritance.\nPersonal Life\nTerence Stamp's personal life was as intriguing and unconventional as his career. He was married once, to Elizabeth O\u2019Rourke, from 2002 to 2008. The couple met in the mid-1990s when O\u2019Rourke was a 23-year-old pharmacist working in Sydney. Despite their 35-year age gap, they married on New Year's Eve in 2002, with Stamp being 64 and O\u2019Rourke 29. The marriage ended in divorce in 2008, with O\u2019Rourke citing Stamp's \"unreasonable behaviour\" as the reason for the split.\nLegal documents revealed that Stamp had initially expressed the desire to separate and agreed to cover all associated costs. The couple had no children and had been living apart when the divorce was finalized. Reflecting on the split years later, Stamp told The Daily Mail, \"We had an incredible amount of fun. She went back to Australia, and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t see her, but if I do go there, I\u2019m sure I will.\"\nStamp did not have children, a fact that contributed to his nomadic, minimalist lifestyle. Without familial obligations, he was free to travel extensively and pursue personal passions, often living abroad for months at a time.\nHobbies and Interests\nStamp was widely recognized for his love of travel and culture. He spent significant time in both the United States and the United Kingdom, exploring local art scenes, attending film festivals, and cultivating friendships with fellow actors, directors, and writers.\nHe was also a lifelong enthusiast of motorcycles and classic cars, often attending automotive shows and enjoying the craftsmanship of vintage vehicles. Beyond vehicles, Stamp had a keen interest in fine art and literature, regularly collecting select pieces and reading widely, reflecting a lifelong curiosity and dedication to culture.\nHis hobbies and personal pursuits were tightly interwoven with his professional life, allowing him to draw inspiration from the arts and experiences around him. This combination of intellectual curiosity, refined taste, and global perspective further shaped both his public persona and private enjoyment.\nLatest News: Terence Stamp's Passing and Tributes\nTerence Stamp Passes Away at 87\nOn Sunday, August 17, 2025, British actor Terence Stamp passed away at the age of 87.

They are also studying whether, after the national tax, a local property tax could then replace council tax in the medium term in an effort to repair battered local authority finances.\nNo final decisions have been made. A national tax could be implemented during this parliament, while it is understood an overhaul of council tax would take longer, at least requiring Labour to win a second term in office.\nThe policy options are being considered as part of a large tranche of work within the Treasury aimed at tapping into the vast cumulative rise in house prices in recent years that risks entrenching inequalities and making council tax \u2013 which is based on early 1990s property values \u2013 more unfair.\nIf the plans came to fruition, they could provide valuable political cover for Reeves, both in terms of raising extra revenue without breaking Labour\u2019s pledge to not raise levies on working people and as policies that would be likely to appeal to many of the party\u2019s MPs and members.\nThere has been increasing pressure on the chancellor to consider more wealth-based taxes, notably from the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, and the additional tax on more expensive homes could be presented in this light.\nThe national tax would be paid by owner-occupiers on houses worth more than \u00a3500,000 when they sell their home. The amount paid would be determined by the value of the property, with the rate set by central government, which would directly collect the proceeds via HMRC. It would not replace stamp duty on second homes.\nCurrent rates of stamp duty vary depending on whether someone is a first-time buyer and are banded in steps upward depending on the value of the property being bought and sold.\nIt would take time to phase in a replacement to stamp duty, and a range of options are being considered for phasing in changes. The revenue raised by stamp duty on primary residences varies considerably from year to year, depending on housing market conditions. In the last financial year it raised \u00a311.6bn, according to government figures. Over time, it is believed the new national property tax would be a more reliable, consistent source of revenue and ultimately raise the same amount as stamp duty.\nThe levy would only affect about a fifth of property sales, compared with about 60% with current levels of stamp duty, which is paid by the buyer of a home. The average price of a home in the UK was \u00a3272,664 in July, according to Nationwide.\nSources said that Treasury officials are, in part, drawing on the findings of a 48-page report from the centre-right thinktank Onward, which was published in August last year.\nOnward\u2019s report proposes a dual approach of a national and local \u201cproportional property tax\u201d on property, based on its value. It is written by Tim Leunig, who worked as a government adviser for more than a decade and was closely involved with devising the furlough scheme during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nLeunig wrote: \u201cThese proposals would make it easier and cheaper to move house, for a better job, or to be near family, as well as being fairer. It should not be the case that a terrace house in Burnley pays more than a mansion in Kensington \u2013 and it wouldn\u2019t be under these proposals.\u201d\nThe government has already showed signals of adopting some of the steps towards council tax Leunig laid out in his report: \u201cThe first step would be to end the overfunding of various councils in affluent areas of inner London, particularly Westminster, Wandsworth and Kensington and Chelsea councils.\u201d This is similar to the approach laid out this summer in a consultation on how to redistribute from richer to poorer councils.\nThe idea of a new local annual property levy to replace council tax was also proposed by Onward. That plan would result in owners, rather than the residents, of a property worth up to \u00a3500,000 paying varying rates of tax dependent on the value of their home. They would pay a minimum of \u00a3800 a year and the funds this generates would go directly to local councils, whose finances have been severely stretched in recent years.\nRayner has already raised the prospect of ramping up redistributions of funds to address regional inequalities, which she has argued are exacerbated by the existing council tax system, which replaced the poll tax in 1993.\nA spokesperson for the Treasury said: \u201cAs set out in the plan for change, the best way to strengthen public finances is by growing the economy \u2013 which is our focus. Changes to tax and spend policy are not the only ways of doing this, as seen with our planning reforms, which are expected to grow the economy by \u00a36.8bn and cut borrowing by \u00a33.4bn.\n\u201cWe are committed to keeping taxes for working people as low as possible, which is why at last autumn\u2019s budget, we protected working people\u2019s payslips and kept our promise not to raise the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, employee national insurance or VAT.\u201d\nEconomists from the right and left of the political spectrum have heavily criticised stamp duty and council tax.\nIn June, the government launched a consultation on how to reform the allocation of funds raised by council tax. Labour said the \u201cfair funding review\u201d aims to fix the \u201cbroken funding system we inherited\u201d which has \u201cleft local authorities across the country in crisis\u201d.\nThe strategy has already met a backlash after it emerged deprived inner-city London councils stand to lose millions of pounds.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies, an economic thinktank, has said that while reform was very much needed, the proposed changes in the government\u2019s funding review appeared to run counter to an \u201cexpectation that deprived and urban areas would win at the expense of more affluent and rural areas, the government\u2019s baseline funding reform proposals are not particularly redistributive to poor, urban areas of England\u201d.\nWhile any wealth-related tax could provoke strong criticism from rightwing opponents, ministers have shown willingness to ignore such criticism for policies that generally affect wealthier people, such as adding VAT on private school fees and changes to inheritance tax for some farms.\nIf billed as a part of a longer-term replacement of stamp duty, this could also be helpful given the existing levy is unpopular and widely seen as a blunt tool and a block on the property market.\nUsing property taxes as a replacement for council tax would be complex to implement and almost inevitably require a second term in office, but there is an increasing acceptance among all the main parties that the current system for local government funding is obsolete and unviable.\nLabour has already committed to the biggest shake-up of council structures in England for decades but does not want to oversee the predicted series of local authorities declaring effective bankruptcy, especially as many will be run by the party.\nThe Guardian last week revealed that the Treasury was also looking at ways to raise more money from inheritance tax in an attempt to ease pressure on the country\u2019s finances, in the run-up to Reeves\u2019s autumn budget.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:04:42 GMT", "author": "Anna Isaac and Peter Walker", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss", "tag": "politics"}, {"domain": "www.theguardian.com", "title": "UK metals firms threaten to sue government over tariffs on steel imports from Asia", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/18/uk-metals-steel-imports-asia", "text": "UK metals companies have threatened to take legal action against the government over tariffs on raw steel imports from Asia which they claim have caused a \u201ctsunami\u201d of problems for the industry.\nEarlier this summer, the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, reduced the amount of raw steel from Vietnam and South Korea that can be imported tariff-free in a move designed to protect UK raw steel makers, which face competition from cheap imports.\nIn a letter to Reynolds, a group of manufacturers who use raw steel to make industrial products threatened to sue the government after the cut took effect in July, leaving shipments already paid for liable to a 25% tariff. Reynolds is expected to reply to the letter this week, after asking for more time to respond.\nManufacturers behind the legal letter said Reynolds gave just 24 hours\u2019 notice of the quota cut, leaving thousands of tonnes of imported steel stranded at UK ports. They said steel already on ships from east Asia had been \u201cbought and paid for\u201d but would now attract a tariff on entry to the UK.\nThe Confederation of British Metalforming (CBM), which represent companies that forge, weld and roll raw steel to make industrial products, said its members faced a \u201ctsunami\u201d of problems, from higher costs to delayed shipments. It said disruptions in deliveries \u201care reverberating throughout domestic industry\u201d.\nPaul Whitehouse, the managing director of Steel & Alloy Gonvarri Industries, based near Birmingham, said he would need to pay more than \u00a3500,000 in tariff surcharges.\nWhitehouse said: \u201cThe government has shot itself in the foot. It wants to help the steel industry, but acting in this way, giving just 24 hours\u2019 notice, has only increased our expenses. We work on very small margins \u2013 1% to 2% \u2013 and these extra costs matter.\u201d\nThe main producers of raw steel in the UK are Tata Steel\u2019s operations in south Wales and British Steel\u2019s plant in Scunthorpe, which was taken over by the government in April after it became concerned that its Chinese owner, Jingye, was planning to let its blast furnaces cool.\nSpeciality Steel UK (SSUK), which employs 1,500 people and is part of the Liberty Steel Group owned by Sanjeev Gupta, is also under threat of closure.\nUK steel businesses have struggled to find domestic buyers after a collapse in demand from longstanding customers. Car production has fallen in the UK and activity in the commercial construction sector, another large user of steel, has slowed this year.\nA regime of quotas and tariffs already exists, protecting UK raw steel makers from cheap Chinese imports and restricting imports from the EU.\nPressure has mounted since February when many steel-producing countries began seeking new markets for their products amid threats by Donald Trump of hefty tariffs on imports to the US. Washington\u2019s steel tariffs have also dented UK exports to the US.\nThe government said its decision followed a recommendation by the Trade Remedies Authority (TRA). However, the metal industry accused Reynolds of ignoring changes set out by the independent body.\nA review by the TRA recommended a cap of 40% on tariff-free imports from \u201cother\u201d countries that make raw steel, including Vietnam, Thailand and South Korea. But Reynolds reduced the cap to 15% and said it would apply the next day.\nThe industry had been expecting the new rules to be implemented in October, giving them time to find new suppliers.\nThe CBM president, Stephen Morley, said steel was being stockpiled at ports \u201ccreating a domino effect, with businesses facing additional costs, logistical challenges, and uncertainties about the future of their operations\u201d.\nHe said his members were in favour of measures safeguarding UK steel production, but added that Reynolds had \u201cexacerbated the existing pressures on firms already grappling with the aftermath of the current economic climate\u201d.\nMembers of the CBM are understood to be clubbing together to fund a judicial review of Reynolds\u2019s decision after sending him a pre-action protocol letter.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: \u201cWe do not comment on potential or ongoing legal proceedings.\u201d", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:32:18 GMT", "author": "Phillip Inman", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss", "tag": "politics"}, {"domain": "www.theguardian.com", "title": "Tory MPs complain party attack ad on asylum hotels \u2018makes us look silly\u2019", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/18/tory-mps-complain-party-messaging-asylum-hotels", "text": "Conservative MPs have expressed frustration at their party\u2019s \u201cpiss-poor\u201d messaging over hotels housing people seeking asylum.\nLeaked WhatsApp messages show members are concerned that the party\u2019s leadership is attacking Keir Starmer\u2019s government for policies introduced by the Conservatives.\nKevin Hollinrake, the Tory chair, agreed that an advert shared by Conservative Campaign Headquarters last week was \u201cof concern\u201d but insisted it would not be deleted.\nThe WhatsApp exchange, which was first reported by ConservativeHome, came after the Tories launched an advert featuring a \u201clist of perks\u201d received by people housed in asylum hotels. It included housing and food \u201cprovided directly by the state\u201d and clothing provided by the Home Office, which are offered to people who arrive in the UK and claim asylum.\nThe advert also included other claims that have since been challenged as exaggerations, including claims of discounted Spanish and French lessons, free driving lessons and free PlayStation consoles for new arrivals.\nLewis Cocking, the MP for Broxbourne, wrote: \u201cThis makes us look silly as we gave them all this too which is why we are in the mess we are in today.

Do message me directly with anything [sic] other ads of concern.\u201d\nBen Obese-Jecty, another 2024-intake MP, shared a post written by Nigel Farage, whose Reform UK party is leading the Conservatives in the polls by an average of about 12 points and made significant gains at the Tories\u2019 expense in the local elections earlier this year. Farage had reposted the Tory graphic and written: \u201cThey should be in hiding.\u201d Obese-Jecty wrote underneath: \u201cAs predicted.\u201d\nCocking wrote in the WhatsApp chain that the party\u2019s original post should be taken down, pointing out that it could be weaponised against Tory MPs with asylum hotels in their constituencies.\n\u201cWell I did say and no one seems to listen. I have an asylum hotel and the community is ripping itself apart and it\u2019s okay for everyone that doesn\u2019t. We did this and we must come up with a policy that solves it,\u201d he wrote. Rosindell and another 2024-intake MP, Peter Bedford, liked the message.\nHollinrake claimed it would be counterproductive to remove the post, although he said he had \u201cspoken to the team about it\u201d and accepted that the message should have been better framed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fine line really, as we\u2019re saying that we\u2019d do stuff now that we didn\u2019t do before on the basis of \u2018under new leadership\u2019,\u201d Hollinrake wrote to his fellow MPs.\nObese-Jecty, one of just 26 new Tory MPs, wrote that the policies being attacked were introduced and maintained under Conservative governments.\n\u201cMost of those perks are ridiculous but some of them have been in place for years and have our fingerprints all over them, so why are we trying to pin them on Labour who can easily point that out?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy would anyone believe we\u2019d scrap them now unless we explicitly state how we would?\u201d\nThe MP for Huntingdon added: \u201cI agree that the tweet can\u2019t be removed, that dinghy has sailed, but it\u2019s yet another example of piss-poor comms from CCHQ that cause unnecessary media embarrassment.

Now we have a plan to end this mess | Stella Creasy and Peter Hain", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/18/proscribing-palestine-action-government-protest", "text": "Is terrorism really a vicar with a peaceful placard?\nAs parliamentarians who are passionate about democracy and civil liberties, we know that both are under threat. A growing number of organisations encourage violence and intimidation in pursuit of political aims. MPs are besieged with threats, advised not to hold in-person surgeries and are grieving still for two colleagues killed in the past 10 years. Anti-migrant protests and threats are encouraged by the far right to take place across the country. Yet attempts to address all this are increasingly destabilising public confidence in politics, emboldening those who fan the flames of hatred by claiming a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d response. Without change, the danger that someone will get hurt \u2013 or killed again \u2013 will only grow.\nDriven by both homegrown and overseas extremism, and social media algorithms, there is a growing trend for direct action to end in physical harm or destruction in order to get noticed. Proscription is the primary tool open to governments to put a hard stop to this, but with nearly 100 organisations and hundreds more Britons now labelled \u201cterrorists\u201d in recent weeks, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain parity between the organisations proscribed within the public mind. For any law to be effective, it has to be workable and legitimate. For it to defend democracy, it must also not be designed \u2013 or be seen to be designed \u2013 to spare ministers the difficulties of dealing with dissent. Proscription puts the person peacefully expressing opposition into the same category as the person planting a bomb or shooting a bullet.\nWe came down on different sides in last month\u2019s vote on whether to proscribe Palestine Action, and neither of us have ever supported the group. But we both agree what is happening now neither protects protest nor makes protest policeable.\nWe have three shared convictions. First, no one \u2013 including elected politicians and the police \u2013 should face violent threats or intimidation for doing the job that we ask of them, even if we disagree with how they do it. Second, everyone should be able to protest and engage in non-violent disruption without being lumped in with Islamic State, al-Qaida or the IRA. Third, legislation to uphold our civil rights and to stop intimidation should be cause-blind: protecting those whom we wish to beat at the ballot box by enabling all citizens to be heard and parliamentarians to do our jobs.\nHow, then, should the government respond? First and foremost with common sense. Urgent police guidance should be issued to head off the car crash that proscription enforcement is rapidly becoming, by setting out a test of proportionality for any interventions. Proscribing the original Palestine Action group was said to be about stopping those inciting direct harm and violence. Going after people with a poster testing the boundaries of liberty \u2013 some who may or may not even support Palestine Action but feel strongly about Palestinian rights \u2013 confuses rather than clarifies the government\u2019s intention. People must be able to protest about the horror in Gaza, and the focus should be on what is happening in Palestine, not in Parliament Square.\nThe government should be much more transparent about how it is upholding our constitutional rights. There is no free speech if one half of a political debate lives in fear of being targeted for disagreeing. We need mechanisms to stop those who use violence, threaten migrants or hound women instead of raising their voices to achieve their goals. Lord David Anderson, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, argued that proscription should always be a time-limited process \u2013 and we agree. It should also be targeted at real terrorists whose explicit intention is to kill innocent civilians.\nNo democratic state should make arbitrary decisions and must actively seek the consent of citizens. As it stands, how proscription is achieved \u2013 short parliamentary debates in both houses and, in the case of Palestine Action, bracketing the organisation along with two far-right groups in a single vote \u2013 fails this test. To have the ability to proscribe a group as \u201cterrorists\u201d, ministers and government must do much more to show the public how and why that is the case.\nWe must also address the glaring inconsistencies and real gaps in law these cases reveal. Legislation on public order focuses on specific practices; proscription orders target specific terrorist groups. Nothing sits between this to recognise when organisations themselves encourage members repeatedly and deliberately to escalate intimidation in pursuit of their aim. Extreme groups create a climate of violence, leaving refugees waiting to be firebombed, Jewish citizens attacked, black and Muslim citizens living in fear, and women increasingly vilified.\nGetting the balance right means abolishing offences such as \u201crecklessly encouraging support\u201d of a proscribed group and focusing instead on those who organise this criminality. Setting out how and when behaviour threatens our democracy \u2013 as distinct from criticising state policies \u2013 would also better maintain the integrity of the seriousness of terrorism charges. Stopping organisations that are not simply accidentally violent, but intentionally so, means a new offence is needed, distinct from the battery of existing criminal ones. This would recognise how groups that encourage violence and intimidation go beyond existing public order offences, disentangling non-violent direct action from violence or attacks on property and terrorism.\nThe alternative \u2013 accepting that harm to individuals is an inevitable risk of protest because people feel strongly about something \u2013 is not tenable. Terrorism is different from terrifying opponents, but both are or should be criminal offences. The failure to make that distinction is both increasingly infecting the policing of protest and undermining the legitimate right to protest.\nAnyone who thinks this situation is simple \u2013 either an egregiously authoritarian power-grab from the government or a sincere intention to block violent thuggery \u2013 isn\u2019t paying attention. The status quo has come to mean equating peaceful witness with terrorism, and isn\u2019t sustainable. But neither is pretending there isn\u2019t a problem that threatens our ability to debate, disagree and ultimately decide in our democracy.

There is no press conference scheduled with Mr. Trump and any European leaders.\nOther U.S. officials will be in the Oval Office for the meeting with Zelenskyy, including Vice President JD Vance, Rubio, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg.\nHere's the full schedule, released by the White House:\n- Noon: European leaders arrive\n- 1 p.m.: Mr. Trump greets Zelenskyy\n- 1:15 p.m.: Bilateral meeting between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office\n- 2:15 p.m.: Mr. Trump greets European leaders in the State Dining Room\n- 2:30 p.m.: Mr. Trump and European leaders take a \"family photo\"\n- 3 p.m.: Mr. Trump holds a multilateral meeting with European leaders in the East Room\nRubio says Putin meeting resulted in \"enough movement\" for Zelenskyy meeting\nRubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that although there wasn't a \"lot of progress\" in the Alaska summit on Friday, it resulted in \"enough movement\" to justify Monday's talks.\n\"If not, we wouldn't be having Zelenskyy flying all the way over here,\" Rubio said. \"We wouldn't be having all the Europeans coming all the way over here.

In a post on Truth Social, the president said the meeting with Putin \"went very well,\" adding that the same was true of a phone call with Zelenskyy and various European leaders after the fact.\n\"President Zelenskyy will be coming to D.C., the Oval Office, on Monday afternoon,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin.\"\nEuropean and NATO leaders are expected to accompany Zelenskyy to Washington, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said she was joining at \"the request of President Zelenskyy.\"\nThough the nearly three-hour-long meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents on Friday failed to produce the ceasefire that Mr. Trump had sought, the administration has since pivoted to seeking a broader peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. The decision to abandon a ceasefire was at odds with the goals of the U.S. and European allies heading into the summit, and some analysts say the shift could give Putin more leverage at the negotiating table.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that \"both sides are going to have to make concessions\" to get there.\n\"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again,\" Rubio said, noting that doing so would require both sides \"to give.\"\nThe secretary of state, who attended Friday's summit meeting with Putin, indicated that enough progress was made to sit down with Zelenskyy to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"\nRubio said the details of security guarantees for Ukraine, the question of territories and the issue of rebuilding the country still need to be discussed and \"require some more specificity.\"\nMeanwhile, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday that Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and Europe to offer \"game-changing\" security guarantees, including a possible arrangement in which the allies provide \"Article 5-like protection\" to Ukraine. Article 5 of the NATO charter says an attack on one member nation is considered an attack against all. Putin has been vehemently opposed to Ukraine joining NATO, but a similar security guarantee outside the framework of the alliance might reassure Kyiv that Russia would be deterred from attacking in the future.\nWitkoff noted that the administration intends to discuss a possible land swap at Monday's meeting.\n\"We're not waiting a week for a meeting with Zelenskyy and the European leaders,\" Witkoff said. \"We are intent on trying to hammer out a peace deal that ends the fighting permanently, very, very quickly. Quicker than a ceasefire.\"\nIn a Truth Social post Sunday night, Mr. Trump said, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\" Mr. Trump was referring to Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea in early 2014.\nIn a post on X, Zelenskyy said he'd arrived in Washington for the talks and insisted, \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace.\"\nAhead of Monday's meeting, Russian attacks on Ukraine continued, with a wave of air strikes hitting cities around the country, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa and Sumy, CBS News partner network BBC News reported. Ukrainian authorities said a drone attack on a residential area in the city of Kharkiv overnight killed a toddler, a 16-year-old and five other people.\n\"Despite all of the diplomacy and peace efforts, Russia continues to kill civilians,\" Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrii Sybiha said in a social media post. \"Russia is a murderous war machine that Ukraine is holding back. And it must be stopped through transatlantic unity and pressure. Moscow must stop the killing in order to advance diplomacy.\"\nRussian state media reported Ukraine had carried out a drone attack in Donetsk, overnight which killed a 62-year-old woman.\nMonday's meeting between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy comes months after a contentious February Oval Office meeting between the two leaders and Vice President JD Vance exposed a severe rift, with tensions erupting on camera as Vance accused Zelenskyy of ingratitude. In recent months, Mr. Trump's posture appeared to shift as he expressed frustration with Putin over Russia's ongoing drone and missile attacks, including what Ukraine described as the largest such attacks since the invasion began in February 2022.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:52:00 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/politics", "tag": "politics"}, {"domain": "www.cbsnews.com", "title": "8/17: Face the Nation", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/817-face-the-nation/", "text": "8/17: Face the Nation\nThis week on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio joins to discuss President Trump\u2019s three-hour meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in Alaska.

Now Congress has questions.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-william-barr-deposition-congress/", "text": "As attorney general, William Barr personally investigated Jeffrey Epstein's death. Now Congress has questions.\nIn the hours after convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein died in a Manhattan detention cell, then-U.S. Attorney General William Barr pledged to intervene personally to lead the investigation into Epstein's death.\nAmong the first to arrive at the Metropolitan Correctional Center soon after Epstein's death in August 2019 were members of Barr's senior staff. The visit to the federal detention center by senior members of the attorney general's staff was highly unusual, a source who was there at the time and witnessed the visit told CBS News. But so was the death in custody of such a controversial figure.\nOne source didn't recall ever seeing members of the attorney general's senior staff investigate an inmate death in more than 20 years. Another source, involved in the investigation, said such senior visits were rare, and if they occurred, usually pertained to promoting correctional programs, not investigating inmate deaths.\nBarr's involvement extended to a personal review of the approximately 11 hours of jail surveillance footage from the night of Epstein's death. He said in an interview with The Associated Press three months later that it showed no one had entered the area where Epstein was housed, and he concurred with the conclusion of the medical examiner: Epstein had died by suicide.\nLast month, after the FBI made that video public, an analysis by CBS News identified inconsistencies between Barr's description of the video and what it actually showed \u2014 including whether it really proves no one else entered the cell block.\nNow, Barr is scheduled to appear on Monday on Capitol Hill, where he will be questioned behind closed doors by members of Congress conducting a review of the Epstein matter.\nSources familiar with the oversight committee's plans tell CBS News they will be asking questions about Barr's involvement in the death investigation.\nCBS News has reached out to Barr for comment.\nThe deposition of Barr, who served two Republican presidents as U.S. attorney general, comes as Epstein's 2019 death in federal custody has come under renewed, intense public and governmental scrutiny. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, issued several deposition subpoenas in August, including to Barr, former President Bill Clinton, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and former FBI Director James Comey.\nBarr, a veteran of the George H.W. Bush administration who was serving his second stint as head of the Justice Department under President Trump at the time, said he was \"appalled\" when Epstein was found dead on Aug. 10, 2019, in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center.\nEpstein was being held at the now temporarily shuttered federal detention center after being arrested on sex trafficking charges that could have carried a life sentence. His arrest came after years of questions surrounding an earlier controversial prosecutorial deal in Florida where he pleaded to state prostitution charges and a federal felony case was dropped.\nScrutiny around that deal, and his subsequent death, has fueled years of suspicions and conspiracy theories. The furor also has enveloped Epstein's vast network of powerful former friends, including Mr. Trump and former President Clinton, who have disavowed him and have not been accused of wrongdoing.\nCampaign promises to \"declassify\" files related to Epstein, made by Mr. Trump and his surrogates in 2024, have led to months of political headaches for the White House.\nThe release last month of what the Justice Department called \"raw\" surveillance video from near Epstein's cell block, rather than settling questions about the night he died, raised new ones. The analysis by CBS News flagged multiple inconsistencies between the video and the 2023 report released by the Justice Department's Inspector General on Epstein's death.\nAs Congress steps up its inquiry, Barr is the first person scheduled to be deposed by the committee.\nBarr has acknowledged what he called \"a perfect storm of screw-ups\" at the jail, but said his \"personal review\" of surveillance footage supported the conclusion that Epstein had died by suicide.\nAs attorney general, Barr faced calls to recuse himself from Epstein's criminal case because he had previously worked for a law firm, Kirkland and Ellis, that had represented Epstein. (Their paths also indirectly crossed decades earlier, in the early 1970s, when Epstein was hired to teach at an elite private school in New York City where Barr's father was the headmaster.)\nHere is a look at some unanswered questions Barr may be asked based on a review of the 2023 DOJ inspector general's report, documents released by the Bureau of Prisons, and the surveillance video.\nQuestions for Barr about Jeffrey Epstein death investigation\nDid the video Barr reviewed from MCC have a missing minute?\nBefore the supposedly \"raw\" surveillance video was released last month, showing about 11 hours of footage from the night Epstein died, Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters that one minute right before midnight was missing was because \"every night is reset, so every night should have the same missing minute,\" from 11:59 p.m. to midnight.\nThat was later disputed by a government source familiar with the investigation in an interview with CBS News in July. Another high-level government source said the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General are in possession of full unedited copies of the video, and those copies do not have a missing minute. Why the FBI released the video with that small segment missing is unclear, and it is not known if anything notable occurred during that minute.\nDoes Barr still believe that \"between the time Epstein was locked in his cell at 7:49 p.m. on the night of August 9 and the time he was discovered the next morning at 6:30 a.m., no one entered his tier\"?\nBarr made that statement in 2019, but the CBS News video analysis indicates the view from the jail camera does not conclusively prove no one entered Epstein's cell block. A staircase leading to Epstein's cell block is almost entirely out of view from the camera, with just a small sliver of stairs visible. From the video released publicly, experts told CBS News it is impossible to determine whether anyone entered the jail unit and accessed the staircase without being captured on the recording.\nJust before 10:40 p.m., the video shows a glimpse of an orange shape moving up the stairs leading to Epstein's tier. The inspector general's report said that it was a jail staffer bringing orange linens or inmate clothing up the stairs. Some video forensic experts who reviewed that footage at the request of CBS News said they were skeptical about that interpretation. They suggested the shape could be a person dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit climbing the stairs. Inmates were typically confined to their cells late at night.\nWhat did the DOJ do to investigate theories other than suicide?\nNo evidence has surfaced suggesting that anyone else was involved in Epstein's death. He had been placed on suicide watch after an apparent attempt to hang himself a month before, and remained under heightened observation. However, there do remain significant unanswered questions about his death, some of which were raised in a \"60 Minutes\" report in 2020 looking at the medical evidence. Those included questions relating to the autopsy.\nA private autopsy commissioned by Epstein's family, conducted alongside the official examination by the medical examiner, raised concerns about the angle of the ligature marks on his neck and the presence of broken neck bones, findings that suggested a level of force greater than typically associated with a hanging. The medical examiner disputed that, saying such fractures can occur in suicides.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:35:56 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/politics", "tag": "politics"}, {"domain": "www.theguardian.com", "title": "Labour needs to \u2018pick things up\u2019 after a \u2018tough\u2019 first year, says Sadiq Khan \u2013 UK politics live", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/aug/18/uk-politics-live-news-updates-labour-sadiq-khan-conservatives", "text": "Labour needs to 'pick things up' after 'tough' first year in power, Sadiq Khan warns\nGood morning and welcome to our live coverage of UK politics. Despite winning a huge majority at last year\u2019s general election, Labour knew it had a lot of work to do to regain voters trust and show government could work for ordinary people.\nThe task was made more difficult as the party inherited a weak economy and crumbling public services underinvested in by previous Conservative administrations.\nSo far, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, has failed to win popularity with voters, according to many polls, with a seeming lack of political direction and constant moves to appease Reform voters while Labour\u2019s base quietly slips away.\nStarmer\u2019s proposed cuts to winter fuel payments, his sluggishness over adopting a firmer stance on Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and his controversial welfare reforms were out of line with much of the public\u2019s attitudes.\nLondon\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, told an audience at the Edinburgh festival fringe yesterday that Labour needs to \u201creally pick things up\u201d after a \u201ctough\u201d first year in government.\nKhan, who has been critical over the government before, notably over disability benefit cuts and ministers\u2019 plans for a third runway at Heathrow, said there was a feeling that people \u201clent\u201d Labour their vote last summer (in a bid to get the Conservatives out).\nThe London mayor said Labour supporters would be \u201cdelusional\u201d if they did not recognise the difficulties the party had had since winning power in July 2024.\nHe said:\nThose people that say it has been a great first year \u2026 I think they are letting the party down.\nIt hasn\u2019t been a great first year. There have been great things that have happened in this first year, around the rights for renters, around the rights for workers, around energy security, and I could go on. But as first years go, it has not been a great first year.\nKhan said Labour could still turn things around before its term is up and are equipped with a \u201cgreat team\u201d in No 10 led by Starmer, who he insisted he was not being critical of, although he conceded that the prime minister and those around him could be performing better.\nKhan \u2013 who is a Liverpool FC supporter \u2013 said if Labour was in a football match, they would be \u201ctwo-nil down\u201d. But continuing his analogy, he said that only 15 or 20 minutes of the match had gone, with minutes still to play and to \u201cwin this game\u201d.\nAfter over a decade out of power at Westminster, Khan also said that the party had \u201clost the memory of running things\u201d.\n\u201cIt has taken some time for the Labour party, the Labour government, to understand how the machinery of government works,\u201d he said.\nMuch of today\u2019s news agenda will be dominated by Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s crunch talks with Donald Trump at the White House. He will be joined by various European leaders, including Keir Starmer, who hope to coax the US president out of the pro-Russian positions he took after the Alaska summit on Friday. You can keep up with the latest developments in our Ukraine live blog helmed by the brilliant Jakub Krupa.\nSadiq Khan said Labour supporters would be \u201cdelusional\u201d if they did not recognise the difficulties the party had had since winning power in July 2024, as he admitted its first year in office has been difficult. The London mayor told an audience at the Edinburgh festival fringe that Labour needs to \u201creally pick things up\u201d.\nKeir Starmer has been urged to recall parliament to \u201cimpose immediate sanctions\u201d on Israel in a joint letter signed by politicians in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The letter urges the prime minister to \u201cact now\u201d to exert pressure on Israel to end its war in Gaza and for an end to arms sales to Israel.\nDowning Street has suggested thatKeir Starmer would back a Ukraine peace deal without a ceasefire as a precondition as the UK\u2019s prime minister and other European leaders join Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington for Ukraine talks with Donald Trump.\nThe watchdog that monitors government ministers\u2019 professional appointments after leaving office has been criticised for clearing Grant Shapps, a former Conservative defence secretary, to join Cambridge Aerospace as long as he promises not to work on defence matters.\nAlex Salmond\u2019s niece has accused Nicola Sturgeon of tarnishing her uncle\u2019s reputation when he is no longer able to defend himself in order to promote her memoir.\nMore than \u00a3300m given to English councils to help Ukrainian refugees into accommodation has not been spent, while thousands of them face homelessness.\nPatients in England now have greater access to important tests such as MRI scans and endoscopies in the evenings and weekends, the government has said, after increasing the number of community diagnostic centres (CDCs) offering out of hours services.\nWatchdog criticised for clearing ex-defence secretary to join missile maker\nThe watchdog that monitors government ministers\u2019 professional appointments after leaving office has been criticised for clearing Grant Shapps, a former Conservative defence secretary, to join Cambridge Aerospace as long as he promises not to work on defence matters.\nIn a ruling that drew scorn from political ethics experts, the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which monitors and advises on the revolving door between Westminster and the business sector, gave Shapps the green light to become the chair of defence company Cambridge Aerospace.\nShapps told Acoba that the company, founded three months after the Conservatives\u2019 general election defeat last year, planned to \u201cdevelop technologies to reduce risks to aviation\u201d. Disclosures show he cited examples such as airport delays caused by drones.\nOfficial government statistics show 209 pubs were demolished or converted for other uses over the six months to June.\nThe data, which was analysed by commercial real estate specialists at Ryan, show the overall number of pubs in England and Wales, including those vacant and being offered to let, fell to 38,780.\nIt means 2,283 pubs have vanished from communities across England and Wales since the start of 2020.\nThe hospitality sector was hit hard by the Covid lockdowns and soaring energy prices after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nThe British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) has urged the government to reform business rates for the sector.\nThe trade association said reducing the cumulative tax and regulatory burden would help more pubs to stay open, leading to more investment and jobs while also protecting spaces that, for many communities, are the only place left to socialise.\nYou can watch this interesting YouTube video in which the Guardian explores the reasons behind the closures of pubs and how they continue to function as key social spaces that can reduce loneliness and bring different types of people together in an increasingly atomised society.\nDowning Street has suggested that Keir Starmer would back a Ukraine peace deal without a ceasefire as a precondition.\nAsked if the prime minister wants a ceasefire back on the table after Donald Trump appeared to drop his calls for one following his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, Starmer\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always said we want to see a sustainable and just peace for Ukraine.\n\u201cOne that ensures peace returns to Europe and the Ukrainian people can live without fear of attack again, and an agreement that delivers that as soon as possible, but ends the killing and translates that into a lasting peace supported by security guarantees, would be a significantly positive step.\u201d\nPressed on whether that marked a change of position, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cWe want to see an end to the killing. If you can bring about an end to the killing and bring about a sustained peace in one go, then all the better.\u201d\nAlex Salmond\u2019s niece criticises Nicola Sturgeon over claims in memoir\nLibby Brooks\nAlex Salmond\u2019s niece has accused Nicola Sturgeon of tarnishing her uncle\u2019s reputation when he is no longer able to defend himself in order to promote her memoir.\nChristina Hendry told BBC Radio Scotland on Monday: \u201cIf my uncle was here today, these things would not be being said. I believe they\u2019re being said because he\u2019s not here to defend himself, as he would have done with every fibre of his being.\u201d\nSturgeon\u2019s political partnership with her predecessor as first minister, who died suddenly of a heart attack last October at the age of 69, dominates her memoir, Frankly, which was published last week.\nShe describes tensions that existed between them long before their catastrophic falling out over her government\u2019s handling of sexual harassment complaints against him, claiming that he opposed equal marriage, overrode her concerns about releasing the Lockerbie bomber and had several extramarital affairs.\nThe former Scottish National party leader stood trial in 2020 on 13 counts of sexual assault and was cleared of all charges, although a pattern of bullying and inappropriate behaviour towards younger female staff emerged in court.\nAsked what she believed was motivating Sturgeon, Hendry said: \u201cThere\u2019s been a number of years that these things could have been said, and the timing of it now where she\u2019s released a book and is looking to publicise that, I think many people have thought that could be the case.\u201d\nSturgeon writes in Frankly that she \u201cagonised\u201d about \u201cstirring up pain for [Salmond\u2019s] wife and family\u201d but concluded \u201cI cannot let what he said stand unchallenged\u201d.\nTory MPs complain party attack ad on asylum hotels \u2018makes us look silly\u2019\nRajeev Syal\nConservative MPs have expressed frustration at their party\u2019s \u201cpiss-poor\u201d messaging over hotels housing people seeking asylum.\nLeaked WhatsApp messages show members are concerned that the party\u2019s leadership is attacking Keir Starmer\u2019s government for policies introduced by the Conservatives.\nKevin Hollinrake, the Tory chair, agreed that an advert shared by Conservative Campaign Headquarters last week was \u201cof concern\u201d but insisted it would not be deleted.\nThe WhatsApp exchange, which was first reported by ConservativeHome, came after the Tories launched an advert featuring a \u201clist of perks\u201d received by people housed in asylum hotels. It included housing and food \u201cprovided directly by the state\u201d and clothing provided by the Home Office, which are offered to people who arrive in the UK and claim asylum.\nThe advert also included other claims that have since been challenged as exaggerations, including claims of discounted Spanish and French lessons, free driving lessons and free PlayStation consoles for new arrivals.\nLewis Cocking, the MP for Broxbourne, wrote: \u201cThis makes us look silly as we gave them all this too which is why we are in the mess we are in today. Completely unacceptable \u2013 they should be put in detention centres and deported.\u201d\nHis message prompted a series of shadow ministers to signal their support, with the home affairs spokesperson, Alicia Kearns, the foreign affairs representative, Andrew Rosindell, and the housing spokesperson, Paul Holmes, responding with thumbs-up emojis.\nHollinrake replied: \u201cAgreed. Do message me directly with anything [sic] other ads of concern.\u201d\nPeople earning a median salary could expect to spend 36.3% of their income on an average-priced rented home in England in 2024, the ONS said.\nThis means rent prices were above the 30% threshold that the ONS considers to be affordable. It also marks an increase on the 33.1% of household income that average renters were paying in 2023.\nRents have risen in recent years for a number of reasons, including high demand outstripping supply, the pandemic and its fallout affecting how many people live and work, and buy-to-let landlords passing on increases in their costs caused by higher interest rates.\nOver \u00a3300m given to English councils to help house Ukrainian refugees unspent\nDiane Taylor\nDiane Taylor writes on human rights, racism and civil liberties\nMore than \u00a3300m given to English councils to help Ukrainian refugees into accommodation has not been spent, while thousands of them face homelessness.\nFreedom of information requests to 150 councils in England, shared with the Guardian, identified that \u00a3327m \u2013 about a third of the \u00a31bn budget \u2013 was still sitting in council bank accounts more than three years after Russia invaded Ukraine.\nMost of the funds councils have spent have been used to pay staff and partner organisations.\nOnly \u00a322m has been spent on temporary accommodation for Ukrainians and \u00a315m to help them into private rented accommodation.\nMany Ukrainians struggle to find accommodation in the private rented sector because of the need to provide a deposit, something councils can help with but which some Ukrainians say in practice can be slow, bureaucratic and difficult to access.\nFinding a UK guarantor can also be difficult and those unable to speak English struggle to negotiate with landlords.\nA veteran far-right activist who was a key figure in the BNP was pictured feet away from Robert Jenrick as the shadow justice secretary controversially met protesters in Epping.\nEddy Butler was seen looking on as Jenrick visited the protest in Essex where the police have been attacked in the past by groups of masked men.\nButler, who was a key strategist on the BNP during its rise in the noughties and has been involved in other groups in recent years, is among far-right figures who have been involved in the protests.\nOthers include Callum Barker, an activist from the Homeland party, which has heavily promoted the protests. It is not suggested Butler or Barker were involved in any violence.\nJenrick also interacted with demonstrators including a woman with a T-shirt saying \u201csend them home\u201d. It\u2019s not clear if he met Butler, but the far-right figure appeared behind him on a number of occasions.\nLewis Nielsen, a spokesperson for Stand Up to Racism, which has been organising counter protests in Epping, said that Jenrick was willing to go on protests that were clearly attended by far-right activists.\n\u201cThese activists aren\u2019t \u2018concerned parents or local residents\u2019. Jenrick is fanning the flames of the far-right by chasing Reform UK votes \u2013 and he\u2019s giving confidence to known fascists.\u201d\nThe F-35 programme is an international defence programme which produces and maintains the fighter jets, with the UK having contributed components for both assembly lines and an international pool.\nIsrael has used the jets to devastating effect in its deadly bombardment of Gaza, killing many civilians.\nIn September, the Labour government suspended about 30 arms export licences for offensive use in Gaza, leaving 200 arms licences in place. It also gave a carve-out for equipment used in the F-35 programme, saying national security required that the F-35 supply chain remained intact.\nThe suspensions were due to a clear risk that Israel, which has regularly targeted civilian infrastructure like schools and hospitals and is accused of committing genocide in Gaza, might use the arms to commit serious breaches of international humanitarian law.\nThe British government continues to struggle to explain its export licensing regime. Ministers say they have stopped the sale of arms, but it was reported in July that there were more than 300 licences in operation. In addition, analysis of trade data shows UK firms have exported thousands of military items including munitions to Israel despite the government suspending key arms export licences in September.\nBut these moves are simply seen by many as inadequate in the face of the scale of the human suffering and death caused by Israel during the most recent war, which was triggered by the Hamas-led 7 October attack on southern Israel in 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 others taken hostage.\nStarmer urged to recall parliament to 'impose immediate sanctions' on Israel\nKeir Starmer has been urged to recall parliament to \u201cimpose immediate sanctions\u201d on Israel in a joint letter signed by politicians in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the PA news agency is reporting.\nThe prime minister, always keen to stay on the right side of the US, has been accused of not doing enough to try to exert pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu to stop his assault on Gaza, which has brought famine conditions to the territory and killed over 61,000 Palestinian people, many of whom are women and children, according to officials.\nThe letter says:\nThe humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza is both man-made and avoidable.\nIt is characterised not only by relentless bombardment and destruction, but by the deliberate creation of conditions that are starving a civilian population.\nThe blocking of food, water, and medical supplies has precipitated what UN agencies and humanitarian experts describe as a man-made famine; one that is rapidly claiming lives and inflicting irreparable harm on an already traumatised population.\u201d\nIt calls upon Starmer to recall parliament and impose sanctions on Israel and to \u201csupport a ceasefire and meaningful diplomatic intervention to protect civilians and secure a just, lasting peace\u201d.\nIt also calls for an immediate end to all arms sales to Israel, support for an \u201cindependent, international investigations into alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity, and acts of genocide in Gaza\u201d.\nThe letter also says the UK should use its \u201cdiplomatic influence to press for the unimpeded delivery of food, water, medicine, and humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza\u201d.\nIt adds:\nThe UK\u2019s moral standing and commitment to human rights will be measured by its response to this crisis.\nWe urge you to act decisively by standing against the man-made famine, the mass killing of children, and the broader assault on civilian life.\nThe letter was signed by Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister Michelle O\u2019Neill, Alliance party leader Naomi Long, SDLP leader Claire Hanna, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader Stephen Flynn and the convener of the party\u2019s Holyrood group Stuart McMillan.\nOther co-signatories include co-leader Lorna Slater of Scottish Greens, Alistair Carmichael from the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth and Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts.\nRachel Reeves to slash environmental protections in a bid to speed up infrastructure projects - report\nThe Times is reporting that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is preparing to strip back environmental protections that block infrastructure projects from getting under way, in an effort to boost Labour\u2019s building pledges and economic growth.\nLabour\u2019s Planning and Infrastructure bill is already in the committee stage at the House of Lords but the Treasury is reportedly preparing for another planning reform bill, with officials considering ripping up key parts of European environmental rules that developers say are obstructing key infrastructure projects.\nAccording to the Times, Reeves has said the interests of \u201cbats and newts\u201d are being allowed to stymie infrastructure and development projects, and officials are considering placing limits to judicial review that will mean people with environmental objections won\u2019t be able to delay projects so easily.\nThe chancellor, restricted by a set of stringent self-imposed fiscal rules, is desperate for economic growth and infrastructure is seen as a key part of that ambition. She is preparing for a difficult autumn budget amid mounting speculation over tax rises, as a weaker growth outlook, higher debt interest payments and a series of U-turns on welfare cuts contribute to a huge deficit in the government finances.\nPatients in England given more access to crucial health checks out of hours\nNicola Davis\nNicola Davis is the Guardian\u2019s science correspondent\nPatients in England now have greater access to important tests such as MRI scans and endoscopies in the evenings and weekends, the government has said, after increasing the number of community diagnostic centres (CDCs) offering out of hours services.\nThere are 170 CDCs operating in England, which are often in shopping centres, football stadiums and on university campuses. Patients can access them through a referral from their GP or clinical teams at hospitals.\nThe government has revealed that 100 CDCs are open 12 hours a day, seven days a week \u2013 an increase of 37 CDCs with such opening hours compared with July 2024 \u2013 with the hope that the service will allow patients greater and speedier access to diagnosis.\nThe move to provide more convenient care is part of the government\u2019s plan for change which, it says, aims to transform healthcare and make the NHS fit for the future, with an expansion of community-based services a key part of the approach.\nJack Straw urges Labour not to panic about threat of Nigel Farage\nThe former home secretary Jack Straw has urged Labour not to panic about the threat of Reform, who are riding high in the polls as Nigel Farage capitalises on the \u201csmall boats\u201d and asylum backlog issue. Here is an extract from the write up of the interview he gave to the Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, Jessica Elgot:\nIn an interview with the Guardian, he praised Starmer\u2019s intention to recognise a Palestinian state after an ultimatum to Israel \u2013 but defended the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, saying he would also have proscribed the direct action group Palestine Action.\nThe British political veteran said he believed Starmer and his cabinet were \u201chead and shoulders\u201d above opposition politicians and would reap the rewards of a gradual improvement in the economy and public services, which would not come immediately.\nAnd he said the poll lead of Reform UK should not be taken as a foregone conclusion. \u201cWe have been here before in terms of an insurgent party leading in the polls. So I think it is the famous phrase \u2013 don\u2019t panic,\u201d he said.\nThe former cabinet minister said Labour faced not only a terrible economic inheritance, but fundamental damage to the fabric of democracy by the previous Conservative governments, primarily Boris Johnson.\nLabour needs to 'pick things up' after 'tough' first year in power, Sadiq Khan warns\nGood morning and welcome to our live coverage of UK politics. Despite winning a huge majority at last year\u2019s general election, Labour knew it had a lot of work to do to regain voters trust and show government could work for ordinary people.\nThe task was made more difficult as the party inherited a weak economy and crumbling public services underinvested in by previous Conservative administrations.\nSo far, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, has failed to win popularity with voters, according to many polls, with a seeming lack of political direction and constant moves to appease Reform voters while Labour\u2019s base quietly slips away.\nStarmer\u2019s proposed cuts to winter fuel payments, his sluggishness over adopting a firmer stance on Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and his controversial welfare reforms were out of line with much of the public\u2019s attitudes.\nLondon\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, told an audience at the Edinburgh festival fringe yesterday that Labour needs to \u201creally pick things up\u201d after a \u201ctough\u201d first year in government.\nKhan, who has been critical over the government before, notably over disability benefit cuts and ministers\u2019 plans for a third runway at Heathrow, said there was a feeling that people \u201clent\u201d Labour their vote last summer (in a bid to get the Conservatives out).\nThe London mayor said Labour supporters would be \u201cdelusional\u201d if they did not recognise the difficulties the party had had since winning power in July 2024.\nHe said:\nThose people that say it has been a great first year \u2026 I think they are letting the party down.\nIt hasn\u2019t been a great first year. There have been great things that have happened in this first year, around the rights for renters, around the rights for workers, around energy security, and I could go on. But as first years go, it has not been a great first year.\nKhan said Labour could still turn things around before its term is up and are equipped with a \u201cgreat team\u201d in No 10 led by Starmer, who he insisted he was not being critical of, although he conceded that the prime minister and those around him could be performing better.\nKhan \u2013 who is a Liverpool FC supporter \u2013 said if Labour was in a football match, they would be \u201ctwo-nil down\u201d. But continuing his analogy, he said that only 15 or 20 minutes of the match had gone, with minutes still to play and to \u201cwin this game\u201d.\nAfter over a decade out of power at Westminster, Khan also said that the party had \u201clost the memory of running things\u201d.\n\u201cIt has taken some time for the Labour party, the Labour government, to understand how the machinery of government works,\u201d he said.\nMuch of today\u2019s news agenda will be dominated by Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s crunch talks with Donald Trump at the White House. He will be joined by various European leaders, including Keir Starmer, who hope to coax the US president out of the pro-Russian positions he took after the Alaska summit on Friday.

Sherrod Brown announced a bid to once again represent Ohio in the Senate on Monday, nearly a year after his reelection effort in 2024 fell short.\n\"I didn't plan to run for office again. But when I see what's going on, I know I can do something about it for Ohio,\" Brown said in a video announcement. \"That's why I'm running for Senate, because even in these challenging times, I still believe if you stand up for workers, treat people with respect, and always fight for Ohio, you can actually make a difference.\"\nBrown, 72, lost his bid for a fourth term in the upper chamber last November against GOP challenger Sen. Bernie Moreno. Brown was the sole Democrat holding statewide office in Ohio and was one of the key targets for Republicans in the 2024 election in which they took control of the Senate.\nBrown had historically appealed to ticket-splitters with his strong working-class brand in the state, which he had represented in the Senate since 2007. But President Trump won Ohio by more than 10 percentage points, making Brown's election a steep uphill climb. Moreno beat him by less than four points.\nIn 2026, Brown is set to face off against Sen. Jon Husted, a Republican who was appointed to fill Ohio's other Senate seat, which Vice President JD Vance vacated. The special election will determine who will serve the remainder of Vance's term, meaning the winner would have to run for election again in 2028.\nHusted, 57, was appointed in January by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, and previously served as DeWine's lieutenant governor.\nThe Ohio race is expected to be a tough battle for Democrats, as the party seeks to retake the majority in the Senate. With 53 Republicans in the upper chamber, Democrats would need to defend seats in a handful of potentially competitive states, while flipping four seats to retake a majority in 2026.\nWhile few races appear comfortably in range, Democrats have been working to recruit formidable candidates, like former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, to boost their chances. Brown's entrance into the race marks the latest recruiting victory for the party.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 07:26:47 -0400", "author": null, "source":

Ali is affiliated with Kataib Hezbollah, as are the brigades that attacked the ministry, analysts told Al Jazeera.\nThe incident is seen as a litmus test of whether the Iraqi state can hold PMF factions accountable for breaking the law.\nIraq\u2019s government argues that passing a new legislation \u2013 which would fully integrate the PMF into the state \u2013 would help them do so. Proponents of the bill argue it would incentivise the PMF to act within the confines of the law, but detractors fear it would give legal cover to militias, which are already too strong.\nThe PMF\nThe PMF, also known as al-Hashd al-Shaabi, is an umbrella organisation of mostly Shia armed groups, some of whom have close ties to neighbouring Iran. A few of these groups first emerged during the Iraqi resistance to US occupation.\nAsa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haq, for instance, split from Jaish al-Mahdi, formerly the dominant arm of the Shia rebellion, in 2007. The group received Iranian support to become a major powerbroker in Iraq and later intervened in Syria\u2019s civil war to support then-President Bashar al-Assad as he tried to crush a popular rebellion.\nKataib Imam Ali is another, albeit smaller, group in the PMF that reportedly received training from the Lebanese group Hezbollah in Iran and also dispatched fighters to Syria during the height of its war.\nLike Kataib Imam Ali, most PMF factions were formed after Iraqi Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani issued a fatwa in 2014, urging all able-bodied men to join the state to defend Iraq from ISIL (ISIS).\nAt the time, ISIL controlled large swaths of territory across Syria and Iraq, equivalent to the size of England. ISIL even captured the Iraqi city of Mosul and declared a \u201ccaliphate\u201d from there.\nBy 2016, Iraq\u2019s parliament had passed a law that recognised the PMF as a component of the state\u2019s national security.\nBut the law lacks clarity around command and control and budgetary oversight, and it has failed to prevent some groups from taking unilateral action to attack United States assets and soldiers stationed in the country.\nIn 2024, for instance, the PMF was awarded a budget of $3.4bn, which exceeded the total budget of Lebanon.\nWhile the figure is small relative to the $21.1bn allocated to Iraq\u2019s Ministry of Defence that same year, it is a sizeable amount that the state allocated to a body that it did not even have an accurate membership list for.\nEach registered PMF faction submits a list of names to be paid, and these lists are then reviewed by the Ministry of Finance. However, PMF leaders often intervene to push payments through unchallenged, according to a 2021 report by the Chatham House think tank.\nEstimates suggested there are 238,000 PMF fighters.\nReceiving a share of the state budget has helped the PMF in its quest to brand itself as a legitimate entity in Iraq.\n\u201cFrom the beginning, the PMF was adamant that it was part of the state and not a militia,\u201d said Renad Mansour, an expert on Iraq with Chatham House.\nOver the past 10 years, PMF factions have created political wings, run in parliamentary elections and gained access to lucrative state money after securing important administrative positions in key ministries.\nYet as they accrued power, some used their arms against the state to safeguard their patronage networks and influence over key ministries.\nIn 2021, PMF groups linked to Iran launched a drone at the home of then-Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, reportedly an attempt to upend the government after losing many parliamentary seats and thus access to state money in the recent elections, said Alaca, the expert on Iraqi Shia militias.\nThe new law\nThe Iraqi government drafted the new law in March. It would give all PMF factions official, stable employment and bring them under the control of Prime Minister Mohamed Shia al-Sudani as commander-in-chief\nProponents of the draft law mainly include a bloc of five Shia parties known as the Coordination Framework.\n\u201cThe argument pushed by those advocating for the law is that by offering an institutional safe haven for armed factions under a reformed PMF, it would incentivise those to comply with the national chain of command \u2013 thereby diminishing their appetite to take action outside the state,\u201d explained Inna Rudolf, an expert on the PMF and a senior research fellow at the Centre for Statecraft & National Security at King\u2019s College London.\nMost importantly to the PMF, the law offers it much-needed legal cover at a time when the US and Israel are threatening to target groups they consider Iranian proxies.\nIt would grant PMF members full access to intelligence, which some argue is a risky proposition because the intelligence could be passed to Iran.\nAnalysts have said, however, that many PMF factions would be more concerned about their power base and assets than about following Iranian interests.\nDuring the 12-day Israel-Iran war in June, PMF groups did not attack US assets or personnel, likely out of fear of giving Israel a pretext to attack their command structure and resources as Israel did against Hezbollah, according to a report by the Royal United Services Institute.\n\u201cI would say that the stronger and more embedded PMF groups are the ones who have been practising restraint and telling the smaller [pro-Iran] factions not to get involved in the regional conflict [between Iran and Israel],\u201d Mansour said.\nThe follow-up on the Ministry of Agriculture incident will test the willingness of PMF commanders to cooperate with the state to hold their own members accountable, as well as the state\u2019s seriousness in holding PMF members accountable, according to Rudolf.\nShe said al-Sudani has shown \u201cstrong will\u201d by referring all those involved in the raid to the judiciary and calling for the formation of a review committee to investigate \u201cnegligence in leadership and control duties\u201d within the PMF.\n\u201cSudani\u2019s administration wants to demonstrate power over the PMF and [to prove] that everyone affiliated with it not only has the same privileges as members of the security forces but has to abide by the same code of conduct,\u201d Rudolf told Al Jazeera.\nPressures against the new law\nNot everybody in Iraq supports the PMF\u2019s integration, said Zeidon al-Kinani, an expert on Iraq and adjunct instructor at Georgetown University in Qatar.\nHe said many PMF factions harmed and even killed hundreds of young protesters who were demonstrating against what they considered a corrupt political elite in 2019.\nAs a result, civil society is wary of seeing all PMF factions given the same privileges as Iraq\u2019s army and police and would prefer the government absorb only those that do not have close ties with Iran, al-Kinani said.\nUS officials are also pressuring Iraq not to pass the law with Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly telling al-Sudani the law would \u201cinstitutionalise Iranian influence and armed terrorist groups undermining Iraq\u2019s sovereignty\u201d.\nFormer and current Iraqi officials argued that the state cannot disband the PMF and any attempt to do so could trigger sectarian violence.\nAl-Kinani warned that the US could trigger a conflict by making unreasonable demands without supporting Iraq to carry them out.\n\u201cWhen it comes to Iraq, the US makes drastic demands [without] supporting the Iraqi government or civil society to ensure their protection from any repercussions,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:16:20 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "tag": "politics"}, {"domain": "www.aljazeera.com", "title": "Palestinian reporter\u2019s remains discovered, weeks after her killing", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2025/8/18/palestinian-reporters-remains-discovered-weeks-after-her-killing?traffic_source=rss", "text": "Palestinian reporter\u2019s remains discovered, weeks after her killing\nPalestinian reporter\u2019s remains discovered, weeks after her killing\nPalestinian journalist Marwa Musallam was buried alive by an Israeli air strike in Gaza City as her cries for help went unanswered.

Then, Israel would begin withdrawing from the south and releasing Lebanese prisoners.\nIn phase three, which should happen within 90 days of that, Israel is to withdraw from the last two of the five disputed border positions, and money would be secured for Lebanon\u2019s reconstruction.\nIn phase four, Hezbollah\u2019s remaining heavy weapons are to be dismantled, and Lebanon\u2019s allies will organise a conference to support the country\u2019s economic recovery.\nHezbollah emerged badly weakened from last year\u2019s 14-month war with Israel, during which longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated in a huge Israeli strike on Beirut. Before the war, Hezbollah was believed to be better armed than the Lebanese military.\nThe group has long maintained it needs to keep its arsenal to defend Lebanon from attacks, but critics accused it of using its weapons for political leverage.\nHezbollah has said it refuses to discuss its arsenal until Israel ends its attacks and withdraws troops from southern Lebanon. Aoun and Salam both want to disarm Hezbollah and have also demanded Israel halt its attacks and withdraw from the country.\nJust on Monday, Israeli attacks blew up a house in the town of Meiss el-Jabal, a sound bomb went off in the border town of Dahra, and drones could be overheard in the towns of Wadi Zefta, al-Numairiyeh and Wadi Kafra, Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency reported.\nAoun said he wants to increase funding for Lebanon\u2019s military and raise money from international donors for post-war reconstruction. The World Bank estimates that the war caused $11bn in damage and economic losses. The country has also faced a crippling economic crisis since 2019.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:59:13 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "tag": "politics"}, {"domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "'Can't stop.

Won't stop': Documentary filmmakers face federal funding shortfall\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has helped make PBS a home for independent documentaries for more than 50 years. In an email to NPR, CPB said it provided over $24 million to documentary filmmaking during the 2024 financial year. The government's decision to rescind CPB's entire $1.1 billion budget in July, subsequently causing it to announce its closure, led last week to PBS's announcement that it would be reducing its budget by 21%. This on top of sweeping grant cancellations earlier this year at both the National Endowments for the Humanities and the Arts, which both served as important sources of federal funding for documentarians.\nDespite these losses, the documentary community said it is not giving up. \"Can't stop. Won't stop,\" said filmmaker Carol Bash, whose 2015 documentary about jazz musician Mary Lou Williams, Mary Lou Williams: The Lady Who Swings the Band, was made with public media support. \" We're going to continue to find ways to think outside the box to get our films out there to audiences.\"\nBash said her community is now trying to figure out how to make up for the funding shortfall. \"There's going more international with your funding models,\" she said. \"And of course, there's the streamers.\"\nLeaning into streaming\nGBH is a public media powerhouse that produces such high-profile PBS series as Frontline, Nova and American Experience. President and CEO Susan Goldberg said GBH will pause production on new American Experience episodes next year, with the aim of reinventing the beloved, nearly 40-year-old history series. (It also laid off most of the team that produces the show.) Digital platforms are an important part of GBH's plan. \"How do we use digital channels to gather younger audiences into being really excited about American history?\" Goldberg told NPR.\nGoldberg said GBH already works with Amazon and aims to develop more relationships with streamers like Netflix, as well as expand its offerings on platforms such as YouTube.\n\"I'm personally very invested in ensuring that storytelling through documentaries continues to find an audience,\" said Angela Courtin, YouTube's vice president of sports and entertainment marketing. Courtin said the platform provides analytics and other resources to help creators of all kinds figure out how to expand their reach, though it doesn't currently pay for content. (Popular creators can earn revenue through such mechanisms as YouTube's Partner Program and brand deals.)\nStreaming platform Tubi does occasionally produce or co-produce documentaries, such as When Black Women Go Missing, a 2024 co-production with Vice about the disproportionately high number of Black, female missing persons. It also sometimes acquires streaming rights, as it did in 2023 for Satan Wants You, a film about satanic cults.\n\"It has been on the one level, a hit driven business,\" said Adam Lewinson, Tubi's chief content officer. Lewinson said Tubi is set up to accommodate not just documentaries likely to appeal to big audiences, but also niche titles by indie filmmakers that attract deep fandoms. Tubi mostly hosts movies in this latter category on its site \u2013 thereby helping films find audiences \u2013 but isn't generally financing this work. \"For many documentarians, if you say, 'Are you looking to recoup your investment, or do you want your story to be seen by as many people as possible?' The answer is always both. But ultimately they'll lean toward, 'We just want our content to be seen.'\"\nThe challenges of the open marketplace\nIndie documentary insiders said it's tough for most indie films to gain visibility in the profit-driven streaming marketplace because they aren't necessarily made for mass audiences. \" Independent documentary has, by and large, always been a non-profit enterprise,\" said Carrie Lozano, president and CEO of ITVS, one of the country's biggest co-producers of indie documentaries. Its output includes the 2004 Oscar-nominated feature The Weather Underground and the 2017 Peabody Award winning Maya Angelou: And Still I Rise.\nITVS received 86% of its funding from CPB. Lozano said her non-profit has directly invested more than $44 million in documentaries over the past five years. Owing to the difficult funding landscape, ITVS laid off roughly 20% of its staff in June. Lozano expects roughly 10 films to lose out on funding this year \u2014 a big cut from the up to 40 feature and short documentaries the group typically supports annually.\nThe basics of Internet connectivity are also an issue around streaming for many people, especially those who live in small, rural communities. \"What about audiences who aren't connected to fast broadband, or live in Internet deserts?\" said filmmaker Jessica Edwards, whose documentaries include the 2015 profile Mavis! about singer Mavis Staples. \"Many folks rely on free, over-the-air programming not just for news and weather but for a diversity of storytelling. What replaces that? More paywalls? It's an equity issue as much as an artistic one.\"\nBut for people like Mike Gonzalez, who've fought for decades to stop the flow of federal dollars into public media, there's no reason why these films should get special treatment in the form of federal dollars.\nA senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation think tank, Gonzalez told NPR that PBS \u2014 and NPR \u2014 needed to be defunded at the federal level owing to \"the very biased programming\" \u2014 a claim both networks' leaders reject. Gonzalez said he welcomes diverse storytelling in the media. \"I don't want to suppress views that are opposite to my own in the least,\" Gonzalez said, adding that it's simply a matter of independent documentaries vying for eyeballs just like everything else in the content universe. \"I fully expect that indie docs will not survive contact with the enemy once you have to compete in a commercial market,\" Gonzalez said. \"But let the competition begin.\"\nCPB declined NPR's request for comment and PBS did not respond.\nLooking elsewhere\nGiven the realities of the marketplace, some documentarians are working to attract more funding from traditional sources such as corporations, foundations and individual donors.\n\"Maybe this is the opportunity to create a much larger fund specifically for Black stories that is not hampered by the whims of the political movement at the time,\" said Leslie Fields-Cruz, the executive director of Black Public Media. The non-profit supports Black-themed stories by indie filmmakers, such as the Oscar-nominated I Am Not Your Negro from 2016 and the Emmy-winning 2021 film When Claude Got Shot. Fields-Cruz told NPR almost half of her non-profit's budget got wiped out with the federal cuts. \"We're here in what I'm calling the worst case scenario,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, some groups, such as the International Documentary Association (IDA), are working to recoup some of the lost federal funds. \" IDA is trying to pursue more strategic litigation to see how we can get the support to challenge some of the actions that have been taken at the federal level,\" said Dominic Willsdon, the IDA's executive director.\nMourning the loss\nUnderpinning all of this new strategizing is a tremendous sense of grief.\n\" Removing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting out of the media landscape means the world becomes much more impoverished, and the stories that get told will be much more anodyne,\" said Robb Moss, a documentary filmmaker and professor in Harvard University's department of art, film and visual studies.\nOscar-winning filmmaker Errol Morris described the loss of federal support for documentaries as a major blow to free speech. \"Worrisome to anybody who values an independent media, who values the First Amendment, who values freedom of expression,\" the Fog of War and The Thin Blue Line director said. \"The pursuit of truth is not a political issue. It's a moral imperative that's now being questioned daily.\"\nNPR has also received funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

The proposal was submitted to the state legislature by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), which is the re-election arm of House Democrats.\n\"Here we are in open and plain sight before one vote is cast in the 2026 midterm election and here [Trump] is once again trying to rig the system,\" Newsom charged on Thursday.\nLast week's appearance by Newsom, who is considered a likely contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, also served as a fundraising kickoff to raise massive amounts of campaign cash needed to sell the redistricting push statewide in California.\nThe non-partisan redistricting commission, created over 15 years ago, remains popular with most Californians, according to public opinion polling.\nThat's why Newsom and California Democratic lawmakers are promising not to scrap the commission entirely, but rather replace it temporarily by the legislature for the next three election cycles.\nBut Republican former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who represented a congressional district in California's Central Valley for 17 years, argued in an appearance on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that \"when you think about how they drew these lines, there wasn't one hearing. There is no debate. There's no input. Even the legislature in California doesn't have input. The DCCC is just ending it. That is why we need to stop Newsom's power grab.\nMcCarthy, who is helping to lead the GOP fundraising effort to counter Newsom and California Democrats leading up to the likely referendum this autumn, said that \"November 4th will be the election that people could actually have a say,\" as he pointed to polls showing strong support for the current non-partisan redistricting commission.\nThe push to temporarily replace the commission is also being opposed by other high-profile Republicans. Among the most visible is former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the last Republican elected governor in Democrat-dominated California.\nThe longtime Hollywood action star, the last Republican governor in Democrat-dominated California, says he's mobilizing to oppose the push by Newsom to temporarily scrap the state's nonpartisan redistricting commission.\n\"I\u2019m getting ready for the gerrymandering battle,\" Schwarzenegger wrote in a social media post Friday, which included a photo of the former professional bodybuilding champion lifting weights.\nSchwarzenegger, who rose to worldwide fame as the star of the film \"The Terminator\" four decades ago, wore a T-shirt in the photo that said \"terminate gerrymandering.\"\nSchwarzenegger spokesperson Daniel Ketchell told Politico earlier this month that \"he calls gerrymandering evil, and he means that. He thinks it\u2019s truly evil for politicians to take power from people.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"He\u2019s opposed to what Texas is doing, and he\u2019s opposed to the idea that California would race to the bottom to do the same thing,\" Ketchell added.\nSchwarzenegger, during his tenure as governor, had a starring role in the passage of constitutional amendments in California in 2008 and 2010 that took the power to draw state legislative and congressional districts away from politicians and placed it in the hands of an independent commission.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:06:17 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://moxie.foxnews.com/google-publisher/politics.xml", "tag": "politics"}, {"domain": "www.baltimoresun.com", "title": "Where Trump is popular, Democrats look to a new crop of candidates to help win back the House", "url": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/08/18/2026-us-house-democrats-candidates/", "text": "By JOEY CAPPELLETTI, Associated Press\nFAIRVIEW, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Jamie Ager has spent much of the past year rebuilding his farm in the foothills of western North Carolina after Hurricane Helene tore through the region, cutting power, destroying fences and scattering livestock.\nThen, earlier this year, Ager lost his beef contract with local schools, a casualty of billions of dollars in cuts to the U.S. Department of Agriculture under the Trump administration.\nNow, the fifth-generation farmer is running for Congress \u2014 part of a new crop of Democratic candidates the party is turning to as it tries to compete in the tough, often rural districts it may need to flip to retake the U.S. House in 2026.\nDemocrats say these new recruits are uniquely suited to break through in districts where President Donald Trump\u2019s popularity dominates. Many, like Ager, are already a well-known presence in their communities. And in parts of North Carolina, Kentucky, Michigan and elsewhere, the party is betting local credibility can cut through skepticism where the Democratic brand has fallen.\nAger says he sees national Democrats as out of touch with rural life: too \u201cacademic\u201d and \u201cpolitically correct and scripted.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not what people are interested in,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ideas of helping poor people, being neighborly, the ideal of doing those things, I think, are worthy, good ideas that are actually popular. But the execution of a lot of those ideas has been gummed up, you know, not well executed.\u201d\nA shifting House map\nHeading into next year\u2019s midterms, Democrats believe momentum is on their side. Historically, the president\u2019s party loses ground in the midterms. In 2018, during Trump\u2019s first term, Democrats flipped 41 seats to take control of the House. Republicans currently control the House by such a slim margin, Democrats need to pick up only a few seats to break the GOP\u2019s hold on Washington.\nThe Republican-led tax break and spending cut bill has added to Democrats\u2019 optimism. About two-thirds of U.S. adults expect the new law will help the rich, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. About half say it\u2019ll do more harm than good for middle-class people and people like them.\nStill, Republicans remain confident. They point to having fewer vulnerable seats than Democrats have this cycle. Only three Republicans hold House districts Democrat Kamala Harris won last year, while 13 Democrats represent districts Trump won.\nThey also note Democrats\u2019 low opinion of their own party after last year\u2019s losses. In a July AP-NORC poll, Democrats were likelier to describe their own party negatively than Republicans, with many Democrats calling it weak or ineffective.\nIn places where local dynamics may give Democrats a shot, it means finding the right candidates is especially important, party leaders say.\n\u201cRecruitment matters in these years when the environment is going to be competitive,\u201d Democratic pollster John Anzalone said.\nDemocrats hope a farmer in western North Carolina can regain trust\nWith power, water and telecommunications down due to last year\u2019s hurricane, Ager\u2019s Hickory Nut Gap farm became a hub for the community \u2014 hosting cookouts and using propane to grill food for neighbors.\nStatewide, the storm caused nearly $60 billion in damage and killed more than 100 people. Little federal aid has reached the hardest-hit parts of western North Carolina.\n\u201cHelene hitting definitely put an exclamation point on, like, \u2018Whoa, we need help and support,\u2019\u201d Ager said.\nDemocrats see Ager as a high-risk, high-reward candidate who could be successful in a district where Democrats have struggled.\nNo Democrat has won North Carolina\u2019s 11th Congressional District since it was redrawn by the Republican-controlled legislature in 2011. A court-ordered redistricting ahead of the 2020 election made it slightly more favorable to Democrats, encompassing Asheville and much of western North Carolina. Republican Rep. Chuck Edwards still won by nearly 14 percentage points last year and is expected to seek reelection.\nGrayson Barnette, a Democratic strategist who helped recruit Ager, said in some districts it\u2019s a risk to run a candidate who hasn\u2019t held elected office before.\n\u201cBut I would argue that\u2019s a good thing, especially when the Democrats just took the big hit we did,\u201d Barnette said. \u201cWe have to look in the mirror and say, \u2018Let\u2019s try something new.\u2019\u201d\nIn a district where nearly 62% of residents live in very low-density areas, Barnette believes Ager\u2019s identity \u2014 as a business owner, coach and father with deep local roots \u2014 could cut through. His unpolished, direct style, he says, may resonate more than a polished political r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\nIn the video launching his campaign, Ager shows flooding on the farm and is seen on the porch of his home, feeding chickens, driving a tractor and spending time with his wife and three sons.\n\u201cI\u2019m not flashy, but I\u2019m honest,\u201d he says in the video.\nAger doesn\u2019t call himself a Democrat in the roughly two-minute video and rarely used the word during a three-hour interview. Still, his ties to the party run deep: His brother serves in the state House, following in the footsteps of their father. His grandfather served six years in the U.S. House.\nAsked whether that might be a liability in the district, Ager shrugged: \u201cThen don\u2019t vote for me.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s big bill could reshape a conservative district in Michigan\nIn western Michigan, state Sen. Sean McCann is a different kind of candidate from Ager. He\u2019s buttoned-up and soft-spoken, with a long resume in elected office and deep roots in Kalamazoo, having served for a decade on the city commission before winning a seat in the state House in 2010.\nIn a district anchored by conservative and religious values, Democrats see McCann as the kind of steady, experienced figure who can make inroads \u2014 especially as backlash builds to Trump\u2019s tax bill, which includes deep spending cuts.\nAt a recent meeting at Kalamazoo\u2019s Family Health Center, where nearly 65% of patients rely on Medicaid, the center\u2019s president warned the proposed Medicaid cuts would be devastating.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about being home in the community and listening to our community\u2019s values \u2014 and carrying those to Washington,\u201d McCann said.\nThe district is represented by Republican Rep. Bill Huizenga, who won reelection by nearly 12 percentage points in 2022. But Huizenga hasn\u2019t said whether he\u2019ll seek another term, and Trump carried the district by only 5.5 percentage points in 2024.\nDemocrats hope strong ties help elsewhere\nAcross the country, Democrats are watching similar races in places like Iowa and Kentucky, where local candidates with strong community ties are running. In Iowa\u2019s 2nd District, state Rep. Lindsay James \u2014 a fourth-term lawmaker and Presbyterian pastor \u2014 is weighing a run in the northeast part of the state. In Kentucky\u2019s 6th, which includes Lexington and Richmond, former federal prosecutor Zach Dembo is running his first campaign, describing himself as a political outsider.\nIt\u2019s a mix of profiles: Ager, the farmer-turned-candidate feeding neighbors after a hurricane. McCann, the public servant meeting with health workers in his hometown. And others like them trying to reconnect a skeptical electorate.\n\u201cYes, the Democratic Party has some taint to it,\u201d Ager said. \u201cBut when I go talk to Republicans who are friends that I\u2019ve known forever, there\u2019s genuine admiration and mutual respect for each other. And that comes from being in this community forever.\u201d\nAssociated Press reporter Maya Sweedler in Washington contributed to this report.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:24:12 +0000", "author": "Associated Press", "source": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/feed/", "tag": "politics"}, {"domain": "www.baltimoresun.com", "title": "Texas Democrats say they\u2019re ending a two-week walkout over gerrymandered US House map plan", "url": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/08/18/texas-democrats-2026-election-redistricting/", "text": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Texas Democrats say they are ending a two-week walkout that stalled Republican efforts to redraw congressional districts to satisfy President Donald Trump\u2019s demands for a greater GOP advantage.\nDemocratic leaders say they will return for a second special legislative session after seeing California Democratic leaders proceed with plans to redraw their own U.S. House maps to neutralize Republican gains in Texas.\nThe nation\u2019s two most populous states have been at the forefront of a national fight to reshape the congressional landscape ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

(AP) \u2014 California Democrats are making a partisan push to draw new congressional districts and reshape the state\u2019s U.S. House representation in their favor, but to pull it off, lawmakers returning to the Capitol on Monday face a tight deadline and must still win voters\u2019 approval.\nLimits on federal immigration raids and advancing racial justice efforts are also among the hundreds of proposals the Legislature will vote on before the session ends in September.\nHere\u2019s a look at what\u2019s ahead for lawmakers in their last month in session:\nNew political maps\nLawmakers are expected to spend the first week back after summer break advancing the new congressional map at the urging of Gov. Gavin Newsom. The new map aims at winning Democrats five more U.S. House seats in the 2026 midterms and is a direct response to President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to redraw Texas\u2019 map to help Republicans retain their control of the U.S. House.\nSo far, California is the only state beyond Texas that has officially waded into the redistricting fight, although others have signaled they might launch their own efforts.\nCalifornia Democrats, who hold supermajorities in both chambers, unveiled the new map Friday. State lawmakers in both houses will hold hearings on the map and vote to put it to voters in a special election in November.\nIf voters agree, the new map would replace the one drawn by an independent commission that took effect in 2022. The new map would only take effect if Texas or another Republican-led state moves forward with their own mid-decade redistricting and would remain through the 2030 elections.\nDemocrats said they will return the map-making power to the commission after the next census. The current effort is to save democracy and counter Trump\u2019s agenda, they said.\nState Republicans vowed to legally challenge the effort, arguing that voters in 2010 already voted to remove partisan influence from how maps are drawn.\nClimate change\nState lawmakers are contending with how to balance meeting the state\u2019s climate goals with lowering utility and gas prices. Those discussions have been colored by the planned closures of two oil refineries that account for nearly 18% of the state\u2019s refining capacity, according to air regulators.\nThe Legislature will have to respond to those concerns when it debates whether to reauthorize the state\u2019s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire in 2030. The program allows large greenhouse gas emitters to buy allowances from the state equivalent to what they plan to emit. Over time, fewer allowances are made available with the goal of spurring companies to pollute less.\nA large portion of revenues from the program goes into a fund that helps pay for climate, affordable housing and transportation projects. The program also funds a credit that Californians receive twice a year on their utility bills.\nNewsom wants lawmakers to extend the program through 2045, commit $1 billion annually from the fund for the state\u2019s long-delayed high-speed rail project and set aside $1.5 billion a year for state fire response.\nMany environmental groups want the state to update the program by ending free allowances for industrial emitters, ensuring low-income households receive a higher credit on their utility bills, and ending or strengthening an offset program that helps companies comply by supporting projects aimed at reducing planet-warming emissions.\nResponse to mass immigration raids\nLawmakers will vote on a host of proposals introduced in response to the escalation of federal immigration crackdowns in Los Angeles and across the state. That includes legislation that would make it a misdemeanor for local, state and federal law enforcement officers to cover their faces while conducting official business.\nThe proposal makes exceptions for officers wearing a medical grade mask, coverings designed to protect against exposure to smoke during a wildfire, and other protective gear used by SWAT officers while performing their duties. Proponents said the measure would boost transparency and public trust in law enforcement while also preventing people from trying to impersonate law enforcement.\nOpponents, including law enforcement, said the bill would disrupt local undercover operations without addressing the issue because California doesn\u2019t have authority over federal agents.\nAnother proposal would require law enforcement to identify themselves during official business.\nState Democrats are also championing several proposals that would limit immigration agents without warrants from entering school campuses, hospitals and homeless or domestic violence shelters.\nRacial justice\nA first-in-the-nation state task force released a report in 2023 with more than 100 recommendations for how the state should repair historic wrongdoings against Black Californians descended from enslaved people.\nThe California Legislative Black Caucus introduced a reparations package last year inspired by that work, but the measures did not include direct payments for descendants, and the most ambitious proposals were blocked.\nThe caucus introduced another package this year aimed at offering redress to Black Californians.\nOne of the bills would authorize universities to give admissions priority to descendants of enslaved people. Another would ensure 10% of funds from a state program providing loans to first-time homebuyers goes to descendants. A third would allow the state to set aside $6 million to fund research by California State University on how to confirm residents\u2019 eligibility for any reparations programs.\nSome reparations advocates say the proposals fall short. They say many of the measures are ways to delay implementing one of the task force\u2019s key recommendations: direct compensation to descendants of slavery.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:41:26 +0000", "author": "Associated Press", "source": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/feed/", "tag": "politics"}, {"domain": "www.baltimoresun.com", "title": "What to know about Zelenskyy\u2019s meeting with Trump", "url": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/08/18/zelenskyy-europe-trump-washington-meeting/", "text": "By BARRY HATTON, Associated Press\nU.S. President Donald Trump is set to host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday to discuss how to end Russia\u2019s three-year war in Ukraine.\nMonths of U.S.-led diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting haven\u2019t made headway, but the stakes have risen since Trump met with with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday. After that summit, Trump abandoned the requirement of reaching a ceasefire in order to hold further talks and aligned with Putin\u2019s position that negotiations should focus on a long-term settlement instead.\nThe presence of several European leaders at the talks in Washington shows how central the conflict \u2014 and any settlement \u2014 is to wider security questions on the continent.\nThey are looking to safeguard Ukraine and Europe more broadly from any further aggression from Moscow \u2014 but also are providing a show of support for Zelenskyy after his last visit to the White House led to an angry confrontation. The American and Ukrainian leaders are scheduled to first meet privately, without the Europeans.\nOn \u201cTrump\u2019s ultimate policy towards the Russia-Ukraine war hangs not just the future of Ukraine security, but Europe\u2019s as well,\u2019\u2019 said Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cThe stakes could not be higher for the continent.\u2019\u2019\nHere\u2019s what to know about the Washington meeting.\nThe talks could be a pivotal moment in the war\nAfter meeting Putin in Alaska, Trump is making a big push for a breakthrough.\nA lot of issues need to be resolved, however, and the two sides have previously established red lines that are incompatible, including questions of whether Ukraine will cede any land to Russia, the future of Ukraine\u2019s army and whether the country will have any guarantee against further Russian aggression.\nIn a post on social media Sunday night, Trump appeared to shift the burden for ending the war to Zelenskyy, whose country was invaded in February 2022.\n\u201cPresident Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,\u201d he wrote.\nA comprehensive peace deal could still be a long way off.\nPutin wants the Donbas\nAs a condition for peace, the Russian leader wants Kyiv to give up the Donbas, the industrial region in eastern Ukraine that has seen some of the most intense fighting but that Russian forces have failed to capture completely.\nIn his Sunday night post, Trump wrote that Zelenskyy should also accept Russia\u2019s illegal 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region.\nAs part of a deal, Putin has said the United States and its European allies can provide Ukraine with a security guarantee resembling NATO\u2019s collective defense pledge, according to a senior U.S. official.\nTrump envoy Steve Witkoff called that a \u201cgame-changing\u201d step though he offered few details on how it would work.\nUkraine has long pressed for some kind of guarantee that would prevent Russia from invading again.\nUkraine won\u2019t surrender land to Russia\nZelenskyy has rejected Putin\u2019s demand that Ukraine surrender the Donbas region, made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, since the Ukrainian Constitution forbids giving up territory or trading land. That also means he can\u2019t cede Crimea either.\nInstead, freezing the front line \u2014 which snakes roughly 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from northeastern to southeastern Ukraine \u2014 seems to be the most the Ukrainian people might accept.\nRussia currently holds about 20% of Ukrainian territory.\nEurope\u2019s security is also at stake in the talks\nEuropean leaders see Ukraine\u2019s fight as a bulwark against any Kremlin ambitions to threaten other countries in eastern Europe and beyond.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron described Ukraine as an \u201coutpost of our collective defense if Russia wanted to advance again.\u201d\n\u201cIf we are weak with Russia today, we\u2019ll be preparing the conflicts of tomorrow and they will impact the Ukrainians and \u2014 make no mistake \u2014 they can impact us, too.\u201d Macron said Sunday.\nThe European political heavyweights expected in Washington are Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.\nCivilians are killed as the fighting continues\nUkraine has in recent months been losing more territory against Russia\u2019s bigger army, and Moscow\u2019s forces breached Ukrainian lines in a series of minor infiltrations in the Donetsk region ahead of the Alaska summit. But there is no sign of a looming, major Russian breakthrough on the front line.\nBoth sides have also kept up their daily long-range strikes behind the front line.\nA Russian drone strike on Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, killed six people late Sunday, including an 18-month-old and a 16-year-old, according to regional head Oleh Syniehubov.

Many are coming with the explicit goal of protecting Ukraine\u2019s interests \u2014 a rare and sweeping show of diplomatic force.\nBy coming as a group, they hope to avoid debacles like Zelenskyy\u2019s February meeting in the Oval Office, where Trump chastised him for not showing enough gratitude for U.S. military aid. Trump and Zelenskyy were due to meet in the Oval Office before European leaders join them in the East Room for talks.\nThe meetings are also a test of America\u2019s relationship with its closest allies after the European Union and United Kingdom accepted Trump\u2019s tariff hikes partly because they wanted his support on Ukraine.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine, and therefore for all of Europe,\u201d Zelenskyy said on X.\nThe night before the meeting, however, Trump seemed to put the onus on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions and suggested that Ukraine could not regain Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, setting off an armed conflict that led to its broader 2022 invasion.\n\u201cPresident Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,\u201d Trump wrote Sunday night on social media. \u201cRemember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\u201d\nZelenskyy appeared to respond with his own post late Sunday, saying, \u201cWe all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.\u201d He said that \u201cpeace must be lasting,\u201d not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago, and \u201cPutin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack.\u201d\nThe sitdown in Alaska yielded the possible contours for stopping the war in Ukraine, though it was unclear whether the terms discussed would ultimately be acceptable to Zelenskyy or Putin.\nZelenskyy said in a social media post he met with Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, on Monday ahead of his scheduled talks with Trump to discuss the battlefield situation and the shared \u201cstrong diplomatic capabilities\u201d of the U.S., Ukraine and Europe.\nEuropean heavyweights in Washington\nPlanning to join Zelenskyy in Washington are European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.\nOn the table for discussion are possible NATO-like security guarantees that Ukraine would need for any peace with Russia to be durable. Putin opposes Ukraine joining NATO outright, yet Trump\u2019s team claims the Russian leader is open to allies agreeing to defend Ukraine if it comes under attack.\nThe European leaders are aiming to keep the focus during the White House talks on finding a sustainable peace and believe forging a temporary ceasefire is not off the table, according to a European official.\nThe official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the leaders are also looking to keep pressure on Russia to end the fighting and want to get more concrete assurances from the U.S. about security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any deal.\nTrump briefed Zelenskyy and European allies shortly after the Putin meeting, and details from the discussions emerged in a scattershot way that seemed to rankle the U.S. president, who had chosen not to outline any terms when appearing afterward with Putin.\nAhead of Monday\u2019s White House meetings, Trump took to social media to say that even if Russia said, \u201cWe give up, we concede, we surrender\u201d the news media and Democrats \u201cwould say that this was a bad and humiliating day for Donald J. Trump.\u201d He separately lashed out at the Wall Street Journal and other outlets \u201cwho truly don\u2019t have a clue, tell me everything that I am doing wrong on the Russia/Ukraine MESS.\u201d\nFollowing the Alaska summit, Trump declared that a ceasefire was not necessary for peace talks to proceed, a sudden shift to a position favored by Putin.\n\u2018A very big move\u2019\nEuropean officials confirmed that Trump told them Putin is still seeking control of the entire Donbas region, even though Ukraine controls a meaningful share of it.\nTrump\u2019s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said the U.S. and its allies could offer Ukraine a NATO-like commitment to defend the country if it came under attack as the possible security guarantee, with details to be worked out.\nMonday\u2019s meeting will likely be very tough for Zelenskyy, an official close to the ongoing talks said. That official spoke on condition of anonymity to speak openly about thinking within Ukraine and between allies.\nZelenskyy needs to prevent a scenario in which he gets blamed for blocking peace talks by rejecting Putin\u2019s maximalist demand on the Donbas, the official said. It is a demand Zelenskyy has said many times he will never accept because it is unconstitutional and could create a launching pad for future Russian attacks.\nIf confronted with pressure to accept Putin\u2019s demands, Zelenskyy would likely have to revert to a skill he has demonstrated time and again: diplomatic tact. The Ukrainian leadership is seeking a trilateral meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump and Putin to discuss sensitive matters, including territorial issues.\nTrump\u2019s ambition to end the war\nAfter enduring a public tirade by Trump and Vice President JD Vance in February, Zelenskyy worked to repair relations with the U.S.\nConstant diplomatic communication and a 15-minute meeting at the Vatican in April on the sidelines of Pope Francis\u2019 funeral helped turn the tide. Trump appeared at the time to be swayed by Zelenskyy\u2019s conditions for peace.\nBut Trump says he cares primarily about ending the war, an ambition that led him after his meeting with Putin to discard the need for a ceasefire.\nEuropean allies also have worked with Trump, reaching a deal in July for NATO allies to buy weapons from the U.S. for Ukraine.\nRussia continues attacks on Ukraine\nRussian forces continued to pound Ukraine with missiles and drones.\nA Russian drone strike on Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second largest city, killed seven civilians late Sunday. Among the victims was a toddler and a 16-year-old, according to local officials. The strike also injured 20 people, including six children, authorities said.\nUkraine\u2019s Air Force said Russia launched a total of four Iskander-M ballistic missiles and 140 Shahed and decoy drones across Ukraine overnight, of which 88 drones were intercepted or jammed.\nKullab reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.

However, Trump has said he is intent on brokering a permanent solution.\nHealth minister Stephen Kinnock said this morning that it was important that any agreement reached has Zelensky's support.\n\u201cIt is their territory, their country. We will support President Zelensky in whatever he determines. Our job then is to have that ironclad security guarantee,\" he told LBC.\nMeanwhile, Reform UK's Deputy Leader Richard Tice has suggested that Ukraine should not be admitted to NATO if it is an absolute red line for Putin in peace talks.\nIn an interview with the Latika Takes Podcast, shared with PoliticsHome, he said Kyiv had to be prepared to accept an \u201cuncomfortable compromise\u201d for an \u201cenduring settlement\".\nTice, who also serves as Reform\u2019s foreign affairs spokesman, said that Western security guarantees were more important than Kyiv\u2019s entry into the trans-Atlantic defence alliance, particularly if it proved a deal-breaker over any ceasefire.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:34:00 GMT", "author": "Tom Scotson", "source": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/rss", "tag": "politics"}, {"domain": "www.coindesk.com", "title": "BitMine Immersion's Ether Holdings Top $6.6B, Stock Slides 7% Alongside ETH's Tumble", "url": "https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/08/18/bitmine-s-ether-holdings-top-usd6-6b-stock-slides-7-alongside-eth-s-tumble", "text": "- Back to menuPrices\n- Back to menuResearch\n- Back to menu\n- Back to menu\n- Back to menu\n- Back to menu\n- Back to menuWebinars\nBitMine Immersion's Ether Holdings Top $6.6B, Stock Slides 7% Alongside ETH's Tumble\nThe Tom Lee-led firm increased its ether stash to 1.5 million tokens last week, up from 1.15 million.\nWhat to know:\n- BitMine's ETH holdings surpassed 1.5 million ETH worth more than $6 billion.\n- The stock's lower by another 7% as ether continued to quickly pull back from its near record-high last wee.\n- Rival ETH treasury company SharpLink (SBET) as well as Solana-focused names Upexi (UPXI), DeFi Development (DFDV) also traded lower.\nIn this article\nBitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), the listed firm with a digital asset treasury strategy focusing on Ethereum and led by Fundstrat's Tom Lee, said in a Monday SEC filing that its holdings surpassed 1.5 million ether (ETH) worth roughly $6.6 billion.\nWith the latest purchases, it has become the second largest public corporate crypto owner, topping miner MARA Holdings (MARA) and trailing only the original treasury play Strategy (MSTR), which owns $72 billion in bitcoin\n, per Bitcointreasuries.net.

It also marked the inability to keep gains above the significant long-term resistance trendline that connects the bull market highs of 2017 and 2021.\nAdditionally, the weekly stochastic oscillator has rolled over from the overbought zone above 80, signaling a potential correction ahead.\nDaily chart\nOn the daily chart, BTC\u2019s latest candle has broken below the bullish trendline extending from April lows, following Friday\u2019s bearish outside-day candle that signaled a potential shift toward seller dominance.\nTogether, these technical signals indicate an increasing downside risk for BTC in the near term, with a potential retest of $11,982, the point from which the market turned higher on Aug. 3.

However, the annualized three-month premium has declined sharply to 15% from 35% last week.

The OI here has continued to print lower highs since December, diverging bearishly from the new highs in the spot price.\n- On Deribit, risk reversals out to November expiry showed a bias for put options as the spot price drop spurred demand for downside protection.

At the time of writing, Cointelegraph data showed ETH traded at $4,260, down from a high of about $4,700 on Wednesday.Many NFTs are minted on the Ethereum network. With valuations and sales denominated in ETH, bullish or bearish momentum in the crypto asset often translates into increased or decreased value in the NFT sector. As ETH went down 4% in the last 24 hours, a majority of the top 10 collections also showed declines in value.\nWhile it continued to be the top collection by market capitalization, CryptoPunks saw about $300 million wiped from the collection\u2019s value.\nAt the time of writing, data showed it was worth $2.1 billion, down 12% from its 2.4 billion market cap on Wednesday.\nThailand plans to launch crypto payment sandbox for tourists\nThe Thai government is planning to announce a nationwide regulatory sandbox to allow visitors to convert crypto into local currency for electronic payments in a bid to boost tourism, local newspaper The Nation reported on Saturday.\nThe scheme, known as TouristDigiPay, is expected to go live on Monday and allows users to exchange crypto for Thai baht and make electronic payments through providers regulated by the country\u2019s central bank and Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTourists in Thailand will be eligible to use the service after undergoing Know Your Customer due diligence checks and opening an account with a digital asset business.

One of them is Bio Protocol (BIO), which reached a daily high of $0.1514 before stabilizing at $0.1301. Even after the correction, the token is up 25% on a daily basis. The surge brought the token\u2019s market cap to $217.58 million.\nAccompanying the token\u2019s strong performance was a 720.24% increase in daily volume, which reached $443.47 million. What is likely driving increased trading interest is a series of updates that helped boost the token\u2019s scarcity and utility.\nFor one, one of the protocols on BIO\u2019s platform, Cerebrum DAO, approved its first funding for a human clinical trial. Its community voted in favor of the protocol to raise $80,000 to expand the trials for a brain health supplement, Percepta, focusing on memory loss and neurodegeneration.\nBio Protocol will provide the funding.

This acquisition pales in comparison to the 31,466 BTC the company scooped up in a three-week span ending August 3, or even the 17,075 BTC bought throughout June.\nThe tempered approach comes as Bitcoin experiences heightened volatility, with prices swinging from a record $124,000 last Wednesday to $115,716 at press time after a 3% drop in 24 hours, per crypto.news data.\nAlongside the purchase, Strategy adjusted its MSTR Equity ATM (at-the-market) guidance. Now, when its market-to-NAV ratio falls below 2.5x, it will flexibly issue common shares to: pay debt interest, cover preferred dividend obligations, or for other strategic purposes.\nThis framework, disclosed alongside the Form 8-K, suggests Strategy is preparing for multiple market scenarios while preserving its treasury\u2019s dominance.

Among these is Wall Street\u2019s focus on the Federal Reserve\u2019s Jackson Hole conference set for Aug. 21 to 23 in Wyoming.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at the central bank symposium, with this being his final Jackson Hole speech before his term ends in May 2026. Key to investor attention at the conference will be Powell\u2019s commentary on the U.S. economic outlook as well as the Fed\u2019s monetary policy framework, the latter crucial, as expectations of a Fed rate cut in September remain high.\nAlso on the agenda and key to sentiment are upcoming retail giants\u2019 earnings reports, geopolitics, and global trade. In terms of earnings, Wall Street will be keen on Walmart, Home Depot, and Target, crucial reports in the broad take on tariffs and inflation impact.\nGeopolitics remain near the top of the agenda after U.S. President Donald Trump met Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.

Despite this pullback, the structure remains bullish as price action finds stability at a strong support zone, suggesting momentum is far from exhausted.\nKey technical points\n- Major Support at $0.22: Confluence of 0.618 Fibonacci and VWAP.\n- Resistance Levels: High timeframe targets at $0.32 and $0.41.\n- Volume Profile: Sustained increases indicate ongoing demand.\nDogecoin\u2019s corrective move from the $0.28 high has not undermined its overall bullish structure. Instead, price has retested the $0.22 high time frame support, a region strengthened by confluence between the 0.618 Fibonacci level and the VWAP. This confluence forms a critical demand zone where buyers are stepping in, allowing price to stabilize before making another attempt toward higher resistances. Maintaining this region is essential for Dogecoin to remain bullish on the daily and weekly time frames.\nStructurally, DOGE continues to print higher highs and higher lows, maintaining a clear bullish trend on the daily timeframe. The current price action appears to be a consolidation within an uptrend rather than a breakdown. A successful defense of the $0.22 support will mark another higher low and build the foundation for continuation toward the next resistance levels.\nVolume also supports this thesis. Despite the price pullback, volume inflows remain elevated, indicating that buyers are absorbing sell pressure. As long as demand remains consistent, the likelihood of reclaiming the value area high continues to increase. A close above this area would signal renewed strength and likely draw in momentum buyers.\nLooking ahead, reclaiming $0.28 would shift focus toward the next resistance zones at $0.32 and $0.41. These are high timeframe levels where sellers may become more active. A clean break above them on rising volume could trigger an extended rally, opening the door for Dogecoin to reach new local highs.\nWhat to expect in the coming price action\nAs long as Dogecoin holds above the $0.22 support level, the broader outlook remains bullish. A reclaim of the $0.28 level, followed by a push toward $0.32 and $0.41, would confirm strength.

Smaller altcoins like Raydium, Aerodrome Finance, and Bonk were among the top laggards.\nCrypto market crashing amid rising liquidations\nA major reason for today\u2019s market drop is a wave of liquidations across crypto exchanges. Exchanges have been closing highly leveraged bullish trades, adding significant selling pressure to the market.\nAccording to CoinGlass data, 24-hour liquidations surged by 327%, with over 131,000 traders liquidated. The largest single liquidation was valued at $7.83 million.\nThese liquidations coincided with profit-taking from investors after strong rallies across most major cryptocurrencies in recent weeks.\nUpcoming Jerome Powell Jackson Hole Symposium speech\nAnother catalyst is the upcoming speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole Symposium in Wyoming, one of the most closely watched annual events for monetary policy signals.\nThe speech comes as market participants are paring back hopes for a cut after last week\u2019s strong consumer and producer inflation data. The core consumer price index jumped to 3.1%, while the producer price index moved to 3.6%. Another report showed that inflation expectations continued rising.\nGiven this backdrop, Powell is expected to signal a more cautious, wait-and-see approach, especially as the Fed monitors the economic impact of Donald Trump\u2019s newly implemented tariffs on major trading partners.\nTechnicals have contributed to the crypto crash\nTechnical factors have also contributed to the ongoing crash. Many altcoins had surged to overbought levels after recent rallies, diverging sharply from their historical averages.\nEthereum is a prime example. The coin hit a multi-year high of $4,785 last week, pushing its Relative Strength Index to 87.6, a level considered highly overbought. Such readings often trigger pullbacks as traders lock in profits.\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s price was significantly above both its 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages. The current decline may reflect a broader mean reversion trend, where assets revert back to their historical norms. Similar setups are unfolding across other altcoins as well.\nIs this the end of the crypto bull run?\nThe ongoing crypto crash is likely not the end of the bull run as the industry has multiple catalysts. Exchange Traded Funds inflows have continued rising, and more treasury companies are coming, leading to higher demand.\nMoreover, the Fed is still expected to begin cutting rates later this year, with further acceleration anticipated in 2026 when Donald Trump replaces Powell.\nMost importantly, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to approve several crypto ETFs before the end of the year, potentially unlocking even greater institutional demand.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:05:36 +0000", "author": "Crispus Nyaga", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "crypto.news", "title": "Crypto summer heats up: XYZVerse presale surges massively", "url": "https://crypto.news/crypto-summer-heats-up-xyzverse-presale-surges-massively/", "text": "Crypto summer heats up: XYZVerse presale surges massively\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

At the same time, BONK and WIF are picking up speed again after a pause. Unusual activity is driving speculation about what comes next. A fresh wave of optimism is sweeping through, leaving everyone eager to know what\u2019s fueling the surge.\nXYZVerse targets sports-fueled memecoin niche with 50x growth ambition\nXYZVerse, billing itself as the first all-sports meme token, is aiming to carve out a new category in the digital asset market. The project is seeking up to 50-fold gains upon launch, with its presale offering XYZ tokens at steep discounts to the projected listing price.\nThe token has advanced from the launch price of $0.0001 to the current $0.0053, raising more than $15 million to date. The target listing price stands at $0.10, implying a significant premium to current presale levels. XYZVerse is featured on CoinMarketCap, where 95% of community votes registered as bullish.\nToken structure and supply management\nXYZVerse has allocated 15% of supply to liquidity and 10% to community rewards such as airdrops and bonuses. The project plans to burn 17.13% of its total token supply over time in an effort to reduce circulating supply and support price stability.\nThe project has launched an Ambassador Program to incentivize grassroots promotion and is in talks with major sports figures to expand reach. A partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ offers token holders bonuses on their first bets, introducing a utility component beyond speculative trading.\nXYZVerse\u2019s combination of sports branding, meme culture and utility-driven partnerships has attracted early interest. Whether it can sustain momentum post-launch will depend on execution, market conditions and the ability to convert presale hype into long-term adoption.\nBonk gains keep hopes alive\nBonk keeps traders alert. Over the past 7 days, the coin slipped 5.93 percent. The slide deepened to 17.55 percent for the past month. Yet over 6 months, BONK is still up 35.96 percent. Current trade sits between 0.00002442 and 0.00002980 dollars, hugging the 10-day average of 0.00002447 and under the 100-day mark at 0.00002571.\nMomentum looks mixed. RSI is 43.95, showing mild selling. Stochastic at 74.54 hints buyers are active. MACD is just below zero, pointing to a flat short-term mood. The nearest ceiling sits at 0.00003197. Beating that could send the token toward 0.00003735.\nIf bulls tire, BONK may drop to the first floor at 0.00002121 or even 0.00001583. From the lower end of today\u2019s range, a jump to the first ceiling offers about 30 percent upside, while a slide to the floor risks near 13 percent. Recent red candles point to more chop, yet the long-term gain keeps hope alive. Reclaiming the 100-day mark could unlock a 7 to 25 percent lift. Otherwise price may drift or slip toward support.\nDogwifhat hints at bounce\nWIF is drifting. The token lost 1.82% this week and 13.16% in a month, slipping below both its 10-day and 100-day averages near $0.93 and $0.97. Yet the six-month score is still up 35.48%, so longer holders are green. A strength gauge at 39 hints that sellers are tiring, while the speed meter at 74 shows traders are still active.\nPrice now moves between $0.89 and $1.08. The first floor sits at $0.78, with a deeper catch at $0.58. On the upside, the first ceiling is $1.16, then $1.35. A close above $1.16 would add roughly 8% from today\u2019s top range and could open a rush toward $1.35, a jump of around 25%. A drop through $0.78 would shave about 15%, and breaking $0.58 would mean another 25% slide.\nShort term, the down-tilted averages and a small negative trend signal point to more chop or a dip toward $0.78. Medium term, the solid six-month gain and fading sell pressure hint at a bounce. If buyers regain control, reclaiming $1.16 looks doable, with $1.35 the stretch mark.\nConclusion\nBONK and WIF stay strong in the 2025 run. XYZVerse, the first all-sport memecoin, aims for 50x growth with GameFi plans and a fan-driven ecosystem ready to lead.\nTo learn more about XYZVerse, visit the official website, Telegram, and Twitter.\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party.

While these steps are nice to have, they\u2019re a far cry from a revolution. The truth is that equities are already very efficient markets, meaning the marginal gains from deploying blockchain technology are notably small.\nThis means the fundamental transformation lies in markets and asset classes where inefficiencies are still deeply embedded. Private markets remain less transparent, more expensive to access and off-limits primarily to over 80% of investors. To have an actual influence on finance, we need to rearchitect access to capital itself. Tokenizing private equity has the potential to remake capital formation, not just digitize it, unlocking a massive new level of financial inclusion.\nWhere are the customers\u2019 yachts?\nIn today\u2019s system, access to high-growth private companies is limited to accredited investors and institutions, leaving retail investors locked out of early-stage growth opportunities. When a company goes public, venture capitalists and hedge funds have swallowed most of the pie.\nThe public markets weren\u2019t always the late-game arena they are today. Companies IPOd earlier a generation ago, letting retail investors ride decades of growth. Amazon went public at a $438-million valuation, while today\u2019s giants stay private until they\u2019re worth $50 billion. Over the past 20 years, capital formation has shifted upstream, and companies remain private longer; Stripe, SpaceX and OpenAI are now worth tens of billions without ever listing. Meanwhile, accreditation rules limit participation in private markets to those with a $1-million net worth or high incomes.\nRelated: Private companies line up to join Robinhood\u2019s tokenized equity platform: CEO\nThis trend isn\u2019t limited to Silicon Valley. Companies increasingly raise capital across Europe, Asia and the Gulf through private placements, sovereign funds and family offices, not initial public offerings (IPOs).\nThe result is a global freeze-out of ordinary investors from the most dynamic parts of the economy.\nTokenization has the potential to break this cycle, not just for investors but for the companies themselves. Instead of relying on a limited pool of venture funds or high-net-worth individuals, putting private shares onchain would allow companies to raise capital from a broader global audience.\nBy representing ownership digitally and enabling programmable transfers, blockchain infrastructure makes it possible to securely fractionalize, trade and settle these assets without the friction of traditional intermediaries. That means lowering the cost and complexity of fundraising while unlocking the door for everyday investors to participate in their growth. It would also provide more liquidity to early employees and backers by making selling a portion of their shares easier without waiting for a full exit, like an IPO.\nWithout this, people can spend years building something meaningful yet remain locked into untouchable equity \u2014 a problem that tokenization can finally solve.\nCareful of risk or hoarding the reward\nBy the end of 2025, private markets will represent a projected $15-trillion-walled-off opportunity, dwarfing public equities\u2019 growth potential. Yet most people can\u2019t participate; retail investors compose 62% of US households and are systematically excluded by accreditation laws and disclosure requirements designed in the 1930s. Enabling companies to tokenize shares before $300 million in revenues would give millions of people access to innovation-stage companies that have historically been the domain of VCs and hedge funds. Risks have to be acknowledged, but they shouldn\u2019t be overstated.\nOne of the most persistent objections is that tokenization could expose retail investors to risks they may not fully understand or can afford and that private equity is too illiquid, speculative and volatile. But this overlooks what\u2019s already happening in public markets. If a 22-year-old can invest in leveraged meme stocks or trade crypto options, why shouldn\u2019t they be able to put $500 into an early-stage AI startup they believe in, provided there\u2019s proper disclosure and oversight? The real issue is the lack of financial education, which persists in our school systems and leaves everyday investors woefully unprepared to navigate any market, public or private.\nTokenization doesn\u2019t mean throwing out safeguards. More transparency results in better outcomes, and blockchain technology offers that. The question is: Whose interest is the current system protecting? There is a middle ground between locking small investors out and allowing them access safely, and this is precisely what tokenization can do. It\u2019s not just a 10x improvement; it\u2019s a 100x unlock for financial inclusion, giving everyday people the chance to back the companies they believe in.\nAccess is the ultimate asset\nTokenizing private equity could rewrite the rules of participation, opening a massive new addressable market for companies and dismantling a system where only accredited investors, defined by arbitrary wealth thresholds, are trusted to take risks. It also creates a two-way unlock: Startups can tap new global capital sources, and investors worldwide can participate in economic growth from day one. For capital markets in emerging economies, where IPO infrastructure is thin or nonexistent, tokenized private equity could leapfrog legacy structures entirely.\nYes, the stakes are high, but this could be one of the biggest democratizations of wealth creation in history. The alternative is keeping capital formation locked in an expensive, exclusionary system that limits innovation and participation. Tokenization doesn\u2019t just speed up transactions; it rewires who gets to participate, shifting the center of gravity from a handful of gatekeepers to a global network of contributors. That shift wouldn\u2019t just change how companies are funded but who shapes the economy.\nWe don\u2019t need faster trains on old tracks \u2014 we need entirely new rails. Tokenized private equity could lay them and may define whether the next generation builds wealth or watches others do it from the outside.\nOpinion by: Alex Svanevik, CEO of Nansen.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

This downturn appears to be driven primarily by technical factors rather than fundamental news, as no significant developments have emerged for MANTRA in recent days.\nThe absence of fresh catalysts has left OM vulnerable to broader market sentiment and technical selling pressure. Trading volume on Binance spot reached $8.69 million over the past 24 hours, suggesting moderate investor interest despite the price decline.\nOM Technical Analysis: Neutral Signals Emerge\nMANTRA technical analysis reveals a complex picture with mixed signals across different timeframes. The OM RSI currently reads 43.42, placing it firmly in neutral territory - neither oversold nor overbought. This suggests that while selling pressure exists, MANTRA hasn't reached extreme levels that typically signal immediate reversal opportunities.\nThe MACD indicator presents a more concerning picture for OM bulls, with the histogram showing -0.0029, indicating bearish momentum is building. MANTRA's MACD line sits below the signal line, reinforcing the short-term negative outlook.\nMoving averages paint an interesting story for OM price action. The shorter-term averages (SMA 7, SMA 20, EMA 12, and EMA 26) all cluster around $0.26, creating a tight resistance zone just above current levels. However, the dramatic gap to the SMA 200 at $2.60 highlights the significant distance MANTRA has fallen from its previous highs.\nMANTRA's Stochastic indicators show oversold conditions with %K at 4.32 and %D at 19.41, potentially setting up for a short-term bounce if buying interest emerges.\nMANTRA Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, MANTRA support levels are clearly defined in the current market structure. The immediate support for OM sits at $0.22, which represents a critical level for maintaining the current trading range. Should this level fail, MANTRA faces a more significant support test at $0.19.\nOn the upside, OM resistance appears formidable at $0.30, which aligns closely with the cluster of moving averages. This creates a technical ceiling that MANTRA bulls must overcome to shift momentum. The stronger resistance at $0.40 represents a more ambitious target that would require substantial volume and positive catalysts.\nThe Bollinger Bands analysis shows OM trading near the lower portion of its range, with the price positioned at 0.2591 on the %B indicator. The upper band at $0.29 serves as another resistance confirmation, while the lower band at $0.23 provides additional support context.\nShould You Buy OM Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor short-term traders, the current OM price setup presents a challenging environment. The neutral RSI suggests limited immediate downside protection, while the bearish MACD momentum indicates potential for further weakness. Conservative traders might wait for either a clear break above $0.30 resistance or a test of the $0.22 support level before establishing positions.\nSwing traders focusing on MANTRA might find value in the current oversold Stochastic readings, particularly if broader market conditions stabilize. However, the risk-reward ratio favors waiting for clearer directional signals, given the tight clustering of moving averages creating resistance overhead.\nLong-term investors should note the dramatic gap between current OM price levels and the 200-day moving average, suggesting MANTRA remains in a significant downtrend on longer timeframes. The 52-week range from $0.20 to $8.50 illustrates the extreme volatility this asset has experienced.\nRisk management remains crucial for any OM position, with stop-losses below $0.22 for long positions and profit targets near $0.29-$0.30 for any short-term bounces.\nConclusion\nMANTRA's current price action reflects a market in transition, with OM trading at critical technical levels that will likely determine near-term direction. The 5% decline has brought the token to important support areas, while mixed technical indicators suggest traders should remain cautious. Over the next 24-48 hours, watch for OM's ability to hold above $0.22 support and any volume-driven moves toward the $0.30 resistance cluster. Without fresh fundamental catalysts, MANTRA price will likely remain dependent on technical factors and broader cryptocurrency market sentiment.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:06:10 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "cointelegraph.com", "title": "Strategy adds $51M in Bitcoin as price hit $124K ahead of sharp dip", "url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/strategy-adds-51m-in-bitcoin-as-btc-hit-124k-ahead-of-dip?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound", "text": "Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy, the world\u2019s largest public Bitcoin holder, added more BTC to its balance as the price swung to new all-time highs before retreating last week.\nStrategy acquired 430 Bitcoin\nfor $51.4 million during the week ending Sunday, according to a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Monday.The new Bitcoin batch cost the company an average price of $119,666 per coin, reflecting the massive volatility last week, with BTC trading at about $120,000 on Monday and slipping to as low as $115,000 on Sunday, according to CoinGecko.\nThe acquisition moved Strategy\u2019s Bitcoin holdings to 629,376 BTC, purchased for about $46.15 billion at an average price of $73,320 per coin.\n\u201cVolatility is a gift to the faithful\u201d\nAs Bitcoin saw high volatility last week, surging above $124,000 on Wednesday only to retreat to $115,000 by the end of the week, Strategy\u2019s co-founder Saylor took to X to comment on the volatile prices.\n\u201cVolatility is a gift to the faithful,\u201d he wrote on Thursday amid the BTC price tumbling below $118,000 the next day after reaching new all-time highs.\nSaylor also previously reported that Strategy\u2019s Bitcoin holdings closed at an all-time high of $77.2 billion at the all-time high prices.\nAugust for \u201csmall\u201d buys?\nStrategy\u2019s new 430 BTC purchase followed another \u201csmall\u201d Bitcoin buy of just 155 BTC announced last week, marking a significant drop from multi-thousand purchases made in previous months.\nThe company bought as much as 31,466 BTC in three purchases from July 14 to Aug. 3, which marked a significant surge from a total 17,075 BTC purchased in June.\nThe acquisition was notably smaller than another Bitcoin buy by the Japanese investment company Metaplanet, which purchased 775 BTC for around $93 million at the average price of $120,006 per BTC.\nRelated: Dutch firm Amdax plans Bitcoin treasury listing on Euronext Amsterdam\nWhile Strategy\u2019s Bitcoin buying spree has been slowing down, Saylor continued following the growing Bitcoin treasury trend, reposting multiple updates, including ones by Metaplanet\u2019s Simon Gerovich and BTC treasuries follower NLNico.\nAccording to an NLNico post that Saylor retweeted on Monday, global BTC treasury companies collectively bought 3,900 Bitcoin and made a total of 62 announcements in the period from Aug. 11\u201317.\nMagazine: South Koreans dump Tesla for Ethereum treasury BitMine: Asia Express", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:09:04 +0100", "author": "Cointelegraph by Helen Partz", "source": "https://cointelegraph.com/rss", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "Blockchain.News", "title": "EigenLayer (EIGEN) Shows Bullish Momentum Despite 5% Daily Decline - Key Levels to Watch", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-eigenlayer-eigen-shows-bullish-momentum-despite-5-daily-decline-key", "text": "Quick Take\n\u2022 EIGEN currently trading at $1.35 (-5.07% in 24h) \u2022 EigenLayer's MACD histogram shows bullish momentum despite price decline \u2022 EIGEN RSI maintains neutral stance at 50.69, suggesting consolidation phase \u2022 No significant news catalysts driving current price action\nWhat's Driving EigenLayer Price Today?\nEigenLayer's price movement appears driven primarily by technical factors rather than fundamental news, as no significant developments have emerged in the past week. The 5.07% decline to $1.35 represents a typical consolidation move within the broader bullish trend that has characterized EIGEN's performance over recent months.\nThe lack of major news events suggests that current EIGEN price action is largely influenced by broader market sentiment and technical trading patterns. This creates an environment where technical analysis becomes particularly valuable for understanding potential price direction.\nEIGEN Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nEigenLayer technical analysis reveals a fascinating divergence between price action and momentum indicators. While the EIGEN price has declined 5% in the last 24 hours, the MACD histogram shows a bullish reading of 0.0068, indicating that buying pressure may be building beneath the surface.\nThe EIGEN RSI at 50.69 sits firmly in neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold. This positioning suggests that EigenLayer has room to move in either direction, making it crucial for traders to watch for the next catalyst. The RSI's neutral stance often precedes significant price movements as the market decides on direction.\nEigenLayer's moving averages paint a complex picture. The current EIGEN price of $1.35 sits above the 20-day SMA ($1.29) and 200-day SMA ($1.30), indicating underlying bullish structure. However, it trades below the 7-day SMA ($1.42), confirming the recent short-term weakness.\nEigenLayer Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical EigenLayer support levels emerge at $1.03, representing both immediate and strong support according to Binance spot market data. This level coincides with the lower Bollinger Band at $1.00, creating a significant zone where buyers may step in aggressively.\nOn the upside, EIGEN resistance appears at $1.67, marking both immediate and strong resistance levels. Breaking above this threshold could trigger momentum toward the upper Bollinger Band at $1.58, though this creates an interesting technical setup where resistance sits above the band.\nThe current EIGEN/USDT trading range of $1.30-$1.46 over the past 24 hours provides short-term boundaries for scalping strategies. The pivot point at $1.37 serves as a key decision level - EIGEN price action above this level favors bullish continuation, while sustained trading below could signal further downside.\nShould You Buy EIGEN Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nConservative traders should wait for a clear break above the 7-day SMA at $1.42 before considering long positions. This would confirm that the recent decline has ended and buying momentum is returning to EigenLayer.\nAggressive traders might consider the current EIGEN price of $1.35 attractive, given the bullish MACD histogram and proximity to key support. However, risk management becomes crucial with stops below $1.30 to protect against a breakdown toward the $1.03 support zone.\nSwing traders should note that EIGEN's position within the Bollinger Bands (%B at 0.6002) suggests the token remains in the upper portion of its recent range, indicating underlying strength despite the daily decline. The 14-period ATR of $0.14 provides context for position sizing and stop-loss placement.\nBased on Binance spot market data, the overall strong bullish trend classification suggests that current weakness may represent a buying opportunity for patient investors willing to hold through short-term volatility.\nConclusion\nEigenLayer's technical setup presents a compelling case for potential reversal despite today's 5% decline. The bullish MACD histogram combined with neutral EIGEN RSI readings suggests accumulation may be occurring at current levels. Traders should monitor the $1.37 pivot point closely over the next 24-48 hours, as a break above this level could signal the resumption of the broader uptrend toward $1.67 resistance.

Over the past 48 hours, ETHFI has declined 8.16%, dropping from the $1.26 high to test support at $1.12. This movement represents a continuation of the bearish sentiment that emerged after the initial buyback-driven rally.\nThe Foundation's $2.58 million buyback program initially sparked a 9% surge on August 9th, pushing the ETHFI price above key resistance levels to $1.22. However, this bullish momentum proved short-lived as broader market dynamics and profit-taking activities led to subsequent declines. Despite the buyback providing fundamental support, the ETHFI price has fallen 6.4% since August 12th, indicating that institutional buying alone cannot counter prevailing market forces.\nThe current price action suggests that while the Foundation's buyback program offers a fundamental floor, technical factors and market sentiment continue to drive short-term ETHFI price movements. The 24-hour trading volume of $21.2 million on Binance spot market indicates healthy liquidity, though the selling pressure has overwhelmed recent buying interest.\nETHFI Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nEther.Fi technical analysis reveals a complex picture with both bullish and bearish indicators present. The ETHFI RSI at 48.72 sits in neutral territory, suggesting neither oversold nor overbought conditions. This positioning provides flexibility for price movement in either direction, making the ETHFI price sensitive to immediate market catalysts.\nEther.Fi's MACD histogram shows a positive reading of 0.0016, indicating emerging bullish momentum despite the recent price decline. The MACD line at 0.0176 remains above the signal line at 0.0159, suggesting that the underlying trend momentum for Ether.Fi may be stabilizing. This divergence between price action and momentum indicators often signals potential reversal opportunities.\nThe moving average structure presents a mixed outlook for ETHFI technical analysis. While Ether.Fi trades below the 7-day SMA at $1.21 and 12-day EMA at $1.18, it maintains support above the 20-day SMA at $1.13. Most significantly, the ETHFI price remains well above the 200-day SMA at $0.96, confirming the longer-term bullish trend remains intact.\nEther.Fi's Bollinger Bands show the price trading near the middle band at $1.13, with a %B position of 0.5236. This positioning suggests balanced momentum, though the recent volatility has expanded the bands to create a wider trading range between $0.91 and $1.35.\nEther.Fi Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical Ether.Fi support levels are emerging at $1.12, which coincides with the recent 24-hour low and represents immediate downside protection. Below this level, ETHFI faces stronger support at $0.90, followed by the robust support zone at $0.89. These levels align with previous consolidation areas and represent potential accumulation zones for value-seeking traders.\nOn the upside, ETHFI resistance appears at $1.39, which corresponds to recent rejection levels where selling pressure intensified. A decisive break above this level could target the stronger resistance at $1.41, representing a significant technical barrier that has contained previous rallies. The daily ATR of $0.12 suggests that moves of this magnitude are well within Ether.Fi's normal volatility range.\nThe ETHFI/USDT trading pair shows particular sensitivity around the $1.17 pivot point, which has acted as both support and resistance during recent sessions. This level represents a critical inflection point where market sentiment shifts between bullish and bearish bias.\nShould You Buy ETHFI Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nBased on Binance spot market data, the current ETHFI price of $1.14 presents a complex risk-reward scenario that varies significantly by trading style and timeframe. For swing traders, the proximity to key support levels combined with the Foundation's buyback program creates a potentially attractive entry point, especially if ETHFI can hold above $1.12.\nShort-term traders should focus on the ETHFI resistance at $1.39 as a primary target, representing approximately 22% upside potential from current levels. However, risk management becomes crucial given the recent volatility, with stops recommended below $1.12 to limit downside exposure to the $0.90 support zone.\nLong-term investors may find the current ETHFI price attractive considering the distance from the 52-week high of $2.82, though the recent selling pressure suggests patience may be required for meaningful appreciation. The Foundation's buyback program provides fundamental support that could limit severe downside moves while building a base for future growth.\nDay traders should monitor the $1.17 pivot level closely, as breaks above or below this level often trigger momentum moves toward the respective resistance or support zones. The neutral ETHFI RSI provides room for movement in either direction, making breakout strategies potentially profitable.\nConclusion\nThe ETHFI price faces a critical juncture at $1.14, where technical indicators suggest a period of consolidation before the next directional move. Despite the Foundation's buyback program providing fundamental support, recent selling pressure indicates that market dynamics continue to influence short-term price action. Traders should monitor the $1.12 support level closely over the next 24-48 hours, as a break below could accelerate moves toward $0.90, while a bounce could target the $1.39 resistance zone. The neutral RSI and positive MACD histogram suggest that Ether.Fi technical analysis favors patience over aggressive positioning until clearer directional signals emerge.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:54:26 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "Blockchain.News", "title": "JasmyCoin (JASMY) Consolidates at $0.02 Following Rally as Technical Signals Turn Mixed", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-jasmycoin-jasmy-consolidates-at-002-following-rally-as-technical-signals", "text": "Quick Take\n\u2022 JASMY currently trading at $0.02 (-5.66% in 24h) \u2022 JasmyCoin RSI sits in neutral territory at 47.63, indicating consolidation phase \u2022 Panasonic and Chainlink partnerships drove 12.7% surge earlier this week\nWhat's Driving JasmyCoin Price Today?\nThe JASMY price is experiencing a natural pullback after last week's impressive rally, which was primarily fueled by strategic partnership announcements with Panasonic and Chainlink on August 13th. This development enhanced JasmyCoin's adoption prospects in Asia and triggered a 12.7% price surge that pushed JASMY above key resistance levels.\nThe partnership with Panasonic represents a significant milestone for JasmyCoin's Internet of Things (IoT) data ecosystem, while the Chainlink integration expands its technical capabilities. However, the current -5.66% daily decline suggests profit-taking activity following the recent gains, which is typical after such substantial moves.\nTechnical analysis from August 13th showed JasmyCoin forming a bullish engulfing pattern near $0.01837, accompanied by a volume spike to $42 million. This pattern indicated strong buying pressure from institutional investors, particularly whale accumulation that was reported on August 12th when JASMY price recovered above $0.016.\nDespite these positive fundamentals, today's price action reflects natural market dynamics as traders lock in profits from the recent rally.\nJASMY Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nJasmyCoin technical analysis reveals a complex picture with both bullish and bearish elements competing for dominance. The most significant indicator is JasmyCoin's RSI at 47.63, placing it firmly in neutral territory and suggesting the recent rally has cooled without entering oversold conditions.\nThe JASMY MACD shows bearish momentum with a histogram reading of -0.0001, indicating that short-term momentum has shifted negative despite the longer-term uptrend remaining intact. This divergence suggests the recent surge may need more time to consolidate before the next directional move.\nJasmyCoin's Bollinger Bands position shows the %B at 0.4706, meaning JASMY price is trading below the middle band but well above the lower boundary. This positioning typically indicates a pullback within an established uptrend rather than a full reversal.\nThe Stochastic oscillator presents mixed signals with %K at 32.94 and %D at 41.52, both approaching oversold territory but not yet reaching extreme levels. This suggests JasmyCoin may find support soon if selling pressure doesn't accelerate.\nJasmyCoin Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, JasmyCoin support levels are clearly defined with immediate support at $0.01 and strong support at the same level, indicating a critical zone for JASMY bulls to defend. A break below this level could signal a deeper correction toward the 52-week low of $0.01.\nOn the upside, JASMY resistance appears at $0.02, which represents both immediate and strong resistance. This level has proven significant in recent trading and aligns with previous consolidation zones. A decisive break above $0.02 could target the next major resistance around $0.025.\nThe JASMY/USDT pair shows tight consolidation between these levels, with the current price action suggesting a period of accumulation rather than distribution. The relatively narrow trading range indicates reduced volatility as measured by the Daily ATR, which may precede the next significant move.\nTraders should monitor volume closely, as the recent $4.7 million in 24-hour volume on Binance spot represents a significant decrease from the $42 million spike during the partnership announcement.\nShould You Buy JASMY Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor swing traders, the current JASMY price offers an interesting risk-reward setup. The recent pullback has brought JasmyCoin back to more reasonable levels after the partnership-driven surge, while fundamental catalysts remain supportive. A position with stop-loss below $0.015 and targets near $0.025 offers approximately 1:2 risk-reward ratio.\nDay traders should exercise caution as JASMY RSI in neutral territory and mixed momentum indicators suggest continued consolidation. The lack of clear directional bias makes scalping strategies more challenging, though breakouts above $0.021 or below $0.019 could provide short-term opportunities.\nLong-term investors may view current levels as attractive given the recent partnership developments with Panasonic and Chainlink. These collaborations could drive sustained adoption in the IoT sector, potentially supporting higher valuations over time. However, risk management remains crucial with the broader crypto market showing mixed signals.\nThe key risk factor is a break below the $0.01 support level, which could trigger accelerated selling and test the 52-week low. Conversely, sustained volume above 24-hour averages could signal renewed institutional interest.\nConclusion\nJasmyCoin's current consolidation at $0.02 appears healthy following last week's partnership-driven rally. While JASMY price faces near-term headwinds from profit-taking, the fundamental outlook remains constructive with Panasonic and Chainlink collaborations enhancing long-term prospects. Traders should monitor the $0.01-$0.02 range for the next directional catalyst, with volume expansion likely to determine whether JASMY breaks higher or requires deeper consolidation. The neutral RSI provides flexibility for moves in either direction, making risk management essential for all trading strategies.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:31:12 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "Blockchain.News", "title": "FTX Token (FTT) Faces Bearish Pressure at $0.91 as Technical Indicators Flash Mixed Signals", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-ftx-token-ftt-faces-bearish-pressure-at-091-as-technical", "text": "Quick Take\n\u2022 FTT currently trading at $0.91 (-3.64% in 24h) \u2022 FTX Token RSI sits in neutral zone at 47.38, suggesting indecision \u2022 No significant news catalysts driving current price action\nWhat's Driving FTX Token Price Today?\nThe FTT price decline appears driven primarily by technical factors rather than fundamental news, as no significant developments have emerged in the past week. The token's 3.64% drop reflects broader market uncertainty and profit-taking near resistance levels that have proven difficult to break.\nFTX Token's trading volume on Binance spot reached $1.158 million over the past 24 hours, indicating moderate interest from traders. The absence of major news catalysts suggests that current price movements are largely technical in nature, with traders focusing on chart patterns and indicator signals rather than fundamental developments.\nFTT Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nThe FTX Token technical analysis reveals a complex picture with conflicting signals across different timeframes. FTX Token's RSI at 47.38 sits firmly in neutral territory, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This neutral FTT RSI reading suggests that momentum could shift in either direction depending on volume and broader market sentiment.\nThe MACD indicator presents a more bearish outlook for FTT, with the histogram showing -0.0020, indicating weakening bullish momentum. FTX Token's MACD line at 0.0005 remains above its signal line at 0.0025, but the narrowing gap suggests potential for a bearish crossover.\nFTX Token's position within the Bollinger Bands shows interesting dynamics, with the current price sitting at 36.42% of the band width (%B = 0.3642). This positioning below the middle band at $0.92 indicates slight bearish bias in the short term.\nThe moving average structure presents a mixed picture for FTX Token. While the price trades near the SMA 50 at $0.91, it remains below both the 7-day and 20-day simple moving averages at $0.93 and $0.92 respectively. Most concerning is FTX Token's significant distance below the 200-day SMA at $1.16, highlighting the longer-term bearish trend.\nFTX Token Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical FTX Token support levels are emerging as key battlegrounds for traders. The immediate FTT support sits at $0.86, representing a crucial level that has previously provided buying interest. Below this, FTX Token strong support at $0.76 aligns closely with the 52-week low of $0.72, suggesting this area could attract significant buying if reached.\nOn the resistance side, FTT faces immediate challenges at $1.07, which has proven difficult to break in recent trading sessions. The more significant FTT resistance level at $1.30 represents a major psychological barrier that would need substantial volume and positive catalysts to overcome.\nThe current pivot point at $0.92 serves as a critical decision level for FTX Token. A sustained break above this level could signal renewed bullish momentum, while failure to reclaim it may lead to further downside pressure toward the $0.86 support zone.\nFTX Token's Average True Range (ATR) of $0.06 indicates moderate volatility, providing traders with measurable risk parameters for position sizing and stop-loss placement.\nShould You Buy FTT Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nBased on Binance spot market data, FTX Token presents different opportunities depending on trading style and risk tolerance. Short-term traders might consider waiting for a clearer directional bias, as the neutral FTT RSI and mixed technical signals suggest consolidation may continue.\nFor swing traders, the current FTT price near the pivot point at $0.92 offers a defined risk-reward setup. A long position could target the immediate resistance at $1.07, representing approximately 17% upside potential, while using the $0.86 support as a stop-loss level limits downside risk to roughly 5%.\nConservative investors may prefer waiting for a break above the $1.07 resistance level before considering entry, as this would confirm renewed bullish momentum for FTX Token. Alternatively, accumulation near the strong support at $0.76 could offer attractive risk-adjusted returns for patient investors.\nThe FTT/USDT trading pair's 24-hour range between $0.96 and $0.89 provides active traders with clear boundaries for short-term strategies, though the relatively narrow range suggests limited volatility opportunities.\nConclusion\nFTX Token faces a critical juncture at current levels, with the FTT price testing key technical support near the $0.92 pivot point. The combination of neutral RSI readings and bearish MACD momentum suggests traders should exercise caution and wait for clearer directional signals. Over the next 24-48 hours, watch for either a decisive break below $0.86 support, which could accelerate selling toward $0.76, or a reclaim of the $0.96 high, which might signal renewed buying interest toward the $1.07 resistance level.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:25:07 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "coingeek.com", "title": "Traditional finance pushes back on crypto-financial products", "url": "https://coingeek.com/traditional-finance-pushes-back-on-crypto-financial-products/", "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nIn recent months, there\u2019s been a flood of good news for the blockchain, cryptocurrency, and digital asset industries. New laws supporting industry growth have been signed into effect, and government agencies are trying to provide clear rules and guidelines so companies can innovate without wondering if they\u2019ll be prosecuted for it. Beyond the changes that have already taken place, even more pending legislation is making its way through the White House that could further accelerate growth.\nBut almost all of this news comes from inside the industry or its loudest supporters. What we haven\u2019t been hearing much of, even though it\u2019s out there, are the voices pushing back against digital currency and digital currency-financial products. However, this may be beginning to change.\nTraditional finance pushes back\nCitadel Securities, the hedge fund founded by Ken Griffin, recently sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) Crypto Task Force weighing in on tokenized equity securities. In that letter, Citadel went against the grain and said tokenized securities should be treated exactly like traditional stocks from a regulatory standpoint. In other words, they should be treated as securities and required to register with the SEC.\nWhat is a tokenized security?\nA tokenized stock is a digital representation of a traditional equity. Instead of buying Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) or Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares outright, you buy a digital currency token that mirrors the stock\u2019s price. That token rises and falls in lockstep with the real thing. Sometimes it\u2019s backed 1:1 by actual shares held in reserve by a custodian, which is usually the brokerage offering the service.\nWhen you buy a tokenized stock, you\u2019re purchasing a synthetic version of the stock, not the stock itself. That means no shareholder voting rights and none of the full regulatory protections that come with direct ownership; instead, you get a blockchain-issued \u201cdigital twin\u201d of a share.\nIn its letter, Citadel argued that tokenized securities are \u201clook-a-like\u201d products being marketed as alternatives to listed equities, and therefore should follow the same rules. That means brokers offering them should register as securities brokers, and the products should be regulated as securities.\nAre tokenized securities legal?\nTokenized securities aren\u2019t illegal in the U.S. or overseas, but they do have to comply with certain rules. In the U.S., that means existing securities laws still apply. Overseas, the rules are often looser, which makes launching these products easier. This may be one of the reasons why Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD) launched tokenized securities in European markets.\nBut due to the newfound attention and support the digital currency industry is receiving from the United States government, the SEC\u2019s Crypto Task Force is actively debating whether the current rules should stay as they are or be revised to make on-chain trading of tokenized securities possible without requiring their offerers to register with the SEC.Citadel\u2019s position is that the SEC should scrutinize tokenized securities thoroughly before making any changes to existing laws. Their main argument is that the U.S. already has a well-tested system for regulating stocks; therefore, letting tokenized stock brokers circumvent those rules could harm investors and markets. They\u2019re particularly concerned about the impact on liquidity, IPO incentives, company transparency, shareholder engagement, and broader market stability.\nTo be fair, Citadel\u2019s concerns are warranted, especially in an era when the U.S. government is largely pro-crypto. The prevailing narrative tends to be that digital currency needs fewer regulations and could go further, faster if \u201coutdated\u201d rules got out of the way. However, as Citadel points out, nothing has really proven that the current laws should be bent for these blockchain-based offerings, especially since the financial products being offered are not something the world has ever seen before that warrants new rules.\nTo put it another way, tokenized stocks run the same software as publicly traded equities, but on a different operating system, blockchain, instead of U.S. stock exchanges. Citadel warns that what we see happening in the cryptocurrency industry might be \u201cregulatory arbitrage\u2014gaming the system\u2014not true innovation.\u201d\nWill Wall Street compete with digital currency?\nAs more digital currency-financial products come to market and government agencies respond with new guidelines or amendments, we will most likely see more traditional finance institutions pushing back, or at the very least, voicing their concerns similar to how Citadel has done with the SEC\u2019s Crypto Task Force. If the products are similar enough, as they are with tokenized stocks and publicly traded equities, traditional finance will compete head-to-head with crypto incumbents for market share.\nWhen that\u2019s the case, we can assume that one of two things will happen: either the traditional financial institutions will fight to slow digital currency\u2019s momentum, or, if they can\u2019t beat them, they\u2019ll join them and enter the arena with their own digital currency-financial products as some traditional finance incumbents are already beginning to do.\nWatch: Improving logistics, finance with AI & blockchain", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:00:00 +0000", "author": "Patrick Thompson", "source": "https://coingeek.com/feed/", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "Blockchain.News", "title": "LayerZero (ZRO) Tests $2.06 Support as RSI Shows Neutral Zone Trading", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-layerzero-zro-tests-206-support-as-rsi-shows-neutral-zone", "text": "Quick Take\n\u2022 ZRO currently trading at $2.06 (-5.15% in 24h) \u2022 LayerZero's RSI remains neutral at 51.32 while MACD histogram shows bullish divergence \u2022 No major news catalysts in past week, price action driven by technical factors\nWhat's Driving LayerZero Price Today?\nThe ZRO price movement appears primarily technical in nature, with no significant news events or catalysts emerging in the past seven days. This absence of fundamental drivers has left LayerZero vulnerable to broader market sentiment and technical trading patterns.\nThe current 5.15% decline brings ZRO price closer to its immediate support zone, testing trader confidence in the absence of positive catalysts. The trading range of $2.01 to $2.21 over the past 24 hours demonstrates the ongoing consolidation phase that LayerZero has entered.\nVolume data from Binance spot market shows $5.03 million in 24-hour trading activity, indicating moderate interest despite the price decline. This volume level suggests that while selling pressure exists, it hasn't reached panic levels that might signal a more severe correction.\nZRO Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals as Momentum Builds\nLayerZero technical analysis reveals a complex picture with both bullish and bearish elements competing for control. The most encouraging signal comes from ZRO's MACD configuration, where the histogram reading of 0.0143 indicates building bullish momentum despite the recent price decline.\nZRO RSI currently sits at 51.32, placing LayerZero firmly in neutral territory. This positioning suggests that neither buying nor selling pressure has reached extreme levels, leaving room for movement in either direction based on market developments.\nThe moving average structure presents mixed signals for ZRO price action. While LayerZero trades above its 20-period SMA at $1.97 and 50-period SMA at $2.00, it remains below the 7-period SMA at $2.16, indicating short-term weakness within a longer-term consolidation pattern.\nLayerZero's Bollinger Bands show ZRO price positioned at 60.61% of the band width, sitting closer to the upper band at $2.40 than the lower band at $1.54. This positioning suggests that despite recent declines, ZRO maintains relative strength within its recent trading range.\nThe Average True Range (ATR) of $0.17 provides insight into ZRO's current volatility levels, offering traders a gauge for position sizing and stop-loss placement in the current market environment.\nLayerZero Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nThe current ZRO price action centers around critical technical levels that will determine near-term direction. LayerZero support levels converge around $1.64, representing both immediate and strong support according to technical analysis. This level coincides closely with the 52-week low of $1.60, making it a psychological barrier for traders.\nOn the upside, ZRO resistance appears concentrated at $2.60, where both immediate and strong resistance levels align. Breaking above this level would signal a potential shift in LayerZero's technical outlook and could attract renewed buying interest.\nThe pivot point at $2.09 sits just above the current ZRO price of $2.06, suggesting that LayerZero is testing crucial support in real-time. A decisive break below this level could accelerate selling toward the $1.64 support zone.\nTraders should note that the distance between current ZRO price and the 52-week high of $6.99 illustrates the significant upside potential that exists if LayerZero can establish a sustained bullish trend above key resistance levels.\nShould You Buy ZRO Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nBased on Binance spot market data, the current ZRO price setup offers different opportunities depending on trading style and risk tolerance. Conservative traders might wait for a clear break above $2.60 resistance before considering long positions, as this would confirm bullish momentum.\nAggressive traders could consider accumulating ZRO around current levels, using the $1.64 support as a stop-loss reference point. This approach offers a favorable risk-reward ratio, with potential upside to $2.60 representing approximately 26% gains against downside risk of roughly 20% to strong support.\nSwing traders should monitor the ZRO/USDT pair for a decisive break of the current consolidation range. The combination of neutral RSI readings and building MACD momentum suggests that a significant move may be approaching, though direction remains uncertain.\nDay traders can utilize the established trading range, buying near $2.01 support and selling near $2.21 resistance, while maintaining tight risk management given the current volatility profile.\nConclusion\nZRO price faces a critical juncture at $2.06, with technical indicators providing mixed signals about near-term direction. While LayerZero's RSI remains neutral and MACD suggests building momentum, the absence of fundamental catalysts leaves price action dependent on technical factors. Traders should watch for a break above $2.60 resistance or below $1.64 support to signal the next significant move in the ZRO/USDT pair over the next 24-48 hours.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:42:34 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "Blockchain.News", "title": "DYDX Price Retreats 6.3% as Mixed Technical Signals Create Trading Uncertainty", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-dydx-price-retreats-63-as-mixed-technical-signals-create-trading", "text": "Quick Take\n\u2022 DYDX currently trading at $0.64 (-6.30% in 24h) \u2022 Mixed technical signals with DYDX RSI at neutral 50.77 while MACD shows bullish momentum \u2022 No significant news events in past week creating technical-driven price action\nWhat's Driving Dydx Price Today?\nThe DYDX price decline of 6.30% appears to be driven purely by technical factors, as no significant news events have emerged in the past seven days to influence sentiment. This absence of fundamental catalysts has left the Dydx token vulnerable to broader market movements and technical trading patterns.\nThe current price action reflects typical cryptocurrency volatility, with DYDX trading within its established range but showing some weakness as it approaches key technical levels. Without fresh news or developments from the dYdX protocol, traders are focusing entirely on chart patterns and technical indicators to guide their decisions.\nThe lack of recent announcements, partnerships, or protocol updates has created a vacuum where technical analysis becomes the primary driver of short-term price movements for DYDX.\nDYDX Technical Analysis: Conflicting Signals Create Trading Dilemma\nThe current Dydx technical analysis reveals a complex picture with mixed signals across different timeframes. DYDX's RSI sits at 50.77, placing it firmly in neutral territory and suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This neutral reading provides little directional bias for immediate price movement.\nHowever, DYDX's MACD indicator tells a different story, showing bullish momentum with the MACD line at 0.0173 above the signal line at 0.0158. The positive MACD histogram of 0.0015 reinforces this bullish momentum reading, suggesting underlying strength despite today's price decline.\nThe moving average structure presents another layer of complexity. DYDX trades above its 50-day SMA ($0.61) and 200-day SMA ($0.63), which traditionally indicates a bullish longer-term trend. However, the price currently sits below the 7-day SMA ($0.67), showing short-term weakness.\nDydx's position within the Bollinger Bands offers additional insight, with the token trading at 57.46% of the band width, slightly above the middle band but well below the upper resistance at $0.73.\nDydx Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical Dydx support levels emerge at $0.52 for immediate support, with stronger support establishing around $0.49. These levels represent significant downside risk areas where buyers may step in to defend the DYDX price.\nOn the upside, DYDX resistance appears formidable at $0.76, which serves as both immediate and strong resistance based on Binance spot market data. This level represents a 19% upside potential from current prices but will require significant volume and momentum to break.\nThe current trading range between $0.63 and $0.69 over the past 24 hours provides short-term boundaries for DYDX/USDT traders. Breaking below $0.63 could trigger further selling toward the $0.52 support zone, while reclaiming $0.69 might signal a recovery attempt toward the $0.76 resistance.\nThe daily ATR of $0.05 indicates moderate volatility, suggesting DYDX could experience significant price swings within these established ranges.\nShould You Buy DYDX Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor aggressive traders, the current DYDX price presents a potential opportunity if the bullish MACD momentum can overcome the near-term weakness. The risk-reward setup offers approximately 19% upside to resistance versus 23% downside to strong support levels.\nConservative investors might wait for clearer directional signals, particularly a decisive break above the 7-day moving average at $0.67 or below the immediate support at $0.52. The neutral RSI reading suggests DYDX could move in either direction without being constrained by overbought or oversold conditions.\nDay traders should focus on the $0.63-$0.69 range, looking for breakout opportunities with appropriate stop-loss levels. The absence of recent news means technical levels are likely to hold more significance in the near term.\nRisk management remains crucial given the conflicting technical signals, with position sizing reflecting the uncertainty in current market conditions.\nConclusion\nDYDX price faces a critical juncture with mixed technical signals creating uncertainty for the next 24-48 hours. While the MACD suggests underlying bullish momentum, the recent 6.3% decline and position below short-term moving averages indicate immediate weakness. Traders should monitor the $0.63 support level closely, as a break below could accelerate selling toward $0.52, while recovery above $0.67 might signal renewed bullish interest toward the $0.76 resistance zone.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:48:26 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "Blockchain.News", "title": "PancakeSwap (CAKE) Falls 5.24% Despite $12M Token Burn and Stock Perpetuals Launch", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-pancakeswap-cake-falls-524-despite-12m-token-burn-and-stock", "text": "Quick Take\n\u2022 CAKE currently trading at $2.66 (-5.24% in 24h) \u2022 PancakeSwap's RSI at 47.39 shows neutral momentum with bearish MACD signals \u2022 Stock Perpetuals launch and $12M token burn provide fundamental support despite recent selling pressure\nWhat's Driving PancakeSwap Price Today?\nThe CAKE price is experiencing significant downward pressure today, falling 5.24% to $2.66 as traders take profits following last week's major developments. This decline appears to be a continuation of the profit-taking that began on August 12, when CAKE dropped 3.52% despite the platform's innovation push.\nThe recent selling pressure comes despite fundamentally positive news from August 13, when PancakeSwap launched Stock Perpetuals enabling leveraged trading of tokenized stocks like Apple and Tesla. Simultaneously, the platform conducted a massive token burn of 8.27 million CAKE tokens worth $12 million, which typically creates bullish price pressure by reducing circulating supply.\nHowever, the market's reaction illustrates a classic \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" pattern. While the Stock Perpetuals launch initially drove CAKE price up 4% on August 13, subsequent sessions have seen traders lock in profits, resulting in the current decline below the $2.70 pivot level.\nCAKE Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Point to Consolidation\nPancakeSwap technical analysis reveals conflicting signals as the token navigates between support and resistance levels. CAKE's RSI currently sits at 47.39, placing it in neutral territory and suggesting neither oversold nor overbought conditions. This neutral RSI reading indicates that selling pressure may be moderating.\nHowever, PancakeSwap's MACD tells a more bearish story. With the MACD line at 0.0301 sitting below the signal line at 0.0489, and a negative histogram of -0.0188, momentum indicators suggest continued bearish pressure in the near term. The Stochastic oscillator reinforces this view, with %K at 30.33 below %D at 45.34, indicating potential for further downside.\nFrom a moving average perspective, CAKE price trades below its short-term SMAs but remains above longer-term averages. The current price of $2.66 sits below both the 7-day SMA ($2.76) and 20-day SMA ($2.72), yet maintains position above the crucial 50-day SMA ($2.61) and well above the 200-day SMA ($2.25), preserving the overall bullish trend structure.\nPancakeSwap Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, PancakeSwap support levels are clearly defined with immediate support at $2.48 and strong support at $2.20. The current CAKE price of $2.66 provides a relatively thin cushion above immediate support, making this level critical for bulls to defend.\nOn the upside, CAKE resistance faces immediate hurdles at $2.97, which aligns closely with the Bollinger Bands upper level at $2.93. A break above this level could target the stronger resistance zone at $3.31, though this would require significant buying momentum given current technical conditions.\nThe Bollinger Bands positioning shows CAKE trading near the lower portion of the bands, with a %B reading of 0.3424 indicating the price sits closer to the lower band than the upper band. This positioning often precedes either a bounce from oversold conditions or a breakdown below support levels.\nShould You Buy CAKE Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor short-term traders, the current CAKE/USDT setup presents a challenging environment. The bearish MACD and position below key short-term moving averages suggest waiting for clearer bullish signals before entering long positions. Aggressive traders might consider the $2.48 support level as a potential entry point, with a tight stop-loss below $2.40.\nSwing traders should monitor the $2.61 level (50-day SMA) closely, as a decisive break below this level could signal deeper correction toward the $2.20 strong support zone. Conversely, a recovery above $2.76 (7-day SMA) would indicate the profit-taking phase may be ending.\nLong-term investors may view current weakness as an opportunity, particularly given the fundamental developments including Stock Perpetuals and the token burn. The Daily ATR of $0.16 suggests normal volatility ranges, making current levels potentially attractive for those with longer time horizons and proper risk management.\nThe key risk factors include broader crypto market sentiment and whether the current selling pressure accelerates. Conservative traders should wait for CAKE price to reclaim the $2.72 pivot level before considering positions.\nConclusion\nCAKE price faces near-term headwinds as profit-taking continues following recent positive developments. While PancakeSwap technical analysis shows mixed signals, the neutral RSI suggests selling pressure may be moderating. Traders should watch the critical $2.48 support level over the next 24-48 hours, as a break below could target deeper correction levels. However, the fundamental backdrop remains positive with Stock Perpetuals launch and token burn providing longer-term support for CAKE price recovery once current selling exhausts.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:13:28 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "Blockchain.News", "title": "ENS Price Drops 6% Despite Ethereum's Rally - Technical Analysis Shows Mixed Signals", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-ens-price-drops-6-despite-ethereums-rally-technical-analysis-shows", "text": "Quick Take\n\u2022 ENS currently trading at $25.27 (-5.99% in 24h) \u2022 Ethereum Name Service's RSI at 43.58 indicates neutral territory with potential oversold conditions developing \u2022 Recent ENS DAO technical updates and Ethereum's surge past $4,400 provide mixed market sentiment\nWhat's Driving Ethereum Name Service Price Today?\nDespite Ethereum's impressive rally past $4,400 driven by institutional investment and favorable SEC stance on ETH ETFs, the ENS price has moved in the opposite direction with a notable 5.99% decline in the past 24 hours. This divergence highlights how individual tokens can disconnect from broader market trends, especially during periods of consolidation.\nThe recent ENS DAO Newsletter released on August 12th highlighted significant technical developments including L2 reverse resolution discussions and enhanced OpenSea integration. While these developments are fundamentally positive for the Ethereum Name Service ecosystem, they appear to have had limited immediate impact on price action. The collaborative efforts with major platforms like OpenSea typically take time to translate into measurable price movements.\nThe broader Ethereum ecosystem's bullish momentum, marked by institutional investment flows, creates a favorable backdrop for ENS in the medium term. However, the current price action suggests traders are taking profits or repositioning ahead of potential technical breakouts.\nENS Technical Analysis: Bearish Momentum Emerges Despite Bullish Trend\nThe Ethereum Name Service technical analysis reveals a complex picture with mixed signals across different timeframes. ENS's RSI currently sits at 43.58, positioning the token in neutral territory but approaching oversold conditions. This RSI level often presents opportunities for contrarian traders, especially when fundamental developments remain positive.\nThe MACD configuration shows concerning momentum patterns for ENS. With the MACD line at 0.1747 and the signal line at 0.6267, the resulting histogram of -0.4520 indicates bearish momentum is building. This divergence between the overall bullish trend classification and current momentum suggests a potential consolidation phase.\nEthereum Name Service's position relative to its Bollinger Bands provides additional context. Trading at $25.27 with a %B position of 0.2018, ENS sits closer to the lower band ($24.00) than the upper band ($30.28), indicating potential oversold conditions in the short term.\nThe Stochastic oscillator reinforces this view with ENS's %K at 4.41 and %D at 16.97, both in deeply oversold territory. These extreme readings often precede short-term bounces, particularly when supported by positive fundamental developments.\nEthereum Name Service Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nThe current ENS price action is testing critical technical levels that will determine the next directional move. Immediate support for Ethereum Name Service sits at $24.04, closely aligning with the Bollinger Band lower boundary. A break below this level could trigger additional selling pressure toward the strong support zone at $17.66.\nOn the upside, ENS faces immediate resistance at $32.21, which also serves as the strong resistance level. This confluence creates a significant barrier that requires substantial volume and momentum to overcome. The 200-day moving average at $21.48 provides additional context, showing that despite recent weakness, ENS remains well above longer-term trend support.\nThe daily Average True Range (ATR) of $1.97 indicates that Ethereum Name Service typically moves within a $4 range on any given day, suggesting the current price level could see volatility in either direction. Based on Binance spot market data, the ENS/USDT pair has shown increased volume at $8.47 million, indicating active participation during this consolidation phase.\nShould You Buy ENS Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor aggressive traders, the current ENS price presents an interesting risk-reward setup. With ENS trading near the lower Bollinger Band and showing oversold Stochastic readings, a tactical bounce toward the $27-28 resistance zone offers approximately 10% upside potential. Stop-loss levels should be placed below $24.04 to limit downside risk.\nConservative investors might wait for clearer confirmation of the trend direction. A break above $27.19 (7-day SMA) with volume would signal renewed buying interest and potentially target the $32.21 resistance level. Conversely, a break below $24.04 could indicate further consolidation toward the $21-22 zone.\nSwing traders should monitor the interaction between ENS price and the 20-day moving average at $27.14. A sustained move above this level, combined with improving momentum indicators, would strengthen the bullish case for Ethereum Name Service. The proximity to the 50-day moving average at $25.28 suggests a critical inflection point is approaching.\nConclusion\nENS price faces a critical juncture as technical indicators show mixed signals despite the overall bullish trend classification. The 5.99% decline contrasts with Ethereum's strength, creating potential opportunities for discerning traders. Ethereum Name Service support levels at $24.04 will be crucial in the next 24-48 hours, while resistance at $32.21 remains the key upside target. The combination of oversold conditions and positive fundamental developments from the ENS DAO suggests patient traders may be rewarded, though immediate volatility should be expected around current levels.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:01:39 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "Blockchain.News", "title": "Filecoin (FIL) Faces Bearish Pressure Despite Grant Program Boost", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-filecoin-fil-faces-bearish-pressure-despite-grant-program-boost", "text": "Quick Take\n\u2022 FIL currently trading at $2.47 (-4.08% in 24h) \u2022 Filecoin's RSI at 47.16 signals neutral momentum with bearish MACD divergence \u2022 $3.6 million ProPGF grants awarded to 14 teams for ecosystem development\nWhat's Driving Filecoin Price Today?\nDespite positive ecosystem developments, the FIL price has retreated 4.08% in the past 24 hours, trading within a range of $2.42 to $2.63. The recent pullback appears to be profit-taking following the 4% surge on August 13, when Filecoin demonstrated strong bullish momentum alongside the broader Coindesk 20 index.\nThe announcement of Filecoin's first batch of ProPGF grants totaling $3.6818 million to 14 teams represents a significant investment in the network's infrastructure and development tools. However, this positive catalyst has yet to translate into sustained upward price action, suggesting that market participants are taking a wait-and-see approach to gauge the long-term impact of these ecosystem investments.\nEarlier market action on August 11 established crucial Filecoin support levels at $2.49, with resistance identified at $2.68. The current FIL price of $2.47 sits just below this support zone, indicating potential vulnerability to further downside pressure.\nFIL Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nThe Filecoin technical analysis reveals a complex picture with conflicting signals across different timeframes. Filecoin's RSI reading of 47.16 places the token in neutral territory, neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting balanced buying and selling pressure.\nHowever, the MACD indicator presents a more concerning picture for FIL bulls. With the MACD line at -0.0015 and the signal line also at -0.0015, the histogram shows a slight bearish divergence at -0.0001, indicating weakening momentum for Filecoin.\nThe moving average structure provides additional context for FIL price action. Filecoin's current price of $2.47 sits just below the 20-period SMA at $2.48, while trading above the immediate support provided by the 50-period SMA at $2.53 creates a conflicting technical setup. Most notably, FIL remains significantly below the 200-period SMA at $2.77, confirming the longer-term bearish trend.\nFilecoin's Bollinger Bands analysis shows the token trading at a %B position of 0.4767, indicating FIL price is positioned in the lower half of the band range but not yet approaching oversold conditions.\nFilecoin Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, several critical Filecoin support levels and resistance zones are shaping current price action. The immediate FIL resistance sits at $2.76, closely aligned with the recent high of $2.68 mentioned in market reports.\nFor FIL support, traders should monitor the $2.22 level as the immediate downside target, with stronger Filecoin support at $2.18. A break below these levels could expose FIL to a test of the 52-week low at $2.07.\nThe FIL/USDT trading pair shows a daily ATR of $0.16, indicating moderate volatility that provides opportunities for active traders while requiring careful risk management. The pivot point at $2.51 serves as a key decision level, with FIL price currently trading below this threshold.\nShould bulls regain control, the path to the stronger FIL resistance at $3.02 would first require overcoming the immediate resistance barriers and establishing support above the 20-period moving average.\nShould You Buy FIL Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor swing traders, the current FIL price action presents a challenging environment. The mixed technical signals suggest waiting for clearer directional bias before establishing significant positions. Conservative traders might consider dollar-cost averaging near the $2.22 support level while maintaining strict stop-losses below $2.18.\nDay traders can capitalize on the $0.16 daily ATR by trading the range between immediate support and resistance levels. However, the bearish MACD and position below key moving averages suggest favoring short-term bearish setups over bullish plays.\nLong-term investors should weigh the positive ecosystem developments from the ProPGF grant program against the technical deterioration. The $3.6 million investment in 14 development teams could drive future adoption, but the immediate FIL price impact remains muted.\nRisk management remains crucial given Filecoin's proximity to key support levels. Any position should incorporate the significant gap between current levels and the 52-week high of $6.75, highlighting the substantial upside potential if fundamental catalysts align with improved technical conditions.\nConclusion\nFilecoin faces a critical juncture as ecosystem investments clash with bearish technical momentum. While the FIL price of $2.47 reflects recent weakness, the established support at $2.22-$2.18 offers potential stabilization. Traders should monitor whether Filecoin can reclaim the $2.51 pivot point in the next 24-48 hours, as this level could determine whether FIL continues its descent or stages a recovery toward the $2.76 resistance zone.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:55:37 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "cryptodaily.co.uk", "title": "Shiba Inu Holders Chase AI Presale Gains\u2014$500 Could Become $280,000 if $2.80 Prediction Plays Out", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/shiba-inu-holders-chase-ai-presale-gains-500-could-become-280000-if-280-prediction-plays-out", "text": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders are directing attention toward an emerging AI-based cryptocurrency presale, with projections indicating substantial potential returns. According to market predictions, a $500 allocation in the Ozak AI token\u2019s current presale phase could yield $280,000 if the price reaches $2.80 in the future. This level of potential return has sparked notable engagement from a community accustomed to speculative, high-reward opportunities.\nThe presale has already been carried out in several stages; Phase 4 is the one that is happening now at the token price of $0.005. It has seen more than 150 million tokens bought, increasing total funds to $1.95 million. These are indicators of a rising interest in retail involvement by strategic investors, many of whom are looking to diversify beyond simply hype-based digital assets.\nUtility and Market Timing\nUnlike other cryptocurrencies that underpin meme-based tokens, the Ozak AI token presents a set of intended real-world applications. These applications focus on things like the introduction of artificial intelligence into blockchain-based solutions, and the target industry has recently been attracting higher interest in the digital asset sector. The roadmap of the project includes the description of utility functions with the aim to provide practical value, which might allow the project to attract and sustain long-term interest in the market beyond speculative trading.\nThe presale has also been timed to take place in the context of a wider trend in the cryptocurrency industry, emphasizing tangible use cases. According to industry data, investors are getting keener with regard to their investment preferences, with a propensity to prefer assets that have an element of innovative technology accompanied by the evident implementation strategies. This tendency can be one of the factors of increased demand witnessed in the initial rounds of token funding.\nPrice Projections and Investor Considerations\nA potential price tracking target has also been estimated by analysts to be as high as $2.80 for the token, which, in case it occurs, would be a very good surge as compared to the presale valuation. Although these projections are speculative and prone to spikes due to market instability, SHIB holders have developed an interest in its upside potential since this sector also offers high growth opportunities.\nIt is recommended that potential investors consider opportunities and overall risks. The cryptocurrency market is associated with price volatility, and presale investments are usually associated with a greater amount of uncertainty because of the incompleteness of the project development. Market adoption, technology deployment, and competitive positioning will be contributing factors as to whether the projected price levels will be attained.\nParticipation in the Ozak AI presale and funding progression milestones will be used to gauge the level of market confidence as it goes on. Whether the AI-driven token will realize its price potential will depend on its ability to deliver on its high price target and the technological promises that it makes, as well as its continuing financial interest to investors in a now more volatile world of digital assets.\nFor more details, visit:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Some are building momentum quietly, others are already in motion.\nOzak AI is already turning heads with its presale, pulling in over $1.8 million. The rest of the list has its own catalysts, from big partnerships to network upgrades.\nOzak AI and the $0.005 Ethereum AI Project\nThe Ethereum AI project Ozak AI is making waves before it even lists. Sitting at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence, it\u2019s not just chasing trends. The fourth presale stage is already underway, selling over 129 million tokens and pulling in more than $1.8 million at $0.005 each.\nBuilt on a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network, Ozak AI offers real-time, secure and fail-free data processing. Smart contracts control every transaction, and everything stays unmodified on the blockchain. The token has been listed on Coingecko and CoinMarketCap, with media attention from CryptoDaily, Cryptopolitan and Cointelegraph adding more weight to its credibility.\nLayerZero and ZRO Token Momentum\nThe LayerZero crypto project is giving serious signs of movement. It\u2019s an interoperability protocol connecting blockchains in a way that avoids clunky and risky bridging systems. Its goal? Let DApps talk to each other across networks without friction.\nThe buzz got louder when the LayerZero Foundation announced a $110 million deal to acquire the Stargate protocol. In the 24 hours after the news, ZRO jumped 27 percent and kept rising to 31% for the week. That kind of volume shift doesn\u2019t happen without serious attention from big players.\nAptos Building for a Quiet Comeback\nAPT hasn\u2019t exactly been the life of the party lately, dropping 1.3% in the last month, which mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s calm. But beneath the surface, the Aptos ecosystem is anything but still.\nIts layer 1 blockchain uses the Move programming language for safer, more predictable smart contracts. Developers claim the network can process up to 100,000 transactions per second thanks to a pipelined, modular system. If sentiment flips, APT could be right in the middle of the action.\nXRP Still Holding the Bridge\nXRP remains one of the most recognized names in the payment side of crypto. Acting as a bridge between currencies, it offers fast cross-border transfers at minimal cost.\nHitting $3.18 on August 12 marks a jaw-dropping 54,076% rise since 2013. Political backing for the crypto sector and any moves from the Federal Reserve on interest rates could give XRP a stronger push this month.\nPolkadot\u2019s Quiet but Strong Upgrades\nDOT regained the $4 mark in mid-July, rising 14.97% in just a week. Volume spiked 28% to $434 million, which shows the market isn\u2019t ignoring it.\nThe introduction of Elastic Scaling v1.6.1 now allows parachains to adjust resources for faster transactions. Add the JAM protocol\u2019s cross-chain compatibility and growing staking numbers \u2014 12 million DOT locked \u2014 and Polkadot\u2019s developer activity looks alive and well.\nConclusion\nAugust isn\u2019t short on crypto contenders, but this group has a mix of momentum, technical strength and real-world traction. From Ozak AI\u2019s presale surge to Polkadot\u2019s behind-the-scenes upgrades, the table is set for interesting moves in the weeks ahead. Sometimes it\u2019s not about chasing the loudest name, it\u2019s about spotting the ones quietly getting stronger.\nFor More Information about Ozak AI, visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The intersection of meme culture and real blockchain technology is propelling $LBRETT into the spotlight as analysts predict the next big crypto bull run could see it outperform established favorites.\nWhile Shiba Inu remains a powerhouse in the meme coin space, experts are projecting that $LBRETT\u2019s potential growth in 2025 could be many times greater than what Shiba Inu price prediction expects it to achieve, and even XRP.\nWhy investors are flocking to $LBRETT: Layer 2 meets meme energy\n$LBRETT, no ordinary meme coin, offers hype and genuine technical value, what many call the best of both worlds. Its presale is currently gaining momentum, fueled primarily by its extremely high staking rewards\u2014early participants accessed up to 30,000% APY, though this rate falls as more users stake.\nThis urgency has made $LBRETT one of the most talked-about presale coins and a top future gainer crypto in 2025 projections. As a presale altcoin, $LBRETT offers greater upside than XRP or SHIB, positioning itself as the next 100x meme coin in the eyes of savvy investors.\nShiba Inu price prediction: Where SHIB stands in the meme coin race\nSHIB remains one of the leading meme coins, and its massive community is a major driver behind its meteoric rise. It is taking advantage of the altcoin and meme season, set to jump in value in the coming months. SHIB EMA is trending upwards, while the MACD shows strong bullish momentum. The RSI is holding above 60, signaling continued buying interest.\nAnalysts are predicting a possible price target of $0.000022 by late August 2025 if the current uptrend continues, giving around 19% profit.\nXRP price outlook: Classic altcoin with new momentum\nXRP has also captured significant attention in the 2025 crypto bull run. It runs almost the same technicals, with MACD signaling an upward crossover, and RSI indicating overbought but sustained momentum. Price predictions suggest XRP could test $4 (~20%+) if bullish momentum holds, making it one of the best long-term crypto choices for risk-tolerant investors.\nWhy Layer Brett is stealing the spotlight in 2025\nThe hype around $LBRETT is justified by its rare combination of meme power and true blockchain utility, showing strong potential to grow exponentially by 50x to 100x. This is why its presale is drawing major attention, with many traders actively moving from XRP and SHIB for its unmatched utility.\nBuilt on Layer 2 Ethereum, LayerBrett offers fast, low-cost transactions and real utility\u2014unlike typical meme coins. Early stakers were privy to 25,000% APY. While it is around 8,000% as it falls regularly, it is still more than what other projects offer. This fully decentralized project requires no KYC, giving you full control. Early presale participants can also enter a massive $1 million giveaway.\nWith a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens and groundbreaking features like NFT integration and upcoming cross-chain bridges, Layer Brett is redefining what it means to be a top meme coin and DeFi project.\nXRP and SHIB to rise, $LBRETT to soar\nLayer Brett is still in its presale\u2014but not for long. Early investors can secure the best crypto presale price, stake for massive APY, and join a project that is set to be a top altcoin and next 100x meme coin. Urgency is high as staking rates drop with each new participant, so those seeking the best crypto to invest in for 2025 should act now.\nLayer Brett is still in its presale stage\u2014but not for long.\nWebsite: https://layerbrett.com\nTelegram: https://t.me/layerbrett", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:00:34 +0000", "author": "Maisie Morrison", "source": "https://coincentral.com/news/feed/", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "cryptodaily.co.uk", "title": "Husky Inu (HINU) Rises To $0.00019805 As Memecoin Ecosystem Faces Qubic Threat", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/husky-inu-hinu-rises-to-000019805-as-memecoin-ecosystem-faces-qubic-threat", "text": "Husky Inu (HINU) registered the latest price jump of its pre-launch phase over the weekend, rising from $0.00019748 to $0.00019805.

The project\u2019s regular price increases are part of its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1.\nMeanwhile, the larger memecoin ecosystem faces a threat from the Qubic community, which voted to target Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest and most popular memecoin, after a 51% attack on Monero.\nHusky Inu (HINU) Rises To $0.00019805\nHusky Inu (HINU) registered the latest price jump of its pre-launch phase over the weekend, rising from $0.00019748 to $0.00018905. The project\u2019s pre-launch phase began on April 1 and aims to empower the Husky Inu community and continue its fundraising efforts as its launch date draws closer. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project\u2019s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion.\nThe project adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, allowing it to raise the HINU token\u2019s value every two days.

The company\u2019s Q2 2025 revenue climbed 122% quarter-over-quarter to $155.6 million, driven by self-mining and hardware sales. However, losses deepened to $147.7 million, weighed by operating expenses and non-cash fair value changes.\nRevenue Grows as Self-Mining and SEALMINER Sales Accelerate\nBitdeer\u2019s quarterly revenue grew to $155.6 million from $99.2 million year-over-year, a rise of 56.8%. Sequentially, revenue jumped 121.9% as self-mining hashrates and hardware sales surged. The company booked $69.5 million from external sales of its SEALMINER A2 units.\nSelf-mining revenue increased to $59.3 million from $41.6 million, driven by a 103.3% increase in average hashrate. Membership and general hosting revenues declined due to contract expirations and reduced mining economics following the April 2024 halving.

The company continues investing heavily in chip development and infrastructure.\nOperating expenses totaled $42.3 million, led by a 156% surge in R&D to $20.6 million due to SEALMINER A4 development. General and administrative costs grew to $20.1 million, while selling expenses decreased to $1.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA dropped to $17.3 million, reflecting reduced profitability and higher investments.\nBitdeer posted an adjusted loss of $24.4 million versus a profit of $3.2 million in Q2 2024. Other net losses reached $108.5 million, mainly due to non-cash losses on convertible notes and warrant liabilities. Despite revenue strength, higher costs and fair value changes weighed heavily on results.\nStrategic Expansion and Liquidity Position Maintain Growth Outlook\nBitdeer reported $299.8 million in cash and $169.3 million in cryptocurrency holdings as of June 30, 2025. Inventories increased to $208.8 million, primarily from SEALMINER wafers and finished products. Prepayments and other assets reached $465.2 million, up due to supplier payments for chip production.\nThe company\u2019s borrowing stood at $533.1 million, reflecting aggressive growth financing including convertible notes and related-party loans. Capital expenditures reached $106.5 million, with most spent on datacenter infrastructure expansion.

However, in 2025, a shift is taking place. Veteran traders, often the earliest to spot changing market winds, are now moving part of their portfolios into Coldware (COLD)\u2014a SocialFi and Web3 hardware project that some analysts believe could deliver an 11,000% surge from its presale entry levels. While Binance Coin (BNB) still holds weight in large-cap portfolios, its pace of growth has slowed compared to emerging tokens like Coldware (COLD).\nColdware (COLD) \u2013 The New High-Growth Contender\nColdware (COLD) blends blockchain with consumer tech in a way few projects have attempted. Each Coldware device ships with a native blockchain layer, enabling tokenized social engagement, creator monetization, and decentralized governance without third-party intermediaries. The hardware acts as an instant onboarding mechanism, meaning new users don\u2019t have to navigate complex wallet setups to start earning and interacting. With its early-stage market cap and direct user acquisition pipeline, Coldware offers a far higher growth multiple potential than Binance Coin (BNB).\nWhy Binance Coin (BNB) Is Losing Momentum\nBNB\u2019s maturity is both its strength and weakness. As one of the largest utility tokens in the market, it has deep liquidity, widespread adoption, and strong fundamentals. But this maturity means it is less likely to see exponential percentage gains. Exchange volumes have been uneven in 2025, and regulatory pressures in key markets have dampened speculative activity. For traders who once relied on BNB for triple-digit returns, the current environment is prompting a search for high-upside alternatives\u2014enter Coldware (COLD).\nThe Veteran Trader\u2019s Perspective\nVeteran traders know that outsized returns come from entering strong narratives early. For many, Binance Coin (BNB) has shifted into a \u201ccapital preservation\u201d role, while Coldware (COLD) represents a fresh, aggressive growth opportunity. The 11,000% surge projection comes from a combination of low initial supply, hardware-linked token demand, and a monetization model that rewards both early adopters and active users. This asymmetric upside is the kind of setup seasoned investors look for in a bull cycle.\nWhy The Shift Matters for Portfolio Strategy\nIn crypto, timing is everything. Traders who diversified away from mature assets like Binance Coin (BNB) in previous cycles often outperformed by catching early-stage momentum plays. Coldware (COLD) offers that rare combination of a compelling narrative, tangible adoption drivers, and tokenomics designed to reward long-term holding. The market is increasingly valuing projects that can capture users directly, without relying solely on developer adoption or exchange volume.\nConclusion\nBinance Coin (BNB) remains a pillar of the exchange-token sector, but for traders seeking explosive upside, Coldware (COLD) is stealing the show. With a projected 11,000% potential gain, hardware-integrated onboarding, and a SocialFi-driven economy, Coldware is emerging as the go-to high-growth play for 2025. OKB and Chainlink (LINK) provide additional diversification, but in the eyes of veteran traders, the real action\u2014and the real opportunity\u2014is with Coldware.\nFor more information on the Coldware (COLD) Presale:\nVisit Coldware (COLD)\nJoin and become a community member:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

This marks a significant milestone as the firm becomes the first Chinese bank-affiliated securities company to launch cryptocurrency trading in compliance with regulations. The platform offers trading for three major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT), with support for 24/7 trading.\nThis move comes as Hong Kong aims to solidify its position as a global virtual asset hub, combining traditional finance with digital asset innovations. CMB International\u2019s new offering represents a crucial step in integrating traditional financial institutions with the rapidly growing digital asset sector.\nStrengthening Hong Kong\u2019s Financial Market with Virtual Assets\nCMB International\u2019s entry into the virtual asset space is in line with Hong Kong\u2019s strategic goal of becoming an international virtual asset center. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has been actively promoting the development of a regulated and secure virtual asset ecosystem.\nIn July 2024, CMB International secured licenses for securities dealing (Type 1) and automated trading services (Type 7) from the SFC, enabling the company to launch its virtual asset trading platform.\nThrough this expansion, China Merchants Bank, CMB International\u2019s parent company, enhances its service offerings in the Hong Kong financial market. As of 2024, CMB International\u2019s assets under management had surpassed 130 billion yuan, with an annual growth rate of nearly 15%. The addition of virtual asset trading will provide a more diversified asset allocation solution for its high-net-worth clients, which is expected to attract both individual and institutional investors.\nA Compliant and Secure Trading Platform\nThe newly launched platform is designed to meet the highest security standards in the industry. CMB International\u2019s trading service includes multiple verification mechanisms, such as cold storage wallets, real-time risk monitoring, and third-party audits.\nThese security measures comply with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission\u2019s technical security requirements for virtual asset service providers. The platform has also partnered with OKX Planet to ensure liquidity support and trading stability during high-concurrency trading.\nInvestors must as a result complete Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) verifications before participating in trading. This ensures compliance with Hong Kong\u2019s regulatory requirements, contributing to a secure and transparent trading environment.\nLong-Term Impact on Hong Kong\u2019s Virtual Asset Ecosystem\nCMB International\u2019s launch of its virtual asset trading service is expected to spark further developments in Hong Kong\u2019s virtual asset sector. The firm\u2019s brand recognition, supported by its affiliation with China Merchants Bank, offers it a unique advantage over other licensed platforms in the region.\nThe integrated account model that allows investors to trade both traditional assets, such as stocks and bonds, and digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, provides a comprehensive investment solution that is attractive to institutional investors.\nAs the market evolves, more Chinese securities firms are expected to follow suit. Institutions like Guotai Junan International and Tianfeng International have already started the process of upgrading their licenses and may introduce similar services in the near future.

A new media report by Outset PR reveals that tools such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot are now sending traffic to both niche crypto-native and broad generalist media. While these referral volumes remain under 1% of total traffic, their emergence signals a fundamental change in how audiences discover content.\nAmong 114 crypto-native outlets, over 20% received measurable traffic from GenAI platforms in Q2, totaling 135,180 visits \u2013 just 0.65% of their combined quarterly visits. Generalist outlets reported nearly 42% adoption, with 566,596 AI-referred visits \u2013 0.06% of their much larger 894.48 million visits.\nThe key takeaway, according to the report, is that AI is already changing referral patterns in ways that could accelerate quickly in coming quarters.\nA Strong Market Rebound, But Not for All Media\nThe rise of AI in news discovery comes against the backdrop of a major crypto market rebound. After a sharp 19% drop in Q1 2025, global crypto assets surged 22% in Q2. Institutional inflows, growing ETF demand, and corporate Bitcoin acquisitions all contributed to this turnaround.\nRegulatory shifts also helped. In the U.S., bank and crypto firm restrictions eased, IRS tax enforcement rules affecting individual investors were rolled back, and the long-debated Market Structure Bill advanced toward establishing a comprehensive framework for digital assets.\nHowever, this bullish sentiment did not translate into growth for most Eastern European crypto outlets. More than 63% of crypto-native publishers lost traffic. The quarter closed with 20.89 million visits, down 18% from April levels.\nGeneralist media \u2014 broader platforms with crypto sections \u2014 performed only slightly better. Nearly 63% saw traffic declines, slipping by 6% between April and June.\nSource: Outset PR\u2019s crypto media report on Eastern Europe, powered by SimilarWeb\nThese findings echo trends seen in Outset PR\u2019s other recent regional studies. In Q1 2025, their Latin America report showed 73% of outlets losing traffic amid increasing concentration, while the Western Europe report revealed 82% of crypto-native media in decline under MiCA-era conditions \u2013 even as generalist sites there remained comparatively resilient.\nIn Eastern Europe, however, the data shows a rare alignment: both crypto-native and generalist outlets are feeling the same downward pull, suggesting broader structural forces are at play.\nConcentration of Reach in a Few Key Outlets\nA defining feature of Eastern Europe\u2019s crypto media is its highly concentrated visibility. Outset PR found that just 17 crypto-native outlets captured 81% of all traffic in Q2.\nSource: Outset PR\u2019s crypto media report on Eastern Europe, powered by SimilarWeb\n-\nTier 1\u20131.5 outlets with over 500,000 average monthly visits together drew 8.77 million visits (41.98% of the total).\n-\nTier 2 outlets \u2014 100,000K\u2013499,000 average monthly visits \u2014 brought in 8.09 million visits (38.73%).\n-\nTier 3 outlets \u2014 10,000\u201399,000 average monthly visits \u2014 reached 3.62 million visits (17.33%).\n-\nThe \u201clong tail\u201d of outlets under 10,000 monthly visits combined for only 410,290 visits (1.96%).\nTraffic is also concentrated geographically. Russia accounted for 42.89% of crypto-native traffic), while Poland followed with 38.76%. Hungary contributed 4.58%, and both the Czech Republic and Slovakia recorded around 4% each.\nThis concentration means that two countries alone account for over 80% of the region\u2019s crypto-native traffic \u2013 a dynamic that creates both high exposure potential and high risk for campaigns reliant on a narrow market base. Generalist media showed a similar pattern: Russia led with 49.89% and Poland brought 25.38%.\nTraffic Sources Reveal Why AI Matters\nOutset PR\u2019s breakdown of traffic sources shows why GenAI referrals, even under 1%, could have outsized strategic impact.\nSource: Outset PR\u2019s crypto media report on Eastern Europe, powered by SimilarWeb\nFor crypto-native media:\n-\nDirect traffic: 45.20%\n-\nOrganic search: 42.47%\n-\nReferrals: 6.57%, including AI tools, aggregators, and forums\n-\nSocial media: 5.23%\n-\nPaid: 0.06%\nFor generalist outlets:\n-\nDirect traffic: 43.04%\n-\nOrganic search: 35.97%\n-\nReferrals: 15.66%\n-\nSocial media: 5.12%\n-\nPaid: 0.06%\nGenAI-related traffic falls within the \u201creferral\u201d category. If AI platforms increase their role in discovery, they could displace traditional aggregator traffic, reshaping how crypto news circulates.\nThe behavior of AI-driven referrals differs sharply from that of search engines. Instead of producing ranked results, AI tools deliver summarized answers, sometimes with source links but often without.\nSome publishers participating in Outset PR\u2019s anonymous survey have reported sudden traffic spikes when their articles appear in AI-generated answers on platforms like ChatGPT or Perplexity. Similar effects have been observed from You.com and Microsoft Copilot, but these surges usually last only a few hours.\nOthers are responding by making content more \u201cAI-friendly\u201d using structured data, concise meta descriptions, and clear attributions to improve the chance of being cited.\nRegulatory Complexities Add to Visibility Risks\nEastern European crypto media also face a complicated regulatory environment, with national laws, EU directives, and algorithmic compliance signals intersecting.\nIn Russia, crypto mining is now legal, but strict bans on advertising and gambling-related content remain. The Ministry of Energy has introduced a registry for cryptocurrency mining equipment as part of its gradual opening toward the industry.\nUkraine saw no new crypto laws in 2025 but floated a proposal to allow Bitcoin in the National Bank\u2019s reserves. Hungary and Poland have felt the effects of MiCA and ESMA compliance signals, with some publishers attributing traffic declines to early-2025 Google Core Updates that may reflect increased regulatory weighting.\nIn Romania, outlets adhere closely to EU rules, prioritizing fact-checking, transparent sponsorship labels, and avoiding sensationalist headlines. Yet compliance is no guarantee of visibility.\nStrategic Implications for the Next Phase\nThe data makes one point clear: direct and organic search remain dominant in Eastern European crypto media, accounting for over 87% of crypto-native traffic and 79% for generalist outlets. But AI-driven discovery is emerging as a third pathway that could grow rapidly as user habits evolve.\nFor niche crypto-native outlets, this shift presents a risk. With traffic heavily concentrated among a handful of large players, smaller sites may struggle to maintain relevance without adapting to AI-era discovery.\nFor generalist media, the scale of their total reach provides some insulation, but crypto sections could face similar audience capture by AI platforms, particularly for casual readers seeking quick answers rather than in-depth coverage.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Over the weekend, Schwartz revealed that he has been running an experimental server designed to enhance the network\u2019s reliability. The update included detailed monitoring metrics such as bandwidth, latency, peer counts, and disconnection rates. According to Schwartz, the system is nearly production-ready and could soon become part of XRPL\u2019s infrastructure.\nThe goal of this update is to improve the reliability of XRP Ledger nodes, making them less prone to disconnections and synchronization issues. While the XRP Ledger has been known for its stability, the new project focuses on ensuring that the network maintains this reliability as it scales for enterprise and global payment use cases.\nFocus on Reliability and Performance of XRP Ledger\nDavid Schwartz new experiment centers around strengthening the infrastructure of XRP Ledger to ensure that important nodes stay reliably connected to the network. The performance metrics showed that, after a full day of monitoring, the network remained stable with only a slight bump in latency that affected a few weaker connections. Schwartz noted that this was not a major issue and dismissed a brief data dropout as a minor glitch in the monitoring system.\nFor Ripple, ensuring that the XRP Ledger remains stable and reliable is crucial, especially as the network is increasingly being used for enterprise-level applications. As blockchain technology moves closer to real-world use cases such as cross-border payments, the need for consistent and seamless network connectivity becomes even more important.\nSchwartz\u2019s update is an important step toward solidifying XRP Ledger\u2019s reputation as a dependable platform for digital payments and institutional use. He emphasized that while such improvements might not be as headline-grabbing as other features, they are essential for the long-term success and scalability of the network.\nXRP Ledger\u2019s Growing Role in Global Financial Infrastructure\nThe updates provided by David Schwartz are part of Ripple\u2019s ongoing effort to enhance the XRP Ledger\u2019s infrastructure for large-scale applications. Ripple has long positioned the XRP Ledger as a viable option for global financial infrastructure, particularly in payment processing, settlement, and liquidity.\nThe ledger\u2019s hybrid model, which blends public, permissionless elements with compliance-friendly features, makes it an attractive option for both regulatory compliance and financial innovation.\nIn a separate update, Schwartz noted that the XRP Ledger has been battle-tested over the past decade, providing it with a solid foundation for future growth. With its ability to settle transactions efficiently and at low cost, XRP Ledger is increasingly seen as a potential backbone for global payments. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, XRP Ledger\u2019s design choices, such as deterministic finality and Proof of Authority-based consensus, are being replicated by other platforms, indicating a shift towards its principles in the broader industry.\nTesting and Readiness for Enterprise Use\nThough David Schwartz did not provide a specific launch date, he indicated that the work being done on the new XRP Ledger node is already showing promising results.\nRipple\u2019s ongoing efforts aim to make the XRP Ledger more suitable for institutional and enterprise use. The company\u2019s focus on improving reliability through this experimental server is a sign that Ripple is preparing the network for broader adoption.\nThe improvements being tested could provide a critical layer of support for XRP Ledger as it handles more extensive and demanding use cases.

After the new Stablecoin Ordinance was enacted on August 1, market manipulation and fraudulent schemes have reportedly grown. Authorities now stress compliance while warning the public against irrational trading behavior.\nGuotai Junan Rallies Then Retreats After Crypto Frenzy\nGuotai Junan shares jumped by 16% in late July as market excitement around stablecoins peaked. Traders speculated on its crypto alignment despite no confirmed involvement in stablecoin issuance. However, by early August, the momentum faded and the stock price corrected.\nThe firm\u2019s position as a Hong Kong-listed brokerage with crypto exposure likely drove interest. As the Ordinance took effect, speculative buying surged, highlighting the influence of hype. Yet without solid corporate declarations, those gains reversed quickly.\nWhile Guotai Junan never stated stablecoin intentions, its crypto status attracted speculative flows. This pattern underscored the volatility driven by regulatory changes. Many firms benefited from the trend despite lacking direct involvement in stablecoins.\nOSL Benefits from Regulatory Optimism but Faces Market Dip\nOSL also saw stock gains ahead of the August 1 implementation. Traders acted on optimism that firms like OSL would thrive under Hong Kong\u2019s regulated crypto framework. However, as requirements emerged, expectations cooled and shares retreated.\nMarket watchers noted that interest in OSL stemmed from its positioning within crypto infrastructure. This association prompted speculative gains similar to Guotai Junan\u2019s rally. However, once the regulatory path proved stricter than expected, a market reset followed.\nThe sudden drop corrected inflated valuations. OSL\u2019s price activity highlighted how mere association with stablecoins can influence performance.

This acquisition comes as Bitcoin faces a price pullback, dropping below the $115,000 mark, while the company\u2019s stock, MSTR, has also seen a slight decline in value.\nStrategy continues to expand its Bitcoin treasury, following a trend of institutional adoption. The company\u2019s co-founder, Michael Saylor, shared his excitement on social media, hinting at the purchase with a post saying, \u201cInsufficient Orange,\u201d referencing Bitcoin\u2019s symbolic color.

This makes the company a dominant player in the Bitcoin market, alongside other large institutional buyers.\nSaylor\u2019s ongoing commitment to Bitcoin is part of a broader strategy to position the company as a leader in the digital asset space. While the market has seen recent price fluctuations, Strategy\u2019s long-term vision remains focused on increasing its Bitcoin holdings.

The company will continue issuing MSTR stock to acquire Bitcoin when favorable market conditions arise.\nThe updated guidance outlines the company\u2019s plans for issuing MSTR stock based on different market conditions. If the market value of MSTR is above a 4.0x multiple of net asset value (mNAV), Strategy will actively issue stock to acquire Bitcoin. If the market value is between 2.5x and 4.0x mNAV, the company will opportunistically issue stock, and below 2.5x mNAV, Strategy will focus on tactical stock issuance to meet debt obligations and fund preferred equity dividends.\nThis flexible capital strategy ensures that the company can continue acquiring Bitcoin while maintaining financial stability and adapting to market conditions. By issuing stock strategically, Strategy maximizes its ability to add to its Bitcoin treasury without jeopardizing its financial health.\nBitcoin Acquisition Amid Stock Market Challenges\nThe latest acquisition comes during a time when Strategy\u2019s stock, MSTR, has seen a slight dip. However, this has not deterred the company from its aggressive Bitcoin purchasing strategy. In fact, Strategy\u2019s continued purchases are seen as a signal that the company is prioritizing its long-term vision over short-term market fluctuations.\nThe market correction in both Bitcoin and MSTR stock highlights the risks associated with Bitcoin investments. However, Strategy\u2019s approach suggests that the company is focused on the long-term potential of Bitcoin as a store of value and a key component of its corporate strategy.\nStrategy\u2019s focus on Bitcoin acquisition continues to draw attention from investors, especially as the company\u2019s stock has gained 22% year-to-date and 174% over the past year.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:43:41 +0000", "author": "Kelvin Munene", "source": "https://coincentral.com/news/feed/", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "cryptodaily.co.uk", "title": "Stellar (XLM) and Cardano (ADA) Set to Break $1, While Coldware Pushes Towards 11,000% for Early Adopters", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/stellar-xlm-and-cardano-ada-set-to-break-1-while-coldware-pushes-towards-11000-for-early-adopters", "text": "Coldware (COLD) is emerging as one of the most aggressive early-stage plays of 2025, with bullish projections putting its upside potential at a staggering 11,000% from its presale base. While Stellar (XLM) and Cardano (ADA) are targeting the psychologically significant $1 milestone, Coldware\u2019s ambition isn\u2019t simply to follow the market \u2014 it\u2019s to create its own adoption curve through a fusion of blockchain, hardware, and SocialFi integration.\nColdware (COLD): Hardware Meets SocialFi\nUnlike most blockchain projects that rely solely on software ecosystems, Coldware (COLD) is building its own line of blockchain-native mobile devices. These devices feature integrated wallets, dApp marketplaces, and a SocialFi layer that rewards user engagement directly in COLD tokens. That means posting content, joining DAOs, or participating in creator economies all happens natively without third-party gatekeepers. This closed-loop hardware-plus-token model could give Coldware a defensible moat that other Layer-1 competitors can\u2019t easily replicate.\nStellar (XLM): Cross-Border Payments at a Tipping Point\nStellar has long been positioned as a leader in low-cost, cross-border transactions. With adoption growing in remittance-heavy regions and increasing partnerships with payment service providers, XLM is building momentum toward $1. Its low fees and speed are attracting fintech integrations, particularly in emerging markets where stablecoin usage is surging. The challenge for Stellar remains scaling user acquisition beyond institutional payment corridors into retail-friendly applications \u2014 something Coldware (COLD) could accelerate through its own hardware channels.\nCardano (ADA): ETF Speculation and Whale Confidence\nCardano is seeing renewed bullish energy, with whales holding over 15 billion ADA unmoved for a year and ETF filings in Delaware boosting sentiment. Price action between $0.90 and $1.00 is setting up for a potential run toward $2 if momentum holds. Hydra scaling upgrades and the Midnight privacy layer are expanding Cardano\u2019s use cases in DeFi and regulated environments. However, while Cardano focuses on software ecosystem maturity, Coldware\u2019s hardware-led approach could give it an onboarding advantage with less friction for new users.\nWhy Coldware\u2019s Growth Could Outpace\nThe difference lies in velocity. Stellar and Cardano (ADA) are established players with strong fundamentals but slower, more methodical adoption curves. Coldware, starting from a low presale base, can leverage exponential network effects if its mobile devices gain traction quickly. Hardware distribution acts as an instant distribution channel for the blockchain itself, pushing transaction volume, SocialFi engagement, and token demand from day one.\nConclusion\nStellar (XLM) and Cardano (ADA) are both positioned for solid growth toward $1 and beyond, supported by institutional interest and strong fundamentals. But Coldware (COLD) offers an entirely different growth story \u2014 one built on merging physical hardware with native blockchain engagement. For early adopters, that combination could deliver gains far beyond what established large-caps can offer in the same timeframe.\nFor more information on the Coldware (COLD) Presale:\nVisit Coldware (COLD)\nJoin and become a community member:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Among the projects making waves, PepeDollar and LilPepe are emerging as standouts on the crypto presale list.\nBoth tokens combine meme culture with innovative blockchain utility, offering fresh alternatives in an otherwise competitive landscape. With crypto ICO presales gaining traction again, these projects represent how token presales can mix community-driven branding with real technical features.\nAs more investors explore crypto coins on presale, PepeDollar (PEPD) and LilPepe are consistently being discussed among the best crypto presales to buy right now.\nPepedollar Merges Culture and Utility in Token Presales\nPepeDollar (PEPD) is one of the best crypto presales to buy right now because it blends humor-driven branding with a strong technical foundation. Built on Ethereum Layer-2, it ensures faster and cheaper transactions, making it suitable for micro-payments and everyday crypto use cases.\nThe project has also integrated staking opportunities and features meme-themed gaming connections, showing a balance between entertainment and utility. Its viral presence, backed by a satirical parody of a central bank, gives it cultural weight that many crypto presale projects lack.\nIn terms of sustainability, PepeDollar employs a capped supply and burn mechanism to increase scarcity over time. This approach addresses a common criticism of meme coins\u2014unlimited inflation with no long-term value structure.\nWith these combined elements, PepeDollar has become a leading example of how pre sale cryptocurrency projects can evolve into serious contenders in the wider crypto market.\nPepedollar Merges Culture and Utility in Token Presales\nLilPepe has raised over $17.5 million in its ongoing presale, leaving less than 8% of tokens available before reaching its target. At $0.0019 per token, it remains one of the top crypto presales attracting attention in 2025.\nIts value proposition lies in its dedicated Layer-2 blockchain built exclusively for meme coins. By focusing solely on this niche, LilPepe aims to deliver the fastest and most cost-efficient environment for meme coin activity. A CertiK audit score of 95.49% provides added confidence in its smart contract security.\nThe project also ensures 0% tax on transactions, a feature welcomed by traders, and includes sniper-bot protection to secure its launch. Furthermore, confirmed Tier-1 exchange listings are expected upon release, signaling strong confidence in the project\u2019s future.\nLilPepe demonstrates how new crypto token presales can combine innovation, community, and market safeguards to build strong momentum before launch.\nPepedollar Merges Culture and Utility in Token Presales\nMarket analysts are closely watching PepeDollar and LilPepe as examples of presale crypto tokens that have gone beyond hype. Both projects are positioned for Tier-1 listings after their token presales conclude, a milestone that can significantly boost visibility.\nWhile crypto presales often face challenges in delivering long-term value, these two projects stand out due to their infrastructure, cultural branding, and growing community support. Their presence on the crypto presale list highlights a shift in the way investors evaluate new crypto presales\u2014focusing on both utility and narrative strength.\nAs crypto presale projects like PepeDollar and LilPepe gain attention, many see them as among the best crypto presales to buy right now, particularly for those seeking both novelty and structured development in pre-sale cryptocurrency markets.\nPepedollar Merges Culture and Utility in Token Presales\nPepeDollar and LilPepe showcase how presale crypto coins can merge entertainment with practical use cases. By combining scarcity-driven mechanics, blockchain innovation, and strong branding, they represent two of the top crypto presales currently available.\nFor investors exploring the crypto presale 2025 landscape, both projects demonstrate how new token presales can build trust through audits, tokenomics, and transparent launches. At the same time, their cultural appeal keeps communities engaged, which is critical in the evolving world of cryptocurrency presales.\nPepeDollar\u2019s Layer-2 integration and LilPepe\u2019s meme coin-focused chain reflect the variety of approaches within the token presale sector.\nTogether, they illustrate why crypto presales remain an important gateway for those who want to buy presale crypto with long-term growth potential in mind.\nLastly, boost your presale allocation with a 20% bonus by entering the code Pepe_Powell20 at the time of purchase.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

BTC traded above $118,000 on Sunday but lost momentum early on Monday, plunging to an intraday low of $115,179 as selling pressure overwhelmed buyers. The flagship cryptocurrency has made a marginal recovery, moving to $115,528, but remains down by over 2%.\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) decline has been far more dramatic, with the altcoin down nearly 5% over the past 24 hours. The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency traded above $4,500 over the weekend before dropping below $4,300 to its current level of $4,261. Ripple (XRP) is down 4.99%, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 4.67%, trading around $0.222. Solana (SOL) has also declined substantially over the past 24 hours, down nearly 6%, trading around $181. Cardano (ADA), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial declines. However, Chainlink (LINK) bucked the bearish trend and is up nearly 2%, trading around $24.50.\nThailand Plans To Launch Crypto Payment Sandbox Aimed At Tourists\nThailand is planning a countrywide regulatory sandbox to allow tourists to convert their crypto into local fiat currency in a bid to boost tourism. The new scheme, called TouristDigiPay, is expected to go live on Monday and will allow tourists to convert their crypto into Thai baht and make electronic payments through local e-money providers. The service is available only for tourists, who must complete Know Your Customer (KYC) checks and open an account with a digital asset business and e-money provider regulated by the Bank of Thailand and its Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe scheme has several safeguards in place, including a monthly spending limit and a block on cash withdrawals. However, full details about the scheme will be released by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira. The scheme aims to revive the country\u2019s tourism industry after a decline in foreign visitors, particularly from China.\nIs Lazarus Behind The $23M Lykke Hack?\nNorth Korea\u2019s notorious Lazarus Group has been blamed for a $22.8 million hack that crippled UK-registered exchange Lykke. The hack resulted in the shutdown of the exchange and triggered a wave of investor lawsuits. The British Treasury\u2019s sanctions office linked the hackers to the hack and theft of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other assets from the platform. The collapse is the latest in a long line of hacks that have netted Pyongyang billions to continue its weapons programs and evade Western sanctions. It also leaves Lykke\u2019s founder, Richard Olsen, facing bankruptcy, liquidation proceedings, and legal scrutiny.\nOlsen is the great-grandson of Swiss banking patriarch Julius Baer and founded Lykke in 2015. The exchange offered crypto trading without transaction fees, before the hack forced it to shut down operations.\nKraken Pauses Monero Deposits Following 51% Attack\nCryptocurrency exchange Kraken has temporarily paused Monero deposits after a 51% attack against the privacy-focused blockchain, compromising the network\u2019s security. A 51% attack occurs when a single mining pool controls over 50% of the network\u2019s hashing power, allowing it to double-spend and reorder transactions on the ledger. Kraken released a statement on Friday,\n\"As a security precaution, we have paused Monero deposits after detecting that a single mining pool has gained more than 50% of the network\u2019s total hashing power. This concentration of mining power poses a potential risk to network integrity.\u201d\nQubic, a Layer-1 AI-focused blockchain and mining pool, claimed to control the majority of Monero\u2019s hashrate, reorganizing six blocks. This prompted denials of the attack from the Monero community. Qubic released a statement claiming responsibility, stating,\n\u201cAfter a month-long, high-stakes technical confrontation, Qubic reached 51% of Monero's hashrate dominance, successfully reorganizing the blockchain. This event marks a pivotal moment in the crypto industry.\u201d\nThe Qubic community has now voted to target Dogecoin (DOGE) next. Qubic founder Sergey Ivancheglo gave the community several choices, including DOGE, Kaspa, and Zcash. DOGE received 300 votes from the Qubic community by the time voting closed, more than all other choices combined.\n$1M Bitcoin (BTC) Could Be A Sign Of Trouble\nGalaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has said that if Bitcoin (BTC) reaches $1M next year, it could be an indication that the US economy is in trouble. Novogratz stated that he would rather have a lower BTC price in a more stable US, adding that the devaluation of a national currency often comes at the expense of civil society. Novogratz stated on the Coin Stories podcast on Wednesday,\n\u201cPeople who cheer for the million-dollar Bitcoin price next year, I was like, Guys, it only gets there if we\u2019re in such a shitty place domestically. I\u2019d rather have a lower Bitcoin price in a more stable United States than the opposite. When a national currency falls, investors often seek alternative safe havens to protect their wealth, and Bitcoin is often called digital gold.\u201d\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\nBitcoin (BTC) has started the week in bearish territory, losing momentum and plunging below $118,000. The flagship cryptocurrency dropped to $117,436 on Friday as sellers dominated market sentiment. However, it stabilized over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Saturday and Sunday to settle at $117,488. However, selling pressure returned during the ongoing session, with BTC down almost 2%, trading around $115,227.\nAnalysts believe a correction was due after BTC spent six weeks in price discovery. According to Rekt Capital, BTC is running out of time to make new highs, and risks staying below $124,000 if historical patterns are in place. The analyst noted that BTC is about to start its 7th week of \u201cprice discovery uptrend.\u201d The bull market after halving events contains a series of such uptrends, accompanied by a substantial correction.\n\u201cHistorically, Bitcoin Price Discovery Uptrend 1 tends to end between Week 6 & 8 of its uptrend. Whereas in Price Discovery Uptrend 2, Bitcoin tends to end its uptrend between Week 5 & 7. Week 7 of Price Discovery Uptrend 2 begins tomorrow.\u201d\nRekt Capital also linked a chart that showed a potential upside for the second uptrend at just $160,000.\n\u201cBut if we think critically about previous Price Discovery Corrections across the cycles... Then only one of them started in Week 8 (2017), one of them started in Week 6 (2021), and two of them started in Week 7 (2013 and 2025).\u201d\nMeanwhile, Daan Crypto noted that BTC/USD had not delivered a positive August and September back-to-back.\n\u201cWe tend to see a quick flush followed by an explosive Q4 in most of the bull market years. Any larger flushes in the next 1-2 months would be welcomed and could very well be the last larger dip for the Q4 end-of-the-year rally, which we see so often. If not, that's fine too, but I think it would pull forward a bigger high timeframe top as well.\u201d\nHowever, Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg believes BTC may have more than 27% upside left in this cycle before it enters a downtrend.\n\u201cI think there is a greater than 50% chance Bitcoin goes to the 140 to 150 range this year before we see another bear market next year.\u201d\nHe also argued that the Federal Reserve should have cut interest rates at its last two meetings.\nBTC started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 1% and settling at $116,683. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price registered a marginal decline to $116,492. However, it recovered on Sunday, rising 2.42% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,309. BTC reached an intraday high of $122,319 on Monday as bullish sentiment intensified. Despite the positive start, it lost momentum and settled at $118,701, ultimately dropping 0.51%. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.19% to cross $120,000 and settle at $120,113. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to cross $123,000 and settle at $123,365.\nSource: TradingView\nThe flagship cryptocurrency surged to a new all-time high on Thursday, reaching $124,533. However, it lost momentum and plunged below $120,000 to settle at $118,389, ultimately dropping over 4%. Sellers retained control on Friday as the price fell 0.80% to $117,436. BTC stabilized over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Saturday and Sunday to settle at $117,488. However, it is back in the red during the ongoing session, with the price down over 2%, trading around 4114,970.\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\nEthereum (ETH) has faced a substantial jump in selling pressure over the past few sessions. The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency was on the verge of crossing $4,800 last week before losing momentum. It fell to a low of $4,379 by Saturday before recovering on Sunday to end the weekend at $4,476. However, ETH is back in the red during the ongoing session, down over 4%, trading around $4,296.\nAnalysts have warned that billions in ETH are waiting to be unstaked, adding to the selling pressure on the asset. ETH holders are lining up to unstake their tokens, with the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s validator exit queue hitting 855,158 ETH on Friday, worth around $3.7 billion. Staking allows ETH holders to lock their tokens and earn rewards. However, the growing queue of soon-to-be unstaked ETH could add to the selling pressure and drive its recent retracement. ETH has declined sharply over the past few days after coming close to setting a new all-time high. Bitwise senior investment strategist Juan Leon stated,\n\u201cTokens like stETH can trade at a discount. That discount reduces their value as collateral, triggering risk cuts, hedges, or even liquidations that lead to spot ETH selling.\u201d\nETH started the previous week in positive territory, rising 2.52% on Friday to cross $4,000 and settle at $4,010. The price continued pushing higher on Saturday, rising over 6% to cross $4,200 and settle at $4,262. Despite the positive sentiment, ETH registered a marginal decline on Sunday, settling at $4,251. Price action remained subdued on Monday as the price registered another marginal decline. However, it rebounded on Tuesday, rising nearly 9% to cross $4,500 and settle at $4,589. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as ETH rose over 3% to $4,745.\nSource: TradingView\nETH lost momentum on Thursday as selling pressure returned. As a result, it fell 4.11% to $4,551. Sellers retained control on Friday as the price dropped 2.34%, slipping below $4,500 and settling at $4,444. Price action was mixed over the weekend as ETH registered a marginal decline on Saturday before rising 1.13% on Sunday to settle at $4,476. However, ETH is back in the red during the current session, down over 4%, trading around $4,296.\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\nSolana (SOL) failed to establish itself above $200 yet again, as volatility and selling pressure drove prices back towards $180. The altcoin surged to an intraday high of $209 on Thursday, only to lose momentum and drop to $185 by Friday. The price recovered over the weekend but is back in the red during the ongoing session, down over 5%.\nSOL registered a notable increase on Friday (August 8), rising nearly 1% to $176. Buyers retained control over the weekend as the price rose 1.80% on Saturday and 1.52% on Sunday, crossing $180 and settling at $182.

Investors continue to pay attention as RTX expands into real-world payments, launching its wallet beta in Q3 with features designed to rival established DeFi tools. With the token priced at $0.0944, over $20 million already raised, and more than 607 million tokens sold, momentum has shifted toward Remittix as one of the most promising crypto projects of the year.\nSolana ETF Hype Fails To Spark Long-Term Rally\nSolana (SOL) has been in focus as several firms, including VanEck and Invesco, filed for spot Solana ETFs. The SEC, however, delayed decisions until October 16, 2025, stalling the rally. Despite $13 million worth of ETF inflows in a single day, SOL struggled to break out past the $195 level, slipping back into consolidation.\nSource: TradingView\nTraders are still eyeing Solana as a top crypto under $1,000 with potential for ETF-driven growth, but the short-term action highlights risks tied to regulatory delays.

Its PayFi model enables direct crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries with low gas fees and real-time FX conversion. The upcoming wallet beta launch this September is designed for freelancers, remitters, and businesses who need fast and transparent cross-border payments.\nKey highlights of Remittix include:\n- $0.0944 current price, over $20M raised and 607M+ tokens sold\n- Wallet beta launching in Q3 with global payment rails\n- Focused on solving a $19T remittance market problem\n- Built with audited security and cross-chain DeFi project integrations\nBeyond that, Remittix has announced it will reveal the name of its first centralized exchange listing once funding crosses the $20M mark, an event that could draw even greater attention. With its clear use case and rising adoption, experts argue Remittix could be the next big altcoin of 2025 and a standout in the category of best crypto presale 2025.\nOutlook For Investors\nThe battle between utility and speculation is evident this August. Solana remains a high growth crypto tethered to regulatory news, while Remittix is showing how real-world adoption drives sustainable momentum. For investors considering early stage crypto investment, Remittix is increasingly positioned as the crypto with real utility that may outperform traditional market favorites in the months ahead.\nDiscover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their presale here:\nWebsite: https://remittix.io/\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/remittix\n$250K Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway\nDisclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.

Remittix, built on the Ethereum architecture, is being pegged as the next XRP-like breakout, offering real-world utility using crypto-to-bank transfers. The narrative: as Ethereum builds macro strength, Remittix delivers grassroots adoption.\nWhy Remittix Is Quietly Turning Heads\nWhile Ethereum continues to dominate the headlines, early investors are quietly betting on Remittix, a presale project that combines real-world utility with strong tokenomics.\n- Beta wallet launch confirmed: Mark your calendar: Remittix\u2019s multi-chain Web3 wallet is set to debut in Q3 2025. It supports crypto-to-fiat transfers across 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies, servicing users in 30+ countries.\n- Presale momentum & CEX buzz: With more than $20 million raised and 607 million tokens sold, Remittix isn\u2019t flying under the radar. Crossing that $20 million threshold will trigger the first-ever centralized exchange listing, an event insiders say could ignite serious liquidity and visibility.\n- Security & trust checkboxes ticked: The project already cleared a CertiK audit with zero critical issues. Audits like these aren\u2019t common in presale projects, marking Remittix as notably credible.\n- General narrative shift: Analysts are now favoring grounded-use case tokens over hype plays. Remittix\u2019s real-world payment angle is giving it an edge in the \u201cbest crypto to buy now\u201d conversations.\nWhat\u2019s Changing in Market Sentiment?\nEven as Ethereum continues to grow steadily, investors seek access to more functional plays. The difference between Solana and Cardano versus Remittix comes down to timing and utility:\n- Established players offer scale and ecosystem.\n- Remittix offers immediate, real-world utility and deliverables.\n- With its wallet and CEX listing inbound (BitMart recently announced RTX listing on its X\u2019s page), Remittix stands poised to benefit from both hype and substance.\nFinal Thoughts: Momentum Meets Utility\nIf you\u2019re asking where the smart money\u2019s leaning as Q3 gains steam:\n- Ethereum: steady macro strength and infrastructure lead.\n- Remittix: a low-cap utility breakout with structural catalysts lined up.\nFor anyone searching for the best crypto to buy now, Remittix offers a compelling blend: legit utility, investor trust, and significant milestones ahead. The window may narrow fast, so keep your eyes on the CEX reveal, and maybe start holding that beta wallet test account.\nDiscover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out the project here:\nWebsite: https://remittix.io/\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/remittix\n$250,000 Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway\nDisclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.

What\u2019s next for ETH\u2019s future?\nEthereum (ETH) is at the centre of some strong market tension. The cryptocurrency has rallied more than 20% in the past month, after rising from June lows of $2,100 to over $4,300 by mid-August.\nDespite the recovery, Ethereum is under pressure from a new development from the short positions that could set up a short squeeze.\nMarket Split Between Bulls and Bears\nWhales and institutional buyers continue to accumulate ETH, and are adding momentum to the price rally. Data shows $378 million in stablecoins flowed into Ethereum over the past 24 hours. This shows a great deal of demand that has challenged bearish traders who expected a deeper correction.\nThe surge in short positions started early this year and has now reached record highs, according to recent updates from Bitcoinsensus.\n\ud83d\udea8 Institutional Shorts on Ethereum Hit Record Highs \ud83d\udea8\nCME data shows Ethereum shorts by institutions just reached an all-time high \ud83e\udde8\nETFs are stacking $ETH\u2026 while futures markets are heavily betting against it. One side is about to be very wrong. \ud83d\udc40#Ethereum $ETH pic.twitter.com/PdNTsy6N08\n\u2014 Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) August 18, 2025\nInstitutions have been particularly active in shorting ETH through CME futures. This indicates that large players are becoming cautious, even as retail traders and whales increase exposure.\nThe standoff has created an ongoing battle between bulls and bears. If prices continue to rise, short sellers may be forced to cover their positions. This could trigger a squeeze and push prices further upwards.\nHowever, if ETH falls below support at $4,200, long positions worth over $2 billion will be at risk of liquidation.\nEthereum Technical Levels in Focus\nEthereum\u2019s recent moves have been volatile. Earlier in August, ETH briefly dipped under $2,500 amid geopolitical uncertainty from the Trump tariffs. However, the price quickly rebounded and is now trading well above that low.\nAnalysts are pointing out $4,200 as an important support level for the asset. Particularly, a sustained move below it could cause a cascade of liquidations.\nOn the upside, resistance is clustered between $4,550 and $4,571. Which means that a break above this range could open the path toward $5,000.\nAccording to the charts, Ethereum is currently battling with a rejection from the $4,788 price level and a possible retest of $3,875.\nIf the bulls are unable to defend the $3,875 zone from attack, Ethereum is likely to trek further downwards and test the $3,293 price level.\nTraders Weigh Liquidation Risks\nThe rise in shorting has made Ethereum trading risky. Analysts are warning that if ETH slips below $4,200, long positions could face forced liquidations. This scenario would increase volatility and possibly push the price back toward the $3,800 region.\nFor traders, it is important to manage risk properly. Market conditions can be unpredictable, and short squeezes tend to create rapid upside moves, just as liquidations can create sharp declines.\nIn all, Ethereum\u2019s year-to-date performance has been strong. However, its immediate future shows a need for caution.\nAnalysts are pointing to the ETF market inflows and whale confidence as evidence that ETH can aim for $5,000. However, the bears are pointing towards the high institutional shorts as reasons why prices could be at risk of a crash soon.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:55:21 +0000", "author": "Samuel", "source": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/feed/", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "www.livebitcoinnews.com", "title": "Unilabs Finance Price Prediction: Even $500 in Viral AI Platform Could Beat Cardano Returns in Q4", "url": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/unilabs-finance-price-prediction-even-500-in-viral-ai-platform-could-beat-cardano-returns-in-q4/", "text": "In recent Cardano News, ADA Coin continues to hold investor attention with its steady network upgrades and consistent community growth. Yet, in Q4 2025, the rise of AI-powered asset managers like Unilabs Finance could change the performance landscape entirely.\nAs market conditions shift, a $500 entry into this viral presale may offer bigger upside that could outpace ADA Coin\u2019s returns.\nCardano News: Market Snapshot and Technical Setup\nSource: ADAUSD on TradingView.com\nCardano news shows ADA began 2025 on a recovery trajectory, starting the year above $0.84 and rallying to nearly $1.00 by mid-August. The intraday RSI has just picked up into the overbought region at 70 that has used the last few weeks of sustained bullish momentum.\nIn the greater time frame, the 50-week running average has rested above the 200-week running average, an uncommon golden cross sign that historically has been followed by extended rallies.\nUnderstanding Unilabs and Its Growing Appeal\nUnilabs Finance is the first decentralized AI-supported asset manager whose Q2 2025 asset under management (AUM) exceeded 30 million dollars. The platform ran four core funds (AI Fund, BTC Fund, RWA Fund, Mining Fund, with a real-time AI allocation system rotating capital across the market sectors according to the volatility, the strength of trend, and liquidity flows).\nThis dynamic approach blends the adaptability of DeFi with the portfolio discipline of traditional asset management. Holders can stake their tokens to earn variable ROI while benefiting from a referral system that encourages ecosystem expansion.\nTechnical Context for Unilabs\u2019 Potential\nAlthough Unilabs Finance has not yet launched on the open market, its early-stage positioning can be compared to previous AI-DeFi projects such as SingularityNET and Fetch.ai, both of which recorded multi-fold gains in their first significant bull cycles.\nIf Unilabs were to capture even a small fraction of the capital from traditional hedge funds, say, just 0.1%, its market cap could multiply several times from presale levels. Trading history from similar platforms shows that it\u2019s not uncommon for investments of just $500 could turn into $200,000.\nComparing ADA Coin and Unilabs in a Q4 Scenario\nIn recent Cardano news, ADA Coin\u2019s technical picture for Q4 suggests sustained growth potential. Its major support is currently around $0.60 \u2013 $0.65, with strong resistance near $1.00 & on $1.12.\nThe recent weekly golden cross and on Cardano news, where the 50-week moving average crossed above the 200-week moving average, points toward a historically bullish structure that could support a continued climb if Bitcoin dominance eases and liquidity rotates into altcoins.\nUnilabs, by contrast, is entering the market with a much smaller capitalization, meaning percentage-based price movements could be significantly larger in either direction. The platform\u2019s multi-strategy execution, capable of shifting between memecoins, stable yield pools, and high-risk/high-reward sectors, adds a degree of flexibility that ADA\u2019s network design does not target.\nShould AI adoption in asset management accelerate through Q4, Unilabs could position itself at the intersection of two of crypto\u2019s most compelling narratives, decentralized finance and artificial intelligence, with technical momentum building quickly from its launch.\nClosing Outlook\nBoth ADA Coin and Unilabs present distinct opportunities for Q4 investors. ADA offers network stability and gradual price appreciation, Unilabs represents an adaptive, high-volatility entry that could benefit from rapid sector rotation and AI-driven allocation strategies.\nFor those tracking Cardano News, diversification across both assets could offer a balanced approach, with ADA serving as the foundation and Unilabs providing significant upside potential. The Unilabs presale is currently live, complete with referral incentives and staking rewards from the outset.\nMore details are available on Unilabs Website and through the Unilabs Telegram.\nDisclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.

This move lifted its total Bitcoin holdings to 18,888 BTC, worth approximately $2.2 billion at current market prices.\nPresident Simon Gerovich shared the news on X, stating, \u201c18,888 BTC.

Like Saylor\u2019s company, Metaplanet sees Bitcoin as its core treasury asset.\nJust weeks before the latest buy, Metaplanet bought 463 BTC for $53 million on August 4 and 518 BTC for $61.4 million on August 12. These buys have helped it rank seventh globally among Bitcoin-holding companies, according to Bitcointreasuries data.\nMetaplanet BTC Push Inspires Regional Companies\nMetaplanet\u2019s actions are influencing companies across Asia to consider similar moves. Recently, Taiwan\u2019s WiseLink committed $10 million through a convertible note to Nasdaq-listed Top Win International.\nSimilarly, South Korea\u2019s K Wave Media partnered with Galaxy Digital to build its Bitcoin reserves. Singapore\u2019s Genius Group also raised its target from 1,000 BTC to 10,000 BTC, which shows its adoption of BTC-focused treasury management in Asia.\nThese examples show how Metaplanet\u2019s strategy could speed up a corporate Bitcoin race in the region.\nStrongest Quarter in Company History\nMetaplanet\u2019s BTC focus has also boosted its financial performance. The company posted its best-ever quarterly results in Q2.\nParticularly, revenue jumped 41% quarter-on-quarter to $8.4 million. Gross profit rose 38% to $5.5 million. Net income reached $75.1 million and reversed a $34.2 million loss in Q1. Finally, ordinary profit surged to $117.8 million from a $46.7 million loss in the prior quarter.\nThe company also recorded a 468% year-to-date Bitcoin yield, which shows both rising BTC prices and effective treasury management.\nGerovich called it \u201cthe best performance in company history.\u201d\nMarket Reaction and Stock Performance\nDespite the strong results, Metaplanet\u2019s stock has faced quite a few headwinds. Shares closed at 866 yen on Friday in Japan, and marked an 8.6% drop. By midday on Monday, the stock edged up 0.6%.\nGerovich acknowledged investor concerns and noted that the recent pullback was natural.\nHowever, he pointed out that the company\u2019s recurring Bitcoin income supports further accumulation. He explained that this income stream also provides flexibility for future financing.\nThe Road Ahead for Metaplanet\nLooking forward, Metaplanet predicts that it will have a full-year revenue of 3.4 billion yen and an operating profit of 2.5 billion yen. Moreover, its recurring income from cash-secured put premiums and operational gains continues to support its Bitcoin buys.\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s price fell 2.1% in the past 24 hours to $115,305, Metaplanet has been unfazed so far.\nGerovich summed it up by saying, \u201cWhat gives us conviction is the foundation we are building.\u201d The company has nearly $2 billion already invested in BTC, and is showing no signs of slowing down.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:57:26 +0000", "author": "Samuel", "source": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/feed/", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "www.livebitcoinnews.com", "title": "$5.5M Raised for BlockchainFX: Why It\u2019s the Top Crypto Presale to Invest In Compared to Nexchain", "url": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/5-5m-raised-for-blockchainfx-why-its-the-top-crypto-presale-to-invest-in-compared-to-nexchain/", "text": "2025 is shaping up to be a record-breaking year for crypto presales, and BlockchainFX is leading the charge.

Don\u2019t miss your chance to invest in the top crypto presale of 2025,BlockchainFX is ready to dominate the market.\nBlockchainFX: All the Features You Need for Maximum Profits\nBlockchainFX is not just another crypto project; it\u2019s a game-changing super app that seamlessly integrates traditional finance with blockchain technology.

Invest in BFX Now and Watch Your Returns Multiply!\nNexchain: A Limited Investment Opportunity\nWhile BlockchainFX is making waves with its multi-asset platform, Nexchain has struggled to match its pace. Nexchain is primarily focused on cryptocurrency trading, offering only a limited range of assets. This niche focus can hinder its growth, especially when investors are looking for platforms that offer more versatility. As crypto traders demand more flexibility and access to traditional finance tools, Nexchain\u2019s limited scope may prevent it from attracting the same level of attention and investment as BlockchainFX.\nWhat\u2019s more, Nexchain lacks the robust reward system that BlockchainFX offers. While BlockchainFX provides daily passive rewards through staking, Nexchain does not offer any passive income opportunities, making it less appealing for long-term investors looking to maximize their returns. Its limited user base and narrow focus mean that it will have a harder time scaling in the rapidly evolving world of digital finance.\nBlockchainFX vs. Nexchain: Feature Comparison\n| Feature | BlockchainFX | Nexchain |\n| Assets Supported | 500+ (Crypto, Stocks, Forex, ETFs, Commodities) | Primarily crypto |\n| Passive Rewards | Yes, BFX & USDT through staking | No |\n| BFX Visa Card | Yes, global spending with zero limits | No |\n| Multi-Asset Trading | Yes, across crypto, stocks, and more | No, limited to crypto |\n| Security | Audited by Coinsult, CertiK, KYC verified | Limited security measures |\n| Referral Program | Yes, earn 10% on referred purchases | No |\n| Staking Rewards | Yes, up to $25,000 USDT | No |\n| Long-Term Potential | 500x growth potential | Limited potential |\nWhy BlockchainFX is the Best Crypto to Buy Now\nThere\u2019s no question that BlockchainFX offers the best crypto presale opportunity of 2025.

Blockdag\u2019s promise of low-cost, high-speed transactions makes it an attractive option for long-term investors and those seeking a decentralized platform for dApps and smart contracts.\nHowever, while Blockdag offers high scalability, it lacks the multi-asset trading and passive rewards that BlockchainFX offers, limiting its long-term appeal.\nRemittix: Changing the Remittance Landscape\nRemittix leverages blockchain technology to make cross-border payments cheaper, faster, and more secure. Targeting the global remittance market, Remittix provides an innovative solution for sending money overseas without the high fees associated with traditional financial services. It\u2019s already attracting attention from crypto whales and Solana-based meme coins enthusiasts.\nYet, while Remittix has great potential in the remittance space, BlockchainFX offers a more comprehensive and rewarding trading platform with a broader range of asset classes and daily passive rewards, making it a superior long-term investment.\nBitcoin Hyper: Faster Bitcoin Transactions\nBitcoin Hyper offers a high-speed Bitcoin alternative, designed for near-instant transactions. Unlike Bitcoin, which can take minutes to confirm transactions, Bitcoin Hyper provides faster confirmation times while maintaining Bitcoin\u2019s strong security features. While Bitcoin Hyper is gaining momentum as a solution for fast transactions, it doesn\u2019t offer the same diversity of assets or staking rewards that BlockchainFX provides.\nFor those interested in a fast Bitcoin alternative, Bitcoin Hyper is worth considering, but it\u2019s limited in scope compared to BlockchainFX\u2019s all-in-one platform.\nFeature Comparison: BlockchainFX vs. Other Presale Projects\n| Feature | BlockchainFX | Blockdag | Remittix | Bitcoin Hyper |\n| Assets Supported | 500+ (Crypto, Stocks, Forex, ETFs) | Blockchain-focused (DAG) | Crypto remittance | Bitcoin alternative |\n| Passive Rewards | Yes (BFX & USDT staking) | No | No | No |\n| Visa Card | Yes, global spending | No | No | No |\n| Multi-Asset Trading | Yes | No | No | No |\n| Security | Audited by Coinsult & CertiK | Decentralized | Decentralized | Fast Bitcoin transactions |\n| Referral Program | Yes (10% on referred purchases) | No | No | No |\nBlockchainFX Leads the Way in Crypto Presales\nBlockchainFX is the top crypto presale to buy now, offering a multi-asset trading platform with 500x long-term potential, daily passive rewards, and BFX Visa Card for real-world spending. While Blockdag, Remittix, and Bitcoin Hyper offer unique features in specific areas, BlockchainFX\u2019s comprehensive platform gives investors the best opportunity for high returns in 2025. With a low presale price of $0.019 and the potential for 100x gains, this is a project that promises to redefine the future of crypto trading.\nInvest in BlockchainFX today to take advantage of the 500x growth potential and be part of the next big crypto revolution.

Institutional inflows are hitting all-time highs, regulators are finally aligning across major economies, and advanced products like staked ETFs are reshaping access for everyday investors.\nAnalysts have dubbed this convergence of factors the \u201c2021 Success Blueprint 2.0,\u201d a recipe that once propelled digital assets to unprecedented valuations.\nBut unlike four years ago, the mix now includes maturing DeFi ecosystems, tokenized real-world assets, and AI-powered platforms, all underpinned by clearer compliance frameworks.\nThis backdrop is fueling a hunt for projects that fit the moment, that is, tokens with the innovation, market readiness, and growth narrative to thrive in this upgraded cycle. While established giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum will likely benefit from the broader uptrend, the real intrigue for high-upside seekers lies in smaller, under-the-radar presales.\nOne such contender emerging within this 2025 climate is Tapzi, whose model intersects with key blueprint drivers: accessible entry, utility beyond speculation, and integration with real-world and on-chain demand trends.\nSimilarly, there are more best presales to buy now that can help you diversify your portfolio for success, and let\u2019s check the details!\n5 Best Presales To Invest in For Capitalizing On High ROI Cryptos\nBelow is a list of the best presales to invest in this month:\n- JetBolt (JBOLT)\n- Best Wallet Token (BEST)\n- Wall Street Pepe (WEPE)\n- Qubetics (TICS)\nWhile the 2021 crypto success was worth witnessing, the best presale to invest in is on similar footsteps and can even go bigger. Let\u2019s check the details!\n-\nTapzi (TAPZI)\nTapzi is a Web3 gaming platform designed to position itself within the structural trends driving the 2025 bull run. With institutional inflows at record highs and growing interest in projects with clear utility, Tapzi\u2019s focus on skill-based Player-vs-Player gaming aligns with the market\u2019s shift toward sustainable use cases over speculative models.\nThe platform aims to become a global hub for competitive games like Chess, Checkers, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and Tic Tac Toe, with staking and prize pools forming the backbone of its in-game economy.\nSecure Your $TAPZI Tokens Now \u2013 Click Here to Visit the Presale Page!\nThe project follows a phased roadmap, starting with its Q3 2025 preparation stage, which includes the launch of its official site, whitepaper, audited smart contracts, and a playable web-based demo. Moreover, the Q4 2025 mainnet beta will integrate staking, player rankings, and the first global tournament, supported by a mobile alpha for broader accessibility.\nIn 2026, Tapzi plans to expand into NFT-based customization, developer SDK tools, multilingual support, and cross-chain deployments to reach over 100,000 daily active users.\nThe TAPZI token will serve as the utility asset for staking, tournament participation, NFT purchases, and potentially governance. Unlike many GameFi projects of earlier cycles, Tapzi removes reliance on inflationary rewards or luck-based mechanics, emphasizing fair play through on-chain verification and anti-bot systems.\nIn a market increasingly valuing infrastructure and real-world integration, Tapzi\u2019s model reflects the blueprint of scalable platforms that can organically grow alongside the broader bull run, making it a candidate worth monitoring for investors seeking exposure to gaming-focused blockchain assets.\n-\nJetBolt (JBOLT)\nJetBolt is a next-generation Layer-1 blockchain designed to address one of the most persistent challenges in Web3: speed without sacrificing security. Built with an optimized proof-of-stake consensus, JetBolt targets industries where latency is critical, such as high-frequency trading, Web3 gaming, and real-time payment networks.\nThe JBOLT token serves multiple purposes: covering transaction fees, enabling staking rewards, and granting governance participation. Its presale incorporates tiered incentives and staking bonuses to encourage early community engagement while ensuring network stability from launch.\nThe roadmap includes developer SDKs, enterprise API integrations, and interoperability bridges to major blockchain ecosystems. By delivering ultra-fast settlements, low costs, and scalable infrastructure, JetBolt positions itself as a foundational layer for applications requiring both performance and reliability.\nEarly backers have the advantage of entering at a stage where network adoption is poised to scale rapidly as demand for high-performance blockchain infrastructure accelerates in the following market cycle.\n-\nBest Wallet Token (BEST)\nBest Wallet Token underpins the Best Wallet ecosystem, an all-in-one digital asset management platform designed for security, accessibility, and cross-chain versatility.\nTailored to both retail and institutional needs, Best Wallet integrates features like multi-chain compatibility, cold storage support, NFT management, and direct access to DeFi protocols. Holding BEST unlocks premium benefits, including zero-fee token swaps, priority transaction routing, exclusive staking pools, and governance rights.\nThe presale structure rewards early participation, while the roadmap outlines the addition of fiat on/off ramps, enhanced NFT utilities, and cross-chain bridging to streamline user experiences. In a fragmented wallet market, Best Wallet differentiates itself by combining robust security standards with an intuitive design, ensuring seamless interaction across decentralized ecosystems.\nAs adoption of digital assets continues to grow globally, a secure and feature-rich wallet solution becomes increasingly critical; BEST plays an intrinsic role in bridging the gap between mainstream users and the evolving Web3 economy.\n-\nWall Street Pepe (WEPE)\nWall Street Pepe combines the viral reach of meme culture with real decentralized finance (DeFi) functionality to create a token ecosystem designed for both engagement and longevity.\nRather than relying solely on hype, WEPE integrates staking, yield farming, governance participation, and a themed NFT marketplace centered on Wall Street-inspired artwork. Its presale strategy prioritizes community building, offering early supporters exclusive NFT drops, governance privileges, and staking rewards.\nA planned decentralized exchange (DEX) will focus on curated meme-related trading pairs, encouraging liquidity and niche market participation.\nBy merging cultural relevance with tangible DeFi use cases, WEPE seeks to attract speculative traders as well as long-term holders who value a strong, active community. This dual approach positions the token to weather volatility and maintain sustained adoption beyond typical meme coin cycles.\nHence, it becomes an interesting presale candidate in a market where most meme assets lack functional depth.\n-\nQubetics (TICS)\nQubetics is an emerging blockchain platform merging quantum-inspired computing principles with advanced distributed ledger technology. Its core aim is to deliver massive computational throughput for industries requiring high-performance data processing, such as AI analytics, climate modeling, financial risk simulations, and large-scale scientific research.\nThe TICS token powers transaction settlements, staking, and governance within the ecosystem. With a limited supply and a presale stage designed to fund testnet deployment and enterprise pilot programs, Qubetics is positioning itself as a niche yet high-value player in decentralized infrastructure.\nIts architecture supports parallelized computations and secure data management, making it an appealing option for enterprise adoption. As blockchain expands beyond finance into computation-heavy fields, Qubetics\u2019 combination of speed, scalability, and advanced analytics capability could place it at the forefront of a new wave of utility-driven blockchain projects.\nAll these offer early backers exposure to a highly specialized but potentially transformative market segment.\nFinal Verdict On Best Presale To Invest In\nThe renewed alignment of institutional capital, regulatory clarity, and maturing blockchain applications has created a market environment that closely mirrors and in some respects surpasses the conditions of the 2020\u20132021 bull run.\nIn such cycles, early-stage projects often deliver the most substantial gains for investors willing to take calculated risks. Presales with clearly defined use cases, sustainable tokenomics, and realistic adoption strategies stand a greater chance of thriving once broader market momentum takes hold.\nLayer-1 speed solutions, all-in-one wallet platforms, DeFi-meets-culture hybrids, and quantum-inspired computation networks each present compelling opportunities.\nThe real differentiator in 2025 is the ability to align with long-term market trends rather than short-lived hype. This means focusing on projects that can scale, integrate with existing infrastructure, and attract a consistent user base across varying market conditions.\nIn this context, Tapzi exemplifies how a presale can position itself within a growth sector, skill-based blockchain gaming that benefits from both retail enthusiasm and institutional interest in digital entertainment infrastructure.\nIts emphasis on verifiable fair play, phased development, and multi-functional token utility reflects a structured approach that could sustain relevance well beyond the initial presale phase, aligning with the \u201c2021 Success Blueprint 2.0\u201d investment mindset. So, what stops you from diversifying your portfolio?\nDisclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.

Could a new player in the meme coin arena deliver sky-high returns in record time? Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is stepping into the spotlight, offering a unique combination of community engagement and high-potential presale stages.\nWhile Memecoin continues building hype with fresh updates and Official Trump gains traction through influencer campaigns, Arctic Pablo Coin is charging ahead with its presale now reaching unprecedented levels. If investors hesitate, they may miss an opportunity that could rival previous meme coin successes. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Memecoin, and Official Trump.\nReferral Incentives: Earn Rewards While Sharing Arctic Pablo Coin\nHave you ever imagined getting rewarded simply for spreading the word about a crypto project? Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is turning that concept into reality with its Referral Incentives Program.

The program not only boosts engagement but also provides early adopters with tangible benefits for their participation.\nHow much could one earn by joining early and actively promoting? The possibilities are exciting. This initiative encourages investors to become advocates, making the community stronger while offering a potential boost to their future ROI. With the presale advancing rapidly, participating in referral campaigns now could mean multiplying gains in the upcoming listing.

From Stage 36 to the listing price of $0.008, early investors can enjoy a 900% ROI, while analysts predict up to 12,400% gains if the coin reaches a projected price of $0.1. Those who joined earlier rounds are already looking at 5,233.33% ROI\u2014an astonishing return that few can ignore.\nConsider this: investing $1,500 now grants 1,875,000 APC tokens, which could grow to $15,000 upon listing at $0.008.

The coin has been leveraging social campaigns and high-profile mentions to build its investor base. Recent spikes in activity have shown that the coin is capturing interest from both political followers and speculative investors. It offers an intriguing mix of novelty, branding, and market engagement that continues to attract attention.\nFor investors keeping an eye on trending tokens, the Official Trump Coin presents an opportunity to ride the current momentum. Yet, with Arctic Pablo Coin\u2019s presale generating record-breaking excitement and massive ROI potential, delaying action could mean missing a chance to get in early on the next big meme coin.\nFinal Thoughts: Arctic Pablo Leads the Charge\nAcross the meme coin spectrum, Arctic Pablo Coin, Memecoin, and Official Trump demonstrate unique strengths. Arctic Pablo Coin, however, stands out with its Referral Incentives, presale ROI, and skyrocketing community buzz. While Memecoin maintains its social momentum and Official Trump Coin capitalizes on brand recognition, Arctic Pablo Coin\u2019s presale is delivering quantifiable potential returns that few tokens can match.

Competing blockchains like Solana and Ethereum continue to eat into Cardano\u2019s market relevance, making it more of a slow-burn play than a breakout contender.\nIn contrast, capital is flowing fast toward projects with clear catalysts and near-term milestones and right now, nothing fits that bill like Remittix.\nRemittix Captures Institutional Attention as Revolutionary Cross-Chain DeFi Project\nRemittix has already raised over $20M with 607M+ tokens sold at just $0.0944, proof that whales are betting on real-world adoption, not empty hype.\nThis cross-chain DeFi project is built to dominate the $19T payments industry by enabling crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries with transparent FX conversion.\nRemittix isn\u2019t selling promises years away, it\u2019s delivering solutions now.

The token has surged 440% over the past year, though it still trades about 15% lower than its all-time high of $3.65 from July.\nAnalyst Ali recently stated that XRP must reclaim the $3.30 zone to avoid a retracement to $2.60 or even $2.

Faraday Future expects staking yields and strategic asset growth to help finance product innovation, potential stock buybacks, and long-term shareholder value. Ian Calderon, co-creation officer and founding board member of the California Blockchain Working Group, stated the company sees the next decade as a promising era for digital assets.\nFaraday Future also plans to introduce a C10 Index, tracking the largest cryptocurrencies to guide treasury allocations, and is exploring the creation of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) to provide broader market exposure. The treasury strategy is part of a larger vision to integrate crypto into the company\u2019s overall business model, ensuring that digital assets are a sustainable part of Faraday Future\u2019s growth trajectory while enhancing liquidity and market positioning.\nEAI Vehicle Chain Bridges Cars And Crypto\nIn a move that directly links blockchain to its automotive operations, Faraday Future announced the EAI Vehicle Chain. This platform will enable tokenized car sales and allow deposits in cryptocurrencies, leveraging artificial intelligence embedded in vehicles.\nCalifornia State Treasurer Fiona Ma praised the plan, noting it could attract investment, generate jobs, and support sustainable development. The initiative comes as Faraday Future works to recover from past challenges, including delayed production of its flagship FF91 EV and regulatory scrutiny from the SEC. Despite these hurdles, the company\u2019s shares remain up 75% over the past six months.\nFaraday Future\u2019s crypto strategy mirrors a broader trend among public companies embracing digital assets. Recent moves by firms such as H100 Group and Thumzup Media Corporation show growing confidence in crypto as a complement to traditional business operations. By combining AI mobility with blockchain finance, Faraday Future aims to create a dual ecosystem that supports innovation while offering potential high-growth returns. The company believes that linking its automotive technology with digital finance could set a precedent for future mobility solutions and attract a new wave of tech-savvy investors.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:47:20 +0000", "author": "federico", "source": "https://crypto-economy.com/feed/", "tag": "coin_news"}, {"domain": "crypto-economy.com", "title": "BNB Price Prediction: Could $OZ Overtake Top 10 Coins with 400x Surge?", "url": "https://crypto-economy.com/bnb-price-prediction-could-oz-overtake-top-10-coins-with-400x-surge/", "text": "The crypto space is comparing Binance Coin (BNB) to newbies like Ozak AI ($OZ). Experts anticipate that BNB will be stable by 2025 and will provide average performance to investors. The presale of Ozak AI provides the prospects of exponential growth potential with the projections of 400x. If that happens, $OZ could be in the top 10 digital assets by market cap.\nBNB\u2019s 2025 Outlook Shows Moderate Growth\nMarket predictions have BNB averaging $619 in 2025 with highs of $676 and lows of $574. Monthly ROI ranges from 18% to 25% depending on the market. August is expected to be the best month, and October is the worst.\nAs a utility token for the Binance exchange, BNB is stable. It will continue to support trading, transaction fees and decentralized applications. Analysts say while these fundamentals keep BNB in the top 10, they also limit its growth compared to newer tokens with more upside.\nThis makes BNB a good option for conservative investors. But those looking for higher gains are looking beyond the steady climb of established assets and looking at newer projects with bigger potential.\nOzak AI: Positioned for 400x Returns\nOzak AI is entering the market with a platform designed to merge artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. The project provides real time predictive analytics of financial markets based on a cluster of linked together systems:\n- Ozak Stream Network (OSN): enables rapid, low-latency data processing.\n- DePIN infrastructure: secures data across decentralized networks.\n- Ozak Data Vaults: provide safe and reliable storage.\n- Prediction Agents (PAs): customizable AI tools that are usable even without technical expertise.\nSuch features enable quicker and more informed decisions by retail traders and institutional investors. The disadvantage of using central systems is an advantage to Ozak AI due to its decentralized nature; the more its usage grows, the more secure and scalable it can become.\n$OZ Token Economics and Presale Momentum\nThe Ozak AI ecosystem is supported by the OZ token. It is applied to transactions on the platform, Prediction Agent customization, governance, and rewarding the users. Demand will grow as the ecosystem expands.\nThe $OZ token presale is showing this momentum in Phase 4, with the tokens priced at $0.005, with over 150 million sold and $1.95 million raised. The next stage, 5, will lead to doubling the price to $0.01, and the long-term goal is $1. You need to contribute a minimum of $100 to participate, using ETH, USDT, or USDC.\nThe supply is 10 billion, and the token supply is presale (30%), ecosystem (30%), reserves (20%), listings (10%), and team (10%). If OZ hits a value of $1, it will give an early investor a 400x gain, and it might become one of the top 10 in market cap.\nConclusion\nBNB is looking good, with steady gains into 2025. Ozak AI is a new growth story around AI driven analytics and blockchain scalability. With a live presale, strong token demand, and 400x potential, $OZ could really challenge top coins. Investors are weighing BNB\u2019s stability against Ozak AI\u2019s explosive growth as the market evolves.\nFor more information about Ozak AI, visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

But, as the market matures and new opportunities arise, BlockchainFX is swiftly taking the spotlight as the top crypto presale of 2025. With Bitcoin Hyper\u2019s and Little Pepe\u2019s hype starting to settle, BlockchainFX\u2019s innovative platform and 30% bonus offer are putting it ahead of the pack.\nIf you\u2019re looking to secure maximum returns, BlockchainFX offers an explosive investment opportunity you simply can\u2019t ignore. Let\u2019s explore why BlockchainFX is the best crypto presale choice for savvy investors, leaving Bitcoin Hyper and Little Pepe in the rearview mirror.\nBlockchainFX \u2013 The Top Crypto Presale with a 30% Bonus\nCurrent Price (Presale): $0.019 | Launch Price: $0.05\nBonus Offer: Get 30% more BFX tokens with the code BLOCK30\u2014limited time only.\nBlockchainFX is redefining the future of trading with its all-in-one crypto super app. The platform is designed to unite the world of crypto, stocks, forex, ETFs, commodities, and bonds into one seamless, unified experience. Here\u2019s why BlockchainFX is the best crypto presale to invest in right now:\nWhy BlockchainFX Is the Clear Winner:\n- Explosive Growth Potential: At a presale price of just $0.019, BlockchainFX is poised to soar to $1 or more in the next few years. The presale has already raised over $5.5M, and with its massive market opportunity, early investors stand to see 1000x returns as the platform grows. This is the next Binance, and getting in early is a rare chance to secure life-changing profits.\n- 30% Bonus for Early Investors: BlockchainFX is offering a 30% bonus to early presale investors using the BLOCK30 code. This limited-time offer allows you to maximize your returns from the moment you invest. It\u2019s an opportunity to grab more tokens at the ground price, setting you up for even greater gains as the platform gains traction.\n- Revolutionary Platform: BlockchainFX is more than just a trading platform; it\u2019s a game-changer. With its seamless integration of 500+ assets and features like staking rewards and a BFX Visa Card, BlockchainFX is creating an ecosystem that will serve as the bridge between crypto and traditional finance.\n- Passive Income Opportunities: One of the standout features of BlockchainFX is its staking rewards, which can reach up to $25,000 USDT for investors. This creates a passive income stream, meaning you not only earn from token appreciation but also from daily staking rewards in BFX and USDT.\nWhat Makes BlockchainFX Different from Bitcoin Hyper and Little Pepe?\n| Feature | BlockchainFX | Bitcoin Hyper | Little Pepe |\n| Price (Presale) | $0.019 | $0.01 | $0.0020 |\n| Core Focus | All-in-one crypto super app | Bitcoin scalability | Meme coin with no utility |\n| Market Opportunity | Massive \u2013 Crypto & traditional finance | Limited \u2013 Bitcoin market | Niche \u2013 Meme coin hype |\n| Growth Potential | 1000x+ | 50x\u2013100x | 10x\u201350x |\n| Staking Rewards | Up to $25,000 USDT | None | None |\n| Unique Selling Proposition | Unified trading experience | Faster Bitcoin transactions | Meme coin for short-term gains |\n| Bonus Offer | 30% more tokens with code BLOCK30 | None | None |\nBitcoin Hyper and Little Pepe: The Hype Is Fading\nBoth Bitcoin Hyper and Little Pepe gained significant attention due to their initial momentum, but as the hype begins to die down, it\u2019s becoming clear that neither has the long-term sustainability that BlockchainFX offers.\nBitcoin Hyper was designed to improve Bitcoin\u2019s scalability issues, providing faster transactions and lower fees. However, its focus on just one aspect of the market limits its potential. Although it has generated some excitement, Bitcoin Hyper\u2019s growth is starting to plateau as the market looks for more comprehensive solutions.\nLittle Pepe, a meme coin inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme, has capitalized on the meme coin craze but lacks real utility or long-term value. While it gained some traction, Little Pepe doesn\u2019t offer the same scalability or use case as more robust projects like BlockchainFX.\nAs the hype around these projects starts to subside, BlockchainFX emerges as the new leader, offering something far more substantial, a revolutionary crypto platform with a clear path to exponential growth.\nExplosive Presale and Long-Term Growth\nWhile Bitcoin Hyper and Little Pepe may have gained attention initially, their limited scope and lack of sustainable utility are becoming more apparent. In contrast, BlockchainFX has a clear path to market dominance, with its revolutionary trading platform and diverse investment opportunities.\nThe opportunity to invest in BlockchainFX at such a low price and with the added benefit of a 30% bonus makes it a no-brainer for anyone looking to maximize ROI in 2025.\nGet In Before the Price Increases\nBlockchainFX\u2019s presale is already raising millions and quickly gaining momentum. As the presale price increases and the platform moves closer to launch, the opportunity to secure 500x\u20131000x returns is slipping away. Don\u2019t miss your chance to invest before the price skyrockets.\n30% Bonus: Use the code BLOCK30 to get 30% more BFX tokens during the presale. This is a limited-time offer, don\u2019t let this opportunity pass you by!\nBlockchainFX is the Best Choice for 2025\nAs Bitcoin Hyper\u2019s and Little Pepe\u2019s hype starts to fade, BlockchainFX is surging ahead as the top crypto presale of 2025. With its all-in-one trading platform, massive growth potential, and 30% bonus offer, BlockchainFX is offering a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity.\nAct fast! Visit BlockchainFX today, claim your 30% bonus, and be part of the next crypto revolution.\nFind Out More on:\nWebsite: https://blockchainfx.com/\nX: https://x.com/BlockchainFXcom\nTelegram Chat: https://t.me/blockchainfx_chat\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

Although Solana has been a favorite among retail traders, analysts indicate that this recent upsurge can be the beginning of a new liquidity rotation, with Solana Price supported by strong momentum and SOL trading volume sitting around $3.67 billion in the past 24 hours.\nWith AI-based crypto initiatives gaining more traction, investors want alternatives like Unilabs Finance (UNIL) that can provide growth as well as real-world utility.\nSolana Price Outlook 2025: Can Momentum Hold as Trading Volume Drops?\nAs at the time of writing, Solana Price is $192.44, up 6.92% in the last 24 hours. Its market cap stands at $103.94 billion, with SOL Trading Volume reducing to $3.67 billion, a decrease of 47.62%.\nThis increasing Solana Price but declining SOL Trading Volume momentum indicates that traders may be setting themselves up to diversify their investments into new growth opportunities.\nSource: TradingView\nSolana remains among the fastest and most scalable blockchains, with support for memecoins, NFT drops, and DeFi platforms. Its stability has earned it the position of being among the top-five cryptocurrencies.\nDue to declining SOL Trading Volume on exchanges, analysts anticipate some capital to pour into higher short-term potential upside projects in the near future, especially those with an association with artificial intelligence.\nWhy Unilabs Is the AI Play Analysts Are Watching\nUnilabs Finance (UNIL) is becoming one of the most powerful presales of 2025. The project has already crossed $13.45 million, where more than 1.9 billion tokens are being sold at $0.0097 in Stage 6, along with 95.5% of the round sold out.\nInvestors are not only seeing the high rate of sellout, but also the very tangible financial underpinnings of the platform, independent of speculative presales.\nWhy Unilabs Stands Out:\n- $30M Assets Under Management (AUM) in Q2 2025 \u2013 actual capital traction pre-listing\n- Four AI-Guided Funds (BTC Fund, RWA Fund, AI Fund, Mining Fund) for diversified portfolios\n- Real-time NAV tracking so owners can view the precise value of their holding\n- Staking rewards with variable ROI, mirroring passive income and liquidity appreciation\n- Referral system encouraging onboarding and education\nThese characteristics describe how Unilabs is being hailed as a \u201cDeFi + TradFi bridge\u201d that is providing hedge fund level strategies directly to retail traders.\nUnilabs\u2019 AI-Driven Competitive Edge Over Competing Presales\nUnilabs is separating itself from the crowded presale arena by creating a model that combines the best of crypto-native innovation and institutional-grade fund sensibility. Where other tokens come to market with nothing but a tale, Unilabs employs multi-strategy AI deployment, screening both conventional and digital markets for mispriced positions in real-time.\nUnlike presales that rely on a single narrative, whether RWAs or DeFi, Unilabs\u2019 system integrates all of them, reducing concentration risk and expanding exposure to top market trends\nThis gives Unilabs an edge over standard presales. Instead of relying on hype, it operates like an AI-driven asset manager, providing retail access to strategies that otherwise live behind hedge fund fences.\nAnalogies to AI protocols such as Render ($RNDR) are well-earned. Render has a $2B market cap but Unilabs takes it to the next level with yield-backed tokens, live tracking of NAV, and a $30M AUM base already in existence.\nGovernance attributes, staking rewards, and regular airdrops also enhance its long-term value, thus becoming attractive for speculation and institutional investors. With the listing price expected at $0.05, investors see a 415% upside. The extra 40% presale bonus (code UNIL40) is fueling even more early interest at lower entry prices.\nYour Window of Opportunity Is Now with Unilabs\nThe latest $22 million Binance inflow highlighted the Solana Price, and its ongoing credibility, and hinted at the fact that traders must be aware of where the next liquidity will flow. With SOL trading volume hovering around $3.67 billion in the past 24 hours, AI-powered platforms like Unilabs are capturing that notice, with backing from both quick-selling presale numbers and real fund returns.\nFor those following the Solana Price and SOL Trading Volume, the smartest thing to do may not be to chase today\u2019s rebound, but join in early on AI-backed projects like Unilabs Finance, before it makes its first exchange listings.\nDiscover the Unilabs Finance (UNIL) presale:\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

While most blockchains compete purely on transaction speed and ecosystem size, Coldware\u2019s model fuses blockchain infrastructure with physical mobile devices, creating a self-contained gateway into Web3. This hardware-first approach could give it a competitive edge over Near Protocol (NEAR) and Cardano (ADA), especially in onboarding mainstream users who have yet to interact with crypto wallets or decentralized apps.\nColdware (COLD): The Hardware Layer 1 That Bypasses Adoption Barriers\nAt its core, Coldware (COLD) is a Layer-1 blockchain, but it\u2019s packaged in a way that breaks through the complexity that keeps average users away from Web3. Every Coldware mobile device comes with native blockchain wallet functionality, dApp access, and built-in SocialFi tools. This means the user doesn\u2019t need to download extensions, manage multiple accounts, or navigate confusing interfaces \u2014 they simply use their phone. The hardware acts as a Trojan horse for adoption, seamlessly integrating blockchain into day-to-day activity. Investors are eyeing COLD\u2019s presale because it\u2019s rare for a Layer-1 to have such a defensible moat at launch, especially one tied to consumer electronics.\nNear Protocol (NEAR): Smart Infrastructure for Intelligent dApps\nNear Protocol has positioned itself as an AI-friendly blockchain, offering a developer toolkit designed to build intelligent, adaptive decentralized applications. Its current chart shows a potential breakout, with technical indicators suggesting it could push toward $3.63 if bullish momentum continues. NEAR\u2019s strategy is to become the default AI execution layer in Web3, making it highly attractive to projects seeking scalable infrastructure for machine learning-powered dApps. While it lacks Coldware\u2019s direct consumer hardware integration, NEAR\u2019s emphasis on advanced computation could make it the go-to chain for AI-driven ecosystems.\nCardano (ADA): The Methodical Heavyweight\nCardano remains one of the most methodically developed Layer-1s in the market. With a strong emphasis on peer-reviewed updates and long-term governance stability, ADA\u2019s upcoming Hydra scaling and Midnight privacy features could push it past the $1.50 mark if adoption follows. Cardano\u2019s slow-and-steady approach appeals to institutional and compliance-focused markets, giving it a different but still critical role in pushing the crypto market forward. While it may not match Coldware\u2019s explosive adoption potential or NEAR\u2019s AI-specific positioning, Cardano\u2019s resilience has been proven over multiple market cycles.\nDriving the Market Forward\nAll three projects target different growth levers. Coldware (COLD) is betting on hardware-driven mass adoption, giving it the ability to onboard users in ways traditional Layer-1s cannot. Near Protocol (NEAR) is focusing on high-compute, AI-integrated applications, aiming to dominate a niche that could become a core Web3 market segment. Cardano (ADA) continues to refine and scale its ecosystem with an emphasis on long-term reliability and governance.\nConclusion\nIf the next crypto bull run is driven by new user onboarding, Coldware (COLD) could lead the charge thanks to its unique fusion of blockchain and consumer devices. If AI-powered dApps take center stage, Near Protocol (NEAR) could ride that wave. And if the market pivots toward regulation-ready, stable ecosystems, Cardano (ADA) will remain a cornerstone. In reality, the future of Layer-1 leadership may involve all three \u2014 but Coldware\u2019s disruptive entry could make it the most transformative of the group.\nFor more information on the Coldware (COLD) Presale:\nVisit Coldware (COLD)\nJoin and become a community member:\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

It boasts a market cap of $10.87 billion, with its 24-hour trading volume falling just under 49% at $198.06 million.

It also reached its first CEX listing on BitMart, providing easier liquidity and access for the first users.\nYet another key highlight of the project is launching the Remittix wallet in Q3 beta, allowing for instant transfers of crypto-to-fiat with 40+ cryptos support and 30+ fiat support.\nThe wallet is set for global adoption with real-time FX conversion and low-cost gas fee crypto transactions, bridging the gap between decentralized exchange functionality and traditional banking.\nWhy Remittix Is Gaining Traction\n- $20 million + raised with strong presale momentum\n- $250,000 Remittix Giveaway drawing community development\n- Wallet release this quarter driving utility adoption\nAmong the best crypto presales 2025, Remittix is a new altcoin to keep in mind because it\u2019s directly aiming for the $19 trillion global payments market. By offering a cross-chain DeFi project with tangible real-world utility, RTX is positioning itself as a crypto solving real-world problems rather than a speculative meme coin.\nAs hype increases in expectation of its exchange listings, presale bonuses, and wallet launch, Remittix is positioning itself to be one of the upcoming major altcoins 2025 investors are keeping a close eye on.\nDiscover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here:\nWebsite: https://remittix.io/\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/remittix\n$250,000 Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

In August, investors are carefully weighing Layer Brett (LBRETT), Solana, Cardano, and Chainlink prices as the next leg of the bull run takes shape.\nWhile blue-chip assets have proven staying power, the spotlight is now shifting to new projects showcasing exponential growth potential. Here\u2019s why analysts tout LBRETT as the undeniable frontrunner likely to rewrite the rules of digital wealth with a 150x upside!\nLayer Brett holds the breakout force of 2025\nWhile assets like SOL, ADA, and LINK are defined by size and history, LBRETT is thriving on utility, scarcity, culture, and innovation. Its appeal rests on five defining features, blending meme virality with substance.\nFirst, speed. By integrating Solana-like scalability, Layer Brett supports high throughput at negligible fees, making it ideal for microtransactions and high-frequency DeFi use.\nSecond, security. Built as a layer 2 solution anchored in Ethereum-grade reliability, Brett ensures users enjoy trustless, battle-tested safety for their assets.\nThird, staking rewards. Brett\u2019s ecosystem provides outsized returns, attracting investors hungry for yield in a tightening DeFi landscape. Stakers earn up to 40,000% APY.\nFourth, culture. Brett injects meme-coin virality into a serious infrastructure project, fusing community-driven hype with credible long-term utility. That\u2019s a rare combination!.\nFifth, integration roadmap. From NFTs to cross-chain DeFi applications, Brett\u2019s pipeline ensures the token remains relevant and deeply embedded across Web3 sectors.\nTogether, these elements give Brett a unique edge. While Solana and Cardano climb steadily, and the Chainlink price continues its strong rally, LBRETT offers the exponential 100x upside investors crave.\nSolana: Fast but with waning momentum\nSolana (SOL) has been trading upwards lately, rising to retest the $190 zone. Its ecosystem has become a hotbed of meme coin activity, DeFi, gaming, and NFTs, with institutional adoption gaining traction.\nHowever, Solana\u2019s $100 billion market cap thwarts quick, large price moves, leaving analysts forecasting slow growth for Solana in the foreseeable future. While Solana remains a high-performance network, investors are increasingly viewing it as a maturing blue chip rather than a faster horse.\nCardano is fighting for a breakout\nCardano (ADA) continues to prove its value in sustainable blockchain solutions, governance, and scalability research. With a 180% year-to-date rally, ADA has momentum but struggles to maintain levels above $1.\nDespite developments in smart contracts and sidechain integrations, sentiment remains mixed, and ADA risks stalling below key breakout zones. Investor frustration has been growing as sellers dump at every breakout attempt.\nCardano\u2019s roadblock now lies in the $1-$1.30 range. If cleared, it could open the way to $1.50 if buyers overpower relentless profit-taking.\nChainlink price surges\nThe Chainlink price (LINK) has been a standout performer in 2025. From lows of $11, LINK has more than doubled, currently hovering in the $24 zone, marking a 140% year-to-date surge.\nThe network\u2019s oracles remain critical for powering DeFi, ensuring secure off-chain data feeds. Yet caution lingers. Traders may look to take profits near the $30 resistance, its recent high.\nAnalysts predict LINK could push toward $32 in the near term, with long-term upside if adoption continues. While the LINK rally is exciting, stepping in near recent highs might result in losses if traders decide to take profit.\nLBRETT is the star of the show\nSolana races, Cardano builds, and Chainlink price impresses\u2014but none match the disruptive force of Layer Brett. By merging speed, security, staking rewards, culture, and integration, Brett redefines what a breakout coin looks like in 2025.\nInvestors seeking exponential returns should visit the Layer Brett presale, where the digital gold rush is currently heading.\nBuy Layer Brett today, stake your $LBRETT, and get ready for explosive gains.\n- Website: https://layerbrett.com\n- Telegram: https://t.me/layerbrett\n- X: (1) Layer Brett (@LayerBrett) / X\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.
