A No 10 spokesperson said afterwards: “The leaders agreed tackling the threat of irregular migration and small boat crossings is a shared priority that requires shared solutions.”\nStarmer has prioritised signing a “one-in, one-out” deal which would have led to Britain accepting asylum seekers who could show a family connection to the UK, but returning those who could not.\nThe French newspaper Le Monde reported on Wednesday that an initial pilot scheme would mean Britain would send back only 2,600 people a year – about 6% of the total number of crossings. But British officials hope they can increase those numbers after any pilot scheme ends.\nWith negotiations going on into Wednesday evening, aides on both sides said there remained significant areas of disagreement, one of which is money.\nThe UK signed a £480m deal two years ago to pay for additional border patrols and surveillance equipment such as drones and night-vision binoculars. Since then the French have agreed to intercept boats in the sea which are up to 300 metres from their shore, and are now asking for extra funding to pay for police officers, boats and drones to enforce that policy.\nFrance has been looking for money to expand its Compagnie de Marche, a specialist unit of officers which operates on beaches to tackle the people-smuggling trade and intercept crossings.\nOther obstacles to the deal include opposition from the southern European countries of Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Malta and Spain, all of which have experienced high levels of irregular migration.\nThis so-called Med 5 group is concerned that asylum seekers who are sent back from the UK to France could then decide to travel back through Europe to their countries.\nStarmer, meanwhile, has sought to assuage Macron’s concerns about the UK’s hidden economy, which the French president believes acts as a “pull factor”, encouraging migrants to cross the Channel and find illegal work.\nThe PM has announced a number of policies to tackle illegal work, including more immigration enforcement raids. One government aide said: “If the French were asking us to do more illegal working raids, we would be fine with that.”\nA No 10 spokesperson said Starmer had used Wednesday’s meeting to stress the action the UK is taking on this front.\n“[He] spoke of his government’s toughening of the system in the past year to ensure rules are respected and enforced, including a massive surge in illegal working arrests to end the false promise of jobs that are used to sell spaces on boats,” the person said.\nOne final concern on the French side, diplomats said, is that their policy of stopping boats 300 metres away from shore may be susceptible to challenge in their domestic courts.\nUK sources said on Wednesday the deal was still a possibility, although some European officials were pessimistic about the chances of it being agreed during this visit.\nOne French diplomatic source described the idea as “a hostage to fortune”, saying the UK had made few guarantees about how many people they would take and that agreement with the wider EU looked as remote as ever.\nBritain and France also said on Wednesday they would be willing to mount a joint nuclear response to an extreme military threat – possibly from countries such as Russia and China – and that “any adversary threatening the vital interests of Britain or France” could be confronted by the “nuclear forces of both nations”.\nThe joint nuclear declaration, a first, forms part of a deepened Lancaster House defence cooperation agreement announced between the two countries, which also sees the two place orders for more Storm Shadow missiles, and begin work on a next generation anti-ship missile together.\nThe UK described the new agreement as an “entente industrielle” and said it would support more than 300 jobs at the Stevenage production line where Storm Shadow missiles are made by Anglo-French manufacturer MBDA. The number of new missiles being ordered was not made clear.", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 22:07:38 GMT", "author": "Kiran Stacey and Dan Sabbagh in London, and Jon Henley in Paris", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}

Where it is, the cause is not just cosmetic, it is economic. Policies relating to shopfronts, rents or parking miss the bigger picture.\n“City centres that struggle are oversupplied with shops and undersupplied with people. If local residents don’t have money to spend or a reason to be in the centre, high streets suffer – no matter what interventions are made.”\nIn more affluent areas, for example, high streets have been able to shift towards dining and drinking and other leisure activities as a portion of traditional shopping activity has shifted online, because residents have spare cash to spend on non-essentials.\nIn poorer areas where fewer people live in the city centre, the lack of spending power means this shift has not happened and funding is needed to bring people back.\n“A struggling high street is the outcome of a struggling [local] economy, not the other way round,” the report said.\nIn more affluent York, London and Edinburgh, about £1 in every £4 is spent on dining out and relatively few stores are empty – just over 9%. In London, the vacancy rate was 7.4%. However in Bradford, Stoke and Wigan – which are among the locations with the highest vacancy rates – it is about £1 in every £10 and vacancy rates are more than 16%.\nThe spending power of a local population is not just measured by high-paying jobs but also the number of people in a catchment compared with the size of a high street.\nStruggling Newport, Blackpool and Sunderland also have a relatively high proportion of shops for the population compared with successful city centres such as Oxford, Brighton or Liverpool.\nWhile York has a relatively high proportion of shops for its population, it also enjoys a strong tourist trade, something which not all cities will be able to develop.\nThe report also found that some locations – such as around Swindon and Slough – had a strong local economy, but shops struggled as consumers predominantly worked at out of town business parks.\nThe British Retail Consortium, which represents most large retailers, said: “City centres need a mix of businesses uses including shopping and hospitality, that make a city a place that people want to be.\n“However, investment in city centres continues to be held back by outdated business rates system which limits the ability to invest in shops and jobs which are vital for the everyday economy.”", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 23:01:03 GMT", "author": "Sarah Butler", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}

This would “quickly break the business model of the smugglers and initial numbers, even if large, would subside”, he argued in a memo.\nLabour officials say one reason they have been able to make further progress is because they have dropped the controversial Rwanda scheme. They also cite the relationship between Macron and Starmer as another reason and the government’s action to tackle illegal working.\nBritain has also been willing to help fund police on the northern coast of France, signing a £480m deal two years ago to pay for additional border patrols and surveillance equipment such as drones and night-vision binoculars.\nBut with hours to go until the two leaders were due to make the announcement, negotiators were still arguing over how much the UK would pay to set up the new system, when it would start and what scale it would reach.\nThe French have recently agreed to intercept boats in the sea which are up to 300 metres from their shore, and are now asking for extra funding to pay for police officers, boats and drones to enforce that policy.\nParis is also understood to be concerned about the possibility of a legal challenge in the French courts against that policy, which officials worry could prove successful.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 06:47:53 GMT", "author": "Kiran Stacey Political  correspondent", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}

Analysis of Labour’s proposal by environmental economists from the consultancy Eftec, suggests 97% of planning approvals – 76,800 out of 79,300 every year – would be exempt from the requirement to replace destroyed nature.\nThis would mean an area of more than 215,000 hectares, the size of the Yorkshire Dales, could be built on over the next decade with no requirement to compensate for any nature destroyed.\nThe biodiversity net gain rules were brought in to help tackle major nature loss. The UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world, and the government has signed a pledge to protect 30% of land and sea for nature by 2030.\nBiodiversity net gain, which requires developers to ensure a 10% increase in biodiversity, came into effect for major developments in February 2024 and for small sites two months later. The report says plans to scrap the rules for small developers – who dominate planning in England – would render the scheme utterly ineffective.\n“Biodiversity net gain is a hugely important principle: industries that harm nature should contribute to its recovery,” said Richard Benwell, of Wildlife and Countryside Link, which commissioned the research with the Lifescape Project. “The proposal to drastically widen the number of exempt small sites from the system would be a return to the bad old days of damaging development, and torpedo confidence in private investment in nature recovery.”\nBiodiversity net gain was supposed to apply to most planning applications but the research found 86% (69,500 out of 80,400) of planning applications approved between March 2024 and February 2025 claimed exemptions, in what the researchers believe could be widespread abuses by developers.\nBiodiversity net gain is not required for sites smaller than 25 sq metres, or those that do not affect protected habitats. But developers are able to “self declare” to claim these exemptions.\nEconomists found a rise in claims for these “de minimis” exemptions, after the rules came into force last year. “The scale of misuse across different sizes of planning applications suggests the de minimis exemption may be being intentionally misinterpreted,” the report said.\nJoan Edwards, the director of policy and public affairs at the Wildlife Trusts, said the government wanted private investment to help it meet its binding nature recovery targets by 2030, but changing the system could destroy the biodiversity market.\n“Scrapping biodiversity net gain for small sites would be a spectacular own goal,” she said. “Nothing undermines private-sector confidence more than a government that chops and changes the rules on a whim.”\nThe economists suggest Labour should tweak its changes to improve efficiency. It suggests excluding only sites of up to 0.1 hectares that align with the government’s proposed new definition of “very small sites”. This would also remove the loophole that allows some very large sites to sidestep BNG entirely by claiming de minimis exemption.\nThousands of individuals and organisations have responded to the government consultation, which ends on 24 July.\nRobert Oates, the chief executive and founder of the ecological consultancy Arbtech, said the government’s proposal “threatens both its goals: supporting nature recovery and accelerating housebuilding”.\n“Small site biodiversity net gain has only been in place for 13 months, yet developers and businesses have spent years preparing for it. U-turns like this create damaging instability. Developers need certainty, not another policy rewrite.”\nA government spokesperson said: “This government is fully committed to biodiversity net gain and this consultation explores easier, quicker and cheaper routes to deliver gains for both developers and nature. We are also consulting on how biodiversity net gain should be applied to nationally significant infrastructure projects to provide a clear framework that ensures major new developments deliver for nature and contribute to our legally binding targets.”", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 10:44:21 GMT", "author": "Sandra Laville", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}

{"title": "By learning to wield political power, Greens could fill the void at the heart of British politics | Adam Ramsay", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/10/green-party-leadership-contest-political-power-realist-fundamentalist", "text": "The Green party leadership election – by far the highest-profile in the party’s history – has largely been seen through the traditional lens of left and centre. On the one hand is Zack Polanski, the deputy leader and London assembly member whose insurgent campaign has attracted a surge of former Corbynites to the party. He’s seen as the left candidate. The incumbent, Adrian Ramsay (no relation to me), and his new running-mate, Ellie Chowns – both rural MPs – have been described as eco-centrists.\nWhile there is some truth to that, it’s not quite so simple: after all, Ramsay and Chowns, like Polanski, have called for a wealth tax and renationalisations, and have denounced Israeli genocide in Gaza. This is hardly Starmerite centrism. To think about the real distinction, it might be an idea to go to Lancaster in 2007.\nAt the time, the party was holding a tense annual conference that was split between two currents whose differences help make sense of what’s happening today. I was one of the “realos” (realists). We wore suits, hoping any passing journalist would take us seriously. The other side were known as the “fundis” (fundamentalists), and they seemed to have exaggerated their hippy garb. I remember two people in druid gowns – perhaps because of genuine pagan beliefs, but probably also because they were trolling us.\nThe realo v fundi terminology originated in disputes within the German Greens in the 1980s over whether to enter coalition governments. In the party in England and Wales, the stakes were lower: in 2007, we were holding a referendum on whether the party should have a leader, replacing the then system of having two “principal speakers”.\nFor realos, this change was a statement of intent: it was about becoming serious. For fundis, there was, as the realo Natalie Bennett, who joined in 2006, put it to me, “a great deal of concern that this would be a major change in the culture of the party”. We won the referendum, but the leadership role it produced is highly limited. The leader gets the title, a desk, a salary if they don’t have one, press office time and one vote on the party executive. They can advocate, but can’t change policy, choose spokespeople or direct strategy. And they’re easily replaced: elections are every two years.\nMany older Greens remain queasy at the idea of a leader – certainly a “strong” leader. Both this queasiness and the limited power have shaped the party ever since, and meant that leadership contests have tended to focus on organisation-building strategy or presentational emphasis and style, not policy. In the first one, in 2008, the realo MEP Caroline Lucas and permanently besuited 26-year-old Norwich councillor Adrian Ramsay were elected leader and deputy virtually unopposed; they advocated that resources be focused on the two target constituencies in which they were the candidates – leading to Lucas becoming the first Green MP in 2010.\nAfterwards, though, she was busy in Westminster, unable to tour the country building the party on the back of this progress and, despite the thriving anti-austerity movement, in which many of us were active, party membership stagnated.\nOur generation of (then) Young Greens developed a broadly shared understanding that the party was held back by two main things: the perception that we were just about the environment (rather than a party for the millions of leftwing voters abandoned by New Labour); and a fear of conflict. I had a mantra: “Greens can either be controversial, or ignored. Too often, the party chooses the latter.”\nIn 2012, Lucas and Ramsay stood down, and Bennett won the election – largely because she presented a serious plan for membership growth. She toured the country and cheerfully adopted leftist language. In her first leader’s speech, she said: “Ask not what the trade unions can do for us. Ask what we can do for the trade unions.” By 2014, membership had more than doubled to almost 28,000. In 2015, it surged past 60,000 … until Jeremy Corbyn ran for Labour leader, and thousands left to join that project instead.\nMany, though, didn’t leave, and the legacy of that membership surge remained, both in party income and in hundreds of activists getting themselves elected as councillors (a phenomenon the MP and 2018-2021 co-leader Siân Berry describes to me as “Natalie’s legacy”). Since the end of Corbynism, space has opened up again on the left, and this, combined with effective mobilisation of resources, led to hundreds more Green councillors and four MPs in 2024.\nBut the last year has felt stagnant. With Starmer lurching right, there’s an obvious space in British politics that the Greens are struggling to take. The average score in the past 10 polls for a Westminster election – about 11% – is better than ever. But sluggish compared with Reform UK.\nIn April, Adrian Ramsay was asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme whether he agreed with the party’s policy that “trans men are men, and trans women are women”, and failed to answer five times – triggering condemnation from the Young Greens. Two weeks later, his co-leader, Carla Denyer, announced that she wouldn’t seek re-election and, in May, Polanski launched an energetic campaign with the slogan “We need bold leadership. Now.”\nRamsay and Chowns’ campaign is, instead, focused on their parliamentary roles – being “in the room where it happens”. This seems to me a mistake: historically, Greens have thrived when the leader isn’t stuck in Westminster. For some longstanding members, Corbynites joining to “back Zack” is scary. Some fear Polanski’s mooted ecopopulism, worrying it will attract people who “aren’t really Green”. Much of this fear isn’t about policy difference, but culture. Older fundi-types who liked Corbyn’s socialism but feared that the movement behind his leadership was a “cult of personality” now have similar worries about Polanski. Chowns and Ramsay, on the other hand, exude the kind of gentle, conflict-averse, consensual leadership style that the fundis used to advocate (sitting uncomfortably with their hyper-realo insistence on the centrality of Westminster). In other words, the Green party division isn’t really so much about left and centre as it is about differing ideas about political power and how to wield it.\nFor me, Polanski takes the realo acceptance of the need for charismatic leadership and blends it with the fundis’ belief in extraparliamentary organising and social movements. His position – that the party should be bolder in articulating its positions, that it shouldn’t be embarrassed by opinions that the Daily Mail considers scandalous (but are shared with much of the population), that it should lead the left – isn’t a new, un-Green one. It’s one that our generation of members has been making for two decades. Indeed, it was the approach that delivered the vast membership surge in 2013-2015, which made the subsequent electoral successes possible. And it’s the approach that will be needed to stop the recent membership surge directing their energies to Zarah Sultana’s new project.\nBritish politics is in a moment of flux. The two-party system is clearly breaking down. Huge numbers of people fundamentally distrust our whole system, and large numbers of seats, particularly left-leaning urban constituencies, are actively looking for a proudly progressive alternative to Labour. Polanski’s bolder platform offers Greens a chance to step up. I hope the party takes it.\n-\nAdam Ramsay is a journalist and Green party member.

There are democracies where jury trial is rarer still. That is relevant context for the recommendation, published on Wednesday in an independent review of the criminal courts, that more cases be heard by magistrates. There are also good reasons why the right to be judged by one’s peers is deemed a foundational principle of justice and an insurance against prejudice and capricious power. This, too, is relevant context.\nSir Brian Leveson, a former judge, recognises the sensitivity around any restriction on jury trial. But he weighs it against “the real risk of total system collapse in the near future”. He argues that the backlog of unheard crown court cases – currently about 77,000 – betrays the victims of crime, leaves witnesses and defendants in limbo and corrodes faith in the whole apparatus of justice. To get the system back on track, Sir Brian makes 45 recommendations, covering a range of sentencing and divisions of labour between police, magistrates and crown courts.\nThe most controversial measure, if adopted by the government, is sure to be ending the right to be tried in front of a jury for offences that carry a maximum sentence of two years or fewer. The report also proposes that judges alone should decide complex fraud cases that notoriously tax jurors’ time and capacity to absorb highly technical testimony.\nSir Brian is candid in acknowledging that the changes are not ideal. They express an invidious choice between unpalatable compromise and an intolerable status quo, tending towards calamity. He makes a case for reform irrespective of the wider fiscal constraints facing the government. But he notes also that the terms of reference for his inquiry sought recommendations that “take account of the likely operational and financial context at the time that they may be considered and implemented”.\nIn other words, it is a question of finding the least worst solution when justice must be tailored to a tight budget. This is a crisis of long gestation. The justice department was among those “unprotected” portfolios that bore a disproportionate burden of austerity when George Osborne was chancellor. The court system is also still struggling to recover from extreme disruption during the Covid pandemic. Labour has taken steps to ease the case backlog, funding more sitting days and appointing judges. But the rate of improvement is insufficient given the scale of the problem, hence the review and the drastic measures it proposes.\nWhether curtailment of jury trial is a price worth paying to avert the worst-case scenario is a nasty question that only arises because adequately funded reform is not on the table. This has become a painfully familiar political conundrum for Labour.\nThe government was elected to fix a badly broken state, but on a manifesto that precluded most of the Treasury revenue-raising measures that might expedite tangible change. As a result “reform” has become a euphemism for shrinking services and withdrawing entitlements. When the time comes, ministers might feel compelled by fiscal circumstance to accept Sir Brian’s recommendations. If so, they will struggle to make a compelling case for a policy that so obviously compromises judicial principle for want of a long-term, better-funded plan.", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 17:30:56 GMT", "author": "Editorial", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}

It starts with a joke | George Monbiot", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/10/right-progressive-societies-joke-glastonbury-starve-benefit-rod-liddle-lewis-schaffer", "text": "Imagine the furore if a Guardian columnist suggested bombing, say, the Conservative party conference and the Tory stronghold of Arundel in Sussex. It would dominate public discussion for weeks. Despite protesting they were “only joking”, that person would never work in journalism again. Their editor would certainly be sacked. The police would probably come knocking. But when the Spectator columnist Rod Liddle speculates about bombing Glastonbury festival and Brighton, complaints are met with, “Calm down dear, can’t you take a joke?” The journalist keeps his job, as does his editor, the former justice secretary Michael Gove. There’s one rule for the left and another for the right.\nThe same applies to the recent comments on GB News by its regular guest Lewis Schaffer. He proposed that, to reduce the number of disabled people claiming benefits, he would “just starve them. I mean, that’s what people have to do, that’s what you’ve got to do to people, you just can’t give people money … What else can you do? Shoot them? I mean, I suggest that, but I think that’s maybe a bit strong.” The presenter, Patrick Christys replied, “Yeah, it’s just not allowed these days.”\nYou could call these jokes, if you think killing people is funny. Or you could call them thought experiments. Liddle suggested as much in his column: “I am merely hypothesising, in a slightly wistful kinda way.” This “humour” permits obscene ideas to seep into the range of the possible.\nAcademic researchers see the use of jokes to break taboos and reduce the thresholds of hate speech as a form of “strategic mainstreaming”. Far-right influencers use humour, irony and memes to inject ideas into public life that would otherwise be unacceptable. In doing so, they desensitise their audience and normalise extremism. A study of German Telegram channels found that far-right content presented seriously achieved limited reach, as did non-political humour. But when far-right extremism was presented humorously, it took off.\nHumour offers deniability. In his article on 3 July, after floating the possibility of killing hundreds of thousands of people, Liddle remarked: “I am not saying that we should do this, of course – it would be a horrible, psychopathic thing to do.” You can scarcely miss the wink. Such speculations have anchored misogyny, homophobia and racism for decades: “Lost your sense of humour, love?” – wink, wink. They distance the writer from the intention, and provide moral cover for the owners of the platform (the hedge fund hectomillionaire and evangelical Christian Paul Marshall is both the owner of the Spectator and the co-owner of GB News). Perhaps we could call it wink murder.\nWhen people become desensitised by ironic calls for violence, the difference between a humorous position and an ideological conviction can begin to break down. They are said by some researchers to suffer from “irony poisoning”. If, for example, people are repeatedly exposed to racial stereotypes in “humorous” form, they are likely to lose perspective, and start to absorb and affirm them. The results are anything but amusing.\nBefore launching his terror attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, the white supremacist Brenton Tarrant announced his intention with a “humorous” meme on the forum 8chan. The same phrase was painted on his rifle. After the attack, in which he murdered 51 people, far-right influencers made a joke of it, creating, among other grim amusements, a playable Roblox version of the mass shooting.\nIt is striking how often those who jokingly advocate dehumanisation and violence appear to act on these impulses. Liddle accepted a police caution for allegedly assaulting his pregnant girlfriend (which he later denied). Jeremy Clarkson proposed that Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, should be “made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while crowds chant, ‘Shame!’ and throw lumps of excrement at her”. He said of striking public sector workers, “I’d have them all shot. I would take them outside and execute them in front of their families.” In real life, he launched an unprovoked assault on his producer.\nPerhaps, if strikers had never been shot, concerts – and, for that matter, Brighton – had never been bombed, disabled people had never been starved or shot and women had never been humiliated and attacked in public places, such incitement might be less of a problem. But all these things have happened, and all are more likely to happen when the threshold of acceptability is lowered through irony and humour.\nAs foreign secretary, Boris Johnson joked about UK investors turning the Libyan city of Sirte into a new Dubai: “The only thing they’ve got to do is clear the dead bodies away and then they’ll be there.” When he became prime minister, he appeared to put his dehumanising rhetoric into action. Diary entries by the former chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance claim Johnson endorsed the idea that Covid was “nature’s way of dealing with old people”. They should accept their fate, “letting the young get on with life and [keep] the economy going”. The Covid inquiry was told that Johnson asked, “Why are we destroying the economy for people who will die anyway soon?” Several insiders claim (though he has denied it) that he said “no more fucking lockdowns – let the bodies pile high in their thousands”. Partly as a result of his psychopathic levels of insouciance and neglect, more than 200,000 UK citizens died of the disease. We chortle along, then discover they mean it.\n“Funny” memes such as Pepe the Frog and Doge, while originally used innocuously, became vehicles to deny and sanitise Nazi atrocities. Anyone who objected was told to “lighten up” or “get a sense of humour”. Then we watched as the president of the United States adopted the frog meme and his sidekick Elon Musk named his massive assault on federal spending after the Doge meme. I’m sure they both found it hilarious.\nDominant powers have for centuries used clowns to express their deepest, most unmentionable urges. Humorous suggestions of violence reveal and embolden real desires. The likes of Liddle and Schaffer are presented as outliers to be laughed off, or, if they cause too much trouble for their bosses, lightly reprimanded. But in some respects they deliver a closer representation of establishment truths than any sober editorial. They probe our defences. They soften us up for violence and misrule. They are not an anomaly. They are an embodiment. It’s the clowning that kills us.\n-\nGeorge Monbiot is a Guardian columnist\n-\nOn Tuesday 16 September, join George Monbiot and guests as they discuss the forces driving climate denialism, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.

After last week’s mini-meltdown during prime minister’s questions, the chancellor is now condemned to spend the next year grinning manically every time she’s out and about in public. Having a bad day at the office? GRIN. Had a row with the kids? GRIN. Now there is no escape.\nTo make it worse, you now get endless colleagues patting you on the shoulder and looking you deep in the eyes as they ask if you’re OK. When you just want to be left alone. GRIN. Everything is fine. Couldn’t be more normal. Sometimes, it’s no fun being a politician.\nSo Rachel entered the Commons alongside Keir Starmer for this week’s PMQs grinning wildly. Of course she did. And it must have taken all Kemi Badenoch’s self-control not to have made fun of the chancellor. She might know it’s a bad look for a party leader to use someone’s mental health against them, but generally speaking she can’t help herself. Kemi is hardwired to kick an opponent when she’s down.\nBut well done Kemi for doing the right thing. Unfortunately for her that was about the only thing she did get right. Not that Starmer himself was on sparkling form. The chaos of the welfare bill has clearly ground him down. It was more that Kemi felt a bit distracted herself. As though her heart wasn’t fully in it either. Semi-detached Kemi. This PMQs was just another chore to be ticked off the list. One to forget for all concerned.\n“Labour said there would be no more rises in income tax, personal national insurance and VAT,” she began. “Is that a promise you intend to keep?”\n“Yes,” replied Starmer, before sitting straight down again. One down, five to go.\nKemi seemed surprised by the brevity and raced back to her notes. Not a good idea. Because her next move was to accuse Starmer of giving in to the resident doctors. Keir looked understandably confused. Largely because he hasn’t given in. The government and the doctors are in a standoff. Kemi had another go. Back to tax. Was Labour going to freeze the tax thresholds yet again?\nThis wasn’t quite the slam dunk she thought it was. Partly because no prime minister is going to write a budget in advance, but mainly because there is no one in the country who ever imagined that Labour was going to raise the thresholds. The Tories hadn’t done so for years and had committed themselves to maintaining the freeze had they won the last election. So this was hardly a big reveal. Every government in recent years has counted on fiscal drag to balance the books.\nAt this point, Starmer went to his own default setting and accused Badenoch of talking the country down. Which would have been music to Emmanuel Macron, who is over in the UK for a state visit. The French president is desperate for the UK to reduce the pull factor for migrants coming to this country. So what more could he ask for than Kemi to tell everyone how rubbish things really were? “Don’t come here. Nothing works. We’re all ever more broke than you.” She could empty the beaches in northern France in minutes.\nKemi now turned to a wealth tax. “This is something that will affect all our constituents,” she said. Er … hello? Unless I’m missing something, the proposed wealth tax only comes into effect on people with assets in excess of £10m. Which, by my reckoning, rather excludes most constituents.\nThough perhaps Kemi knows something the rest of us don’t. Maybe Saffron Walden is wall-to-wall multimillionaires. But here’s something Kemi definitely doesn’t know. A wealth tax is actually quite popular with most voters. They like the idea of the super-rich paying a bit more. Even if Tory donors don’t.\nWe ended the leaders clash where we so often do on days like these where neither Kemi nor Keir can really be bothered to engage. In an unsatisfactory stalemate. Kemi claiming the Tories had left the country with a booming economy – she still hasn’t worked out why her party only won 121 seats at the last election – and everything was now shit. Keir insisting everything had been shit and that the good times were back again.\nI couldn’t help feeling that both their good times had rather passed me by. I must have been asleep. At times, it feels as if no party is prepared to grasp the demographic realities of the fiscal situation.\nSitting near the back during these exchanges were Rupert Lowe and James McMurdock. A new two-man party of the Reform Recovery Group. Cast adrift by Nigel Farage. Left to contemplate their inner futility. Though it’s possible James has other things on his mind. At present he finds himself in hot water over Covid loans.\nLabour’s John Slinger was not going to let McMurdock’s appearance in the Commons go unremarked. Was it not the case that anyone who was guilty of extracting Covid loans under false pretences should feel the full force of the law? Or perhaps under Lord Leveson’s recommendations, 40% of the force of the law. Starmer needed no second invitation. There was “no place for con artists and grifters in public life”.\nCue the speaker. Lindsay Hoyle may be a bit of a bore at heart, more interested in securing himself a peerage than the day job, but he is occasionally capable of genius comic timing. All the better for probably being accidental. Because a nanosecond after Starmer had talked of con artists and grifters, he chose to introduce Nigel Farage.\nNot that anyone got to properly hear Nige amid first the general laughter and then the barracking. Poor Lee Anderson became quite overwhelmed that his leader was not getting heard and demanded that the independent MP Iqbal Mohamed shut up. The noise wasn’t a great look. Nige thrives on being the voice of the people, the man whom the establishment want to silence. Sometimes, Westminster does Nige’s job for him.\nBut what Farage had seemed to say was that he didn’t want anyone slagging off Brexit. It had been a great idea, was still a great idea even though it was a disaster, and could he tell Macron to sink a few more boats and stop being so arrogant.\nWhat is it with Nige and Manu? A secret love tryst gone wrong? Macron seems to live rent free in Nige’s head. Despite slagging him off at every opportunity, Nige is desperate to meet him. And can’t believe it when Manu says no. He doesn’t like it when Nige talks dirty … This one will run and run.", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 16:11:54 GMT", "author": "John Crace", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}

Thousands of appointments and operations cancelled. Much of the reaction to the decision of resident (formerly junior) doctors in England to stage their third six-month series of strikes over pay in just 16 months has focused on the disruption to NHS services.\nBut their stoppages also threaten to pose serious problems – political, economic and reputational – for the government. For Keir Starmer, Wes Streeting and inescapably Rachel Reeves, too, this is a situation replete with risk but without an obvious solution.\nFirst, it will make the already tricky delivery of the government’s main NHS pledge – to restore the 18-week wait for planned hospital care by 2029 – even harder.\nLast July, Labour inherited a waiting list that stood at 7.6m treatments and appointments. After a year of the party overseeing the NHS, it remains at a stubbornly high 7.4m. On current trends, ensuring that 92% of people waiting get seen within 18 weeks of referral by a GP as promised looks like a real stretch even without strikes.\nAs the NHS Confederation chief executive, Matthew Taylor, says: “Hitting the 92% target is a difficult enough ambition without further industrial action.”\nSecond, a fresh round of strikes by resident doctors could embolden other NHS staff groups to do the same. That is a real fear among health bosses.\nOther health unions envy the 22% rise for 2023-24 and 2024-25 that the then junior doctors got within days of Streeting becoming health secretary and noted that it came after they withdrew their labour on 11 occasions, for a total of 44 days, in 2023 and 2024. Resident doctor stoppages could well encourage others.\nThe Royal College of Nursing and Unison recently initiated indicative ballots about possible strike action. Both have done so in recent years and have restive memberships, many of whom see NHS salary rounds as involving doctors who are far better paid getting preferential treatment yet again.\nAs the Health Foundation noted recently, even though the strikes by doctors, nurses, ambulance crews and others ended, “there remains significant underlying dissatisfaction with pay” among NHS staff trying to cope with more than three years of historically high inflation.\nThird, a government that has got itself into huge difficulties over the cost of winter fuel payments and disability benefits will struggle to offer a bigger pay rise than the 5.4% it unveiled in May – at least, not in the form of extra cash from a Treasury that does not have it.\nThat leaves open the possibility that ministers could agree a bigger rise with the British Medical Association (BMA) and tell the NHS to fund it. But with the health service already grappling with a forecast deficit of £6.6bn for this year, it has no money to spare.\nThere is no obvious middle ground for Streeting and the BMA to meet on. He has insisted that this year’s 5.4% settlement will not be reopened. The union for its part says he needs to produce “a credible offer” to address a 20% real-terms fall in resident doctors’ pay and start to “negotiate a path to full pay restoration” – or face strikes that could last until next January.\nThe recent readiness of the medical profession’s younger members to take industrial action in pursuit of their 29% pay claim suggests they will not back down. Streeting struck a deal with a BMA weary after 44 days of strikes and fruitless negotiations with the previous government. It will take all his persuasive skills, and a pragmatism so far unseen in the BMA’s approach, for the same to happen again.", "published": "Tue, 08 Jul 2025 17:18:30 GMT", "author": "Denis Campbell Health policy editor", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}
{"title": "If ministers want to see how welfare reform can be done, come see us in Greater Manchester | Andy Burnham", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/09/welfare-reform-labour-greater-manchester-prevention-housing", "text": "One consequence of the recent debate on disability benefits should be the acceptance of a shared responsibility across the Labour family to support the government with alternative approaches to welfare reform. Here in Greater Manchester, where there was strong opposition to the cuts, we accept our responsibility entirely.\nAs clear as the case is for some form of wealth taxation, it would be wrong to make that the only response. The Department for Work and Pensions system didn’t work for people before last week’s debate and it still doesn’t now. What is needed is a unifying version of reform, and we think we can help with that.\nWith a decade of devolution behind us, Greater Manchester is ready to step forward as the UK’s first “prevention demonstrator”, showing how we can prevent poor outcomes for residents and rising costs of public services. We are proud to have received that official designation from the government in the 10-year health plan for England, and we are confident we can live up to it.\nThe time has come to break with Whitehall business as usual and build an entirely new model of support. One of the many problems with Whitehall’s approach to welfare reform is trying to solve the complex issue of getting more people into work from within the narrow policy silo of the DWP when, in truth, the answers are much more likely to lie outside.\nThis is where Greater Manchester starts. We recognise that the barriers to work our residents face are often linked to issues like housing, personal debt and mental health. Consequently, a whole-person, whole-system approach is the only one that stands any chance of working. This is the philosophy upon which our prevention demonstrator is based – a bottom-up, names-not-numbers approach to supporting people with the essentials needed for a good life. At its heart are three big ideas which we believe, if carried out to their fullest extent, could together score the savings the Office for Budget Responsibility needs to see, as well as financing the removal of the two-child benefit cap.\nWhereas the Whitehall version of reform focuses on people, and crude cuts to headline rates of support, ours begins with bricks and mortar. I am stunned by the extent to which the media debate on benefits underplays the impact of the housing crisis. It inflates the benefits bill by multiple billions – but is also entirely fixable.\nThe new Greater Manchester strategy, published today, is anchored on the idea of a “housing first” city region. Without the foundation of a good home, everything in life becomes more difficult for our residents. From now on, housing will be recognised as pre-eminent in public policy. Freeing our city region from the grip of the housing crisis will be our number one priority.\nWhat does that mean in practice? It means, for instance, reaching a new tipping point within two to three years of building more social homes than we are losing, alongside a much tougher approach to improving standards in the private rented sector through our new good landlord charter.\nIn an ideal world, we would go much further. The vast majority of the £39bn announced for housing at last month’s spending review should be focused on a drive to build a new generation of council homes, rather than subsidise private housing. The evidence is compelling. A 2024 study for the National Housing Federation, carried out by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, found that building 90,000 new social homes would save £3.3bn a year in universal credit over the long term. If the government worked with England’s mayors and councils to scale that number up to 500,000, then the recurrent annual saving to the benefits system gets closer to £18bn.\nBuilding on this new approach to housing, the second part of our prevention demonstrator involves a paradigm shift in employment support, moving away from a distrustful, tick-box system and towards a more empowering Live Well approach.\nHow is a system which people fear having contact with, and often leaves them feeling worse about themselves, ever going to help them into work? The answer is it won’t. Years of tough-on-benefits rhetoric has created a system which people see as being there to trip them up rather than help them out.\nThe only answer is to turn it on its head. We must start with places people trust at a local level, such as community and voluntary organisations, and with the issues in people’s lives that are the true barriers to work. This is the essence of Live Well. We know there are thousands of people in Greater Manchester who have completely disengaged from the DWP but, if helped in a different way and particularly with issues that are destructive to their mental health like personal debt, could be supported into work.\nOur third focus is young people. The appalling statistic of 1 million people not in education, employment or training stands as a damning monument to an education system in England built for some young people but not all. The obsession with the university route, and the failure to provide equal technical paths, leaves many teenagers feeling lost in the middle years of secondary school. Our plan for the Greater Manchester baccalaureate, or Mbacc, seeks to fix that with the guarantee of a 45-day work placement for every young person who wants one.\nWe are confident our prevention demonstrator, in its entirety, could significantly reduce reliance on the benefits system and other public services like the NHS. We have never truly tried prevention in this country. If there was ever a time to give it a proper go, surely it is now?\n-\nAndy Burnham is the mayor of Greater Manchester.

In a digital age, when intergovernmental business could easily be conducted online, the analogue grandeur of a state visit feels potent as a bestowal of favour.\nThis week Emmanuel Macron is the beneficiary. In September it will be Donald Trump. The sequence is not meant to indicate preference. Both relationships are special, say officials. There are enough champagne receptions and sleepovers at Windsor Castle to go around.\nBut it is also no accident that the French president was invited ahead of his US counterpart. Trump has had a state visit already, during his first term. Hardly anyone gets two. Macron, by contrast, has been in office since 2017 and dealt with five UK prime ministers. None before Keir Starmer rolled out the deep red carpet of ceremonial statecraft.\nIt was never going to happen with Theresa May or Boris Johnson in No 10. It was conceivable with Rishi Sunak, who got on fine with his French counterpart. As for Liz Truss, when asked during the 2022 Conservative leadership contest whether Macron should be considered friend or foe, she said: “The jury’s out.” It was a howling display of unsuitability for the job of prime minister. Naturally, with a Brexit-addled Conservative party doing the recruitment, the howler won.\nEvicting the Tories was a necessary but not sufficient condition for upgrading cross-Channel relations. Starmer is fairly criticised for entering Downing Street with an undernourished policy agenda, but cultivating contact with the Élysée Palace, laying the foundations of mutual trust, is one area where the effort started in opposition. If all goes to plan, this week’s visit will reward that foresight with policy gains amid the pomp.\nIn terms of what registers with a domestic audience, the prime minister’s priority is a deal to obstruct the traffic in small boats ferrying immigrants to the Kentish coast. Whatever Macron agrees on that front, it will be more than he was prepared to do for Starmer’s Tory predecessors. That is the benefit of pragmatic post-Brexit diplomacy. It will also be less than satisfactory to those island-fortress fantasists who can’t forgive a Labour prime minister for proving that constructive engagement with European neighbours gets results.\nBut there is still a limit to what can be achieved on a bilateral basis when the Channel is an external EU border. No matter how well disposed Macron might be to Starmer on a personal level, the integrity of the European project comes first.\nFew European leaders were as angry as Macron about Brexit or as determined that the competitive disadvantages of rupture from the single market be locked into the subsequent trade and cooperation agreement. (Boris Johnson was a hapless accomplice to that end, happily giving away valuable economic privilege for fistfuls of worthless sovereignty.)\nThere is also plenty of history and shared strategic interest between Britain and France that antedate and transcend Brexit. Western Europe’s only nuclear-armed powers, comparable in economic heft, each with a seat on the UN security council, meet peer-to-peer on matters of security and defence. No other continental state is in that club. The longer French and UK dignitaries spend in a room together, the shorter the odds get on someone toasting the entente cordiale.\nThat isn’t just sentimental nostalgia now that Starmer and Macron find themselves co-leading the “coalition of the willing” – a loose affiliation of countries, mostly in Europe, that have pledged to support Ukraine. What that means in practice is unclear. It is partly a commitment to continue arming Kyiv in the face of relentless Russian assaults, partly a determination to maintain pressure on Moscow to stop the killing and partly a promise to help invigilate any ceasefire should one be agreed.\nBut the risk and feasibility of providing those things are hard to measure. The baseline might be a level of commitment that persuades Trump not to abandon Ukraine, or it could be the cost of replacing the US’s contribution when he bails. Those are very different things.\nLast week, the US stopped sending vital air defence equipment to Kyiv on the grounds of “putting America’s interests first”. This week, the shipments resumed. Trump said he is “not happy” with the Russian president. If so, his displeasure isn’t so strong that he supports European efforts to tighten energy sanctions on Moscow.\nTrump’s chaotic, capricious attitude makes it hard for Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s more stalwart allies to establish what their coalition might really be willing to do.\nIt is a question of survival for Ukraine, but also an existential challenge to all democracies on the continent. Should Europe be sprinting for strategic autonomy because Washington is unreliable? Or are military deterrence and self-defence without the US security backstop such remote ambitions that the real task is knowing the price that a racketeer president demands in protection money, and paying it? The awkward answer is both: hope to forestall the betrayal and prepare for it too.\nA subsidiary question is how biddable Trump really is, and by what means. Starmer and Macron come at this from slightly different angles. Both recognise that flattery is essential. But the French president also has defiance in his repertoire. He has publicly rebuked the US president’s threats to annex Greenland, for example.\nStarmer’s method is all emollience. Downing Street says the rewards speak for themselves in preferential trade terms. And it is true that Britain got a lower tariff deal, although that only means relative leniency for an uncertain period in a regime of arbitrary extortion.\nThe real difference between Macron and Starmer when it comes to Trump is not a matter of negotiating tactics or temperament but of geopolitical arithmetic. A French president speaks to Washington as part of a 27-nation bloc of sufficient collective market size to count as an economic superpower. A British prime minister goes into the Oval Office alone.\nAnd that is more significant than a ride in a horse-drawn coach and dinner with King Charles, which isn’t to say a state visit is unimportant or unimpressive. It is a real projection of status. But one that usually means more to the diminished host than the honoured guest.\n-\nRafael Behr is a Guardian columnist\n-\nOne year of Labour, with Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr and more\nOn 9 July, join Pippa Crerar, Raf Behr, Frances O’Grady and Salma Shah as they look back at one year of the Labour government, its current policies and plans for the next four years", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 05:00:43 GMT", "author": "Rafael Behr", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}

The system is unsustainable, and this threatens all the good it was designed to do.\nStreeting says resident doctors have lost support of public with latest strike threat\nIn the Commons Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has just delivered a statement about the announcement from resident doctors (hospital medics, formerly known as junior doctors) that they will go on strike in England for five days.\nStreeting argued that it was unprecedented for a union to go on strike after receiving as good a pay deal as that offered to resident doctors. Elaborating on what he said in his open letter to the BMA released yesterday, Streeting said that when resident doctors were on strike when the Tories were in power, refusing to even meet them, they had the support of the public. But now they don’t, he said. He urged them to take up his offer to meet them so the strike can be averted.\nHis statement was theoretically addressed to MPs, but in practice it was directed at the BMA, and at the public at large. He is trying to use public opinion as leverage against the union.\nBadenoch claims Farage like 'Corbyn with a pint', saying Reform UK promising 'unaffordable giveaways' on welfare\nKemi Badenoch is also going to describe Nigel Farage as like “Jeremy Corbyn with a pint and a cigarette” in her speech, according to the overnight briefing. She will say:\nNigel Farage pretends to be a Thatcherite Conservative but really, he’s just Jeremy Corbyn with a pint and a cigarette. On welfare he shows his true colours - promising unaffordable giveaways with no plan to fix the system.\nBadenoch calls for foreign nationals and people with less serious medical conditions to lose right to sickness benefits\nKemi Badenoch is giving a speech on welfare later. According to the briefing sent out overnight, she will claim that the welfare system amounts to a “ticking time bomb” because of the rate at which spending is going up and she will propose significant cuts.\nShe will outline a three-point plan to “fix welfare”. According to CCHQ, this involves:\n1) Limit benefits - ending handouts to foreign nationals and restricting sickness benefits to more serious conditions. Modelling by the Centre for Social Justice shows that tightening mental health-related claims like anxiety alone could save up to £9bn.\n2) Face to face assessments - restoring face-to-face checks and requiring proper medical evidence to stop the system being gamed.\n3) Get people back to work - through retraining and early intervention. Under the last Conservative government, unemployment halved and 800 jobs were created every single day. The Conservatives will get people back to work again.\nOf these, point 1) is by far the most significant, because the government is already planning a £1bn-plus investment in getting people back to work, and Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, has said she wants more face-to-face assessments for sickness benefits.\nBadenoch is expected to say:\nIt is not fair to spend £1bn a month on benefits for foreign nationals and on handing out taxpayer-funded cars for conditions like constipation.\nWe should be backing the makers – rewarding the people getting up every morning, working hard to build our country.\nOur welfare system should look after the most vulnerable in society – not those cheating the system.\nBadenoch’s speech coincides with the publication of a new analysis by the Centre for Social Justice thinktank saying that people on sickness benefits can end up receiving more than people working full-time on the national living wage, and that the government could save up to £9bn a year by cutting benefits for people with mental health conditons. The CSJ was set up by Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, and Badenoch seems to agree with the broad thrust of what it is saying.\nIn its news release the thinktank says:\nIn 2026/27, an economically inactive claimant on Universal Credit (UC) with the average housing benefit and Personal Independence Payment (PIP) for ill health would receive an income of around £25,000 – rising to £27,500 for those awarded PIP’s highest rate.\nFor new claimants, this falls to £22,550 once the Welfare Bill’s £47 per week cut to UC Health is taken into account.\nBy comparison, a full-time worker on the National Living Wage (NLW) is expected to earn £22,500 after paying income tax and national insurance – leaving a £2,500 gap between work and welfare for existing claimants.\nThe Daily Mail has splashed on this argument. The Daily Telegraph has also put it on the front page.\nTom Pollard, head of social policy at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, has posted this comment on Bluesky.\nIt seems completely reasonable to me that someone who has been assessed by DWP as being unable to work due to disabilities/poor health & as facing significant health/disability related extra costs should be supported by the government to have an income around the level of a minimum wage salary 1/2\nThe ‘work disincentive’ argument implied here is completely disingenuous because people would keep PIP (& a decent chunk of their UC) if they moved into work The vast majority of people in this position would rather be working if their health allowed 2/2\nAlmost 1.7m children living in homes affected by two-child benefit cap, figures show\nCampaigners have renewed calls to scrap the two-child benefit limit after thelatest figures showed the number of children in affected households is approaching 1.7 million across Great Britain, PA Media reports. PA says:\nThere were 1,665,540 children living in households in England, Wales and Scotland affected by the two-child benefit limit in April, figures published by the Department for Work and Pensions showed.\nThis was a rise of 37,150 (2%) from April last year.\nThere were a total of 469,780 households on universal credit affected by the policy – an increase of 13,520 (3%) from the total number of households affected in April 2024.\nMore than half (59%) of households affected by the policy are in work, the data showed.\nA total of 275,820 households affected are in work while 193,960 households are out of work, the department said.\nThe government is expected to publish a child poverty strategy in autumn, and a multitude of campaign groups have said it must contain a commitment to do away with the two-child benefit limit.\nThe limit restricts child tax credit and universal credit (UC) to the first two children in most households.\nOrganisations working in the sector argue that 109 children across the UK are pulled into poverty by the policy every day and that an estimated 350,000 children would be lifted out of poverty immediately if it was scrapped.\nJoseph Howes, chair of the End Child Poverty Coalition, said the government’s “‘moral mission’ to end child poverty will fail if the two-child benefit cap remains, arguing that “no child poverty strategy will succeed in lifting kids out of poverty, if this policy remains”.\nHe added: “We have heard the government say that they are looking at all ‘the available levers’ to reduce child poverty. We all know that this is the lever that needs pulling first – backed up by the government’s own data released today. It’s time for the government to act.”\nThis chart, from today’s DWP report, shows how the number of households on tax credits or universal credit affected by the two-child benefit cap has risen since it was introduced.\nAnd this table shows the number of households affected by the policy, the number of children living in those households, and the number of children directly affected (because they were not the first or second-born child). In practice, of course, all children living in these households are likely to be affected by a reduction in benefits paid to parents.\nThe government’s welfare bill passed its third reading in the Commons last night. Aletha Adu and Peter Walker have the story here.\nHere is the list of MPs who voted against the bill at third reading, including 47 from Labour. Most, but not all, of them were backbenchers seen as leftwingers.\nThis is what Emmanuel Macron said about the agreement on defence cooperation. (See 9.29am.)\nOur two armed forces together constitute what is really the bedrock of this European Nato pillar, to be able to be framework nations, to project ourselves on several theatres of operation, to defend European soil, at the site of our allies, is paramount.\nI welcome the fact that this [summit] can seal first of all breakthroughs in terms of strategic capability and common efforts, but really take it to the next level in terms of capabilities on more sensitive issues such as nuclear deterrence.\nOn Ukraine, he says there is a shared resolve to support the country. There is a “Coalition of the Willing” meeting taking place this afternoon, with Keir Starmer and Macron participating.\nPresident Zelenskyy is in Rome, where a Ukraine Recovery Conference is taking place, but a virtual “Coalition of the Willing” meeting is also taking place, for the countries led by the UK and France that are willing to support Ukraine militarily, and Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron will be contributing from a military HQ in north London.\nJakub Krupa is covering the Ukraine developments on his Europe live blog.\nThis is what Emmanuel Macron said in his public remarks at the start of the summit about small boats.\nWe share the same resolve to fight against illegal criminal gangs with strong coordination with other EU states.\nAs we’ve said, ministers have worked on that. France is the final point before entering into the UK, but these men and women obviously, roots of poverty, who are exploited by these smugglers. We must work with entry point countries into Europe to stem these entry points. We have common resolve in fighting this traffic and protecting our people and the men and women from these smugglers, and engage all countries that have a co-responsibility on our side.\nThis is something the EU wishes to take forward and starts with a bilateral discussion that must be broadened. I think that’s the momentum underway through this summit, and in line with what was done through the Calais group.\nKeir Starmer is attending the UK-France summit alongside Rachel Reeves, chancellor, Yvette Cooper, home secretary, John Healey, defence secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, Cabinet Office minister in charge of post-Brexit relations with the EU, and Ed Miliband, energy secretary.\nMacron suggests EU needs to be involved in finding solutions to illegal migration\nEmmanuel Macron is speaking now. After opening in English, he switches to French, for the benefit of the French media.\nHe says the UK and France are opening a new chapter in their relationship.\nThe two countries are working together on economic challenges, he says. That will involve having more integrated capital markets, he says.\nThey are working together on security issues, he says.\nOn small boats, he says poverty is a root cause. The migrants are exploited by smugglers, he says. He says there is a need to tackle this with “common resolve”, and to restrict the entry points into Europe.\nWe have common resolve in fighting this traffic and protecting our people and the men and women from these smugglers, and engage all countries that have a co-responsibility on our side.\nMacron says the EU also wants to tackle illegal migration. He says this will start with a “bilateral discussion” (between the UK and France, he implies), but he says that must be “broadened” (implying that ultimately the EU must be involved in a solution).\nUPDATE: See 10.45am for a fuller version of what Macron said.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 12:05:07 GMT", "author": "Andrew Sparrow", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}
{"title": "UK government abandons energy ‘zonal pricing’ plan", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jul/10/uk-government-abandons-energy-zonal-pricing-plan", "text": "The government has abandoned plans for “zonal pricing” that would have charged electricity users in the south-east of England more than those in Scotland, saying that a single national price would help ensure the system was “fair, affordable, secure and efficient”.\nThe energy secretary, Ed Miliband, had been considering proposals for zonal pricing that would mean different parts of England, Wales and Scotland being charged different rates for their electricity, based on local supply and demand.\nIt was intended to encourage heavy electricity users to relocate to areas that have more generation such as Scotland, where windfarms sometimes have to switch off because of a lack of demand.\nBut senior officials said earlier this week that the scheme could put off investors and make it more difficult to build renewables.\nThe energy department confirmed on Thursday it was abandoning the proposal after a lengthy consultation that had been running since 2022.\nMiliband said: “Building clean power at pace and scale is the only way to get Britain off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel markets and protect families and businesses for good.\n“As we embark on this new era of clean electricity, a reformed system of national pricing is the best way to deliver an electricity system that is fairer, more affordable, and more secure, at less risk to vital investment in clean energy than other alternatives.\n“Our package of reforms will protect consumers and secure investment as we drive to deliver our clean power mission through our plan for change.”\nInstead, ministers said new proposals would let the government take more responsibility for planning the system and determining where clean energy infrastructure was located, based on what is needed for the long term.\nThe long-awaited decision ends the bitter feud within the industry between those who believe that zonal energy pricing could make the market more efficient and those who argue the disruption would raise costs and jeopardise the UK plan to create a virtually carbon-free power sector by the end of the decade.\nThe energy regulator, Ofgem, welcomed the decision and said it brought “certainty and confidence for the future of the energy system”.\nIt added it would work with the government “to build a decarbonised system which will bring stability and protect consumers from international volatility and the rollercoaster effect that has on bills. We’ll be setting out our thinking on network charging reforms shortly”.\nHowever, Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, had previously spoken out in favour of zonal pricing.\nThose who backed a move to zonal pricing included Greg Jackson, the founder and boss of Octopus Energy, whereas some of Britain’s biggest renewable energy companies including SSE, Scottish Power and RWE opposed the idea.\nResponding to the government’s decision, a spokesperson for Octopus said: “We must reverse the spiralling costs of electricity, so we respectfully disagree with this announcement. The UK should have followed the majority of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) and put consumer interests ahead of producers.\n“The alternative to zonal pricing – reformed national pricing – is nonexistent. There are no published models, no cost-benefit analysis and no hope it’ll tackle the precipitously rising costs of the system.”\nHowever, SSE said the move provided “much-needed policy clarity” for investors and consumers.\nChris O’Shea, the chief executive of British Gas’s owner, Centrica, said it was a “commonsense decision” and that the “theoretical benefits never stacked up against the real-world risks” in potential zonal pricing.\nUnder the dropped proposals, zones with an abundance of electricity generation relative to local demand – such as Scotland – would have had lower market prices. But densely populated areas in the south-east of England would have run the risk of higher energy bills due to higher market costs.\nThose on both sides of the debate paid consultants to produce detailed analysis to serve as evidence, and engaged in rigorous lobbying to put forward their point of view.\nAna Musat, executive director of policy at RenewableUK, said: “This decision is good news for billpayers, in part because the prices set in the government’s auctions for clean power contracts will be lower than they would have been under the costly zonal pricing regime.\n“It will give confidence to private investors that the UK is one of the best markets in the world to build new renewable energy projects, by ending the uncertainty that zonal pricing would have caused.”", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 09:45:44 GMT", "author": "Kalyeena Makortoff and Jillian Ambrose", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}
{"title": "Flight of the non-doms: how worried should Labour be about the super-rich leaving the UK?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/jul/07/non-doms-labour-super-rich-leaving-the-uk", "text": "In Chester Square, the exclusive London address that was once home to Margaret Thatcher, multimillion-pound stuccoed townhouses are proving a hard sell.\nMore than 20 luxury properties in the Belgravia postcode are on the market, says a buying agent. In nearby Montpelier Square in Knightsbridge, less than a 10-minute walk from Harrods department store, nine houses are on the open market.\nHuge price reductions do not appear to be working either, with some homes lingering unsold for months and even years despite repeated reductions. One six-bedroom Chester Square townhouse has been on the market since 2022, despite its price being slashed by £4m – almost a quarter of its original £17.5m listing.\nOne possible reason for this luxury property glut has been echoing loudly in City boardrooms and the offices of Mayfair advisers in recent months: the world’s footloose super-rich are starting to lose interest in the UK, put off by Labour’s tax changes. After Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 halted the flow of wealthy Russians, some claim Labour’s non-doms tax has sent the global elite fleeing the UK for cities such as Milan, Singapore, Geneva and Dubai.\nAt the heart of their complaint is the abolition of the centuries-old non-dom regime, which allowed wealthy foreign people to avoid paying tax on money they were earning outside the UK, and avoid paying inheritance tax on their global assets.\nSuch is the concern that Rachel Reeves is reportedly considering softening changes to the inheritance tax aspect of the non-doms clampdown. But that comes amid speculation about more tax rises in the autumn budget, after Labour’s U-turn on its welfare bill left a £5bn hole in the chancellor’s fiscal plan- with wealth taxes increasingly popular among some campaigners and the left of the party.\nA colonial era relic\nIt was under the last Conservative government that Jeremy Hunt laid out plans to replace the 225-year-old non-doms system, a relic of Britain’s colonial era.\nIntroduced under King George III in 1799, it allowed subjects who had been born in Britain’s colonies to live in England without paying tax on their foreign rents and stocks so long as the money remained abroad.\nAfter winning last year’s election, Labour went a step further by also exposing their overseas assets to the UK’s inheritance tax. The death duty is levied at a rate of 40% and, although it comes with a basket of allowances and exemptions, it is one of the highest in the world.\nUnder the new regime, non-doms’ foreign income and gains are subject to UK tax after four years rather than the previous 15. A new residence-based system means also that their global assets are subject to inheritance tax after 10 years.\nIt is this inheritance tax element that has been the “emotional trigger” for non-doms, tax experts and chief executives say. One financial services CEO said older wealthy clients in particular were relocating abroad to escape the death duty.\nSeveral prominent non-dom departures have captured headlines: Shravin Bharti Mittal, an heir of one of India’s richest families; Nassef Sawiris, the Egyptian investor; and Richard Gnodde, a veteran Goldman Sachs banker.\nOne Indian non-dom, who has been living in the UK for the past five years, said she was considering moving her family to Switzerland as a result of the tax changes.\n“We love England. We feel very much at home here,” she said. “We want to pay fair tax as members of society. But the biggest pain point was inheritance tax … it is not just ours, but my grandfather’s and my parents’ wealth that would now be taxed by the UK. That feels deeply unfair as the money was not made here.\n“The current philosophical approach seems to be shrinking everyone’s pie instead of enlarging the pie, bringing more investment, employability and wealth to the country.”\nSean Cockburn, of the advisers Forvis Mazars, said while many non-doms were unhappy with the changes, most of his clients were staying in the country.\n“There has been an acceptance of higher income and capital gains but the emotional trigger has been inheritance tax. That seems to be the motivator for those moving. But not everyone is leaving the UK entirely.\n“Yes some people have left, some people are considering it, but some people have decided to stay and are broadly accepting of the new rules. In the media there have been very high-profile, very wealthy people leaving who receive a lot of coverage. I personally have not had many clients leaving.”\nAs well as Reeves considering a reversal of her decision to charge UK inheritance tax on global assets of non-doms, Nigel Farage has promised Reform UK would “bring back” wealthy foreigners who have left Britain by giving them a full exemption from taxes on their overseas assets in return for a once-a-decade £250,000 fee.\nIs there really an exodus, and what might it cost?\nThe UK counted about 74,000 non-doms when the regime ended in April. After the government announced its changes to the tax policy, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimated it could lead to a 12% to 25% decrease in the population of non-doms without trusts.\nCollectively they paid just under £9bn in tax in 2023, according to figures from HMRC. About £6bn of that came from income tax, £2.3bn from national insurance contributions and £400m from capital gains tax.\nJohn-Paul Marks, the new permanent secretary and chief executive of HMRC, told MPs in June that official data would only start to come through in January 2027, when self-assessment tax returns were due.\nStill, in the absence of official figures, reports with estimates have emerged, often commissioned by interested parties such as the investment migration company Henley & Partners, and campaign groups such as Land of Opportunity and Foreign Investors for Britain.\nResearch commissioned by Henley found the UK could lose a net 16,500 “dollar millionaires” this year, those with at least $1m (£736,000) in liquid investable wealth, which includes assets such as cash, bonds, stocks and gold. But the figures are disputed, with the campaign group Tax Justice Network criticising the report’s reliance on social media platforms, such as LinkedIn, as a measure of where millionaires live or reside. A spokesperson for Henley & Partners said the report relied on multiple sources, not just LinkedIn.\nA spokesperson for New World Wealth, the company that conducted the research, said the report also used sources such as investment migration programme statistics from across the world, its in-house database, company registers and property registers, among others.\nStuart Adam, a senior economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a thinktank, emphasised that until official data from the UK government arrives, there simply is not enough information to draw conclusions about how many non-doms have left, or would leave as a result of the changes.\n“Scraping people’s LinkedIn pages and their changed location is extrapolating massively,” he said. “A change in location may not correspond with a change in tax residence.\n“I have not seen anything that could qualify as proper evidence. It is a hot topic so people will put out what they can. But it will be one or two years, or even longer, when data becomes available.”\nA study co-authored by Arun Advani, a tax economist at the University of Warwick, found previous patterns would suggest the loss of the tax break will result in a “significant” but “temporary” exodus.\nBut he has said he expects a bigger backlash this time, particularly because of the change to inheritance tax rules. Non-doms, who previously did not have to pay inheritance tax on their global assets (including businesses they had built in their homeland), now have to pay the levy on these assets if they have been resident in the UK for 10 of the past 20 tax years.\n“It was always a mistake to have the IHT rate for foreigners jump from 0% to 40% overnight when they get to 10 years in the UK,” he told Bloomberg.\nThe OBR had forecast that the changes to the non-dom regime would generate £33.8bn in revenue for the Treasury over the next five years. However, there is considerable uncertainty around those numbers.\nA report from the Centre for Economics and Business Research found that if a quarter of non-doms left the UK, the net gain to the Treasury would be zero. That research was commissioned by Andrew Barclay, the co-founder of the property platform Yopa, grandson of one of the billionaire Barclay brothers.\nBarclay now runs the Land of Opportunity Campaign, a lobbying effort that intends to recreate Britain’s economy in the image of the US.\nThe non-dom lobby group Foreign Investors for Britain has also been highly active in the area, with research conducted by Oxford Economics on its behalf finding that nearly two-thirds of non-doms were planning to leave the UK or considering doing so because of the changes. That was based on surveys responded to by 73 non-doms and 42 tax advisers. It also found that inheritance tax changes was a key motivator for 83% of non-doms in any relocation decision.\nEd Bussey, the chief executive of Oxford Science Enterprises, a builder of UK technology spin-outs from Oxford University, said he was increasingly hearing from non-UK investors, who have historically funded companies in the UK, but who are now leaving the country because of the changes to inheritance tax.\n“While they don’t want to leave they can’t justify having their worldwide assets – which they often grew before coming to the UK – now being taxed at 40%, while other European and Middle East countries are charging little or no inheritance tax,” he said.\n“There is simply not enough UK domiciled investment capital to fund the innovation-led companies that we’re building and the high dependency on foreign capital is critical.”\nHe said the same issue was also deterring international entrepreneurs from coming to the UK to build their companies.\n“We should be rolling out the red carpet to this highly sought-after global talent pool, not ‘incentivising’ to go to Italy, Greece or Dubai instead – all of which are now seeing substantial inflows of the investment capital that we’ve lost,” he said.\nDonald Trump has certainly taken the view that wealthy individuals should be welcomed with open arms. The president has drawn up plans for a “gold card” that rich foreigners can buy for $5m that would grant them permanent US residency.\nBut Paul Donovan, the chief economist at the wealth management arm of the Swiss bank UBS, added that the population of truly “nomadic” wealth owners is “perhaps smaller than popularly supposed”.\n“Certainly in conversations with UK clients, the issue of changing tax rules has come up more often, as you would expect,” he said. “To date there is very little evidence to suggest the idea of an exodus.\n“You will always have high-profile nomadic wealth owners who will move and change their location.”\nMore tax please\nFor all the noisy departures, there are lower-profile non-doms who wish to stay in the UK, prizing its robust rule of law, elite schools system and world class museums, galleries and restaurants.\nGiorgiana Notarbartolo, an impact investor who helps to run her family office, is one former non-dom who plans to stay in the country. Born in Italy, she has been in the UK since 2016. “I have been uncomfortable not paying tax off the wealth I make in Italy,” said Notarbartolo, a member of Patriotic Millionaires. “Who wants to raise their kids in a two-tier system?\n“There are many single millionaires, if that, who are also non-doms. Some are staying and some are leaving, but not all are citing tax as their main reason, it’s something that might tip them off the edge if they were thinking about leaving anyway. Education and higher private school fees are a big reason.”\nPaolo Fresia, also native to Italy and an impact investor who lives in London, said he has been “appalled by the media coverage” on the subject. In fact, he said, although he claimed non-dom status, he felt “a bit guilty” and now felt “relief” that the system was no longer in place.\n“I first moved here for educational reasons, not for tax. There are so many reasons to be here, not just tax, but education, meritocracy and the rule of law. There is even a new four-year regime for people.”\n“None of my friends or colleagues are moving,” added Fresia, also a member of Patriotic Millionaires. “Some parents of friends are leaving but those are the ones who are coming to the end of their lives, do not work or invest and were already thinking about leaving. I am happy to pay tax here.”", "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 14:00:10 GMT", "author": "Lauren Almeida", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}

That’s a curious sentence to say as a newspaper columnist in Britain in 2025. But since the government voted to proscribe the direct action protest group Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act, any statement seen as expressing support could lead to arrest and prosecution.\nYou may justifiably respond that Guardian journalists are not above the law. For example, if I penned a column in support of al-Qaida, you might be sympathetic to incarceration: it did, after all, kill nearly 3,000 people on 9/11, as well as perpetrate multiple terrorist atrocities such as the 2004 Madrid train bombings, and the 7 July London bombings two decades ago. Similarly, you may conclude that a polemic in favour of Islamic State should be met with a hefty prison sentence.\nPersonally, I’m not in favour of carceral solutions for political problems: I didn’t support the neo-Nazi football hooligan who attacked me six years ago being locked up (his sentence was two years and eight months), nor the racists who posted inflammatory hatred during last August’s attempted national pogrom. But that is a legitimate political disagreement, one that places me in a small minority.\nClearly, I would never write a defence of murderous hijackers, bombers, beheaders and indeed génocidaires. But this column concerns a movement which is, legally speaking, now equivalent to al-Qaida and IS, and that is Palestine Action. Rather than decapitating people, or filling mass graves with innocent victims, they were proscribed after throwing red paint at military planes in what they say is a protest against Britain’s complicity in Israel’s genocide of the Palestinian people.\nLast week, our home secretary joined other female Labour MPs in a photoshoot celebrating the suffragettes, who planted bombs, burned down private homes and smashed up art galleries. They then voted to classify a movement which positions itself as opposing violence against people as a terrorist organisation.\nAnd this weekend, an 83-year-old retired priest, Sue Parfitt, was arrested after holding a placard that read: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.” Twenty-eight others were also arrested on those grounds. Questioned about her detention, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Mark Rowley, responded: “It is not about protest. This is about an organisation committing serious criminality.”\nNote how even Britain’s top police officer could not bring himself to claim Palestine Action was “an organisation committing terrorism”, which is what the law proclaims. I suspect he knows that, in doing so, he would have exposed the grotesque absurdity of this legislation. Yes, those who have helped drown Gaza in blood have turned the world upside down – treating the opponents of this mass extermination as dangerous, hateful extremists – but words have still not been entirely emptied of their meaning.\nDo not expect that to last. An injury to democracy, once inflicted, cannot be contained. It becomes immediately infected, and the sickness spreads.\nOne of the hallmarks of an authoritarian society is that the state sanctifies what everybody knows is not true, even if they are legally compelled to act otherwise. Britain remains far from totalitarianism, but a society that arrests an 83-year-old retired vicar for holding a placard supporting non-violent direct action, and opposed to genocide, is firmly on an authoritarian pathway.\nThis has been a long time in the making. When New Labour introduced anti-terrorism laws, opponents warned the legislation would be abused to persecute peaceful protesters. Indeed, then 83-year-old Holocaust survivor Walter Wolfgang was held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act after he heckled the then foreign secretary, Jack Straw, over the Iraq war at the 2005 Labour party conference.\nWhile many commentators portrayed Boris Johnson as a hands-off libertarian, his government introduced legislation that allows police to ban virtually any protest, with the Policing Act permitting action against demonstrations deemed too noisy. You may well ask what sort of protest is not noisy.\nAlas, it should always have been obvious that authoritarianism pulses through the veins of the Labour faction underpinning Keir Starmer’s leadership. As former Labour MP – and indeed adviser to Tony Blair – Jon Cruddas once put it, this is “the most rightwing, illiberal faction in the party”. As anyone who has ever encountered these factionalists in person can testify, they are defined by a raw hatred of the left. Lobby groups committed to Israel, or with links to the defence industry, pushed for this sort of legislation, and the Labour top brass lapped it up.\nOnce a movement committed to non-violence has been designated as terrorists, then a Rubicon has been crossed. “Terrorism” has been emptied of any real meaning, and can be applied far more widely. Indeed, earlier this year, more than 70 peaceful protesters were arrested at a demonstration organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC). None of this was direct action: they were deemed to have breached arbitrary restrictions by marching down Whitehall clutching flowers commemorating Palestine’s dead. The PSC leader, Ben Jamal, is among those being put on trial.\nYes, the authoritarian descent predates the slaughter of Gaza. But we have certainly learned that the consequences of a state facilitating genocide will have profound consequences on society at home. Millions of people are aware that their government has facilitated a grave crime, and to protect themselves from scrutiny and accountability, the powers that be must silence those challenging the crime. Democracy becomes ever more imperilled.\nRemember: it is an offence to show support for Palestine Action, which is deemed legally equivalent to al-Qaida and IS. If that law is broken, prison awaits. The proscribed organisation promotes civil disobedience and non-violent direct action in protest at genocide. This column has been checked over with that in mind. Ask yourself if this is normal in a self-described democracy. Then ask yourself searching questions about where this is all headed.\n-\nOwen Jones is a Guardian columnist\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

While in opposition, under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, Labour pledged to ban NDAs that stopped employees from disclosing discrimination, harassment or victimisation.\nA 2019 report by the Commons’ women and equalities committee (WEC) found employers were routinely using NDAs to cover up allegations of such behaviour at work and said their use in these circumstances should be outlawed. The Conservative government of the time responded to the report by saying it would legislate to prevent the misuse of NDAs but never did.\nIn the meantime, evidence of their use in organisations as disparate as trade unions, charities, universities and media organisations proliferated.\nAnnouncing the ban on NDAs being used to silence victims and witnesses of harassment and discrimination, the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, said it was not an issue confined to high-profile individuals or the most powerful organisations but was growing “sadly among those in low-income or insecure employment across multiple industries and workplaces”.\nWhile ministers did not act, others did, including the solicitors’ regulator. It issued a warning notice, first in 2018 in light of evidence heard by the WEC, and then updated last year, which outlined a range of circumstances in which preventing disclosure would be improper.\nAlthough solicitors are duty bound to abide by the warning notice, it is not the same as having a statutory prohibition, which is what the amendment to the employment rights bill will do.\nReacting to the proposal, Perkins said: “If what is promised at this stage becomes reality, then the UK will be leading the world in protecting not only workers but the integrity of the law.”\nThat is not to say there are not problems. In the past, people have suggested employers will have no incentive to settle without confidentiality, that NDAs expedite a quick settlement without having to go to a tribunal and can deliver higher payments.\nBut the trickle of revelations about them tells a different story: of a power imbalance between employer and employee being exploited to the detriment of the latter and those who came after them, who might otherwise have been forewarned of what they were getting themselves into. In the face of such evidence, it is easy to see why Labour has acted to fulfil a pledge that previous governments failed to deliver.", "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 18:00:15 GMT", "author": "Haroon Siddique Legal affairs correspondent", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}
{"title": "‘We need real change, not fiddling at the edges’: voters on Labour’s first year", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/07/we-need-real-change-not-fiddling-at-the-edges-voters-on-labours-first-year", "text": "For Aiden Robertson, a 35-year-old consultant from Burnley, Labour’s first year back in government can only be summed up as “incredibly disappointing”.\nThe year had been marked, he felt, by “dreadful communication, a lack of clear purpose, zero vision”, while Labour had been “pandering to Reform voters who will never back them”.\n“This just feels like continuity Tories. As a man who has voted Labour at every single election since 2010, this is the first time where I now feel I can no longer support them.”\nRobertson was among hundreds of people who shared their verdict of Keir Starmer’s first year in No 10 with the Guardian.\nThe responses – many of them excoriating – hammered home why the government is struggling to win the approval of a deeply divided public. While hundreds of people on the left branded the prime minister’s approach so far as a “betrayal” and an alienation of Labour’s traditional socialist base, hundreds of others expressed scathing disappointment about the new government’s failure to use its substantial parliamentary majority to reform the country and balance the books more.\nUnsurprisingly, many retired respondents, unpaid carers, or people in receipt of welfare support clamoured for tax increases to better fund benefits, public services and radical socialist reform. Overstretched workers, middle class professionals, business owners and families meanwhile wondered why their income continued to be taxed harshly instead of the wealth and assets of “the rich” – and lamented the perceived absence of fiscal discipline and meaningful economic upswing.\nProgressive voters decried the government’s approach to Donald Trump and Reform voters, its stance on Israel, attempted welfare reforms, lack of convincing solutions to tackle the climate crisis, the housing crisis and education, and the prime minister’s “island of strangers” speech. But others believed that Labour had failed to limit immigration – an issue many respondents described as a top concern.\nOf those who felt positively about the government’s achievements over the past 12 months, many felt that “grownups” were now back in charge, citing their agreement with Labour’s attempts to reform the welfare state, its rail nationalisation plan, Starmer’s performance on the international stage – such as his handling of Trump being a factor in the reduction of tariffs for Britain – resolved public sector strikes after increased pay awards, and the commitment to higher defence spending.\nA widely held view was that an overly critical press was “undermining” the new government and “playing into the hands of Reform”.\nMary, a 61-year-old local council employee from near Hull, felt the Starmer government had faced a lot of unfair criticism.\n“I agree with the change in tax for farmers and also winter fuel payments,” she said. “I live in a wealthy area and know so many people who absolutely do not need that money. All benefits should be means tested and not given out willy-nilly. I accept that the threshold of £11,500 was too low, but feel £35,000 is too high.\n“Change in Pip (personal independent payments) is also needed as the growth in the number of people receiving it has been off the scale – something obviously isn’t working with the assessment process. This all seems common sense to me. I personally think Starmer is the best leader we have had in a very long time – he has integrity and he does the right thing even when that’s difficult. He’s navigating the relationship with Trump and the EU really well.”\n“I think they’re doing a good job,” said James, a 21-year-old from South Tyneside. “Starmer represents a serious break from gerontocracy, and has attempted to rewire the British economy in favour of those in work.\n“Dealing with a public which wants lower taxes, higher spending and lower debt, an insurgent populist right and a rowdy backbench, Starmer has secured three trade deals, reduced NHS waiting lists, and ended the Rwanda deal [to name a few]. He is doing a good job, if [people] let him.”\nJonathan Dyson, 65, a pensioner from Huddersfield, stressed that Labour had been burdened by “an extremely difficult inheritance”.\n“It’s going to take several years before any significant progress can be seen, despite the constant demand for Deliveroo policies,” he said.\n“I don’t think that they are getting enough credit for what they are trying to achieve,” said Melanie, an architect from Edinburgh. “They’re tackling emotive issues that have to be addressed. I still have faith in them and I think that they could accomplish significant change.”\nAlthough various people described the Labour leader as “unprincipled” or “flip-flopping”, others felt drawn to the prime minister’s approach. “I like the idea of Starmer not having a fixed ideology, but instead going around fixing things,” said Chris Hurd, a 48-year-old accountant and small business owner from Wiltshire.\nDozens of people felt that the government had been spectacularly poor at controlling the narrative and making the case for many of its policies, among them Noel, a retired college principal from Otley, West Yorkshire.\n“The very policies they are being criticised for, inheritance tax rises, winter fuel allowance cuts, welfare reform, etc, are the right policies, but they were introduced badly without sensitivity and without being sold properly. Each could have been widely supported,” he said.\n“Basically Labour need to do much more to sell their policies and crow about the achievements.”\nCraig, 44, a father of three and data analyst living in Leicester, was one of many who felt that no coherent change agenda for an ambitious future had been communicated.\n“I was excited to see Labour come to power. I remember the hope and optimism the last time Labour won under Blair,” he said.\n“This time, though, it just feels like there’s no plan. I’m really concerned about the country’s finances, that we’re continuing to pay more and more in debt interest because of our deficit. I worry about the country my kids will grow up in.\n“I do believe some hard decisions need to be made to balance the books more. But Labour hasn’t offered a bold message to address this. Where are the exciting ideas for the future? Where’s the investment now that pays off later?”\nRespondents who felt decidedly negative about the government’s first year were split into those who desired a far more radical socialist governing approach and those who felt the government had ignored the will of the public in favour of left-wing concessions.\nMuch of the outrage was aimed at the government’s attempts to cut winter fuel for elderly people and Pip for some disabled people, and keeping the two-child benefit cap.\n“I think they’ve leaned too heavily into trying to appease the right,” said Holly, a 24-year-old from London who works in PR. “As a young, disabled and neurodivergent woman I despair at these [planned] cuts – I even cancelled my Pip application because I thought the chances of me getting it were so low.\n“I miss when we had a real opposition – this government has left me feeling like we don’t live in a functioning democracy. Even without the authoritarian crackdown on legal and peaceful protest, who can I vote for that actually represents me and has a chance of getting into parliament?”\nHolly said she would in theory vote for the Greens or a new party led by Jeremy Corbyn but would vote tactically for Labour if she lived in a seat “at risk of going Conservative or Reform”.\n“We voted Labour and got the Conservatives, but nastier,” said Richard Jewell, 56, a carer from Northampton.\n“There’s a real danger we could end up with Nigel Farage as PM at the next general election. The thought fills me with dread, but if it should happen we all know who will be to blame – Keir Starmer.\n“[This government] seems to have no moral compass when it comes to either foreign or domestic affairs,” said 60-year-old Timothy Willcocks, a school administrator from Hastings. “It is avoiding taxing wealth and hitting the poorest and most vulnerable [ … ] trying to ‘out reform’ Reform, rather than pursuing solid socialist policies to counter the far right. The first year has been utterly disappointing, made even more so by the significant majority Labour enjoy.”\nPaola Adeitan, 31, a mother of three and law graduate from Wiltshire, described the new government as “treacherous”.\n“Adopting a Trumpian approach on the issue of human rights and the government’s rhetoric and support of Israel’s airstrikes against Iran makes me hate politics,” she said.\nSeventy-seven-year-old Howard Gould, a retired civil servant from south London, was among scores who said they had been Labour voters for years but would not vote for the party again.\n“[I’m] appalled at the approach over Gaza, the snuggling up to Trump, [the] cutting [of] overseas aid and welfare cuts. [I] cannot understand why taxes [are] not raised. It has left me so frustrated over who I can vote for – certainly not Labour as of now, and never for Tories or Reform. But I understand why some are similarly frustrated and willing to consider Reform.”\nWhile many complained about Labour’s move to the right on immigration, many others felt the prime minister had not done nearly enough to reduce net migration, particularly illegal immigration.\n“Within my circle of friends and family and beyond I don’t know one single person who is happy with the state of this nation, one single solitary person who is not voting Reform at the next election,” said Lizzie Quinlan, 64, a retired registered nurse from the West Midlands. “I think it’s without exception the worst ever first year of any government I can recall.”\nQuinlan was among scores who questioned why the government had targeted welfare budgets for elderly and disabled people at a time of record small boat arrivals.\n“What leader punishes the elderly, disabled and disadvantaged in favour of legal and illegal [people] arriving on these shores? The next election cannot come quickly enough.”\n“Their policies are cruel and ill thought out,” said Sally Scarfe, 64, from Edlington, Lincolnshire, who used to work as a hairdresser, in retail, catering and as a cleaner before becoming a full-time carer for her mother.\nShe was one of many who felt the prime minister had prioritised his role on the world stage while neglecting the struggles of his electorate at home.\n“Starmer is weak, and nearly every time you put the news on, he’s somewhere other than in the country. He’s enjoying the big role of the statesman but doesn’t seem to realise the crisis that this country’s in. He doesn’t listen to how worried and angry we are about mass illegal immigration – which we’re paying for, while they’re trying to make welfare cuts.”\n“I voted them in hoping for change, mainly on immigration – small boat crossings. I don’t see change and in fact, the issue is worsening with no real plan put forward,” said Damien Seaborne, 42, who works in a laundry factory, from Caerphilly, south Wales.\n“I was also hoping a new government would be less wasteful on our taxes.”\n“Business confidence has collapsed,” said Jason Clark, a restaurant owner from Stockton-on-Tees, who was among scores of respondents who felt the new government had damaged Britain’s economic outlook with an “anti-growth” agenda.\n“Rachel Reeves’ crazy anti-business budget was like a hammer. Many businesses in this area are now no longer recruiting new staff. I thought about closing and various business friends are contemplating the same, off the back of the employers’ national insurance (NI) hike.\n“Like many others, I’ve reduced my trading hours to manage costs, so my wage bill is going to be 12 to 15% lower this year. People’s spending power has reduced in the last 12 months, footfall is down a third, while costs are amazingly high. Some months I’m not taking a salary. Why would you take the risk of starting a business? For many, it’s just no longer viable to take on staff.”\n“The tax levels are the worst,” said a 54-year-old professional in the tech sector from London. “The government made a couple of early errors by treating the private sector as a piggybank and increasing [employer] NI rates, but giving out large pay awards to public sector workers. It shows how little they understand how to grow the economy.”\nRuth, a professional in her 60s from Cambridge, felt Labour’s first year in government had been “tragic” amid “misfiring good intentions”.\nThe country, she said, needed “a mature debate about the trade-offs involved” in its desire to improve public services, increase defence spending and not increase taxes. “We cannot continue pretending the big issues can be solved by three-word slogans,” she said.\nMichael Morwood, 40, a disabled author from London, predicted political consequences for Labour and the country that chimed with remarks of hundreds of others.\n“We need real change, not fiddling at the edges,” he said. “Adding X million into the NHS won’t fix it. Reforming planning permission laws won’t solve the housing crisis. These are things that need to happen, but they’re inadequate given the scale of the problems.\n“We’re often told we need to get on board with Labour or we’ll wind up with a Reform government. The thing is, if Labour continue as they are, we’ll wind up with Reform sooner or later, guaranteed. The UK is in real, serious trouble, and Labour don’t have the clarity of vision, the principles, or the spine to actually fix any of the systemic problems.\n“I’d love for Labour to discover a bold new vision for the country, but the current leadership don’t seem to even understand why such a vision is needed.”", "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 06:00:59 GMT", "author": "Jedidajah Otte", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}

{"title": "The Sordid History of Offshoring Migrants", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/sordid-history-offshoring-migrants", "text": "Just weeks into Donald Trump’s second presidency, the Department of Homeland Security began sending immigrants living in the United States to prisons in Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Panama and to the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. At the time, newspapers reported that the Trump administration was pursuing similar agreements with Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Kosovo, Libya, Moldova, Rwanda, and Ukraine. The list has more recently grown to dozens of countries, including South Sudan.\nAlthough this strategy shocked many Americans, the offshoring of detention is not new. In fact, it has a recent precedent in American history: it was used during the so-called war on terror, when Washington detained suspected terrorists in one country and took them to another, a process formally known as “extraordinary rendition.” This was often done for the express purpose of torturing suspects or enabling other governments to do so. But the practice also has a longer history. For decades, the United States and other countries have systematically and forcibly moved asylum seekers to “third countries,” or territories that have lower legal standards and that are neither their places of origin nor their intended destinations.\nTrump’s approach to offshore detention, however, is unprecedented. His administration has sent hundreds of immigrants who were living in the United States, some of them for years, to third countries where there is no practical way to judge their asylum claims. Moreover, immigrants have been removed from the United States before they have had a chance to defend themselves before an immigration judge, as is standard practice in the United States. “The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order,” a U.S. appellate court wrote in April, in a decision demanding that the Trump administration return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who was wrongly sent to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, to the United States.\nBut on June 23, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily allowed the Trump administration to continue deporting immigrants to third countries, including to South Sudan. The summary ruling, in which no reasoning was offered, paused a lower court’s order halting such deportations and affirming immigrants’ rights to know where they are being deported to and to challenge being sent to a country where they could face persecution or torture.\nAlthough this offshoring practice sends a strong signal that the government is taking a hard line on immigration, it is bad policy: it is far more expensive than detaining and processing asylum seekers on the mainland, offers too many concessions to host countries that often have poor human rights records, and is used to skirt the human rights obligations to which the United States has agreed. It also portends a broader threat to the rule of law domestically; normalizing offshore detention can normalize the mistreatment of U.S. citizens. “Homegrown criminals next,” Trump told Nayib Bukele, El Salvador’s president, during a televised meeting in the Oval Office in April.\nISLANDS OF DETENTION\nFollowing World War II, most of the world’s countries signed international accords designed to prevent “refoulement,” or sending refugees back to places where they might be persecuted. But most governments still sought to block the entry of refugees; to do so without blatantly violating new international laws, they prevented people from setting foot on their territory and being able to ask for asylum.\nOne of the methods to achieve this was by offshoring the detention and processing of asylum seekers, which in the past few decades the United States has done more than any other country. In the early 1990s, the U.S. Coast Guard began intercepting asylum seekers at sea and taking them to the U.S. naval base at Guantánamo, where they were granted fewer rights than they would enjoy on the U.S. mainland, including access to information about their right to ask for asylum, their right to be represented by a lawyer, and their ability to file an appeal. At the height of this practice, in 1994, the base held more than 30,000 asylum seekers, most from Cuba and Haiti. With capacity at Guantánamo full, the Clinton administration sent 8,000 of the asylum seekers to Howard Air Force Base, in what was then the Panama Canal Zone, and to ships anchored in Kingston Harbor, Jamaica. Most who were found to meet the criteria of being persecuted at home were ultimately settled in the United States, but some were quietly resettled as refugees in other countries, including Australia, Nicaragua, Panama, Spain, and Venezuela, as a result of diplomatic favors from these governments.\nInspired in part by the Guantánamo model, the Australian government created its own offshore detention system, the so-called Pacific Solution. In 2001, the country’s special forces boarded a container ship carrying 433 asylum seekers, most of them from the persecuted Hazara minority group in Afghanistan. The Australian navy then transported the asylum seekers to two Pacific islands for detention: Manus, in Papua New Guinea, and Nauru, the world’s smallest island state. The countries, which were under Australian control for much of the twentieth century, accepted the deal in return for financial compensation and development aid.\nFrom 2001 to 2007 and from 2012 to 2014, Australia sent 5,800 asylum seekers it had intercepted at sea to these islands. Hundreds who had been verified as refugees nonetheless remained detained there for years, because the Australian government wanted to deter more asylum seekers from using that route.\nOne of the purposes of offshore detention is to restrict the access of journalists, attorneys, and watchdogs to detention facilities. The islands’ isolation allowed abuses by detention staff to go unchecked. A cache of documents from the facility in Nauru obtained and published by The Guardian in 2016 included extensive reports of assaults on children, including sexual assault. Doctors Without Borders treated 208 patients there; it reported that 60 percent of them experienced suicidal thoughts and that 30 percent attempted suicide. The organization said that the level of mental suffering it found on Nauru was among the most severe it had “ever seen among its patients anywhere.” At least seven asylum seekers detained on Nauru died by suicide.\nThe practice of offshoring migrants is used to skirt human rights obligations.\nRecently, a number of rich countries have considered Rwanda as a potential offshoring destination. In 2013, Israel and Rwanda struck a secretive deal in which Israel sent an estimated 4,000 Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers to Rwanda between 2013 to 2018. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, and other authorities, the Israeli government had offered the asylum seekers a choice: a transfer to Rwanda with a $3,500 payment, repatriation to the countries they had fled, or indefinite detention in Israel. Some of the asylum seekers who chose to go to Rwanda were secretly sent to Uganda or repatriated to their countries of origin. Many of those who stayed were robbed of their cash payments. Almost all ultimately left Rwanda to seek asylum in Europe.\nDenmark twice planned offshore schemes with Rwanda, first in 2011 and again in 2022, in which it would transfer asylum seekers on its territory to Rwanda for processing. The European Commission and the UN Committee Against Torture condemned the plans based on Rwanda’s history of human rights violations and the risk of refoulement, and Denmark shelved the idea without implementing it. The United Kingdom announced a similar deal with Rwanda, also in 2022. Under the plan, asylum seekers sent from the United Kingdom and granted refugee status by Rwanda could stay in Rwanda but would not be allowed to return to the United Kingdom. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom blocked the policy in 2023, citing concerns that the asylum seekers would not be safe in Rwanda. But the country may yet become an offshoring destination: in May 2025, Rwanda’s foreign minister, Olivier Nduhungirehe, claimed that Kigali was negotiating with the Trump administration to receive migrants expelled by the United States.\nThe clearest implementation of Europe’s aspirations to push its border control into other countries was a deal signed by the EU and Turkey in March 2016. The EU paid Turkey six billion euros and promised to grant Turkish nationals visa-free travel in exchange for the Turkish government attempting to stop asylum seekers—mostly Syrian refugees fleeing that country’s civil war—from crossing into Greece and agreeing to accept people who had been intercepted during attempts to cross. But Europe may also be on the cusp of more direct offshoring arrangements. Last year, Italy signed a five-year deal with Albania that would allow the transfer of up to 36,000 intercepted asylum seekers per year to detention facilities in Albania. Italian officials would manage the camps and process the migrants’ asylum cases in Albania, which is not an EU member state. Anyone determined to be eligible for asylum would be admitted to Italy, but those whose cases were denied would be repatriated. Asylum seekers successfully challenged the plan in Italian courts, citing the risk of refoulement.\nBut this past April, under a new version of the plan, Italy sent 40 migrants to the facilities for forced repatriation after their asylum applications were rejected in Italy. This marked the first known instance of an EU member state sending rejected asylum applicants to a third country outside the EU. Politicians around the EU have expressed a desire to emulate the newer Italian model, but it remains unclear if the practice will pass scrutiny in Italy’s Supreme Court of Cassation and the European Court of Human Rights.\nWAYS AND MEANS\nDespite the recent proliferation of third-country candidates, rich countries have generally had difficulty finding hosts for their offshoring schemes. Few governments want to be stuck with masses of migrants whose countries of origin may not facilitate repatriation. There can also be reputational costs to offshore detention. After its participation in Australia’s Pacific Solution, for instance, Nauru came to be known as the “Pacific Gulag.”\nThose countries that do partake have their reasons. For some, the schemes represent a way to rehabilitate their images. Rwanda’s longtime president, Paul Kagame, used the country’s deals with Denmark and the United Kingdom to promote a vision of a peaceful, stable country that was flourishing after the 1994 genocide. Critics, meanwhile, suggested that the deals were an attempt to whitewash Kagame’s support for armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and his authoritarian policies at home. Negative global reactions to the Rwandan deals suggest they have not been a reputational blessing. El Salvador, for its part, has tried to put a positive spin on having the world’s highest incarceration rate, with Bukele using the deal with the Trump administration to boast of “the best prison system in the world.”\nThese arrangements can also be incredibly lucrative. Italy was expected to spend around $1 billion over five years through its deal with Albania. British taxpayers will also be paying an estimated $1 billion for their government’s deal with Rwanda, despite its cancellation. The Australian government paid private contractors and the governments of Papua New Guinea and Nauru an estimated $7.75 billion to detain around 4,180 asylum seekers between 2012 and 2024. A 2016 study estimated that the Australian government would have saved about $300,000 annually per asylum seeker if it had transferred them to Australia for community detention while their claims were adjudicated. For host countries, these payments can be a windfall. During the 2012 to 2014 offshore transfers, for instance, Australian payments to Nauru represented two-thirds of the island’s GDP.\nSpeaking at a press conference in February, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised the Salvadoran government’s “very generous offer” to detain immigrants deported from the United States. Rubio said that the $6 million plan between the countries—the details of which are opaque—would “outsource, at a fraction of the cost, at least some of the most dangerous and violent criminals that we have.” Yet the economic costs of processing and detaining asylum seekers offshore are much higher than processing and detaining them onshore. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has estimated that the average daily cost of detaining an immigrant in the United States is $152. Alternatives to detention are far cheaper: the agency’s Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, for instance, which monitors asylum seekers via telephone reporting, a smartphone application, or an ankle or wrist bracelet, costs only $4.20 per immigrant per day.\nCountries seeking offshore processing and detention often offer concessions beyond direct payments for services. In the past, such deals have paved the way for trade agreements, diplomatic support, weapons transfers, or the easing of visa requirements. Like several other countries that serve as migration buffers, Albania is a candidate for EU membership; the Italian government has expressed support for its accession. Willingness to allow the detention of migrants on their soil gives countries such as Albania leverage in these negotiations. Several third countries approached by the Trump administration to detain migrants have reportedly sought to avoid being placed on the list of countries whose nationals are banned from traveling to the United States.\nCOMMAND PERFORMANCE\nThe real rationale for countries wishing to offshore the processing and detention of asylum seekers and even long-term immigrants is to create a spectacle of control while hiding individual immigrants in legal black holes. Offshoring schemes make for compelling political theater. Bukele, for instance, released a slick video on social media, with English-language commentary, that celebrated the arrival of deportation flights from the United States. It opens with drone footage of the aircraft but then cuts to a montage of machine guns and guards in balaclavas frogmarching detainees under flashing red and blue lights before roughly shaving their heads and stuffing them into cells. The following day, the White House released its own video in which a handcuffed man is frisked on an airport tarmac to the tune of Semisonic’s hit song from 1998, “Closing Time”: “Closing time / you don’t have to go home / but you can’t stay here.”\nSuch productions are a way for the Trump administration to show domestic supporters that it is making good on its promise to carry out mass deportations—even if the number of deportations this year is on pace to be lower than it was during the final year of the Biden administration. Other aims are to scare asylum seekers and unauthorized migrants already in the United States into self-deporting and to deter potential future immigrants with images of harsh treatment.\nHidden beneath the spectacle are the fates of real-life people. The United States is party to a UN convention against torture or degrading treatment, the domestic obligations of which are implemented through the U.S. Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998. The law’s core provision states that “it shall be the policy of the United States not to expel, extradite, or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, regardless of whether the person is physically present in the United States.” And yet the U.S. government is actively sending immigrants to places such as El Salvador, where according to independent watchdogs and to the State Department itself, prisoners are subject to endemic torture.\nMoreover, most instances of offshoring under Trump have arguably amounted to extrajudicial deportations, the results of orders from Department of Homeland Security officials and not immigration judges. The Immigration and Nationality Act specifies that when immigrants are deported, they should be sent to their country of citizenship or former residence. Only if those options are “impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible” can they be deported to a third country. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor laid out in her dissent in the June 23 Supreme Court case, the Trump administration’s policy is to “ignore the clear statutory command that notice and a hearing must be provided.”\nIn the case of Abrego Garcia, the administration sent the Maryland resident to a Salvadoran prison despite the fact that a judge had issued a legal order protecting him from deportation to El Salvador. The administration admitted that Abrego Garcia’s deportation was a mistake but then openly flouted a district court order, upheld by the Supreme Court, to facilitate his return to the United States. The government finally brought him back, in June, only to detain him on federal charges of human smuggling.\nThe Trump administration has not released complete lists of people it has sent to offshore detention. The White House’s website features only partial lists of deported violent criminals, who represent a minuscule fraction of migrants in the United States. This is because, at its core, offshore processing and detention are attempts to hide people from public scrutiny, strip immigrants of their right to seek asylum, and normalize indefinite detention and even torture. They are forms of disappearance.\nThe point of these policies is not to deter migration or to save money: it is to put on a show of being tough on the border. The major question is whether national and international legal systems will consistently compel governments to follow their own domestic laws as well as international treaty obligations. Rich countries around the world are watching one another for policy models. If the Supreme Court’s June 23 decision on deportations to South Sudan opens the floodgates from the United States, it will likely start a global race to the bottom.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "How Russia Could Exploit a Vacuum in Europe", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/how-russia-could-exploit-vacuum-europe", "text": "The NATO summit held two weeks ago in The Hague delivered on the low expectations the allies had set for it. Amid fears that U.S. President Donald Trump would blow up a normal agenda, NATO leaders significantly pared back the program, taking hard discussions on issues such as support for Ukraine, NATO’s relations with Russia, and Russian hybrid attacks in Europe off the table. But the summit did close with a historic agreement by most allies, Spain being a notable exception, to increase members’ defense spending to five percent of GDP over the next ten years, with 3.5 percent earmarked for core military spending and 1.5 percent for hardening civilian infrastructure and overall resilience. The pledge to spend more on defense, in addition to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte’s sycophantic praise of Trump at the summit, smoothed the way for Trump to stick largely to the summit’s highly choreographed script, keeping the alliance’s cohesion intact. Trump even appeared to leave The Hague with a newfound appreciation for NATO members, telling reporters: “These people really love their countries. It’s not a rip-off, and we’re here to help them.”\nAny sense of relief among the allies, however, may be short-lived. The relatively positive headlines coming out of the summit obscure the storm brewing across the Atlantic. The Trump administration is undertaking a sweeping force posture review slated for release in late summer or early fall that could fundamentally reshape the U.S. military’s global footprint. If that process results in a significant and swift reduction of U.S. forces in Europe, an outcome that administration officials have publicly suggested is possible, the alliance will become more vulnerable to further Russian aggression.\nEurope is stepping up in a big way, and defense budgets are rising, but it will take time to ramp up production and deliver the capabilities that the United States currently provides on the continent. The United States may see fit to make some force adjustments in Europe that allow it to bolster its defense posture in Asia to counter rising threats from China. But Washington must carefully plan any such shift, leaving U.S. forces in place long enough that Europeans can work to fill the coming gaps and retain their credible deterrent against Russia. It is critical that any drawdown be closely coordinated with NATO military authorities and that allies agree in advance to cover lost capabilities. Otherwise, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be tempted to take advantage of a weakened alliance.\nWORDS OF DISCOURAGEMENT\nThe political signals surrounding the U.S. Defense Department’s force posture review have only increased European allies’ fears that a rapid drawdown is coming. In a speech at his first NATO defense ministers meeting in February, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth underscored the Trump administration’s view that Europe could no longer be a U.S. priority, saying that given the “strategic realities,” European NATO leaders “should take primary responsibility for defense of the continent.” Those comments contrasted sharply with the message Hegseth delivered in Singapore in May, when he underscored the U.S. commitment to the Indo-Pacific and called it the United States’ “priority theater.” Media coverage of the Pentagon’s 2025 Interim National Defense Strategic Guidance—issued this spring as a placeholder for the National Defense Strategy, which is expected to be released late this year—suggests that the department intends to fund a military buildup in the Indo-Pacific by diverting resources from other places, including Europe, and accepting greater risk in those areas. Even Matthew Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said in May that Washington was “not going to have any more patience” when it came to reducing the U.S. presence in Europe.\nThe Trump administration’s attitude toward Russia is also feeding NATO allies’ concerns about the U.S. commitment to Europe. Trump has been reluctant to define Russia as a threat, instead calling Putin a “good guy” and making clear his aim to normalize U.S. relations with Moscow. Senior U.S. officials have also downplayed Putin’s risk to Europe. Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy for the Middle East, who also oversees diplomacy with Moscow, said in an interview with the conservative broadcaster Tucker Carlson in March that it was “preposterous” to think that Russia would “march across Europe”—a straw-man argument meant to suggest that European assessments of the Russian threat are overblown. NATO allies had planned to present a Russia strategy for approval at the June summit but suspended it in fear that they could not get Trump on board.\nEven if Moscow does not march across Europe, Russia will pose a threat to NATO. The Russian military, although not without its flaws, is no longer the disorganized force it was just over three years ago, when it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since February 2022, Putin has transformed Russia’s economy and military to support prolonged confrontation. Russian defense spending in 2025 amounts to 7.7 percent of GDP, a 12 percent increase from 2024. Moscow’s defense industrial base is running at full capacity. As Rutte said at Chatham House in June, “the facts are clearly there that Russia is able, within five years, to mount a credible attack against NATO territory.” Multiple European intelligence agencies have arrived at similar conclusions. Washington can ill afford to rapidly reduce its presence in Europe just as Russia is gearing up for further aggression.\nTHESE THINGS TAKE TIME\nNATO has been overly dependent on the United States for its military capabilities since the alliance’s founding, in 1949. After the Cold War, when most European militaries substantially cut their defense budgets, this dependence only deepened. The United States also lowered its defense expenditures and reduced its forces in Europe, from about 300,000 during the Cold War to about 100,000 troops today (including 20,000 additional forces Washington deployed in 2022 in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine). But despite this decrease in manpower, U.S. capabilities have remained key to NATO’s posture, plans, command and control, and force models. Today, the U.S. Army supplements NATO forces along the alliance’s frontier with Russia in the Baltics and Romania, and it maintains permanent bases in Germany and Poland. The U.S. military also stores equipment, its Army Preposition Stocks, in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland to outfit army reinforcements that arrive by air. The U.S. Navy has six Aegis-class destroyers deployed at a U.S. base in Rota, Spain, to support NATO’s missile defense and take on other maritime tasks in European waters, such as maritime patrols in the Baltic Sea. The U.S. Air Force has combat and support squadrons stationed at allied bases across NATO territory, from the Incirlik Air Base in Turkey to those in Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Azores.\nShould U.S. military capabilities be removed from NATO defense plans, Europe would be unable to quickly fill the resulting gaps, creating vulnerabilities that Putin would be tempted to exploit. U.S. intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms, for example, are essential for NATO’s awareness of Russian activity. Their withdrawal would leave the alliance especially vulnerable to Russian hybrid attacks, such as undersea cable sabotage, jamming, or cyberattacks. Fewer such resources would also limit early warnings about incoming attacks and hinder NATO’s ability to select, prioritize, and engage Russian targets in the event of conflict. The personnel that process, analyze, and fuse this intelligence—many of them American—are too specialized to replace quickly and often in short supply.\nEurope also remains highly reliant on U.S. air-to-air refueling tankers, heavy lift aircraft, and other such “strategic enablers” to move forces across the continent and supply it with battlefield intelligence. Despite European allies’ progress on procuring the military equipment needed to meet their newly mandated responsibilities in NATO planning, they have made less headway in developing these particular capabilities at scale. NATO would therefore struggle to move troops and equipment quickly across Europe in a crisis, just as it did after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, when some allies relied on the United States to transfer their troops to eastern Europe to reinforce the eastern flank. With a pared-down U.S. presence, critical shortfalls of air and missile defenses would also become even more acute, leaving allied forces and countries that are within striking distance of Russian missiles and drones particularly vulnerable.\nOther essential capabilities—long-range precision missile systems such as HIMARS, stockpiles of precision-guided munitions, and advanced drones—could also be diminished by a premature U.S. withdrawal. One of NATO’s key deterrents against Russia is its credible ability to target high-value assets within the country. Losing stocks of long-range missiles would significantly erode this deterrence and increase Europe’s vulnerability in the event of a Russian attack. And these capability gaps do not exist in isolation. The United States provides European militaries with most of their sustainment units, including medical and logistics personnel and a large share of specialists in cyber, space, and electronic warfare. Even as European countries ramp up defense spending, the timelines for assuming the functions the United States fills today will stretch into the next decade.\nA MOST DANGEROUS GAME\nThe Kremlin would likely see a rapid U.S. drawdown in Europe as a golden opportunity. Moscow has long sought to undermine NATO, seeing its demise as a critical step toward reasserting Russia’s position as a global power. Most immediately, the Kremlin would seize on any U.S. retreat to amplify Europeans’ anxiety that Washington is abandoning them. With Europe feeling vulnerable, Moscow would ratchet up its coercive tactics to intimidate European publics and pressure their governments to be more accommodating to Moscow.\nAs Russia perceived gaps in NATO’s conventional forces, Moscow would probably become more willing to take risks to advance its aims. Putin would assume that with a smaller U.S. presence in Europe, the West would be forced to favor de-escalation, creating an environment the Kremlin would view as exceptionally permissive and paving the way for increasingly brazen acts. Moreover, Russia has long viewed Europeans as supplicants of Washington, unable to function effectively absent U.S. direction. If the United States goes forward with a rapid reduction in forces, Moscow might judge that European unity would collapse, fueling Putin’s propensity to overestimate Russia’s ability to achieve its goals.\nAny sense of relief among NATO allies may be short-lived.\nMost immediately, Putin would look to further scale up gray-zone activities in Europe, such as cable cutting and other forms of sabotage. With fewer U.S. intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets in place, such acts would be harder for European countries to detect or attribute, allowing Moscow to operate with greater impunity. Beyond hybrid attacks, Russia could be tempted to take limited military action. Because a reduction in U.S. assets in Europe would lead to slower NATO response times, Putin might have greater confidence that Moscow could successfully seize territory, for example in a Baltic state or in Svalbard, a strategic Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic, and then use coercion and nuclear threats to compel NATO to accept the result. With air and missile defense in short supply and long-range missiles withdrawn, NATO could find it challenging to mount an immediate and coordinated defense—undermining NATO’s credibility and dramatically altering the European security order.\nRussia is not going away, and Europe’s buildup will take time. If the United States does plan to reduce its troop deployment in Europe, simply notifying the alliance that such a change is underway will be woefully insufficient to ensure NATO’s continued ability to protect its members. To avoid a dramatic blow to the alliance’s defenses, allies must procure today what they will need to quickly fill the gaps tomorrow. NATO military authorities must be given time to review and update their battle plans, and individual countries with the means to do so must commit to replicating specific capabilities that that will be lost as the United States pivots.\nPulling back as Russia is ramping up its military capacity and before Europe is ready to defend itself would embolden the Kremlin and raise the risk of another war—this time on Trump’s watch. The best way to prevent a future war in Europe is to make sure Moscow never dares to start one. And that will require Washington and its European partners to design a careful and coordinated handoff. The United States must tell its partners exactly where any new gaps will be—long before they appear.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "The Real AI Race", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/real-ai-race", "text": "Discussions in Washington about artificial intelligence increasingly turn to how the United States can win the AI race with China. One of President Donald Trump’s first acts on returning to office was to sign an executive order declaring the need to “sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance.” At the Paris AI Action Summit in February, Vice President JD Vance emphasized the administration’s commitment to ensuring that “American AI technology continues to be the gold standard worldwide.” And in May, David Sacks, Trump’s AI and crypto czar, cited the need “to win the AI race” to justify exporting advanced AI chips to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.\nGiven the prospect that AI could transform the power and prosperity of nations in the decades to come, it is better to win the race than lose it. But determining who is ahead depends on what it means to win. A common definition is being the first to cross the threshold of artificial general intelligence, which in basic terms is an AI model that is as smart or smarter than the top human experts across a wide range of cognitive tasks. AGI could unlock extraordinary breakthroughs in science, technology, and economic productivity—and the first country to develop it could reap disproportionate benefits.\nBut the race to AGI is not the only critical race in the AI contest. Militaries and intelligence agencies must harness AI’s transformative potential and mitigate its disruptive effects. Similarly, countries stand to gain a competitive edge if they can adopt AI at scale across the economy and society. Governments are also battling to create and own the standards, supply chains, and infrastructure that will undergird the global technological ecosystem. And all must avoid a race to the bottom in AI safety by working—sometimes together—to manage security risks from misused or rogue AI.\nTaking these additional AI races into account makes the United States’ position look precarious. Although U.S. companies maintain a meaningful—if narrowing—lead at the frontier of AI research and development, Washington could lose other AI races. China has considerable advantages, and neither superpower seems eager to cooperate to avoid catastrophe. And given AI’s world-changing potential, the stakes are profound: losing risks relegating the United States to economic dependence, military vulnerability, and diminished global leadership. That bleak future can still be avoided. But the United States will need to muster a coherent AI strategy, one that balances innovation, integration, and risk mitigation to translate the country’s immense technological dynamism into enduring strategic advantage.\nTHE RACE TO INNOVATE\nThe race to AGI is the most visible and immediate of the AI contests. Private companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind in the United States and DeepSeek in China are rushing to innovate, supported by their respective governments. No one knows exactly how the technology will evolve. Large language models could be the first signs of emerging AGI, or true AGI could manifest suddenly when AI models pass a certain threshold. Either way, AGI has enough potential to transform the sources of national power and competitiveness that the world’s two AI leaders have a substantial interest in securing a first-mover advantage.\nAmerican AI labs currently have a discernible edge, helped along by semiconductor export controls designed to maintain the United States’ computational advantage over China. But this lead is fragile. China’s domestic innovation, circumvention of export controls, and intellectual property theft have kept the country in a close second place. Its leading AI companies, such as DeepSeek, are developing technologies that trail their U.S. counterparts by mere months. And Beijing’s centralized approach might help it nurture, consolidate, and harness private-sector innovations more quickly than Washington can.\nThe race to artificial general intelligence is not the only race in the AI contest.\nThe United States’ open system, meanwhile, fosters innovation but is inherently vulnerable to espionage and the rapid diffusion of algorithmic advances. Breakthroughs in algorithmic design or alternative paradigms for AI development could diminish the importance of U.S. semiconductor dominance, and their spread could enable China’s AI labs to leapfrog American competitors. The Trump administration, driven by other political priorities, is also pulling back investment in basic AI research and development and discouraging talented foreign nationals from working in the United States, potentially setting back American AI efforts over the next several years.\nThe U.S. private sector, moreover, responds to commercial imperatives that are not always consistent with national priorities. AI firms, for example, will be tempted to build AI computing power wherever there is available energy infrastructure—whether or not it is based in the United States. Favorable regulatory environments and abundant resources in the Middle East are already proving attractive. The world’s first five-gigawatt AI data center cluster will be built in the UAE, not the United States—a development enabled by the Trump administration’s recent decision to export hundreds of thousands of leading-edge AI chips to Abu Dhabi. Washington does benefit from this arrangement, and U.S. firms including OpenAI and Microsoft are slated to operate most of the data centers’ capacity. But moving crucial infrastructure offshore, where security may be lax, could also provide a backdoor for China and other competitors to acquire advanced computing resources and AI models.\nEven if the United States can hold on to its lead in the innovation race, that may not be enough. Current market trends suggest that frontier AI models are becoming so widely accessible and undifferentiated that they give no one a clear technological edge. If that trend holds when AGI emerges, victory will depend on effective AI adoption—and there is no guarantee the United States will come out on top.\nSECURING THE EDGE\nIn the realm of national security, effective AI adoption requires both understanding the capabilities enabled (and threats posed) by frontier AI and integrating AI into existing structures in ways that secure a decisive military edge. Integration of AI promises to enhance intelligence processing, accelerate data-driven decision-making, optimize logistics and resource allocation, enable sophisticated autonomous systems, and possibly even lead to the development of a “wonder weapon”—such as a cyberweapon that could cripple an adversary’s critical infrastructure and command and control or, used defensively, make a country invulnerable to cyberattacks.\nThe U.S. government and private industry need to work together to achieve AI integration, but their current cooperation remains troublingly limited. National security agencies lack early access to the latest AI models, which would speed up the process of incorporating the latest technologies into their workflows. Partnerships between leading AI labs and the Pentagon and other national security agencies are only in nascent stages. And lengthy procurement cycles, operational cultures that are resistant to change, a lack of infrastructure and data, and misunderstandings about what AI can achieve—both underestimating and overestimating its abilities—hamper the government’s ability to take full advantage of innovations coming out of Silicon Valley. Although these problems are widely acknowledged, fixing them has proved difficult.\nChina’s authoritarian system, meanwhile, eases civil-military integration, providing it with a structural edge in AI adoption. State mandates ensure that technological advances are rapidly translated into military and intelligence capabilities. The People’s Liberation Army has embraced AI and is actively seeking contributions from the commercial and academic sectors. Making use of AI competitions and public purchasing platforms designed to translate civilian AI research to military applications, it plans to field “algorithmic warfare” and “network-centric warfare” capabilities by 2030. More than merely using algorithms in weapons systems, this entails a transition to a new type of warfare in which military superiority depends on the speed, sophistication, and reliability of those algorithms.\nRemaining on the cutting edge of innovation is necessary but not sufficient to win the race in the national security space. The United States could produce scientific and technological breakthrough after breakthrough but still fail to recognize the point at which AI opens a new technological pathway to a revolutionary military or intelligence capability. Washington’s bureaucratic structures, designed for incremental improvements to existing systems, often make it difficult to imagine left-field possibilities for emerging technologies. Beijing’s centralized decision-making system, in comparison, could identify and exploit a disruptive pathway much faster, potentially leaving the United States technologically superior but strategically outmaneuvered.\nTHE INTEGRATION IMPERATIVE\nThe winner of the AI race will also need to integrate AI into the national economy—to ensure that AI is widely accessible and is diffused across the education, energy, finance, health, logistics, and manufacturing sectors. The U.S. technology companies that drive consumer and business AI applications, a vibrant venture capital ecosystem that funds innovation, relatively high digital literacy, and extensive digital infrastructure all provide the United States notable advantages. Yet success is not guaranteed. If corporate and governmental actors at all levels fail to create the right incentives for integration and build sufficient public trust in AI, the private sector could struggle to adopt AI quickly enough to capitalize on the benefits of enhanced productivity and new value creation. There is also a danger that AI will not simply augment human labor but replace it. Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, has recently warned that AI could lead to as much as 20 percent unemployment in the United States within five years—an outcome that could deeply destabilize both the economy and American society.\nMeanwhile, China may be poised to perform surprisingly well in the race for economic adoption. Chinese business leaders are already more focused on AI applications than on developing AI models. DeepSeek’s open-source models, for example, are driving down costs for all Chinese AI models, which enables more businesses to experiment with the technology. This could give China an edge in creating game-changing products. The Chinese government is also less exposed to the political consequences of AI replacing labor. Whereas automating jobs raises alarm in Washington, Beijing could even welcome AI adoption as a solution to China’s labor shortages brought by a rapidly aging and shrinking population.\nEven if the United States can keep its lead in innovation, that may not be enough.\nEven if the United States adopts AI across its economy as aggressively as China does, it may lose the overall race if China is better positioned to capitalize on the manufacturing advances enabled by AI, particularly in the realm of robotics. China leads the world in industrial robot installations: Chinese manufacturers purchased half the global market share in 2024, and the country’s robots per employee significantly exceeded the global average. Extreme automation is becoming more common in the manufacturing sector with the proliferation of “dark factories,” such as the electronics company Xiaomi’s smartphone facility that operates 24/7 without human workers. As AI makes strides in spatial reasoning and embodied intelligence—AI that enables robots to interact with and learn from their physical environment—factory robots may become able to perform a much wider array of complex physical tasks.\nAlthough U.S. firms excel in software and services—areas that are also expected to make significant productivity gains as a result of AI adoption—the United States has ceded ground to China in recent decades in physical industries, including manufacturing, logistics, energy, and infrastructure. With its state-driven industrial policy and massive manufacturing base, China can deploy AI at scale within these sectors and might unleash dramatic productivity gains that lead it to finally surpass the U.S. economy.\nSTACKING THE DECK\nThe world’s tech powers are also racing to provide the digital infrastructure that will undergird the global development, deployment, and use of AI. Although this is primarily a competition between the United States and China, other established tech powers (such as France, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom) and ambitious emerging players (such as Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE) are joining the contest, too. Each participant aims to control the data, the chips and data centers, and the foundational models required for AI use, as well as exert influence over global AI norms and standards. As Sacks, the AI and crypto czar, recently put it, “If 80 percent of the world uses the American tech stack, that’s winning. If 80 percent uses Chinese tech, that’s losing.”\nExport controls on semiconductor chips have given the United States a meaningful edge. U.S. companies have access to the chips they need for computational power, and much of the world wants U.S. chips because they are the best on offer. The Trump administration is seeking to capitalize on this advantage by “flooding the zone” with U.S. chips and data centers, starting in partner countries such as Saudia Arabia and the UAE. The idea is to lock in the use of U.S. technology in places where market forces encourage massive investments in digital infrastructure.\nBut in countries with lower incomes, fewer customers, and less basic infrastructure such as broadband connectivity and electricity, Washington’s strategy of following market forces will lead to underinvestment. This is the dynamic across a broad group of countries in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and South and Southeast Asia that are turning to AI to boost their economic growth. China is positioned to outcompete the United States in these places by providing less advanced and significantly cheaper AI models—as well as subsidizing the physical and digital infrastructure needed to run them. It may not currently be able to export any top-of-the-line chips, but for many developing countries where cost and accessibility are more important than cutting-edge performance, China’s “good enough” offerings could prove highly attractive.\nCeding these emerging markets risks a future in which the United States wins the technological race at the frontier but surrenders leadership of the global AI ecosystem to China. The consequences for Washington extend beyond lost geopolitical influence and commercial opportunities. Chinese AI models and infrastructure frequently embody digital authoritarian values, enabling Beijing to export mechanisms of state control and shape historical and political narratives beyond its borders. They facilitate surveillance by powering facial and voice recognition systems and analyzing vast amounts of data to monitor individuals and flag “suspicious” behavior. They automatically censor content critical of the Chinese Communist Party or related to sensitive topics such as Tiananmen Square, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Uyghurs, or Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Their algorithms also curate and disseminate pro-Chinese propaganda. In contrast, American AI models generally reflect stronger commitments to democratic norms, transparency, privacy safeguards, user choice, and data protection frameworks, helping reduce opportunities for government abuse. A critical step toward ensuring the technologies shaping modern life across the world align with democratic values is for Washington to proactively incentivize American AI firms to invest and build infrastructure in developing countries.\nPoor policy choices could set the United States back in the race to build and manage the world’s AI infrastructure. Overly restrictive export controls could alienate allies or drive countries currently on the fence toward Chinese products. Conversely, applying too little control over advanced AI chips could inadvertently create opportunities for Chinese companies to acquire or remotely access them, potentially accelerating China’s technological innovation. And if Washington cannot articulate a compelling vision for technological governance—one that carefully balances national security with economic openness and democratic values—potential international partners may turn elsewhere. China is not just selling AI; it offers a comprehensive toolkit for rapid modernization on financially and politically appealing terms to a substantial portion of the world. For a developing country eager to harness AI for economic gains and improved governance, the Chinese offer is often the most practical and readily available path forward.\nA RACE TO THE BOTTOM?\nEven as the United States and China compete in the AI race, they cannot forget that AGI and other highly capable AI models create potential threats. It is imperative that neither competitor allows its rapid development and deployment of AI to make a disaster more likely. A nonstate actor or rogue state weaponizing AI models, unintentional military escalation caused by AI, or a loss of control of superintelligent systems could prove catastrophic. Preventing such outcomes requires that AI powers avoid cutting corners on safety in their haste to compete.\nThe most pressing near-term catastrophic risks are that nonstate actors with access to advanced AI systems could launch large-scale cyberattacks that devastate financial systems or design and release highly lethal and transmissible pathogens. These hazards are no longer confined to the realm of science fiction. Companies at the forefront of AI development have predicted that their internally defined thresholds for dangerous capabilities—measured as “uplift,” or the degree to which an AI model significantly enhances a malicious actor’s abilities—are likely to be crossed this year. Another rapidly approaching threat is the potential emergence of a superintelligence misaligned with human values or intentions, pursuing actions that endanger human well-being because of flawed design, ambiguous instructions, or unforeseen consequences. Growing evidence of frontier AI models exhibiting deceptive or scheming behaviors makes this risk increasingly credible.\nBoth Washington and Beijing have an interest in preventing the proliferation of dangerous AI capabilities and the emergence of rogue AGI. This common ground creates an opportunity for cooperation between the two AI superpowers—even amid their intense technological competition—to better understand risks of misuse and misalignment and to identify and develop effective mitigation measures.\nFor Washington, seeking ways to mitigate threats from AI—an imperative the Trump administration has recognized—is sound policy regardless of what other AI powers do. Even if rogue AI does not lead to global calamity, a major AI-related incident originating from the United States, whether accidental or through negligence, would undermine confidence in American technology. And if the United States is seen as unable to manage the immense power of AI, its global leadership and moral authority would be called into question, and China could exploit the resulting power vacuum by promising stability and control.\nRECIPE FOR SUCCESS\nThe trajectories of the various AI races between China and the United States are tightly intertwined. Winning the race to AGI development, for example, will boost the leading country’s national security, economic vitality, and global technological influence. And the competitive pressures unleashed by the races to develop and adopt AI exacerbate the risk of a catastrophic outcome as haste and rivalry undercut safety—a danger no country can outrun. Success in the AI race therefore requires a strategy that advances progress across several fronts simultaneously while managing the security risks of unchecked AI.\nAs part of a holistic strategy, Washington must make every effort to avoid being caught off guard by AI advances in Silicon Valley, China, and emerging AI hubs around the world. Being surprised could mean failing to recognize the emergence of new threats or missing opportunities to capitalize on AI progress ahead of China. To prevent this, the U.S. government must maintain close communication with domestic industry leaders and closely monitor imminent technological breakthroughs abroad. The Commerce Department’s repurposing of its AI Safety Institute, now called the U.S. Center for AI Standards and Innovation, to focus on working with industry to research and test frontier AI is a step in the right direction. National security departments and agencies, too, should remain apprised of the latest frontier AI developments and explore potential use cases. Likewise, the intelligence community must expand its monitoring of foreign AI efforts, particularly focusing on China’s advancements and objectives, as well as those of emerging AI powers in the Middle East.\nThe Trump administration should also identify ways to facilitate frontier AI development. It must ensure that AI companies have access to the resources they need for AI model development and deployment, including vast computational power (in the form of semiconductors), high-quality data, world-class talent, and sufficient energy supplies. It will be important not to create new problems in the process; to meet AI’s growing energy demands without exacerbating climate change, for example, Washington should invest in cleaner energy sources such as nuclear power.\nThe private sector could struggle to adopt AI quickly enough to capitalize on its benefits.\nWashington must defend U.S. technological superiority, too. To ensure that AI advancements are not rapidly replicated by competitors, the U.S. government will need to enforce stringent controls over technologies such as advanced semiconductors and manufacturing equipment, strengthen security measures at research labs and data centers to prevent espionage and intellectual property theft, and require rigorous user verification on cloud computing platforms so that they do not become unwitting tools for an adversary’s technological advancement.\nTo keep the United States at the forefront of innovation while safeguarding national interests, the U.S. government must develop a scalable and adaptive public-private partnership model to cooperate with companies working on frontier AI. These initiatives should help the government ramp up its adoption of advanced AI and promote prudent security practices. American AI companies can benefit from access to sensitive government intelligence about adversaries attempting to target them, and both the public sector and the private sector can benefit from co-developing AI applications that can enhance national security, such as advanced cybersecurity and biodefense tools.\nAs China expands its industrial capacity using AI and robotics, policymakers in Washington must also broaden AI adoption beyond the technology sector. The Trump administration should work with Congress to launch a dedicated “industrial AI” initiative to accelerate research, development, and investment in robotics and AI deployment across the manufacturing, logistics, energy, and infrastructure sectors. With tax credits, innovation grants, and public-private pilot projects, the government can incentivize factories, warehouses, and transportation hubs to integrate AI-driven systems, bridging the gap between the United States’ cutting-edge software capabilities and its lagging factory floors.\nPolicymakers must also act now to help the workers who will lose their jobs to AI in these industrial sectors. This means significantly increasing investments in STEM education, vocational training, and retraining and upskilling programs—services that would enable workers displaced by automation to swiftly transition into new roles, such as robot maintenance or AI system supervision. To provide clarity for businesses and protections for workers in an AI-centric economy, labor laws and regulations also require updates. As companies increasingly use algorithms to schedule work shifts and more employees work on short-term contracts, wage-and-hour laws should be modernized to ensure transparent, fair compensation and clearly defined working hours. Workplace safety guidelines will need to be revised to incorporate standards for safe human-robot interaction on factory floors. Strengthening unemployment benefits and other forms of direct income support for people disproportionately affected by automation will also be crucial to mitigating the potentially destabilizing consequences of significant labor displacement.\nAI powers must avoid cutting corners on safety in their haste to compete.\nIf the United States is to lead the global AI technology ecosystem, it will also need to provide advanced AI and data centers to more than just wealthy countries. To compete with China’s “good enough” AI systems across the developing world, the Trump administration should explore public-private partnerships to offer generous access to U.S. cloud computing systems to researchers and entrepreneurs in these countries. It should also scale up government-backed financial tools—such as low-interest loans, loan guarantees, equity investments, political risk insurance, and tax incentives—through agencies such as the International Development Finance Corporation. These incentives should be geared toward building digital infrastructure in important emerging markets, such as in Brazil, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Vietnam.\nFinally, the Trump administration must take steps to reduce the risk of worst-case scenarios—and prepare for those contingencies should they arise. It should run tabletop exercises and crisis simulations of cases involving catastrophic misuse of AI or rogue superintelligence. Doing so would give senior leaders opportunities to rehearse crisis responses, identify gaps in readiness, and improve their decision-making under pressure.\nThe United States and China, moreover, have a profound obligation to themselves and the world to collaborate to reduce AI risks. Following the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, the United States and the Soviet Union built guardrails around their nuclear competition. They cooperated on negotiations for the 1970 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, recognizing that an uncontrolled race to the nuclear frontier could send humanity hurtling off a cliff. Washington and Beijing today need to chart a similarly narrow path between AI competition and collaboration. They could start with a bilateral agreement to share AI incident information and exchange best practices on AI safety, control, and alignment with human values. Further talks should focus on how to handle scenarios of misused or uncontrolled AGI.\nThe notion of a singular AI race between the United States and China fails to capture the true complexity of the rivalry unfolding today. The challenge is to win not one definitive contest but a multifront competition whose outcome will shape the international balance of power. Navigating these deeply intertwined domains of technological and strategic AI competition demands that Washington adopt a holistic strategy. Without it, success in one race could create vulnerabilities in another—and neglecting any of them risks irreparably weakening the United States’ global position.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "North Korea’s Second Chance?", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/north-korea/north-koreas-second-chance", "text": "Since coming to office in January, U.S. President Donald Trump has waded into several geopolitical crises, including Russia’s war in Ukraine and Israel’s wars in Gaza and Iran. Thus far, however, he has said comparatively little about the growing strength of the Kim regime in North Korea, leading some analysts to suggest the administration is neglecting one of the most critical security issues in Asia.\nBut Trump has not forgotten about North Korea. Although his administration has been preoccupied with other immediate priorities, there are multiple indications that reviving talks with Pyongyang remains high on the president’s agenda. Soon after his inauguration, for instance, Trump told Fox News that he would “reach out” to North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, whom he described as a “smart guy.” In late March, Trump told reporters he was in “communication” with North Korea and intended to “do something” regarding the country “at some point.” Moreover, Trump’s foreign policy team includes several Korea specialists in key roles at the State Department, such as Allison Hooker and Kevin Kim.\nIn fact, there are several reasons to think that renewed talks between Washington and Pyongyang might now lead to a deal. For Trump, it would offer an opportunity for a foreign policy success that has proved elusive so far in the cases of Ukraine and the Middle East. It is also worth recalling that Trump has unfinished business with North Korea. During his first administration, Trump met with Kim but was unable to finalize a deal; his return to office gives him a second chance. For its part, the North Korean regime is considerably stronger than it was a few years ago, but it also knows that its position could soon change—most notably with respect to Russia. Furthermore, there is already a template for a plausible “small” deal between North Korea and the United States that, while imperfect, could provide a way forward. It will not be easy, of course, but there are several factors now at play that could draw North Korea back to the negotiating table.\nCHANGING FORTUNES\nTo understand what a Trump deal with North Korea might look like, it is useful to consider the president’s earlier engagement with the Kim regime. In February 2019, Trump met Kim at a summit meeting in Hanoi, during which the two sides tried to achieve a so-called small deal. According to the U.S. proposal, North Korea would dismantle all of its known nuclear facilities in exchange for the UN lifting—or at least significantly relaxing—Security Council sanctions, bringing much-needed relief to the North Korean economy. This was known as a “small” deal because North Korea would still retain some nuclear weapons. It was not, in other words, calling for a “complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization,” which is known as the “big deal.”\nAt the time, Pyongyang was in a tough spot, and it appeared that the Trump administration had real leverage. Kim was facing the Security Council’s newly imposed harsh sanctions regime that was vigorously enforced not only by the United States but also by China and Russia, which were more concerned then about nonproliferation than about maintaining stability in Northeast Asia. For a brief moment, the sanctions deprived North Korea of foreign assistance and pushed the country into a corner: its economy shrank 4.1 percent in 2018. Reaching an agreement with the United States seemed almost to be a matter of survival for North Korea.\nNonetheless, North Korea did not buckle in Hanoi. The two sides were unable to agree on the precise scale of concessions that North Korea would have to make and on the list of facilities to be dismantled. The North Koreans were ready to dismantle all facilities at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center, which had been North Korea’s key nuclear research facility for decades, but the U.S. side was aware of additional uranium enrichment plants in other locations and insisted on also including them. The talks collapsed almost immediately.\nNorth Korea has signaled since Trump returned to office that it is ready to play ball.\nSince then, North Korea has become far stronger. Following the failed summit, North Korea didn’t crumble under the weight of sanctions but instead ended up benefiting from a series of unforeseen geopolitical shifts as both China and Russia sought to improve relations with Pyongyang.\nFirst, around 2019, Beijing began relaxing its attitude toward Pyongyang. North Korea’s nuclear program had long been a source of tension between Beijing and Pyongyang, but as China’s conflict with the United States kicked into high gear, Beijing started seeing its shared border with North Korea as a vital buffer zone protecting China’s northeast. Beijing has since seemed determined to keep North Korea afloat, providing it with moderate but essentially unconditional aid.\nNorth Korea’s sudden windfall from Russia was even less anticipated than its renewed ties with China. Once the war in Ukraine began, in February 2022, the Russian military faced a severe shortage of heavy artillery shells. Moscow, however, soon discovered that North Korea not only had massive stockpiles of such ammunition but was also willing to supply them to Russia for an undisclosed, hefty price. By October 2024, North Korea’s accumulated revenues from these sales were estimated at $5.5 billion—and that is a conservative estimate. To put this figure in context, in 2016, before the sanctions hit, North Korea’s total exports were estimated to be $2.5 billion. North Korea and Russia also entered a formal military alliance in 2024, and shortly thereafter, Pyongyang sent some 12,000 North Korean soldiers to Russia to fight against Ukrainian forces—in exchange for further financial payments from Moscow.\nMeanwhile, North Korea’s nuclear arsenal has grown rapidly. Since the Hanoi summit, North Korea has developed and successfully tested a number of new long-distance delivery systems, including the solid-fuel Hwasong-19, a new intercontinental ballistic missile that can be prepared for launch in minutes and can hit any target in the continental United States. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has estimated that North Korea currently has an arsenal of about 50 nuclear warheads. And according to the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, North Korea stands in its “strongest strategic position” in decades. As the political scientist Victor Cha recently wrote in Foreign Affairs, should the Trump administration meet the Kim regime again at the negotiating table, “Washington may have to offer Pyongyang big concessions.” But despite Washington’s reduced leverage, there are reasons to believe some version of a small deal might still be within reach.\nWRITING ON THE WALL\nFor starters, North Korea has signaled since Trump returned to office that it is ready to play ball. According to several sources, North Korean officials and diplomats have in recent weeks told their contacts in a number of countries that they would like to resume talks with the United States. This tracks with other signs from Pyongyang, including a softening tone in official North Korean media channels.\nFrom Pyongyang’s perspective, reviving the main contours of a small deal would be attractive for two simple reasons. Most immediately, North Korea’s current level of trade with Russia is unlikely to last after hostilities in Ukraine end. Indeed, Moscow’s financial flows to Pyongyang could wind down almost overnight. Aside from munitions, there isn’t much of a trade opportunity between the two countries; the two economies are fundamentally incompatible. The few items North Korea can sell on the international market, such as minerals and seafood, are of little interest to Russian importers. This economic mismatch has undermined numerous past attempts to boost economic cooperation between the two countries. For decades, trade between North Korea and Russia has followed the same pattern, flourishing only when Moscow is willing to subsidize it—a reality that is not lost on decision-makers in Pyongyang.\nIf and when Russia’s war in Ukraine ends, China’s support would likely continue—but North Korea is probably not thrilled at the prospect of being overly reliant on its giant neighbor. North Korea’s decision-makers have always viewed China as a threat because it is the only country that might have both the will and the means to meddle with North Korean domestic politics. Indeed, Pyongyang has consistently tried to keep some distance from Beijing. This trend has become even more pronounced under Kim’s leadership. When Jang Song Thaek, Kim’s leading adviser, was purged and executed in 2013, for instance, one of the accusations against him published in North Korean media was his alleged willingness to make concessions to China.\nRather than rely solely on China, Pyongyang would much prefer to diversify its aid sources—something it could do if the Hanoi deal were revived and the UN sanctions were finally relaxed. South Korea’s newly elected president, Lee Jae-myung, for instance, might be willing to bring back the progressive tradition in South Korea of showering North Korea with aid and subsidized trade deals. If sanctions were lifted, the North Korean government could also resume talks with Japan. For years, the two countries have discussed compensation for abuses committed during Japan’s colonial rule of Korea (1910–45), a period that was marked by the use of forced labor, the extraction of mineral resources, and discrimination against the local population.\nThis freedom to maneuver both geopolitically and economically should be a strong incentive for the Kim regime. Accepting a Trump deal, in other words, would both alleviate some long-standing economic pressures and allow Pyongyang to return to its preferred strategy of exploiting great-power rivalries to its advantage.\nTHE LEAST BAD OPTION\nA small deal has serious shortcomings for both North Korea and the United States, but it still might be the least bad option. Such a deal is not going to bring about North Korea’s denuclearization, of course, and Pyongyang will likely attempt to cheat by hiding some of its nuclear facilities. But a small deal could still slow down—or perhaps even halt—the further advancement of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. By dismantling North Korea’s nuclear reactors and most or even all of its centrifuges, such a deal would cause producers to lose most of their R & D and production capacity. This would drastically reduce the number of nuclear devices North Korea could produce and also significantly slow its technological progress regarding weapons of mass destruction. Given the progress North Korea has made since 2019, however, Pyongyang would still retain a nuclear arsenal formidable enough to make any foreign attack unthinkable. Its security, in other words, would not be meaningfully endangered by a small deal.\nNorth Korean decision-makers might also see this particular moment, with the Trump administration in power, as Pyongyang’s best opportunity to find relief from UN sanctions. North Korean officials are generally skeptical that agreements with democratic countries will last. They assume that if the ruling party changes in the next presidential election, any prior agreements will be tossed into the wastebasket, as happened, for example, with the Iran nuclear deal that was painstakingly negotiated by the Obama administration but thrown out by Trump. Still, if the sanctions were lifted now, North Korea could reasonably hope they won’t be reimposed. Even if, say, a Democrat wins the U.S. presidential election in 2028 and decides to renege on a small deal by pursuing new rounds of sanctions against North Korea, the new administration would have great difficulty getting China and Russia on board, as both countries now believe their interests are better served by maintaining North Korea’s status quo rather than working toward its denuclearization. North Korea’s leadership thus has valid reasons to consider the proposals that may come from a second Trump administration.\nIt is worth remembering, of course, that should negotiations resume, North Korea is likely to take a much tougher stance, and the Trump administration will probably have to accept a worse deal than the one it proposed in Hanoi. But North Korea knows that it lucked out the last time around and didn’t end up paying a hefty price for walking away—saved, as it was, by China’s tensions with the United States and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Now, however, Pyongyang should be interested in a deal that grants it greater economic autonomy as well as distance from potentially dangerous neighbors. It might be interested in a deal, in other words, in case its luck runs out.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "AI and the Trust Revolution", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/artificial-intelligence-and-trust-revolution-technology-transforming-human-connections", "text": "When experts worry about young people’s relationship with information online, they typically assume that young people are not as media literate as their elders. But ethnographic research conducted by Jigsaw—Google’s technology incubator—reveals a more complex and subtle reality: members of Gen Z, typically understood to be people born after 1997 and before 2012, have developed distinctly different strategies for evaluating information online, ones that would bewilder anyone over 30. They do not consume news as their elders would—namely, by first reading a headline and then the story. They do typically read the headlines first, but then they jump to the online comments associated with the article, and only afterward delve into the body of the news story. That peculiar tendency is revealing. Young people do not trust that a story is credible simply because an expert, editorial gatekeeper, or other authority figure endorses it; they prefer to consult a crowd of peers to assess its trustworthiness. Even as young people mistrust institutions and figures of authority, the era of the social web allows them to repose their trust in the anonymous crowd.\nA subsequent Jigsaw study in the summer of 2023, following the release of the artificial intelligence program ChatGPT, explored how members of Gen Z in India and the United States use AI chatbots. The study found that young people were quick to consult the chatbots for medical advice, relationship counseling, and stock tips, since they thought that AI was easy to access, would not judge them, and was responsive to their personal needs—and that, in many of these respects, AI advice was better than advice they received from humans. In another study, the consulting firm Oliver Wyman found a similar pattern: as many as 39 percent of Gen Z employees around the world would prefer to have an AI colleague or manager instead of a human one; for Gen Z workers in the United States, that figure is 36 percent. A quarter of all employees in the United States feel the same way, suggesting that these attitudes are not only the province of the young.\nSuch findings challenge conventional notions about the importance and sanctity of interpersonal interactions. Many older observers lament the rise of chatbots, seeing the new technology as guilty of atomizing people and alienating them from larger society, encouraging a growing distance between individuals and a loss of respect for authority. But seen another way, the behavior and preferences of Gen Z also point to something else: a reconfiguration of trust that carries some seeds of hope.\nAnalysts are thinking about trust incorrectly. The prevailing view holds that trust in societal institutions is crumbling in Western countries today, a mere two percent of Americans say they trust Congress, for example, compared with 77 percent six decades ago; although 55 percent of Americans trusted the media in 1999, only 32 percent do so today. Indeed, earlier this year, the pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson concluded that “what unites us [Americans], increasingly, is what we distrust.”\nBut such data tells only half the tale. The picture does seem dire if viewed through the twentieth-century lens of traditional polling that asks people how they feel about institutions and authority figures. But look through an anthropological or ethnographic lens—tracking what people do rather than what they simply tell pollsters—and a very different picture emerges. Trust is not necessarily disappearing in the modern world; it’s migrating. With each new technological innovation, people are turning away from traditional structures of authority and toward the crowd, the amorphous but very real world of people and information just a few taps away.\nThis shift poses dangers that nobody should minimize. The risks of overdependence and reality distortion from AI companions are already evident: studies show that their intensive use is associated with decreased well-being and emotional dependency in socially isolated users. But the shift could also deliver benefits. Although people who are not digital natives might consider it risky to trust a bot, the fact is that many in Gen Z seem to think that it is as risky (if not riskier) to trust human authority figures. If AI tools are designed carefully, they might potentially help—not harm—interpersonal interactions: they can serve as mediators, helping polarized groups communicate better with one another; they can potentially counter conspiracy theories more effectively than human authority figures; they can also provide a sense of agency to people who are suspicious of human experts. The challenge for policymakers, citizens, and tech companies alike is to recognize how the nature of trust is evolving and then design AI tools and policies in response to this transformation. Younger generations will not act like their elders, and it is unwise to ignore the tremendous change they are ushering in.\nTRUST FALL\nTrust is a basic human need: it glues people and groups together and is the foundation for democracy, markets, and most aspects of social life today. It operates in several forms. The first and simplest type of trust is that between individuals, the face-to-face knowledge that often binds small groups together through direct personal links. Call this “eye-contact trust.” It is found in most nonindustrialized settings (of the sort often studied by anthropologists) and also in the industrialized world (among groups of friends, colleagues, schoolmates, and family members).\nWhen groups grow big, however, face-to-face interactions become insufficient. As Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary biologist, has noted, the number of people a human brain can genuinely know is limited; Dunbar reckoned the number was around 150. “Vertical trust” was the great innovation of the last few millennia, allowing larger societies to function through institutions such as governments, capital markets, the academy, and organized religion. These rules-based, collective, norm-enforcing, resource-allocating systems shape how and where people direct their trust.\nThe digitization of society over the past two decades has enabled a new paradigm shift beyond eye-contact and vertical trust to what the social scientist Rachel Botsman calls “distributed trust,” or large-scale, peer-to-peer interactions. That is because the Internet enables interactions between groups without eye contact. For the first time, complete strangers can coordinate with one another for travel through an app such as Airbnb, trade through eBay, entertain one another by playing multiplayer video games such as Fortnite, and even find love through sites such as Match.com.\nTo some, these connections might seem untrustworthy, since it is easy to create fake digital personas, and no single authority exists to impose and enforce rules online. But many people nevertheless act as if they do trust the crowd, partly because mechanisms have arisen that bolster trust, such as social media profiles, “friending,” crowd affirmation tools, and online peer reviews that provide some version of oversight. Consider the ride-sharing app Uber. Two decades ago, it would have seemed inconceivable to build a taxi service that encourages strangers to get into one another’s private cars; people did not trust strangers in that way. But today, millions do that, not just because people trust Uber, as an institution, but because a peer-to-peer ratings system—the surveillance of the crowd—reassures both passengers and drivers. Over time and with the impetus of new technology, trust patterns can shift.\nNO JUDGMENT\nAI offers a new twist in this tale, one that could be understood as a novel form of trust. The technology has long been quietly embedded in daily lives, in tools such as spell checkers and spam filters. But the recent emergence of generative AI marks a distinct shift. AI systems now boast sophisticated reasoning and can act as agents, executing complex tasks autonomously. This sounds terrifying to some; indeed, an opinion poll from Pew suggests that only 24 percent of Americans think that AI will benefit them, and 43 percent expect to see it “harm” them.\nBut American attitudes toward AI are not universally shared. A 2024 Ipsos poll found that although around two-thirds of adults in Australia, Canada, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States agreed that AI “makes them nervous,” a mere 29 percent of Japanese adults shared that view, as did only around 40 percent of adults in Indonesia, Poland, and South Korea. And although only about a third of people in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States agreed that they were excited about AI, almost half of people in Japan and three-quarters in South Korea and Indonesia did.\nMeanwhile, although people in Europe and North America tell pollsters that they fear AI, they constantly use it for complex tasks in their lives, such as getting directions with maps, identifying items while shopping, and fine-tuning writing. Convenience is one reason: getting hold of a human doctor can take a long time, but AI bots are always available. Customization is another. In earlier generations, consumers tended to accept “one size fits all” services. But in the twenty-first century, digitization has enabled people to make more personalized choices in the consumer world, whether with music, media, or food. AI bots respond to and encourage this growing desire for customization.\nAnother, more counterintuitive factor is privacy and neutrality. In recent years, there has been widespread concern in the West that AI tools will “steal” personal data or perform with bias. This may sometimes be justified. Ethnographic research suggests, however, that a cohort of users prefer AI tools precisely because they seem more “neutral,” less controlling, and less intrusive than humans. One of the Gen Zers interviewed by Jigsaw explained her affinity for talking to AI in blunt terms: “The chatbot can’t ‘cancel’ me!”\nAnother recent study of people who believe conspiracy theories found that they were far more willing to discuss their beliefs with a bot than with family members or traditional authority figures, even when the bots challenged their ideas, which suggests one way that human-machine interactions can trump eye-contact and vertical trust mechanisms. As one person told the researchers: “Now this is the very first time I have gotten a response that made real, logical, sense.” For people who feel marginalized, powerless, or cut off from the elite—like much of Gen Z—bots seem less judgmental than humans and thus give their users more agency. Perhaps perversely, that makes them easier to trust.\nFROM HAL TO HABERMAS\nThis pattern might yet shift again, given the speed of technological change and the rise of “agentic intelligence,” the more sophisticated and autonomous successor to today’s generative AI tools. The major AI developers, including Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI, are all advancing toward new “universal assistants” capable of seeing, hearing, chatting, reasoning, remembering, and taking action across devices. This means that AI tools will be able to make complex decisions without direct human supervision, which will allow them to bolster customer support (with chatbots that can meet customer needs) and coding (with agents who can help engineers with software development tasks).\nNew generations of AI tools are also gaining stronger persuasive capabilities, and in some contexts they seem to be as persuasive as humans. This invites obvious dangers if these tools are deliberately created and used to manipulate people—or if they simply misfire or hallucinate. Nobody should downplay those risks. Thoughtful design, however, can potentially mitigate this: for example, researchers at Google have shown that it is possible to develop tools and prompts that train the AI to identify and avoid manipulative language. And as with existing apps and digital tools, agentic AI allows users to exercise control. Consider wearable technology, such as a Fitbit or an Apple Watch, that can monitor vital signs, detect concerning patterns, recommend behavioral changes, and even alert health-care providers if necessary. In all these cases, it is the user, not the bot, who decides whether to respond to such prompts and which data will be used in the AI programs; your Fitbit cannot force you to go jogging. So, too, with financial planning bots or those used for dating: technology is not acting like a dictator but like a member of an online crowd of friends, offering tips that can be rejected or accepted.\nHaving an AI tool act in this way can obviously make people more efficient and also help them better organize their lives. But what is less evident is that these tools can potentially also improve peer-to-peer interaction within and between groups. As trust in authority figures has faded and people have tried to customize their information sources and online “crowd” to their individual tastes, societies have become more polarized, trapped in echo chambers that do not interact or understand each other. Human authority figures cannot easily remedy that, given widespread distrust. But just as AI tools can translate between languages, they are also starting to have the potential to translate between “social languages”: that is, between worldviews. A bot can scan online conversations between different groups and find patterns and points of common interest that can be turned into prompts that potentially enable one “crowd” of people to “hear” and even “understand” others’ worldviews better. For instance, researchers from Google DeepMind and the University of Oxford have developed an AI tool called the “Habermas Machine” (an homage to the German philosopher Jürgen Habermas) that aspires to mediate disputes between groups with opposing political perspectives. It generates statements that reflect both the majority and the minority viewpoints in a group that relate to a political issue and then proposes areas of common ground. In studies involving over 5,000 participants, the AI-generated statements were preferred over those created by human mediators, and using them led to greater agreement about paths forward on divisive issues.\nFor people who feel marginalized, bots seem less judgmental than humans.\nSo how can societies reap the benefits of AI without falling prey to its dangers? First, they need to recognize that trust is a multifaceted phenomenon that has shifted before (and will keep shifting) and that technological change is occurring amid (and exacerbating) social flux. That means AI developers need to proceed very cautiously and humbly, discussing and mitigating the risks of the tools they develop. Google, for its part, has tried to do this by publishing an ambitious 300-page collection of recommendations about the ethical labyrinth of advanced AI assistants, exploring how to maintain safeguards that prevent AI from emotionally manipulating users, and what it means to measure human well-being. Other firms, such as Anthropic, are doing the same. But much more attention from the private sector is needed to tackle these uncertainties.\nConsumers also need real choice among developers, so that they can select the platforms that offer the most privacy, transparency, and user control. Governments can encourage this by using public policy to promote responsible AI development, as well as open science and open software. This approach can create some safety risks. But it also creates more checks and balances by injecting competition between different systems. Just as customers can “shop around” for banks or telecom services if they dislike how one system treats them, they should be able to switch between AI agents to determine which platform offers them the most control.\nIncreasing human agency should be the goal when thinking about how people interact with AI platforms. Instead of viewing AI as a despotic, robotic overlord, developers need to present it more as a superintelligent member of people’s existing online crowds. That does not mean people place blind faith in AI or use it to displace human-to-human interactions; that would be disastrous. But it would be equally foolish to reject AI simply because it seems alien. AI, like humans, has the potential to do good and bad and to act in trustworthy and untrustworthy ways. If we want to unlock the full benefits of AI, we need to recognize that we live in a world where trust in leaders is crumbling, even as we put more faith in the wisdom of crowds—and ourselves. The challenge, then, is to use this digital boost to the wisdom of crowds to make us all wiser.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "The Islamic Republic’s New Lease on Life", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/israel/islamic-republics-new-lease-life", "text": "Israel’s June 13 assault on Iran, designed to decapitate Tehran’s military and nuclear program, is one of the worst setbacks the Islamic Republic has ever experienced. In less than two weeks, the Israel Defense Forces managed to assassinate dozens of senior Iranian commanders and nuclear scientists. The IDF destroyed many of Iran’s air defense systems and damaged its nuclear facilities. Israel bombed Iran’s energy infrastructure, military bases, and various missile production sites. The strikes were precise, indicating that Israeli intelligence had penetrated the highest levels of Iran’s armed forces and government. And toward the end of the attacks, the United States joined in. As a result, the Iranian military is weaker now than it was just a month earlier.\nBut instead of collapsing under the shock, the Islamic Republic appears to have gained a new lease on life. The strikes caused a rally-around-the-flag effect as Iranians condemned them and celebrated the government’s response. The Iranian regime mourned its lost officials but swiftly replaced them. The operations thus made the Iranian nation more cohesive and strengthened the hand of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\nIranian society is unlikely to become more rigidly Islamist in response to the strikes. To maintain internal stability, the government might even tolerate more social freedoms. But the regime will probably become more repressive, arresting anyone it sees as a traitor. And critically, Iranians may be more willing to accept the state as it is. The country could now have a new social contract, one that prioritizes national security above everything else.\nIran’s national security strategy, however, remains broadly unchanged. The Islamic Republic may be weaker in some ways, but its leaders are proud of having withstood the Israeli and American assaults. They see the substantial damage they inflicted on Israel’s cities as a major achievement. And they continue to believe that demonstrating resolve in the face of aggression is the only way to deter their opponents. Iranian leaders will thus set out to rebuild the country’s network of proxies: the so-called axis of resistance. They will trust diplomacy even less than before. Instead, they will lay the groundwork for a long war of attrition with Israel—and a potential nuclear breakout.\nUNITE AND FIGHT\nIn the weeks before Israel attacked Iran, it seemed as if Tehran and Washington might peacefully resolve their dispute over Iran’s nuclear program. For the first time since abandoning the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2018, the nuclear deal that Iran had reached with the United States and other major countries three years earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump’s team indicated it was willing to accept an arrangement in which Iran would be able to enrich uranium up to 3.67 percent—the level the United States agreed to under the JCPOA—rather than no enrichment at all. Tehran, for its part, was once again open to speaking directly to American officials rather than exclusively through mediators. Some analysts believed a new nuclear agreement could be near.\nBut as negotiations progressed, the Trump administration began walking back its initial flexibility, oscillating between demanding zero enrichment and the full dismantlement of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Israel, meanwhile, steadily degraded Tehran’s position by picking apart Hezbollah (Tehran’s most powerful partner), tearing through Hamas, and taking out some of Iran’s air defenses. The Islamic Republic grew even weaker in December, when rebels toppled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, another faithful Iranian ally. Eventually, a sense of resignation took hold in Tehran: many officials and analysts alike came to believe that—deal or no deal—Israel, the United States, or both would attack.\nTehran still proceeded with caution. It knew that its people were seething after decades of repression and that it risked even more domestic anger if it provoked a direct confrontation with Washington. Iranian officials thus stayed at the negotiating table, hoping to avoid an assault while trying to shore up their domestic backing—for instance, by suspending enforcement of the unpopular law mandating that women fully cover their hair in public and easing other restrictions on freedom of expression.\nThe Israeli and U.S. attacks led to an outburst of Iranian nationalism.\nIt is unclear how much these steps helped the government when the first Israeli bombs fell. At first, many ordinary Iranians assumed the conflict would be a short confrontation between two governments that was unlikely to affect them. But as the strikes intensified, targeting infrastructure and killing ordinary citizens, many Iranians began to conclude that the attacks were not merely a war against the regime but a war against the nation itself. These sentiments swelled after Trump and Israeli officials urged Tehran’s residents to evacuate their homes. “I’m no fan of the Islamic Republic, but it’s now time to show solidarity for Iran,” one Tehran resident told the Financial Times. “Trump and Netanyahu say ‘evacuate’ as if they care about our health. How can a city of 10 million evacuate? My husband and I are not going to pave the ground for them. Let them kill us.”\nRather than prompting popular outrage at the Iranian state, the attacks led to an outburst of nationalism. As the Islamic Republic weathered Israel’s assault and retaliated with ballistic missiles of its own, the regime’s response was cheered on by Iranian writers, artists, and singers, many of whom are typically apolitical or in opposition to the government. Iranian commentators across the political spectrum likened the Israeli assault to Nazi Germany’s 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, casting the conflict as Iran’s own patriotic war: a national struggle that transcends politics. Even some longtime dissidents and former political prisoners joined in. For instance, hundreds of political and civil rights activists—many of whom have been previously imprisoned—condemned Israel’s attacks in a joint statement. “In defense of our homeland’s territorial integrity, independence, national defense capabilities, … we stand united and resolute,” it declared. These actors carefully kept some distance from the regime. But their emphasis on solidarity aligned with the government’s message. Israel’s strikes thus relieved some of the internal pressure on the Islamic Republic.\nThe Iranian government is likely to use this respite to accelerate its militarization in preparation for sustained conflict. Less constrained by domestic pressure, it will channel resources into the IRGC and other armed forces and security agencies, especially since many in Tehran expect the fragile cease-fire to collapse at any moment. But it will struggle to prove that it can handle another war, especially given the extent to which its ranks have been penetrated by Israeli intelligence operatives. Critics have accused the regime of prioritizing ideological loyalty over competence, allowing individuals who simply mouthed hard-line slogans to rise through the ranks while concealing their true allegiances. Others point out the irony that, as the government fixated on enforcing the veiling law and cracking down on political dissidents under the pretext of fighting foreign subversion, its actual adversaries were quietly infiltrating its most sensitive institutions.\nThe resulting fallout has triggered calls for investigations, accountability, and even the resignation of the senior officials accused of overseeing such a catastrophic intelligence failure. Whether any top official will actually face consequences remains to be seen. But one response already appears certain: Tehran is likely to launch internal purges, expand its surveillance apparatus, and rely on ordinary citizens to participate in monitoring and reporting suspicious activities.\nIran has been summarily executing those it accuses of collaborating with Israel.\nStill, the country’s leaders are trying to keep the country’s society unified. Pro-government preachers across the country have suddenly begun blending iconic, pre-revolutionary patriotic songs into Shiite religious rituals—a mix of nationalism and Islamism that the regime historically avoided but now appears eager to embrace. Similarly, state-controlled media and municipal officials are now invoking pre-Islamic Persian mythology in their messaging, linking legendary figures to slain IRGC commanders. This cocktail has drawn mixed reactions, with many skeptical Iranians arguing that the gestures are merely opportunistic. Yet other citizens are joining in, having concluded that they must confront these external threats with the government they have, not the one they want.\nSome Iranians believe that to make sure today’s social cohesion lasts into the future, senior officials will take steps to moderate. The government, after all, has acknowledged the support of Iranians who have historically opposed the regime and, implicitly conceding past mistakes, promised better treatment of the population. It might release political prisoners and repair relations with sidelined moderate figures, including former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani, to project national unity. It could also continue to let women go unveiled and allow for more free expression. It has already marginalized some hard-liners, who had pushed for Iran to attack Israel before June 13. (Some of these figures and analysts had argued that the country was already at war and thus needed to strike, even though doing so risked further upsetting an already fractured populace.)\nBut whether the government’s promise of moderation signals a genuine opening remains unclear. Many Iranians believe the government will instead double down on its hard-line stance, viewing reconciliation as too risky in wartime and expecting that the wave of nationalist solidarity will allow them to be more repressive while limiting blowback. The state, for example, has been summarily executing those it accuses of collaborating with Israel. It has established checkpoints across major cities to arrest suspected collaborators, as it did during the 1980s—the last time Iran was subjected to similar kinds of attacks. The regime could also mix and match, liberalizing in some respects while growing more restrictive in others. Iranians, after all, are ambivalent about the state’s reaction. “It’s unsettling, but also somewhat reassuring to see them near my house,” a different Tehran resident told the Financial Times, referring to the IRGC paramilitary volunteers. “I could never imagine seeing Basijis and feeling happy.”\nSTAY THE COURSE\nIsraeli and U.S. officials are, of course, focused more on whether Tehran is a threat to them than whether it is a threat to its people. And after a year and a half of indirect and direct conflict, many of them believe the regime is nowhere near as menacing as it was before. According to these commentators, Iran’s aggressive Middle East strategy has been a failure, given the collapse of Hezbollah in Lebanon, Assad in Syria, and Hamas in Gaza—plus the damage to Iran’s own military.\nThe IRGC, however, sees the situation differently. Its leaders believe the country’s forward defense strategy—fighting adversaries by conducting asymmetric warfare near or within their borders rather than on Iranian soil—has been vindicated. This approach successfully deterred Israel and the United States from attacking for years and thus bought Tehran critical time to build up the industrial infrastructure, technical expertise, and institutional resilience it can now use to rapidly rebuild its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, even after the devastating bombings.\nIRGC leaders had argued for years that they needed to take the fight abroad to protect the nation—claiming, for example, that failing to shore up Assad in Damascus would lead to strikes in Tehran. In a sense, they have now been proved correct. Iran had designed its regional posture to create layers of defense in the form of its various partners, believing that this network would force adversaries to penetrate multiple fronts before striking the homeland. That, of course, is exactly what Israel did. In other words, the way the war has played out allows the IRGC and its hard-line allies in the regime to assert that their strategy worked as intended. This argument is easy to rebut: the layered defense delayed, but did not prevent. attacks on Iranian soil. But for Tehran, that delay is precisely the point: it bought the government time to prepare, learn from Israel’s tactics, and cast the war as an existential national struggle.\nIran is therefore unlikely to behave much differently after this attack, although it will make some adjustments to reflect the realities that have emerged in the past year and a half. The regime could look to reconstitute the axis of resistance by rebuilding Hezbollah as a more agile, small force closer to its original form rather than as the quasi army it had become. (It would still equip the group with advanced missile capabilities.) In Syria, Tehran will try to take advantage of the current power vacuum by empowering grassroots militant groups. Neither of these steps will be easy: Hezbollah is under pressure from Lebanese officials and continues to suffer Israeli bombardment, and the new Syrian government, which is consolidating control over its territory, is hostile to Iran and has begun moving closer to Israel. Still, Tehran sees openings. The war in Gaza has fueled widespread anger toward Israel across the region, driving bottom-up demand for renewed resistance to the Islamic Republic’s enemy. In fact, Iran’s survival and its missile strikes on Israeli territory have also earned it admiration among many Arab populations.\nTehran will likely continue to pursue nuclear ambiguity.\nTehran, meanwhile, is more skeptical of diplomacy than ever. The shock of the attacks—which included the assassination of senior IRGC commanders and a failed attempt to kill a key nuclear negotiator, Ali Shamkhani—has drained away whatever credibility American assurances might once have had. In the past, Iran distrusted Washington but saw talks as a potential avenue for sanctions relief and de-escalation. Now, Iranian officials will not only assume that the United States will violate any agreement but also that negotiations are a cover for coercion or military action, given that Israel’s attack occurred just two days before scheduled talks between Tehran and Washington. Nevertheless, Iran is likely to remain engaged, combining maximum resistance to the regional order with maximum diplomacy, in order to communicate its redlines and further expose what it views as the West’s bad faith. By doing so, Tehran can justify its behavior to both internal and external audiences and put pressure on Israel and the United States.\nStill, Iran does not appear to be rushing toward the bomb. By crossing the nuclear threshold, Tehran would validate the very accusations it has long denied and risk triggering a larger conflict with U.S. forces. Iran also does not see nuclear weapons as a substitute for a strong conventional military. It is a large country that has porous borders with multiple unstable neighbors. It is involved in overlapping territorial disputes about oil fields, water resources, and maritime boundaries. These external challenges are compounded by Iran’s internal vulnerabilities, including chronic ethnic tensions along its periphery. And it has a long history of enduring foreign invasions and meddling. There is a reason why generations of Iranian leaders have invested extensively in building a conventional military, regardless of the type of regime.\nInstead of rushing for a bomb, Tehran will likely continue to pursue nuclear ambiguity, suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Doing so will also pressure the IAEA to lobby against future attacks on Iran, since the agency can resume inspections only if Iran’s nuclear sites are no longer under threat. Tehran believes this approach, which conceals its enrichment activity, will also provide it with greater flexibility to advance its program without notice. And it sees the suspension as a just comeuppance for the IAEA: Iranian officials are incensed that the agency has not condemned the Israeli and American attacks even though Iran is a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (from which it has threatened to withdraw), which guarantees members the peaceful use of nuclear energy. In fact, Iranian officials believe the IAEA gave Israel and the United States useful intelligence and was exploited to justify the attacks. As Tehran pointed out, the agency released a report just a few days before the attack, declaring that Iran’s cooperation with IAEA inspectors was “less than satisfactory.”\nThat doesn’t mean Iran will eventually build a nuclear weapon. Whether or when the country will obtain the ultimate deterrent remains an open question. But what is clear is this: Iran is unbowed and unlikely to behave differently than it did before. That means Israel may decide to strike again. Iran could swiftly retaliate. The conflict between these parties is far from over, and the Middle East should expect more turbulence ahead.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "How Trump Can Finish the Job in Iran—and the Middle East", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/how-trump-can-finish-job-iran-and-middle-east", "text": "Since taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump has gone for gold in the Middle East. He launched a dramatic military operation against Iran’s nuclear program, building on the broader dismantling of the country’s regional power. He then brokered a cease-fire between Israel and Iran and indicated a willingness to talk with the Iranian government. These outcomes have provided hope that if the United States can focus on the essential—the continued containment and further weakening of Iran—and avoid overcommitment to myriad other regional policy objectives, the Middle East might finally have the stability and normalcy it has long lacked.\nBut the region has seen similar optimism: after the Yom Kippur War in 1974, the defeat of Iran and then Iraq from 1988 to 1991, and after the takedown of the Taliban in 2001. In each case, the Middle East had reached a critical point of danger, prompting successful American intervention, followed by diplomatic campaigns to lock in these moments of stability. The Camp David accords, for instance, normalized relations between Egypt and Israel, and Israel and Jordan later signed a peace treaty of their own.\nYet after brief periods of peace, the region has always devolved back into chaos. First came the Iranian revolution and Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. The Oslo accords, which set up a peace process between the Israelis and the Palestinians, ultimately collapsed after 2000. The American invasion of Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks, like the Soviet one before it, stretched on for years, and it ultimately ended with the Taliban back in power. The invasion of Iraq heralded two decades of conflict, including indirect fighting with Iran and direct combat against the al-Qaeda offshoot the Islamic State, or ISIS.\nThis history represents decades-long American policy failures. For years, the United States has managed to secure the Middle East from hostile dominance, but containment policy there differed dramatically from that in Asia and Europe. Asian and European states eventually established stable domestic institutions and regional cooperation systems, leaving the United States to focus on organizing collective security against China and Russia. In the Middle East, however, the United States has had to intervene repeatedly in internal and regional conflicts that undercut stability and containment—even after the Soviet Union passed from the scene.\nThis time, though, the situation may well be different. Thanks to a year and a half of war, Iran and its proxies are very weak. New leaders are reshaping the region’s power dynamics in Tehran’s absence. The Trump administration thus has a chance to do what its predecessors could not and truly stabilize the region.\nUNDER NEW MANAGEMENT\nSince the collapse of ISIS, Iran has been the Middle East’s primary generator of regional instability. Its proxy groups have unleashed attacks on Israel, U.S. forces, Arab Gulf states, and commercial ships in the Red Sea. But after Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, Tehran’s tools have largely evaporated. Hamas and Hezbollah were significantly degraded by Israel’s offensives. Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria collapsed, and Iran’s nuclear, offensive missile, and air defense systems have been demolished by Israel and the United States. Iran can still count on its influence in Iraq and on the Houthis, and it has at least the remnants of its nuclear program. But it cannot erase the reality that these setbacks are its fault, first by allowing its proxies to attack Israel and then by joining in the fight directly, in 2024. As a result, the path toward regional stability is now much smoother.\nTehran’s decline has coincided with the rise of new power brokers in the Middle East. Israel, Turkey, and the Gulf states have become major international players, integrating themselves into the global economy and making internal reforms that both advance and reflect their more cosmopolitan populations and economies. Other than Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the region’s leaders have not abandoned formal and informal relations with Israel over the huge civilian losses in Gaza. Arab leaders have demonstrated this new self-confidence by largely embracing the new Syrian government, choosing to look past President Ahmed al-Shara’s terrorist history and coordinating with Erdogan to push an initially reticent Trump administration to embrace Damascus’s leader.\nFor its part, the United States has been playing a far more effective regional role under Presidents Biden and Trump since the outbreak of the war in Gaza. It has neither pivoted away from the region nor dived into every social, political, and security problem. In a speech during his tour of the Middle East in May, Trump declared that the region has the ability to develop prosperity and peace on its own, with only some American support. Trump is handling military threats, if possible, via negotiations. When diplomacy is not possible, he is relying on massive, rapid military force to achieve limited, definable goals that Americans can understand—such as protecting freedom of navigation and stopping the development of an Iranian nuclear bomb. He has, in short, updated the 1980s Powell Doctrine, which held that military force should be a last resort but should be used decisively when necessary, with clear goals supporting national interests and popular support. Trump has benefited from having Steve Witkoff and Tom Barrack as envoys, a knowledgeable team that enjoys his trust. And he does not have to contend as much with Moscow, a perennial troublemaker that has been unable to support its partners in Iran and Syria.\nSECOND TIME’S THE CHARM\nIf this propitious moment holds, the path to lasting stability is to further contain the Iranian threat, with Washington working by, with, and through its partners. Although difficult, this outcome is not impossible. In the 1990s, following its defeat in the Iraq War, Iran was all but supine in the region. The Trump administration thus should pay attention to why Iran broke out after 2000, exacerbating mayhem through the Levant and beyond and building huge nuclear and ballistic missile programs in the face of American, Arab, and Israeli opposition.\nThere are two complementary explanations for what went wrong. The first is that this loose coalition focused on other, ultimately less destabilizing issues, including counterterrorism, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Arab Spring, and Israeli-Palestinian relations. The second is that regional actors disputed the nature of Iran’s threat and so they attempted remedies that were both diverse and ineffective.\nTo handle Tehran, Washington considered both regime change and rapprochement. But ultimately reluctant to address the full dangers Iran posed head on, the United States and others turned to negotiations. They hoped that by treating Iran as normal state, they could both solve specific problems and nudge it toward a broader rapprochement with the region. The assumption here was that when met with enough understanding, dialogue, and concessions, Iran would shed its distrust and insecurity, cease its nuclear and missile projects, and stop inciting its proxy network. This group saw military responses as futile, as Iran was assumed to have escalation dominance. Consequently, Washington and an international coalition struck a nuclear deal with the country in 2015. But the agreement was only temporary, did nothing to constrain Iran’s broader destabilizing behavior, and gave the regime new sources of revenue. As a result, the first Trump administration withdrew in 2018.\nDevelopments in the Middle East since October 7 have demonstrated that Iran will not behave like a normal state, no matter what analysts may wish. Negotiations alone can slow the country down, yet they will not tame it. But decisive military action can cripple Iran’s capabilities and temper its taste for conflict, as Iraq’s offensives and the U.S. confrontation with Iran in the Gulf in 1988, the killing of the Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani by the United States in 2020, and, so far, the Israeli and U.S. military operations all have.\nIn light of this, Washington should prioritize eliminating Iran’s nuclear weapons program and defeating its proxy forces. Victory could lead to comprehensive diplomatic openings or even a different Iran. But renewed dialogue or regime change should not be goals unto themselves. Instead, the United States must focus on making sure Iran retains no nuclear program that it could use to develop weapons.\nSEIZE THE DAY\nTo achieve this aim, Washington should apply economic and, if necessary, military pressure until Iran comes clean on its weaponization programs and abandons all or almost all uranium enrichment for perpetuity. This is the most clear-cut and important mission and one that the United States now completely owns with its decision to use force against Iran. Israel has its own existential interest here, but by necessity it must coordinate with Washington. Critics of military action are correct that the nuclear dispute with Iran will end only with negotiations. But negotiations are not an end in themselves, only a means to prevent any possibility of nuclear weaponization. And in the absence of immense pressure, it will not be achieved.\nWashington must also better calibrate its policies to block Iran’s proxies from returning to Gaza and Syria and to reduce Tehran’s influence in Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen. Proxy pushback is hard, and these countries all have other issues—energy, terrorism, humanitarian relief—that vie for Washington’s attention. But to truly stamp out Iran’s regional influence, the United States must subordinate these concerns and focus on combating Iran’s partners. Regional states, whose security has been repeatedly threatened by instability in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, should play a leading role. Yet Washington must be willing to counter Tehran’s tactic of attacking via its proxies by retaliating not against them but against Iran.\nOutside Iran, the United States should heed Trump’s words and allow regional states to exercise their own agency, as it largely does in Asia and Europe. But there are exceptions—issues that affect overall security and in which Americans can clearly help. One is the Israeli-Palestinian impasse, which although not the core source of regional dysfunction, is significant. Until better managed, beginning with a Gaza settlement, it will be a drain on American and Israeli regional goals, including Arab-Israeli integration. The budding rivalry between the two most powerful regional states, Israel and Turkey, also bears attention. They do not have underlying security conflicts. Instead, their rivalry is partly a function of their two leaders’ mutual animosity and partly the inevitable result of realpolitik. Trump, who works well with both leaders, has an interest in calming their relations.\nThe Middle East requires U.S. engagement in other ways, as well, including ensuring the export of hydrocarbons, maintaining global transport routes, and managing terrorism threats and refugee flows. But the United States now has a chance, in concert with the region’s leaders, to more permanently stabilize the region and dramatically reduce its nonstop diplomatic crisis management and half century of nearly continuous combat operations. It should seize the moment.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "The Fantasy of a Grand Bargain Between America and China", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/fantasy-grand-bargain-between-america-and-china", "text": "Hope springs eternal in the world of great-power diplomacy. Even today, in the throes of a norm-busting trade war with China, there is talk of some kind of leader-to-leader grand bargain between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. Trump says he “would love to get a deal with China.” Xi, who has responded to Trump’s tariff broadside in a measured and targeted way, has left the door open for a negotiated settlement. Such a breakthrough in U.S.-Chinese relations might sound alluring at this particularly fraught moment, but the history of the strategic rivalry between China and the United States and each country’s internal politics make the likelihood of reaching one remote.\nSince 1950, China and the United States have pivoted from cooperation to confrontation and back again, several times. They have done so for geopolitical and domestic political reasons. As a rule, they have been able to cooperate on security only when facing a clear and present danger from a common enemy. U.S. President Richard Nixon’s historic visit to China in 1972, for example, led to a series of agreements aimed at containing the Soviet Union. And the two countries have managed economic cooperation only when both were governed by domestic coalitions that supported the expansion of international trade, as during the 1990s and early 2000s. Cooperation across both security and economic affairs, meanwhile, has always been elusive.\nToday, there is nothing—internationally or domestically—that would suggest this is a propitious moment for China and the United States to transcend their differences in either the security or economic realm. Both countries are currently governed by strident nationalist coalitions, with an antiglobalization backlash dominating domestic politics. There is also no common security threat drawing the two countries together. Indeed, they are more likely to find themselves on opposite sides (or at least at orthogonal purposes) regarding international conflicts, such as those between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Iran. Only once in the past hundred years, at the height of the Cold War in the 1950s and 1960s, did China and the United States find themselves completely at loggerheads on both dimensions of statecraft. With today’s environment becoming more like that one, it is hard to imagine either leader meaningfully resetting relations or addressing any of the major issues dividing them.\nTrump won’t want to play the cards in his hand. If he were to push for a grand bargain, it would almost certainly be a Faustian one for the United States. For Washington to seal any sweeping, across-the-board deal, the United States would likely have to make concessions on Taiwan or on Beijing’s claims in the South China Sea—thus potentially unraveling a security architecture that has underpinned regional stability for decades.\nThe strategic costs to the United States of conceding influence in the region to China far outweigh any potential economic benefits—including increased access to the Chinese market or even resurgent American manufacturing. Given the circumstances, American policymakers should focus on more manageable, critical goals, such as reducing the risk of inadvertent war, particularly in the South China Sea and other flash points. A small but real step back from the brink would be grand indeed.\nUSEFUL ADVERSARIES, USEFUL PARTNERS\nHistory shows that relations between China and the United States sour when the countries do not share a common enemy and when inward-looking, nationalist economic interests are in ascendance in domestic politics. Following the Communist Party’s victory in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, for instance, Americans from Wall Street to Main Street viewed the People’s Republic of China as a key part of the widening global communist threat orchestrated from Moscow. This view crystallized during the Korean War, when the two countries faced off on the battlefield, and it hardened in the 1960s, when the U.S.-Chinese strategic rivalry spread across the developing world as part of the Cold War competition for “hearts and minds.”\nDomestic political imperatives buttressed those geopolitical considerations and fueled hostility on both sides. In the 1950s and 1960s, globalization and trade liberalization were off the table in both countries, albeit for different reasons. The United States favored managed, not liberalized, trade, focusing almost exclusively on commercial ties with its Western allies. Meanwhile, Washington did everything it could to isolate and punish China economically by imposing a broad trade embargo. In Mao Zedong’s China, this hardly mattered. During these years, China had little interest in trading with the outside world. Apart from the Soviet Union, North Korea, and a few other outposts such as Albania, China kept foreign economic ties to a minimum.\nFor the first two decades of the Cold War, China and the United States were not only bitter strategic rivals; they also served, as political scientist Tom Christensen has noted, as “useful adversaries” for each other domestically. Political leaders in both countries found advantage by pointing to an implacable foe at critical moments of domestic vulnerability. For Mao, this was to shore up power following the calamitous Great Leap Forward and amid the tumult of the Cultural Revolution. And for U.S. presidents from Dwight Eisenhower to Lyndon Johnson, pointing to a hostile China helped sell a foreign policy of deepening engagement in South Vietnam to a public that would not buy it on its own merits. This tactic, however, came at the price of strengthening hard-liners in both countries, which in turn deepened the rift between Beijing and Washington.\nBy the 1970s, Beijing viewed Moscow as an even greater threat than Washington. The two communist giants had border clashes in 1969, and Beijing’s anxiety about facing off against both of the world’s superpowers was palpable. Simultaneously, the United States was seeking to extricate itself from a deeply unpopular war in Southeast Asia and recalibrate its Cold War strategy in Asia and beyond. China and the Soviet Union were no longer universally seen in Washington as part of a monolithic communist bloc, and this convergence of strategic interests led to a thaw in U.S.-Chinese relations, beginning with Nixon’s visit to China, which was facilitated by the secret diplomacy of his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger.\nU.S.-Chinese cooperation across both security and economic affairs has always been elusive.\nThe visit marked the beginning of a “tacit alliance,” as Kissinger put it at the time, to counterbalance Soviet power. Although formal diplomatic relations were not established until 1979, the 1970s set the stage for a series of strategic initiatives from “Ping-Pong diplomacy” and other charm offensives to increasing trade and technical exchanges to the beginnings of actual defense cooperation that lasted throughout the 1980s. Although strategic cooperation flourished, economic cooperation between China and the United States remained limited during the 1970s. China’s economy was still largely autarchic and disconnected from global markets. All industry remained state-owned, and agriculture was still collectivized. Mao’s successor, Hua Guofeng, even doubled down on whatever his predecessor had been doing, replacing five-year central plans with a ten-year one.\nIt wasn’t until the 1980s, when domestic coalitions favoring globalization took firmer root in both countries, that security and economic interests on both sides were briefly in sync. In China, the new paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, along with his deputies Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, pursued structural economic reforms, committing China to the twin goals of market reform and integration into the global economy. And in the United States, President Ronald Reagan championed globalization, promoting trade liberalization and open markets. Strategically, meanwhile, China and the United States continued to cooperate against the Soviet Union. The 1980s saw collaboration in arming Afghan resistance fighters (the mujahideen) during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which further strengthened the U.S.-Chinese security relationship. The emergence of pro-globalization coalitions in both countries, combined with a common enemy, created a conducive environment for economic as well as strategic cooperation that would last until the end of the Cold War.\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 fundamentally altered the calculus. With the common enemy gone, the strategic rationale for security cooperation all but disappeared even as economic cooperation flourished. In Washington, Beijing’s growing economic and military power raised questions about the credibility of the United States’ forward presence in Asia, as did China’s willingness to push back against perceived encroachments on its interests in the region. The 1995–96 crisis in the Taiwan Strait, when Beijing fired a series of missiles near Taiwan as a warning against movements toward independence, highlighted the issues and raised the stakes. In the face of Chinese assertiveness, the United States demonstrated its military commitment to Taiwan by deploying multiple aircraft carriers to the region.\nWith only economic interests in alignment, relations between Beijing and Washington were plagued by mixed motives, as leaders navigated conflicting pressures to cooperate and compete. U.S. President Bill Clinton, for instance, devised a rationale for doubling down on economic interests that he thought could one day lead to strategic alignment: using free trade and investment as a means to integrate China into the U.S.-led global order. With Deng’s successor Jiang Zemin deepening reformist policies, China seemed willing to play ball. The net result was spectacular growth in U.S.-Chinese trade and the start of negotiations that led to China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. The U.S. and Chinese economies have been deeply intertwined ever since.\nOUT OF ALIGNMENT\nLast year, China and the United States traded over $580 billion in goods and services. China is the United States’ third-largest trade partner. The United States, meanwhile, is China’s largest single export market, not counting regional blocs such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations or the EU. Beijing holds over $1 trillion in U.S. treasury securities. But this mutual economic dependence masks deeper centrifugal forces that have been gradually pulling the two countries apart. Domestically, both American and Chinese leaders are facing increasing political pressure to turn inward and away from global markets—and for roughly the same reason: the inequality and dislocation globalization is believed to have caused.\nIn the United States, economic dislocation precipitated and accelerated by globalization has led to a growing backlash against free trade and international institutions. Signs of trouble were evident as early as the 1990s in the battle over Clinton’s North American Free Trade Agreement and the Seattle protests over the WTO. But it was not until the 2008 global financial crash and the Obama administration that domestic concerns about job losses and China’s trade practices became hot-button electoral issues. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill increasingly linked the United States’ economic troubles to China’s emergence as an economic powerhouse. It was a short step from there to the anti-Chinese, “America first” neomercantilist agenda that Trump championed on the campaign trail and then from the Oval Office.\nParallel developments were afoot in China—first under the leadership of Hu Jintao in the first decade of this century and then more dramatically under Xi in the 2010s—as the country pivoted toward a more assertive nationalism and an inwardly focused policy agenda. Xi emphasized “common prosperity” and social equity, the green transition, and eventually, the “China Dream,” which promised rising living standards but also a better overall quality of life, a powerful and confident China, and a more consumer-oriented economy focused on leading-edge technologies. These moves entailed reducing its reliance on foreign technology and investment and increasing domestic demand, fostering domestic innovation, and favoring the state over the market. In the 2010s, amid its fears that the United States was winning the hearts and minds of young Chinese, Beijing increasingly blamed Washington for its economic and social problems.\nU.S. policymakers should focus on manageable, critical goals, such as reducing the risk of war.\nWith each side scapegoating the other and no common enemy to create incentives to cooperate, the political space for alignment over strategic-military matters narrowed. Attempts to find common ground over nontraditional security challenges such as terrorism, climate change, and global health foundered during the George W. Bush and Obama administrations. For Washington, fighting a so-called global war on terror was paramount in the first decade of the century, while Beijing was much more focused on developments in East Asia. U.S.-Chinese efforts to cooperate over climate change became entangled in broader disputes over trade, technology, subsidies, and intellectual property.\nBy 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed and exacerbated confrontational tendencies. In the United States, political leaders lambasted China for its handling of the outbreak, with Trump pejoratively labeling the disease the “China virus.” China rejected these accusations and portrayed its pandemic response as superior, later using “vaccine diplomacy” to compete with the United States and bolster its global image. The pandemic also intensified economic nationalism: both countries moved to secure critical supply chains domestically and then, during Joe Biden’s presidency, to restrict access to key materials and leading-edge technologies.\nAs strategic mistrust deepened during the Biden years, Washington and Beijing came to view the other’s actions through a lens of great-power rivalry. Both countries increasingly sought to weaponize aspects of their interdependence (imposing export controls on microchips and rare earths, for instance) and rachet up threats over publicly held debt, state or state-directed investment flows, and more. Economic statecraft could not become the same kind of battleground it was in the 1950s and 1960s, when China and the United States operated in separate trading spheres. Their dependence on each other necessitated a subtler dance, but it also opened additional avenues of competition and angles of leverage that were unthinkable during the Cold War. Although both sides recognize the need to prevent rivalry from spiraling into open conflict, the relationship remains volatile and unstable.\nLESS IS MORE\nSix months into the new Trump administration, relations have only become more precarious. Trump’s over-the-top tariffs on China in April, jacked up to an eye-popping 145 percent, were intended to force Xi to the negotiating table and possibly pave the way for a grand bargain. But the Chinese leader’s quick, forceful response—raising tariffs on U.S. goods to 125 percent and imposing export restrictions on critical rare-earth minerals and magnets—suggests such blunt, coercive tactics are unlikely to work. Although both sides have since agreed to a temporary trade truce, it was Trump, not Xi, who blinked first. Short of major concessions by Trump on issues critical to Xi’s geopolitical ambitions, the latter is extremely unlikely to cave to the former’s demands on trade and economic matters. Herein lies the rub.\nGiven the state of play, any grand bargain would require the United States to implicitly recognize much of East Asia and Southeast Asia as a de facto Chinese sphere of influence in exchange for similar recognition of a U.S. sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere, the Atlantic, the Pacific Islands, and Oceania. Such a deal, however, would seriously compromise the security of core U.S. allies including Japan and the Philippines and could very well drive Japan and others across Asia to consider drastic options to guarantee their security—including acquiring nuclear weapons. This is a recipe for what international relations scholars call a perilous security dilemma, in which each country’s effort to increase its own security threatens the security of other countries, putting in motion a cycle of mistrust and potential conflict. It would also set a dangerous precedent for global alliance politics and nonproliferation norms. The erosion of trust in the United States among its allies would then make future coalition-building efforts more difficult, weakening the United States’ strategic posture in the Indo-Pacific and around the world.\nAn oft-discussed economic angle of a grand bargain, meanwhile, would involve Trump rolling back U.S. tariffs, easing export controls on advanced technology, and allowing Chinese investments in key U.S. sectors in return for Xi agreeing to relax export restrictions on rare earths and curb China’s anticompetitive policies—including subsidies and intellectual property theft—that have long disadvantaged American businesses. Such an agreement would offer each side something that key domestic economic sectors want, but it would do little to address the deeper issues whipsawing the two economies—namely, falling living standards, rising prices, and a poor job market. Any agreement that fails to deliver tangible and immediate economic gains is likely only to fuel stronger demands for protectionism, trepidation about globalization, and feelings of xenophobia and distrust.\nTo better serve U.S. interests, Trump would be wise to recalibrate his dealmaking ambitions to narrower yet strategically significant and winnable objectives. Chief among them should be preventing accidental conflict in the South China Sea through more reliable communication channels, military-to-military dialogues, and confidence-building measures such as prelaunch notification procedures for space launches and processes for dealing in real time with cyberwarfare and hacking. Such initiatives would not only reduce the likelihood of escalation but also reassure allies in Asia of the United States’ commitment to regional peace and security. Through incremental agreements, for instance, Trump and Xi could address specific issues such as maritime security and freedom of navigation by agreeing to a code of conduct along with protocols for managing close-in naval encounters. The two leaders could also establish norms against cyber-espionage and state-sponsored commercial cybertheft.\nWashington and Beijing view the other’s actions through a lens of great-power rivalry.\nMeasured progress on economics, meanwhile, first requires some sort of shared framework to deliver predictability in the regulation and terms of trade: tariffs and other barriers rising and falling every week or month harms both U.S. and Chinese interests. More progress can then be made on aligning standards and practices regarding labor rights and environmental safeguards. China has shown significant willingness to move in such a direction, not least by dramatically tightening emissions standards—improving air quality in all Chinese cities over the past decade—and initiating markedly stronger enforcement, since at least 2010, of labor protections, including health and safety rules, minimum wages, and overtime. If Washington were able to cement a bilateral agreement on, say, baseline labor practices or greenhouse gas protocols, it would help, not harm, American workers and producers because it would blunt some of China’s competitive advantages that U.S. labor unions and others have long decried as unfair.\nThe United States would also benefit greatly from any headway in making China’s financial sector more transparent or more open, such as by pushing even noncore sections of state enterprises to disclose more information and allowing freer entry into the Chinese market for U.S. and other international banks, insurers, and financial firms. Some of these reforms were important components of the agreement that brought China into the WTO but have never been properly implemented. If Trump were to pursue even modest progress on them now, it could help provide better information and opportunities to American firms operating within the Chinese market.\nBy prioritizing these narrow and achievable outcomes, Trump has an opportunity to place the world’s most important bilateral relationship on more solid footing. U.S. policy toward China must be based on a clear-eyed assessment of prevailing international and domestic conditions. This means recognizing that in the absence of a common enemy, any grand bargain Washington strikes is likely to be self-defeating, given that the enhanced security Beijing seeks in the region can only come from unilateral U.S. concessions. Meanwhile, the concessions China is apt to offer on trade in return for U.S. concessions on security are unlikely to deliver the relief that antiglobalization constituencies demand. With the political room for negotiation or compromise between China and the United States so narrow, small incremental steps in the right direction trump any promises of a grand bargain.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "What Drones Can—and Cannot—Do on the Battlefield", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/what-drones-can-and-cannot-do-battlefield", "text": "Within the space of two weeks in June, the Ukrainian and Israeli armed forces executed two of the most audacious operations in recent military history. On June 1, using hundreds of short-range one-way attack drones smuggled deep into Russian territory, Ukraine was able to significantly damage or destroy at least 11 Russian strategic bombers as part of its Operation Spider’s Web. Then, starting on June 13, in Operation Rising Lion, Israel used one-way attack drones that had been smuggled into Iran piece by piece to destroy Iranian air defenses, helping Israel gain full control of Iranian airspace. In each case, drones that cost no more than a few thousand dollars each were able to wipe out tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of advanced weapons systems that cannot be easily replaced.\nThese two stunning tactical successes herald a broader shift in the conduct of warfare. Both Ukraine and Israel also continue to rely on traditional, expensive weapons systems, and Israel’s success in Iran in particular required the extensive use of crewed fighter jets. But for modern militaries, uncrewed weapons systems—increasingly enabled by artificial intelligence—are becoming critical for success on the battlefield. This should be no surprise: according to Ukrainian officials, one-way attack drones are now responsible for 70 percent of the frontline casualties in the war between Russia and Ukraine. In 2024, Eric Schmidt, the chair of the U.S. National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence and Google’s former CEO, argued that the rise of cheap drones has rendered older technologies such as tanks “useless” and advised the United States to “give them away” and buy drones instead. In posts on X in 2024, Elon Musk suggested that “idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35” and said that “future wars are all about drones.”\nDespite this growing consensus, the U.S. Department of Defense still devotes most of its funding to expensive legacy weapons systems. Operation Midnight Hammer—the June 22 U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites involving more than 125 U.S. aircraft, including seven B-2 bombers—showed that high-cost, crewed weapons systems still have an important role on the battlefield. But as modern warfare evolves, so must the world’s most powerful military. The Pentagon spends tens of billions of dollars annually sustaining and upgrading aircraft carriers, F-35s, and tanks. But it invested just $500 million in low-cost drones through the first round of its signature Replicator Initiative in 2023. Although the Replicator Initiative represents a good start, U.S. investment in the low-cost drones necessary to fight a high-intensity, modern war is still at least an order of magnitude too small.\nMaking the shift to a high-low mix of forces—larger numbers of inexpensive assets paired with lower numbers of expensive platforms and weapons—will not be easy. After decades of focusing nearly exclusively on building a military made up of small numbers of advanced systems, the United States must recoup lost time and invest in and develop the capacity to deploy large numbers of cheap but accurate uncrewed systems, or what could be called “precise mass” capabilities. It must also integrate this new generation of capabilities with its existing legacy systems so it can operate more effectively in creative ways. If the Pentagon does not adjust to the new realities of warfare, it will lose the ability to deter adversaries’ aggression before it occurs—and perhaps the ability to win wars.\nADAPT OR DIE\nThe Ukrainian and Israeli operations show that precise mass attacks can be devastatingly effective, even against sophisticated adversaries. In Operation Spider’s Web, Ukraine made use of several emerging technologies. One was an open-source autopilot system that enables its drones to operate autonomously when the signal between human pilot and drone is jammed or weak. Another was an AI-enabled targeting system trained to identify Russian bombers based on three-dimensional scans of Russian and Soviet aircraft housed in Ukrainian aviation museum collections. Spider’s Web’s success—and Ukraine’s ability to smuggle more than a hundred drones over 2,000 miles into Russian territory in preparation for the operation—reinforces a pattern evident from the outset of the conflict: expensive military platforms are more susceptible than ever to attacks by precise mass weapons, especially when they are parked out in the open in airfields or seaports.\nIsrael’s Operation Rising Lion demonstrates the vulnerability of other expensive systems, such as air defense, to cheap, precise mass capabilities, no matter how deep into a country’s territory they are. Well before the mid-June attack began, Israeli agents had smuggled drone parts into Iran, then reassembled them so that they could strike Iranian air defense systems quickly and without detection.\nBy using cheap uncrewed weapons systems to carry out their attacks, Ukraine and Israel also imposed asymmetric costs on their adversaries. Although the full scope of Russia’s losses from Operation Spider’s Web is not yet clear, Ukraine claims to have destroyed over 40 aircraft. The 11 Russian bombers that commercial satellite imagery has verified were destroyed or severely damaged were alone hundreds of times more valuable than the drones used in the attack. If Russia lost even one of each kind of the advanced aircraft Ukraine supposedly destroyed, it would have incurred serious costs: a single Russian airborne early warning and control system aircraft has an estimated price tag of $330 million, and Russia’s long-range bombers cost up to $270 million. By contrast, Ukraine’s quadcopters cost between $600 and $1,000 each, meaning that the total capabilities used in Spider’s Web likely cost Ukraine no more than $117,000, a fraction of the cost of a single Kh-101 missile carried by one of the destroyed Russian bombers, and less than the $200,000 per-unit Javelin antitank missiles the United States has provided to Ukraine.\nU.S. investment in low-cost drones is still at least an order of magnitude too small.\nAlthough they took place in vastly different contexts, Spider’s Web and Rising Lion underscore an emerging dynamic in modern warfare: militaries that rely too heavily on expensive legacy systems may struggle in longer wars of attrition, and if wealthy countries do not adapt, they will be able to afford to lose only so many of these systems before the costs become financially or politically unsustainable.\nPrecise mass weapons are not just cheaper than their legacy counterparts, affording even underresourced militaries the ability to compete with stronger foes. They can also be produced much faster. Ukraine is now producing millions of drones each year, whereas it will take many years for Russia to rebuild its degraded bomber fleet. Such a gap in replacement times could help level the playing field or even determine the outcome of a protracted conflict between a state that overinvests in expensive, difficult-to-replace legacy weapons systems and one that can rapidly scale production of precise mass systems.\nUkraine and Israel are not the only countries that are exploiting these advantages. Their adversaries are, too. Moscow retaliated against Spider’s Web with some of the largest drone attacks of the war, nearly overwhelming Kyiv’s already overstretched air defenses. Iran responded to Israel’s initial attacks by launching its own waves of relatively cheap drones and missiles against Israeli targets. Although Israeli air defenses intercepted most of these attacks, the Iranian response was effective enough to prompt concerns from Israeli and U.S. officials that the Israel Defense Forces could run out of interceptors. The counterattack also forced Israel to use its fighter jets to further target Iranian launch sites over the course of a 12-day war that cost Israel hundreds of millions of dollars a day.\nBRING OUT THE BIG GUNS\nEven as low-cost drones become increasingly important on the battlefield, legacy capabilities, such as stealthy submarines and fighter and bomber aircraft, remain useful, especially in combination with cheap systems. For example, Israel’s June 13 strikes on Iranian air defenses with one-way attack drones allowed advanced Israeli and (subsequently U.S.) aircraft and pilots to enter Iranian airspace to bomb the country’s most sensitive nuclear sites and other strategic targets virtually unimpeded. Notably, Iran did not fire a single surface-to-air missile at any U.S. aircraft, and the Israeli government claims that none of its crewed aircraft were shot down.\nIsrael’s early use of uncrewed weapons systems to weaken Iran’s air defense reduced the monetary and human risks in the event that the initial attack failed and the drones were shot down. Then, once the skies were cleared, Israel used its crewed aircraft to strike targets such as the Natanz nuclear facility with an accuracy and payload beyond drones’ capability. Russia has similarly combined cheap systems such as Shahed-136 drones with advanced missiles to exhaust or destroy air defenses and then strike high-value targets.\nStealthy legacy weapons systems are expensive and take a long time to produce. But they can be extremely effective. To successfully degrade the deeply buried Fordow and Natanz enrichment facilities, the United States not only had to use 14 30,000-pound massive ordnance penetrator bombs that only it possesses; it also had to dispatch seven $2 billion stealth B-2 bombers, the only aircraft in the world equipped to carry and deliver such bombs. For all their advantages, one-way attack drones simply cannot carry over 400,000 pounds of firepower.\nInvesting exclusively in precise mass systems would limit the targets a military is capable of destroying. In fact, Iran’s military exemplifies the pitfalls of such an overreliance on low-cost weapons systems. Tehran has one of the most extensive drone programs in the world, but because it lacks a modern air force, it couldn’t successfully strike well-protected Israeli military and civilian targets and force Israel to rethink its war plans.\nHIGH AND LOW\nThe Allies’ victory on D-Day in 1944 required the integration of air, naval, and artillery fire to soften Nazi defenses and clear the way for ground forces to seize and hold territory in Normandy. That victory required mastering the cutting edge of combined arms warfare at the time. Today, operating with a mix of low-cost and high-end systems is the new combined arms warfare.\nTaken together, Spider’s Web, Rising Lion, and Midnight Hammer suggest that well-resourced militaries need to invest in both types of capabilities to strengthen their deterrence. As China rapidly modernizes its military in every domain, including precise mass, the United States has invested too little in “low end” systems that can be easily acquired at scale and updated as needed. The Replicator Initiative’s initial $500 million expenditure amounted to just 0.05 percent of the U.S. defense budget in fiscal year 2024.\nThe United States could comfortably spend ten times as much on precise mass capabilities—including on one-way attack drones and surveillance platforms—than it does by reprogramming money invested elsewhere in the Pentagon’s vast budget. The Pentagon could also easily draw on the vision of uncrewed and crewed aircraft flying alongside one another and acquire large numbers of inexpensive, uncrewed, autonomous surface naval craft to add firepower and surveillance capabilities at sea. But even in this new era of precise mass, the Pentagon should continue investing in stealthy bombers and submarines that are hard to locate and destroy.\nHistorically, countries that fail to adapt effectively to changes in the character of war are less capable of deterring their adversaries and more likely to lose future wars. Japanese airpower destroyed supposedly impregnable British battle cruisers in the Pacific at the outset of World War II. In the Hundred Years’ War, England used the longbow to end the era of the mounted knight by defeating France at the Battle of Crécy. If the United States continues to underinvest in precise mass to complement its legacy investments, it may not face such a dramatic fate. But its deterrence may deteriorate at the hands of adversaries who believe they can bleed U.S. resolve. At the same time, however, Washington should not lose sight of the high-end, stealthy platforms and weapons that are cornerstones of U.S. military power and simply chase the newest, shiniest technologies in the hopes that they represent a magic bullet. Preparing for the future of warfare has never meant abandoning the past. But it does require a nimbleness the United States has not yet shown.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "Ukraine’s Drone Revolution", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russia/ukraines-drone-revolution", "text": "The war between Russia and Ukraine began with an unprovoked combined air and ground assault, then settled into a mid-twentieth-century-style artillery standoff, and has now evolved into the world’s first conflict waged largely by drones.\nLast year, Ukraine launched a series of successful long-range drone strikes against ammunition depots hundreds of miles inside Russian territory. Such strikes have been ongoing ever since. Every day, the Ukrainian military deploys thousands of shorter-range drones to defend against Russian ground assaults, largely replacing the Howitzer shells that were previously the lifeblood of the conflict. Kyiv is locked in a technological and production arms race to ensure that its drones are both sophisticated enough and plentiful enough to overcome Russian jamming and other countermeasures. Ukraine’s innovators are still reaching new heights: in June, Ukrainian drones caused billions of dollars in damage to advanced military aircraft in remote parts of Russia.\nThe United States has played an important role in this Ukrainian success, seeding the expansion in this key area of the country’s defense industrial base and financing the most promising Ukrainian drone manufacturers, to help Ukraine reach a level of production once unimaginable—millions of autonomous systems per year. Today, the remarkable pace of this innovation, forged by necessity under battlefield conditions found nowhere else on the planet, presents an opportunity for the United States. To seize it, the Department of Defense and U.S. industry must learn from Ukraine’s drones and other defense technology. The war between Russia and Ukraine is not perfectly analogous to contingencies that the United States may face in the future, and not every lesson in Ukraine is applicable to U.S. military planning, but this war is nonetheless full of instructive technological innovations and breakthroughs.\nOver the past three and a half years, Ukraine has developed a cutting-edge defense industry. The Ukrainian military still depends on the United States for high-end conventional capabilities such as Patriot air defense missiles, as well as certain staples, including rockets and associated launchers. But within its own borders, Ukraine is now producing novel and inexpensive short- and long-range drones, counterdrone systems, robotics, and tactical air defenses. While serving in the Biden administration, we toured Ukraine’s drone facilities, met with their manufacturers, and watched Ukrainian businesses, frontline forces, and pilots work together to upgrade those systems, hour by hour, in response to battlefield feedback.\nHaving never experienced this form of combat, most countries in the world, including the United States, are now far behind the Ukrainians in this regard. Neither the U.S. military nor any European military can produce mass quantities of such low-cost and adaptable capabilities. Nor is it clear that the U.S. military is moving rapidly enough to incorporate battlefield lessons into its own doctrine. Meanwhile, Ukraine and Russia are innovating further as they gradually integrate AI into their drone and other defense technologies. AI promises to remake modern warfare, just as it will remake so many other aspects of society—but unlike with large language models, Kyiv, not San Francisco, is where cutting-edge systems are being developed and deployed first.\nThis opportunity to learn from Ukraine provides, among other things, a powerful counterargument to those who question the merits of continuing to support Ukraine: the United States can benefit from Ukraine’s unique technological capabilities and knowledge of U.S. adversaries. President Donald Trump’s recent decision to pause critical security assistance deliveries to Ukraine should be reversed for many reasons, including because a sustained pause will make it more challenging to deepen U.S.-Ukrainian technological cooperation.\nTo its credit, the Trump administration has said it is committed to defense innovation. Ukraine is perhaps the leading laboratory for such innovation today. Russia’s key backers—China, Iran, and North Korea—are surely drawing their own lessons from this war, and from their contributions to Russia’s military campaign. Iran is learning how its drones and missiles perform; North Korea is doing the same with its munitions and soldiers; and China is assessing the efficacy of its inputs into Russia’s defense industrial base. To stay ahead and enhance its readiness for potential conflicts in the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East, and elsewhere, the United States must expand its technological partnership with Ukraine.\nThat means continuing Washington’s support for Ukraine’s military, with the understanding that Ukraine will, in turn, share its technological know-how and expertise, including the designs for its most effective drones, its strategy for upgrading those designs in response to Russian countermeasures, and data on the strengths and weaknesses of Russia’s defensive and offensive weapons systems. This approach would be mutually beneficial: Ukraine would help the United States build world-class drones and other cutting-edge capabilities, and the United States would continue to help Ukraine defend itself. But the inverse is also true—less support for Ukraine will mean it will be less inclined to share its expertise and data with the United States.\nA REVOLUTION FORGED IN FIRE\nUkraine developed its drone industry as part of a national struggle to survive. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, the Ukrainian military repelled the Russian assault on Kyiv and went on to retake more than half the territory that Russian forces initially seized. At the same time, in factories and labs far from the frontlines, Ukrainian entrepreneurs and engineers began to pursue another critical mission: to build drones that could be deployed against Russian forces.\nThese innovators had the same fervor as their countrymen on the battlefield, but they needed financing and materiel. The U.S. government quietly provided this assistance. In the fall of 2022, the Biden administration began efforts to improve Ukraine’s drone manufacturing, which at that time was nascent. A turning point came in the summer of 2023, when Ukraine’s counteroffensive failed to break through Russian lines and exposed the limitations of conventional capabilities in this conflict. Ukraine’s brigades were unable to overcome Russia’s rudimentary but effective minefields and other physical barriers, while Russian drones wreaked havoc on Ukraine’s armored vehicles. In response, the United States decided to turbocharge support for Ukraine’s drone industry. The White House worked with Congress to secure additional funding in the April 2024 national security supplemental for this effort, which was used both to finance select Ukrainian drone manufacturers directly and to provide Ukraine with key components needed for drone production. In all, as we briefed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a visit to Kyiv last fall, the United States directed more than $1.5 billion into Ukraine’s drone industry, and other countries followed suit in supporting Ukraine’s defense industrial base.\nUkrainian partners generated an enormous return on this investment: Ukrainian production of both short- and long-range drones increased exponentially in 2024. According to the Ukrainian government, the Ukrainian military’s monthly supply of drones rose from 20,000 at the start of 2024 to 200,000 a year later, a tenfold increase. As Russia improved its counterdrone capabilities, Ukrainian manufacturers learned to update their software and designs to defeat Russian jamming and other countermeasures. By January 2025, Ukraine had scaled its ability to use long-range drones against military targets deep inside Russia and to use shorter-range drones against Russian units across the frontlines. Ukraine was also producing impressive counterdrone, missile, robotic, and tactical air defense systems.\nWHAT UKRAINE CAN TEACH\nThe opportunity to learn from Ukraine’s cutting-edge capabilities still exists today, although the window is closing. Ukraine’s drones have proved both effective and affordable. Ukraine is building millions of short-range FPV drones this year at a cost of roughly $400 per unit and tens of thousands of long-range drones at a cost of roughly $200,000 per unit. By contrast, shorter-range U.S. drones such as the Switchblade 600 are estimated to cost more than $100,000 per unit, and longer-range U.S. drones can cost millions. Ukrainian drone operators report that U.S.-made drones have been less effective, reliable, and rapidly adaptable to Russian countermeasures than those produced inside Ukraine.\nThese differences are in part a matter of circumstance. Ukraine is fighting for its survival with limited resources against a larger adversary, while the Pentagon has historically been cautious about investing in emerging technologies and startups, preferring instead to partner with established contractors on legacy systems. Part of the problem is that these contractors have incentives to build more limited numbers of expensive, higher-margin weapons. But the Ukraine conflict has also addressed a legitimate concern for the Pentagon—uncertainty about which technologies will prove effective in the real world—by providing billions of dollars in R & D and weapons testing under unprecedented battlefield conditions.\nAlthough there will remain a role for more advanced and expensive autonomous systems in which the United States retains an edge, the sheer scale of Ukraine’s mass production yields an important and complementary advantage. Ukraine can iterate rapidly—and discard older models with such frequency—precisely because companies are closer to the action and its systems are cheap and disposable. As Ukraine and Russia deploy AI-enabled drone technology, China, Iran, and North Korea will be watching, and learning. As AI-driven swarming technology develops, the advantage of sheer numbers will only deepen.\nU.S. allies and partners threatened by stronger adversaries are particularly in need of the kinds of asymmetric capabilities Ukraine is developing. Consider Taiwan, which could use scalable and cheap drones to help defend itself if Beijing were to escalate. Washington should provide such partners with similar capabilities and help them develop their own domestic production. But for the United States, this opportunity is about more than just helping friends. Ukraine’s offensive success against Russia, such as the recent drone attack conducted from trucks positioned deep inside Russian territory, reveals potential shortcomings in U.S. defenses, as well, including in the homeland. Ukrainian expertise could help close the gap.\nSEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY\nLearning the right lessons from Ukraine to strengthen U.S. capabilities should involve a few key steps. As a starting point, the U.S. Defense Department should work with Ukrainian companies to manufacture drones in the United States, with the understanding that those drones would then be provided to both the Ukrainian and the U.S. militaries. This type of partnership, known as coproduction, would be a win-win: the United States would learn from Ukrainian manufacturers firsthand, and both Ukraine and the United States would receive these drones. The Pentagon should also strike a deal with the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense to license drone technology and designs to the United States. With this intellectual property, the U.S. military could independently build inexpensive and battlefield-tested drones and develop the domestic infrastructure needed to scale production.\nThe United States could take the same approach with additional Ukrainian technologies, including counterdrone systems, by coproducing these capabilities with Ukraine and acquiring the associated intellectual property. Ukraine’s defense industry has succeeded in part because its manufacturers can engage in rapid iteration based on real-world results. The United States should also take advantage of the opportunity to provide Ukraine with experimental U.S. technologies, assess their performance on the ground, and then make updates accordingly.\nThe primary risk of this approach is that the United States could become dependent on a foreign partner for some of its defense production, akin to Russian dependency on Iranian drones in the current conflict. But the alternative is worse given Ukraine’s current knowledge and production advantage, and the focus should be on closing this gap. The United States should view its collaboration with Ukraine as a short-term technology accelerator rather than a long-term solution. The Department of Defense, working with U.S. industry, should aim to learn from Ukrainian expertise rapidly, begin to produce these cutting-edge systems, and then transition away from licensed models and toward their own independent designs. Should the United States instead back away from supporting Ukraine, it would risk losing access to proven defense technology, battlefield expertise, and data on Russia’s military performance.\nEurope, meanwhile, should look to the United States and Ukraine as complementary models for defense production. As European leaders invest in their own defense industries, the United States can offer guidance on how to build higher-end autonomous systems, as well as conventional capabilities such as artillery, rockets, and strategic air defense at scale. Ukraine can do the same for mass-produced drones and associated technologies.\nUkraine’s fight represents a watershed in modern warfare. Kyiv has shown that it is possible to hold a stronger adversary at bay with advanced, affordable, and adaptable drones and other defense technologies. The United States must continue to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression, and as the Trump administration seeks more in return, Ukraine should help the United States turbocharge its own innovation. Both countries will be better and stronger for it.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "The Staying Power of India’s Hindu Right", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/india/staying-power-indias-hindu-right", "text": "When India’s 2024 general election results were announced a year ago, they surprised almost everyone. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party—which was expected to win its third straight parliamentary majority—took less than 240 of the country’s 545 seats. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised his supporters a supermajority in parliament; instead, he was forced into a coalition with other parties. It is the first time Modi has ever had to depend on politicians from outside the BJP to prop up his government.\nThe election results were, naturally, celebrated by India’s opposition. They were also celebrated by millions of ordinary Indians who have been repressed by Modi’s Hindu nationalist policies. As prime minister, Modi revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, the country’s only Muslim-majority state. He enacted a series of citizenship laws that discriminate against Muslims. And his government constructed a temple to Ram on the site of a former mosque in Ayodhya, the mythical birthplace of the eponymous hero of a Hindu epic. Modi’s most recent campaign celebrated these achievements, and the prime minister engaged in the trademark Muslim-baiting and Islamophobia that helped him decisively win previous elections. When he then failed to sweep the 2024 contest, liberals concluded there were limits to Hindu nationalism. The BJP, they thought, might finally be losing its grip over the country.\nIt is true that the election diminished Modi. The prime minister’s personal charisma, traditionally considered an invaluable asset, appears to have lost some of its sway. But the BJP has won most of the regional elections that have taken place since the national one, including in places where it was expected to lose. It has done so without moderating its Hindu nationalist stance. Instead, its shift was tactical. Rather than relying on Modi, it began depending more on the 100-year-old Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh—its parent body and India’s overarching Hindu nationalist organization.\nIn many ways, this is a return to the norm. The RSS exercised control over the BJP until Modi won an overwhelming victory in 2014. Although Modi is still ideologically beholden to the body, his political popularity ensured that he did not have to answer to it. Unlike previous BJP leaders, he did not travel to the RSS headquarters to meet the organization’s leader. Instead, the RSS chief came to him. But no more: in March, Modi made a pilgrimage to the organization’s headquarters for the first time since becoming prime minister. The most recent state election campaigns were not waged in Modi’s name or image. Instead, they were waged by the organization’s vast cadre of members, who went door to door to ensure the BJP’s success.\nThe RSS’s success should be a wake-up call to anyone who thinks that Hindu nationalism is waning. It suggests that any predictions of the BJP’s demise were greatly exaggerated and that the party is hardly doomed without Modi. In fact, thanks to the RSS, the party may be stronger and more durable than ever. It has broad support. It is exceptionally mobilized. It is thus well prepared to dominate India for years to come, no matter who its leader is. Modi, it seems, is a mere mortal. But the RSS isn’t.\nCASTE CONSOLIDATION\nAt first blush, the 2024 Indian elections looked rather straightforward. The BJP lost 63 seats. Its primary rival, the Indian National Congress, gained 47. The country, then, appeared to be like any of the other states around the world where incumbents struggled.\nBut most of the Congress party’s pickups came at the expense of smaller parties, not by flipping BJP seats. In fact, the BJP was not pushed back in any region where it was in a one-to-one contest with the Congress. Instead, the BJP lost almost half its seats in a single state, Uttar Pradesh, where it was bested by the regional Samajwadi Party. It lost those seats not because of mass anger at Hindu nationalism, but because the Samajwadi Party mastered the BJP’s own template. Over the last 20 years, the BJP has consolidated India’s smaller and less dominant castes into an electoral coalition by giving them a small measure of political power, something the Congress did not manage to do in its decades in power. The BJP accomplished this by sealing alliances with the smaller political parties that represent these castes and by providing lower-caste peoples with some electoral representation in its own ranks. The BJP then merged these so-called backward castes with its high-caste base, creating an electoral juggernaut that was hard for any opponent to beat. But the Samajwadi Party did it by providing space within its own ranks for backward-caste leaders and giving a substantial number of tickets to backward-caste candidates. It thus flipped dozens of seats.\nThe Congress, however, failed to appreciate this. Instead, it treated 2024 as a vindication and changed nothing as it geared up for state-level contests. In the October elections held in the northern state of Haryana, for instance, the Congress put all its money on earning the support of a single, dominant farming caste—the Jats. The BJP, meanwhile, consolidated its old coalition of backward castes, rallying them in opposition. The party won 48 out of 90 seats in Haryana’s parliament, more than it had before, while the Congress won just 37. It was a major upset.\nPredictions of the BJP’s demise were greatly exaggerated.\nNotably, the BJP’s campaign in Haryana made little mention of Modi. The prime minister’s face was not in all the party’s posters, as it usually is. The BJP’s slogans and proposals were not built around Modi’s speeches, as they typically are. Instead, the party relied on a substantial grassroots effort by the RSS to consolidate castes and turn out votes. RSS apparatchiks worked in small neighborhoods across the state mobilizing voters. Before the elections, the RSS replaced the incumbent BJP chief minister—who hailed from a dominant urban caste—with a politician from a marginalized one. These efforts ultimately pushed the BJP to victory, checking momentum against the party after its national setback.\nThe BJP followed a similar template to win the November elections in Maharashtra, India’s second-largest state. Once again, the party consolidated the country’s various castes into a single electoral bloc. Once again, it did so not by relying on Modi but on the RSS (which is headquartered there). Then, in February of this year, the party won in Delhi. The victory in the capital was particularly notable: Delhi is India’s biggest metropolitan city, and as such, it usually follows different political patterns than does most of the country. But the RSS was able to import the caste politics of rural regions to dislodge the incumbent Aam Aadmi Party, which had won the prior two contests by focusing on education and health while adopting a flexible approach to Hindu fundamentalism. (The BJP was also aided by the Congress, which needlessly divided the anti-BJP vote by running candidates in almost all of the city’s constituencies.)\nThe BJP, of course, does not solely depend on grassroots mobilization to win elections. The party has also advantaged itself by taking authoritarian measures—cowing media outlets, harassing opponents, and exercising ever greater sway over India’s Election Commission. After seizing control of the commission appointments process and stacking it with loyalists, the body began picking voting dates and schedules that benefit Hindu nationalist candidates. The Election Commission has also become increasingly opaque, ducking questions about voter rolls and registration. But these factors were all present in the 2024 national election, where the BJP underperformed. The recent wins thus mark a bigger organizational triumph.\nMEET THE NEW BOSS, SAME AS THE OLD BOSS\nThe Delhi, Haryana, and Maharashtra elections have shown that the decline of Modi is not the decline of Hindu nationalism. They have also reset the movement’s internal power politics. Modi may still be the face of Hindu nationalism. But the RSS is now in command. It will not be subservient to the prime minister—or to any one person.\nThe RSS is likely happy with this reversion. The RSS helped create the BJP in the early 1980s, and it steered the party for most of its history. Modi began his career as an RSS apparatchik before being sent by the organization to work for the BJP. It was not until he, as prime minister, built a powerful electoral base that he was free to ignore the RSS chief and, eventually, direct the organization. This arrangement yielded dividends for the RSS, as Modi made many of its biggest dreams come true. But the organization never enjoyed being subordinate to an elected official. It thus saw the 2024 results as an opportunity to reassert its position. “A true sevak” (one who serves the people) does not have “ahankar” (arrogance), said the RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat after the setback—a not-so-subtle swipe at Modi.\nModi’s secular opponents may enjoy watching the diminishment of Modi at the hands of the RSS. Yet they shouldn’t ultimately be happy. The resurrection of the RSS actually leaves the BJP stronger than it was when Modi was the movement’s leader. The power the BJP has enjoyed since 2014 could have been transitory, likely to diminish with the passage of the prime minister. But by building on the organizational strength of the RSS, Hindu fundamentalists have made their movement more durable. The RSS has spent its century of existence creating powerful networks that contest elections, host cultural events, and do everything in between. It has survived all kinds of obstacles, including four separate bans on its existence. The group is not going to disappear.\nModi may still be the face of Hindu nationalism, but the RSS is now in command.\nTomorrow, if the BJP were without Modi, the Hindu right would maintain its control over Indian politics. The RSS has simply created an electoral machine unmatched by any party. It has stationed sympathizers deep inside the Indian bureaucracy and judiciary. It has gained control of almost every university in the regions it controls, remaking curricula to reflect its crude, Hindu-supremacist ideology. The chief ministers who now govern Delhi, Haryana, and Maharashtra may not be charismatic politicians in the mold of Modi, but from the RSS’s perspective, they are something even better: faceless apparatchiks who have lived their lives within its anonymous confines and are committed to advancing its program. India’s political and social apparatus, in other words, is increasingly just the RSS machine.\nAnyone who seeks to deal with India must come to terms with the fact that, from now on, they will actually be dealing with the RSS. On a day-to-day basis, this might not seem significant. But overall, it will mean a more nationalistic New Delhi. During the recent Indian-Pakistani conflict, for example, the ideology and rhetoric espoused by Indian policymakers could have come from any RSS handbook published over the last 50 years. Going forward, India might grow even more belligerent, including when it comes to Kashmir. Among the most prominent RSS demands has been to capture the part of Kashmir under Pakistani control, or what India terms “Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.” Doing so is part of an RSS vision for a greater India in which New Delhi reaches out and occupies part of its neighborhood.\nThat idea might seem fanciful. But so were many RSS proposals that have now become real. With the organization still dominant, a Hindu nationalist foreign policy may be something India’s neighbors—and everyone else—will have to contend with. The country, after all, does not appear poised to change course any time soon.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "The Real Obstacle to Peace With Iran", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/iran/iran-nuclear-kavanagh-kelanic", "text": "Just two days after authorizing military strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities at Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz, U.S. President Donald Trump announced an end to the air war between Iran and Israel and declared that it was time for peace. “Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region,” he wrote on his site Truth Social. Whether the cease-fire will hold remains to be seen, but if Trump is hoping for a quick return to diplomacy, he is likely to be disappointed.\nTrump and his national security team find themselves in a bind. As administration officials have admitted, Iran’s stockpiles of highly enriched uranium and centrifuge components have probably survived military operations by Israel and the United States. In order to locate and secure them, Washington will require Tehran’s cooperation. So far, however, Trump and his negotiators have been unable to cajole Iran’s leaders into making significant concessions. Most notably, the Iranians continue to reject calls to give up uranium enrichment entirely. Trump may hope that his recent display of U.S. military power, combined with Israel’s aggressive military campaign over the past two weeks, will force Iran to compromise, but this is unlikely. If anything, Iran’s leaders will be more reluctant to pursue diplomacy after Trump twice allowed ongoing talks with Iran to be scuttled by military action—first by greenlighting Israeli airstrikes and then by joining the war directly. His ultimatums promising more military punishment and his references to the possibility of regime change are equally unhelpful.\nThe challenge that the Trump administration faces now is not with the severity of the threats it has issued but with the credibility of the assurances it can provide to Iran’s regime. For Trump’s coercive approach to diplomacy to work in pushing Iran into a strong nuclear deal, two things are necessary. First, the United States must issue believable threats to impose significant and painful consequences if Iran ignores or violates U.S. demands. Trump has done that, with his social media posts, the surge of U.S. military forces to the region, and, most emphatically, his strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. These warnings and actions, however, may still have limited impact on Iranian behavior without the second requirement: meaningful U.S. assurances that Iran won’t suffer the threatened consequences—or other repercussions—if it acquiesces to U.S. demands. Iran’s leaders need to believe that if their country bends the United States won’t try to break it.\nTrump’s decision to use U.S. military force has made his threats more believable but made it harder to offer credible assurances. Washington still has options, however, if it hopes to bring Iran’s leaders back into productive negotiations toward a new nuclear deal. Trump will need to ensure that Israel permanently ends its military campaign, including by restricting the resupply of offensive munitions if Israel restarts its air war. The president and his national security team should state definitively that regime change is not an American goal and show that they mean it by withdrawing recently surged air and naval forces from the Middle East. And Washington should offer immediate sanctions relief that kicks in as soon as Iran and the United States reach a broad framework for an agreement. Restarting the diplomatic track that Washington abruptly interrupted in mid-June will be difficult and require patience, but solving the problem of credible assurances offers the only pathway to Trump’s ultimate goal: an end to Iran’s nuclear ambitions.\nWHY THREATS NEED ASSURANCES\nTrump remains focused on blocking Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon. That is a goal best achieved through diplomacy, not military means, given the inherent limitations of airpower for destroying deeply buried nuclear sites and uranium stockpiles with certainty and finality.\nThe U.S. attacks on Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan aptly demonstrate the problem. Although battlefield damage assessments are ongoing, Fordow appears to have been damaged but not entirely destroyed. Gary Samore, a Harvard nuclear expert, suggested in an analysis for the Financial Times that the Iranian regime removed centrifuges and perhaps other materials from Fordow before it was targeted, meaning that components of Iran’s nuclear program likely survived the attack. David Albright, a former UN weapons inspector, told CNN on Monday that some centrifuges are “unaccounted for” and that some stockpiles of 60 percent highly enriched uranium “were taken away by Iran, and we don’t know where they are.” According to analysis that nuclear expert Jeffrey Lewis shared on social media, the last known location of the Iranian stockpile was in tunnels at Isfahan that the United States does not appear to have struck.\nMore broadly, the Iranian nuclear program far exceeds these three sites. Mindful of the 1981 Israeli attack on Osirak, an Iraqi nuclear reactor, Iran constructed its nuclear program to be compartmentalized, redundant, and highly resilient. Critical functions such as R & D, uranium metallurgy, and centrifuge engineering are embedded in government agencies, engineering firms, and Iranian universities. Diplomacy must therefore follow U.S. airstrikes to persuade Iran to cooperate in dismantling its nuclear program.\nIran clearly fears a long war with the United States. It is for this reason that Tehran limited its retaliation to the U.S. airstrikes to a highly telegraphed missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar that was easily intercepted with no casualties to U.S. military personnel. But even if Iran’s leaders are willing to give up many of their demands to extricate themselves from war with the United States, Trump’s heavy use of threats will fail to bring them back to the negotiating table. As Thomas Schelling, the revered international relations scholar and Nobel Prize recipient, famously recognized, credible threats must be paired with credible assurances to successfully persuade an adversary to capitulate. For coercion to be successful, in other words, it must come with promises that if the target complies, it will avoid the threatened consequences.\nThe Trump administration can convince Iran that compromise will be worthwhile.\nThe issue, then, is not just convincing Iran that if it doesn’t give up its nuclear program, the United States will attack. Washington must also convince Tehran of the implicit assurance: if it does give up its nuclear program, then no attack will occur. If Iran believes that Israel or the United States will use military force no matter what, it has no incentive to compromise.\nThere are several reasons why Iran cannot simply take the credibility of U.S. assurances for granted. First, states live in an anarchic international system where no overarching authority exists to guarantee agreements and punish those who renege. Iran has no external recourse if the United States double-crosses it by pursuing regime change after Iran has given up its nuclear ambitions. Second, there is a time-inconsistency problem: only after Iran has already sacrificed its chief source of leverage—its nuclear program—will the United States have to keep its end of the bargain. Finally, Iran must worry that nuclear concessions will embolden Israel and the United States to make more expansive demands in the future. Altogether, compliance with U.S. conditions is risky for Iran because the United States has less incentive to remain restrained after Trump gets what he wants.\nStates can break their promises immediately or over the long term. Consider the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, when Ukraine returned Soviet nuclear weapons to Russia in return for a commitment from Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States that Ukraine’s territorial integrity was sacrosanct. That promise lasted a mere 20 years; Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and invaded deep into Ukrainian territory again in February 2022.\nIn the case of Iran, the regime clearly believes that the United States might be committed to regime change regardless of whether Tehran agrees to dismantle its nuclear program. And right now, it holds an important card: knowledge of the location of the missing components of that nuclear program. If the United States is unable to trace and capture all program components, it risks the possibility that embattled remnants of the current government could covertly sprint for a bomb or that these missing components fall into the hands of unpredictable militant groups. Washington, therefore, is disincentivized from jumping to regime change right away. But once Iran gives up those components or their location, Iran’s leaders will have reason to fear for their political survival—unless, that is, the United States gives them real assurances.\nTHE CREDIBILITY PROBLEM\nEven if the Trump administration is ready and willing to provide Iran with credible assurances, it will find this task difficult for several reasons. For one, there is an inherent tension between threats and assurances. The steps a country takes to make its threats more convincing—such as moving military forces into position or exploiting “madman tactics” to convince the adversary that the country is “crazy enough” to follow through with extreme threats—simultaneously throw into doubt its commitments that cooperation will be rewarded rather than taken advantage of.\nIn dealing with Iran, Trump has leaned primarily on threats, both promised and delivered. He has flooded U.S. military assets into the Middle East, including more air defenses, additional U.S. fighter jets, and a second U.S. navy carrier strike group. Trump has also used social media and public statements to make clear that he is ready and willing to unleash the full weight of the U.S. military on Iran. And he has ensured that Iran’s leaders see his threats to use military force as credible by following through on them with strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites. Trump has also demonstrated himself to be an unpredictable actor, using deception to catch Iran off guard, even while publicly calling for negotiations.\nIran now can have no doubt that Trump is ready to make good on military threats. But these same actions have made any pledge of cooperation that Trump and his national security team might offer unreliable. With a still large and ready U.S. military footprint in the region, Iran’s leaders are likely to be skeptical of Washington’s commitment to peace and fear that yielding to Washington’s demands will leave their country vulnerable and exposed for the next round of strikes.\nThe second challenge Trump faces is not entirely of his own making. It arises from the many times that past U.S. presidents have gone back on their word or offered assurances that ended up being hollow. Haunting the current interaction between Iran and the United States, for example, is the case of the 2003 U.S. war in Iraq. In the lead-up to war, President George W. Bush demanded that Saddam Hussein let international weapons inspectors in to substantiate Saddam’s claims that he was not pursuing weapons of mass destruction. After months of dispute, Iraq finally readmitted international inspectors in November 2002, acquiescing to Bush’s pressure campaign in hope of averting a military strike. Yet Bush subsequently attacked Iraq anyway, despite the inspectors finding no evidence of such weapons. Later evidence, such as the Downing Street Memo, suggested that Bush was determined to attack Iraq regardless of what the inspectors discovered.\nIran has every reason to worry about the same dynamic here. After all, Trump allowed Israel to take military action in mid-June even while American and Iranian negotiating teams were planning for another round of talks just days later. He was also the one who pulled out of the original nuclear deal with Iran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and imposed punishing “maximum pressure” sanctions despite Iran’s compliance with the terms of the 2015 deal. With these experiences in mind, Tehran would be justified in suspecting that Washington has already decided to use military force again in the future no matter the extent of Iran’s concessions.\nFinally, and perhaps trickiest of all, Trump’s assurances to Iran need to carry over to Israel. For diplomacy to work, Trump has to convince Iran not only that concessions will forestall a future U.S. attack but also that they will keep Israel in compliance with the new cease-fire and prevent renewed Israeli military action down the road. This will be challenging because Israel has already demonstrated its ability and willingness to act unilaterally, while Trump has exhibited limited appetite (or perhaps ability) to restrain Israel when pressured. Convincing Iran that the United States can and will keep Israel from taking future military action against Iran as long as Iran’s leaders agree to U.S. conditions will require, at the very least, a president determined to use U.S. leverage over Israel, not only with regard to its activities in Iran but across the Middle East.\nProviding credible assurances to Tehran is thus a tall order for Washington, made more complicated by the long tail of past U.S. foreign policy choices. It is not, however, impossible, and the Trump administration can convince Iran that compromise will be worthwhile.\nRESTARTING DIPLOMACY\nReengaging Iran diplomatically will require a combination of military and economic assurances that are visible and irreversible, some made unilaterally by the United States and some made alongside other countries. Trump must first promise to rein in Israel. This will be challenging politically and made much harder by the fact that Trump has already yielded to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at least twice. Moreover, it is unlikely that Trump would pull back defensive aid while Iran still threatens Israel. But the United States could signal to Israel (and Iran) that it will not resupply certain offensive Israeli capabilities, including precision bombs and missiles, should Israel try to resume its air war against Iran during negotiations or while Iran is adhering to the terms of a new deal. This would at the very least limit the scope and duration of future Israeli airstrikes.\nSecond, Trump and other U.S. officials should assert clearly and consistently that they do not seek regime change in Iran and are focused only on Iran’s nuclear program. Rhetoric alone is unlikely to be sufficient, so the United States should reinforce its words with changes to U.S. regional posture that clearly signal that Washington is not getting ready for another regime change war in the Middle East. For example, the United States could, in the near term, withdraw air and naval forces that have been surged to the region over recent weeks and, as things in the region stabilize, lower readiness and threat levels at regional military bases to normal. Washington could also recommit to plans to withdraw forces from Syria and Iraq as an indication that the United States intends to continue its global realignment away from the Middle East once the current crisis abates. U.S. regional partners could be enlisted to bolster the message that the United States is not interested in facilitating regime change in Iran by refusing to allow U.S. forces to use their territory or airspace for operations aimed at regime targets.\nFinally, the Trump administration should offer immediate sanctions relief once Iran and the United States agree to even a broad framework for a deal. This would be consistent with Trump’s assertions that he hopes to see a successful and prosperous Iran and would offer Iran’s leaders some evidence that Washington is not out to topple the regime. Getting European partners to sign on to this promise will help strengthen any U.S. commitment and the benefits sanctions relief can offer to Iran. Notably, the effects of sanctions relief could be rapid: Syria recently completed its first banking transaction using SWIFT, barely one month after Trump announced plans to lift U.S. sanctions.\nEven as he offers these three types of assurances, Trump should also retire the “deal or bombs” ultimatums that he continues to make to Iran’s leaders. With Iran’s nuclear program set back and its ballistic missile infrastructure severely damaged, there is not an urgent need for either a deal or further military action. Trump now has the luxury of time and so should take advantage of it. He has adopted “peace through strength” as a mantra. In the coming days and weeks, he will need to remember that strength is measured not only through the use of military force but also through the ability to credibly withhold it.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "An Industrial Policy With American Characteristics", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/industrial-policy-american-characteristics", "text": "Competition between China and the United States has long been framed as a contest between two countries with opposite roles in the global economy: China as the world’s leading producer and the United States as the world’s leading consumer. Now, however, each country is attempting to become more like the other in a race to rebalance its economy. Can the United States substitute for lost production from China faster than China can substitute for lost consumption from the United States?\nUncertainty about the answer to this question has shaken Washington out of its complacency. In a recent Foreign Affairs essay, former U.S. officials Kurt Campbell and Rush Doshi warned against underestimating China and its industrial capacity. Diagnosing the United States’ main deficiency as a lack of scale, which they defined as “the ability to use size to generate efficiency and productivity,” Campbell and Doshi argued that Washington must gather a team of allies to address this problem and compete with Beijing.\nAssembling an economic Team America might help solve the scale problem, but it will not be enough. Scale alone won’t yield the integrated supply chains the country will need to build the way China has built for the last three decades. To get there, the United States will also need to do the hard work of digging up raw materials, building infrastructure, and deploying technology inside its own borders.\nIf the United States wants to achieve results like China, it will have to build more like China by replicating certain aspects of how Beijing organizes and mobilizes its production economy, prioritizing speed and agglomeration. What Washington needs is an industrial policy with American characteristics.\nPOWERING THE FUTURE\nAn exemplar of China’s model is its decades-long electrification push. When China launched its quest to deploy a nationwide electric-powered high-speed rail network around 20 years ago, it also needed to build the accompanying electrical infrastructure to accommodate the rail network. Later, Beijing’s investment in electric vehicles further increased demand for electricity, prompting more updates to the grid and the construction of more infrastructure, such as charging stations. The creation of an electric vehicle industry catalyzed the emergence of an advanced electrification supply chain, including batteries, permanent magnets, and energy storage. At each stage of development, China invested not only in advanced technologies but also in its grid infrastructure—a decision that has proved fruitful.\nChina has achieved advanced electrification with astonishing speed in part because of government support and in part because of its competitive and vertically integrated firms. Consider the Chinese automaker BYD: the conglomerate’s operations span the entire value chain, from securing raw materials to manufacturing batteries to producing electric vehicles. Similarly, leading Chinese solar companies such as LONGi and Trina Solar control each step of the supply chain in the manufacture of solar panels and their components. Vertical integration allows companies to rapidly iterate and optimize their processes to accelerate research and development, minimize supply disruptions, and reduce costs. As a result, solar panels are up to 65 percent cheaper to make in China than in the United States or Europe. The cost of lithium iron phosphate batteries, preferred by electric vehicle makers for their balance between power and efficiency, fell by 30 percent in 2024 alone. Industries adopt cheaper technologies more quickly, which in turn boosts production volumes and lowers costs for consumers—accelerating technological advancements.\nIn many cases, state support has dramatically shortened production cycles for energy technologies. Chinese central government and state-owned enterprises coordinate innovation, regulation, and deployment under a unified strategy. To develop an important next-generation nuclear technology, the small modular reactor, such firms partnered with universities to cultivate talent, directly funded labs to guide research, and aligned design and compliance timelines to speed up the regulatory process. As a result, China moved from conceptualizing to commercializing such reactors in just a decade—an unthinkable timeline in the U.S. regulatory environment.\nChina’s model has also produced results in renewable energy. In 2024 alone, the country installed enough solar panels to produce approximately 280 gigawatts of energy, more than the entire U.S. solar capacity. China’s solar capacity now exceeds one terawatt—enough to supply global demand through 2032. Partly as a result, China has more capacity to generate electricity than the United States and the European Union combined.\nChina’s massive investment in electrification has positioned the country for success in a key front in its competition with Washington: artificial intelligence. Because AI data centers require uninterrupted baseload power, the outcome of the global AI race will depend in no small part on reliable access to large amounts of electricity. Although the United States has the most advanced chips to train frontier AI models, China is well ahead in deploying the electrification infrastructure necessary for the widespread adoption or diffusion of AI.\nGROWTH ZONES\nAnother ingredient in China’s recipe for manufacturing success is regional industrial clustering, a form of agglomeration in which businesses colocate to tap into concentrated labor pools and supplier networks. In this environment, firms can expand operations more quickly, increasing in value as they grow. In the Pearl River Delta, for example, the Chinese government designated special economic zones, built massive port and logistics infrastructure, and offered tax incentives to attract suppliers and assemblers. Firms benefit from reduced transaction costs and faster commercialization timelines, leading high-value manufacturers to concentrate in the zones. Companies such as Apple and the Chinese drone maker DJI, for example, have placed a significant portion of their supply chains in the region.\nIndustry clustering has also fueled the growth of electrification technology hubs across China. For more than a decade, China has fostered a hub dedicated to producing permanent magnets—which are used in electric vehicle motors, wind turbines, and sophisticated machines such as the F-35 fighter jet’s electric drive systems—around Inner Mongolia’s Baotou, a resource-rich city the government designated as a high-tech zone. As part of that designation, the government gave the Baotou-based China Northern Rare Earth High-Tech Company, the country’s largest rare-earth producer, crucial access to rare-earth reserves as well as tax breaks and other incentives. Baotou is now home to a fully integrated rare-earth supply chain and seven of China’s top ten magnet firms.\nSimilarly, in Anhui Province in eastern China, the city of Hefei has transformed from a poor backwater into a crucial hub for the electric vehicle industry. The local government coinvested with major electric vehicle companies and built a supplier park with housing and transit links. Software developers, advanced display vendors, and manufacturers have colocated in the city, creating a clustered automobile industry supply chain. Global automakers have taken notice. In 2024, Germany’s Volkswagen invested $2.7 billion in its Hefei production and innovation center, reinforcing the city’s emergence as a twenty-first-century Detroit.\nORCHESTRATING ACCELERATION\nChina’s model offers important lessons for U.S. policymakers embracing industrial policy for the first time in half a century. Although Silicon Valley once lived by the mantra “move fast and break things,” this principle has not transferred well to manufacturing. Moving fast in the world of atoms is much harder than in the world of bits. Unrealized projects from the Northeast Corridor’s Gateway rail tunnel to California’s high-speed rail no longer represent isolated failures but symptoms of a national malaise.\nPolicymakers should focus on developing industries in which the United States faces the most glaring scarcities. China boasts well over 150 lithium-ion battery megafactories, more than 1,000 solar manufacturers, and hundreds of permanent magnet producers of various sizes. As a result, China now produces 75 percent of batteries, 80 percent of solar panels, and 90 percent of permanent magnets globally. In contrast, the United States is home to only a single major manufacturer—whose scale pales in comparison with China’s firms—in each of those sectors. These severe deficiencies cannot be remedied by allies but will require rapidly building a domestic production base.\nClustering can be an effective strategy for growing a producer base. Any effort to create clusters would require federal policymakers, who have historically left such choices to state governments and market forces, to step outside their comfort zones and designate regions with comparative advantages where supply chains can mature and technologies can commercialize. Over time, government-supported clusters would evolve into robust, self-sustaining industrial ecosystems. Policymakers can start with exploring opportunities to cluster around existing capacity in critical industries.\nThe Midwest, for example, could foster clustering around lithium-ion battery capacity. The critical minerals needed for batteries are abundant in the Midwest: the region holds substantial deposits of cobalt, copper, and even manganese, particularly around Lake Superior. The Chinese battery maker Gotion has already invested billions in Illinois and Michigan to build battery plants with the potential to create thousands of jobs. The United States could transform the Great Lakes region—once derided as a rust belt, similar to China’s city of Hefei before its rebirth—into a “Battery Belt” stretching from Duluth, Minnesota, to Detroit, Michigan.\nThe U.S. government must become an agent of acceleration.\nTo create an integrated twenty-first-century electric vehicle supply chain in the United States, it will be necessary to cluster mining, manufacturing, and material science in proximity. But to make Midwest mining economically and politically feasible, policymakers will have to think big and be ready to spend. If the Trump administration follows through on its proposal to create a national sovereign wealth fund, Washington could use such a fund to support strategic industry hubs. The private sector, too, will need to invest in ramping up industrial capacity. Doing so might not produce immediate returns. But even venture capital firms, which have historically shown more interest in the high-tech sector than in extractive industries, now recognize the need to back mining. The firm Andreessen Horowitz, for example, has called for the United States to build a new kind of vertically integrated “national mining champion” to secure critical mineral resources.\nWith ample resources to mine and refine within its own borders, the United States has the capacity to become more self-reliant with respect to critical metals, including rare earths. Although allies may be able to supplement U.S. supplies, such efforts require slow and unwieldy coordination with countries in which production is often expensive. Even as the United States continues to work with allies, it must prioritize building its own capacity in various segments of the supply chain.\nYet simply designating clusters will be insufficient. The U.S. government must go further to become an agent of acceleration. Streamlining compliance and cutting environmental review timelines are necessary first steps, but Congress must also give federal agencies such as the Departments of Energy and Transportation the authority to accelerate project timelines: for example, there is no reason that it should take more than a decade to build a nuclear power plant, as it currently does. Executive agencies should collaborate to establish “green lanes” to streamline permitting for strategic industrial projects in designated clusters. Governors and mayors in turn must work with federal counterparts to create task forces that can fast-track utility, land-use, and workforce arrangements.\nREINDUSTRIALIZATION FOR RENEWAL\nThe United States cannot and should not organize its economy exactly like China’s. It would be prudent, however, for Washington to learn from the world’s manufacturing colossus. Borrowing best practices from competitors is not without precedent: at the height of Japan’s challenge to U.S. industry in the 1980s, the United States leaned in to competition while also adopting elements of the Japanese approach. U.S. auto manufacturers adopted Toyota’s inventory management practices—for example, organizing supply and production “just in time” to meet demand, minimizing factory stockpiles—and American business schools embraced the concept.\nUnderestimating China would be a grave error, but underestimating the United States would be equally foolish. History has shown that when properly mobilized, the United States can retool with astonishing speed and ingenuity. Nearly a century ago, the country completed the Hoover Dam ahead of schedule and under budget. The United States’ dynamic innovation system—renowned research institutions, deep and open capital markets, and high concentrations of global talent—remains an enduring advantage. It is arguably easier for the United States to build like China than it is for China to innovate like the United States.\nTo convert these advantages into productive capacity, the United States should selectively emulate today’s preeminent manufacturing powerhouse and rediscover its own ability to build fast and build well. The U.S. government must make industrial investment attractive once again, not only to businesses but also to investors, workers, and communities.\nReindustrialization is not about nostalgia but about renewal. The United States can no longer rest on its reputation as the country that invents the future but must build the infrastructure and deploy the technologies to deliver that future. The United States does not need to become China—nor is that even possible. But China has grasped a crucial point: economic prosperity for future generations hinges on investing in a twenty-first-century industrial base. Now, it is time for the United States to do the same.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "Ukraine Can Still Win", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/ukraine-can-still-win", "text": "When U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January 2025, many in Washington expected a rapid settlement to the war in Ukraine. On the campaign trail, Trump had boasted he could end the conflict in 24 hours. Although few analysts believed that specific promise, many speculated about the possible terms and timeline of an impending deal. The investment bank JPMorgan Chase, for example, claimed an agreement could be reached by June.\nYet as the weeks pass and diplomacy stagnates, it is becoming clear that no such resolution is imminent. As Ukraine’s former Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba noted in Foreign Affairs in late May, neither Russia nor Ukraine “has much of an incentive to stop the fighting.” Ukraine refuses to surrender its sovereignty; Russia will not accept anything less than Ukrainian capitulation.\nThis conclusion, however, does not mean all is lost. Russia is much weaker economically than many analysts realize, and hard-hitting sanctions and export controls can still cripple its war economy. Ukraine is fighting smartly and could turn the tide on the battlefield with more high-end drones, air defense systems, long-range missiles, and munitions. With a change of strategy, Ukraine can still win the war in the near term—if both Europe and the United States decide to give it the assistance it needs.\nTHE DOSE MAKES THE POISON\nMuch of the premature optimism about a settlement earlier this year sprang from the prevailing belief that Ukraine was losing and would soon be forced to negotiate out of desperation. Trump stoked this narrative by asserting that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had “no cards” left to play. U.S. Vice President JD Vance took it a step further, declaring that Ukraine—and its foreign backers—never had any “pathway to victory.” Citing Russia’s superiority in manpower and weapons, Vance argued that if the United States kept up its security assistance, it would only postpone Ukraine’s inevitable defeat.\nThis defeatism has been supported by a second, equally pernicious assumption: that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s commitment to subjugating Ukraine cannot be deterred. The former CIA analyst Peter Schroeder’s assessment in Foreign Affairs last September exemplifies this view, describing Putin as “all in”—personally invested in keeping Ukraine from becoming a European democracy, no matter the cost. Such a narrative holds a kernel of truth, but it also dovetails too neatly with Russian propaganda. By assigning no agency to Ukraine or its foreign partners, it presumes that Ukrainian victory is a fantasy born of Western delusion, and it is a view that risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nBoth assumptions, meanwhile, rest on an excessively narrow reading of battlefield dynamics and a limited understanding of the policy options available to Ukraine’s backers. Despite significant constraints on the aid that Europe and the United States have offered over the past three and a half years, Ukraine has achieved impressive victories. It repelled Russia’s initial push toward Kyiv in March 2022 with little more than shoulder-fired antitank missiles and grit, defying the predictions of many military analysts. Later that year, in a stunning rout for Russian forces, Ukraine reclaimed nearly a thousand square miles in the Kharkiv region without the benefit of modern armor or air cover. And just weeks ago, Ukraine shocked the world by pulling off Operation Spiderweb, a surprise attack that used cheap, remote-controlled drones to inflict substantial damage on Russia’s long-range aviation.\nIndeed, what most consistently hindered Ukraine’s war effort was not Kyiv’s lack of manpower or weak resolve compared with Putin, but rather an insufficient supply of advanced military capabilities. Long after Russia had deployed its most modern tanks, fifth-generation fighter aircraft, long-range air defense systems, and cutting-edge ballistic and cruise missiles, Ukraine was still waiting for deliveries of similar capabilities from its Western partners. When some of these systems finally did arrive, Ukraine was prohibited from using them on targets inside Russia until the United States relaxed its rules of engagement in mid-2024. The truth is precisely the opposite of what the current administration has claimed. Instead of prolonging the war by giving Ukraine too much military assistance, Kyiv’s foreign allies have prolonged it by giving too little, and often with significant delays.\nWhen it comes to punitive economic measures against Russia, the international response has been similarly half-baked. In the early days of the war, the United States and its G-7 allies crafted sanctions and export controls that were thought to pack a powerful punch but in fact had so many mitigations built in that they were robbed of their full impact. In April 2022, just after Russia’s invasion, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union removed seven Russian banks from SWIFT, the dominant international payments system. Many analysts had previously touted the move as a “nuclear option” that would decimate the Russian economy.\nBut the delisting was so selective in its application—targeting only seven banks out of hundreds in Russia—that the Russian economy actually grew in 2023 and 2024. The gradual implementation of export controls also gave Russia time to adapt, as did numerous carve-outs for certain types of Russian banks or transactions: civil nuclear energy, aviation servicing and maintenance, and fertilizer sales, for example, could still be processed. As the saying goes, the dose makes the poison—and the insufficient dosing of punitive economic measures produced an underwhelming campaign with limited strategic effect.\nTIPPING THE SCALE\nDespite these missteps, victory for Ukraine—minimally defined as preserving its sovereignty and continuing to chart a course toward NATO and EU membership—is still squarely within reach. Achieving it, however, requires a fundamental shift in Western strategy, one that combines a large boost in military assistance with more robust economic measures to constrain Russia’s war economy.\nThe linchpin for this new strategy is the West’s mobilization of the approximately $300 billion in frozen Russian assets held in their jurisdictions—mostly in the EU—to support Ukraine’s current fight. Thus far, the Trump administration has shown no inclination to use congressionally authorized funds to support Ukraine. So, as Wally Adeyemo and David Shimer have written in Foreign Affairs, it makes sense to seize these assets and, in effect, “make Russia pay” for Ukraine’s defense. Some EU leaders have argued that these assets should be saved for reconstruction efforts after the war ends. Others worry about setting a dangerous precedent for the rule of law by seizing a country’s funds—even if that country has violated international laws and is engaged in the mass murder of civilians. If Europe is to help bring this war to an end, it must set these concerns aside and act now.\nThese funds could serve multiple purposes. A portion could be invested in Ukraine’s burgeoning defense industrial base: its drone sector, for instance, has become highly innovative but needs additional investments for industrial-scale production, sensor development, and counter-electronic warfare measures. Another portion could help Ukraine purchase long-range missiles and other weapons systems from Europe, assisting the continent in building up production lines that support both Ukraine’s defense and, once the war is over, NATO deterrence. A third chunk could fund the production of U.S.-made capabilities—such as air defense systems and long-range precision fires—that Ukraine needs but Europe currently lacks in sufficient quantities. And finally, the remainder could go to distributed energy generation, the protection of critical infrastructure such as switchyards and electrical substations, and humanitarian needs.\nYet helping Ukraine win requires more than just transferring arms. Western governments must prioritize co-production agreements, intellectual property sharing, and defense manufacturing partnerships—especially in missile and ammunition manufacturing, armored vehicles, and drone and counterdrone technologies, as well as cyber, command and coordination systems, and electronic warfare systems. Such arrangements would reduce Ukraine’s dependence on foreign supply chains, fortify its domestic capacity, and foster long-term interoperability with NATO forces. Equally important is for these governments to give Ukraine access to maintenance and life-cycle support technologies and software so that Western platforms can be adapted to the evolving battlefield.\nDespite being outnumbered, Ukraine has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to offset its disadvantages with asymmetric tactics, such as sinking parts of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet with maritime drones and missiles and denying Russia air superiority by using its limited air defenses creatively. With more sustained military, technological, and economic support, Ukraine could develop new advantages, such as better integrating drones, land mines, and long-range fires to pin down Russian forces and take out their logistics nodes.\nEVERY TOOL IN THE TOOLKIT\nTo buttress Ukraine’s military capabilities, the West must also target the economic foundations of Russia’s war effort. Fortunately for Ukraine, Russia’s economy remains fragile. Although the country’s GDP has increased over the last two years, structural weaknesses abound in its economy: a 20 percent interest rate, a 68 percent decline in Russia’s sovereign wealth fund since February 2022, and persistent inflation of around nine percent. These vulnerabilities present opportunities.\nFirst, the West must go after Russia’s primary revenue stream: energy exports. Currently, Europe is still importing roughly $23.5 billion worth of Russian oil and natural gas. If Europe is to get serious about ending the war, it must decrease Moscow’s energy income and foreign currency flows. Moreover, Russia has systematically evaded the G-7’s oil price cap, significantly weakening its intended impact. Western countries should impose a full embargo or steep tariffs on Russian oil and gas and should tighten regulations, engage in more systematic maritime tracking, and take stronger legal measures to strictly enforce the G-7 price cap. And if third parties flout these restrictions, the G-7 should impose sanctions on them.\nThe G-7 countries, meanwhile, must further isolate Russia financially. The Kremlin has taken advantage of the sanctions regime’s carve-outs and has the power to direct Russian banks to process whatever payments are needed. To meaningfully disrupt Russia’s trade, devalue the ruble, and increase economic uncertainty, the G-7 should remove all Russian banks from SWIFT and subject them to full blocking sanctions, which prohibit all transactions with the sanctioned entity. If financial institutions in foreign countries enable sanctions evasion, they, too, should be subjected to secondary sanctions. Only by applying the full power of these sanctions tools can Ukraine’s allies succeed in weakening Russia’s war machine.\nWestern governments can also redouble their efforts regarding export controls on high-tech components, including semiconductors, precision machine tools, optics, aviation components, and industrial software. There have been export controls on Russia for more than a decade, but these are not one-and-done solutions; meaningfully degrading the Kremlin’s capacity to replenish and maintain its military equipment requires continuous enforcement whenever workarounds and third-party cutouts arise. The U.S. Commerce Department should further restrict Russia’s access to “dual use” goods—products valuable in both civilian and military applications—in order to constrain its production of high-tech weapons and undermine its military-industrial complex. Similarly, Western governments can do more to zero in on Russia’s defense industry by sanctioning more Russian firms that manufacture essential defense equipment such as drones, missiles, and armored vehicles.\nEven after three and half years of full-scale war, Ukraine’s supporters have not come close to exhausting the sanctions toolkit. If rigorously applied and internationally enforced, the combination of these sanction enhancements would cripple Russia’s economy.\nTHE CHINA FACTOR\nYet it is also important to recognize that Russia is no longer waging this war alone. It has found steady backing from a coalition of autocratic states—backing that has allowed it to weather the bite of Western sanctions and replenish critical materiel. Only a few months into the war, Western intelligence agencies and military analysts had assessed that Russia had significantly depleted its stockpile of precision-guided munitions. As sanctions took hold and component shortages mounted, the Kremlin was forced to ration these weapons. This rationing had a real effect on the war, gradually turning the battlefield dynamics in Ukraine’s favor. The tempo of Russian precision strikes declined markedly by late 2022, replaced in part by the use of unguided bombs and the repurposing of systems such as the S-300 air defense missile for ground-attack roles.\nBy the fall of that year, however, Iran began supplying Russia with drones. Then, by 2023, China emerged as Russia’s primary supplier of dual-use technologies, including accounting for over 90 percent of imported microelectronics. North Korea, meanwhile, provided short-range ballistic missiles and, later, troops.\nConfronting this axis of aggressors will require a shift in Western strategy. There is probably little Europe or the United States can do to dissuade North Korea, but Iran has been greatly weakened following its war with Israel and has less to offer now that Russia is mass-producing its own drones. That leaves China, whose inputs into the Russian defense industrial base are far more consequential than Iran’s or North Korea’s contributions. To constrain Chinese support for Moscow, a unified transatlantic approach is needed to raise the costs of Beijing’s support. That means leveraging trade and market access—areas in which Europe holds unique influence—to apply pressure. European leaders acknowledge China’s key role in enabling the Russian war effort, but they have not taken serious steps to stop it; mere expressions of disapproval are not enough. If the war in Ukraine is to be contained and ultimately resolved, Europe will have to make clear to Beijing that normal commercial relations cannot coexist with China’s support for a war against the European security order.\nTURN THE TIDE\nPutin’s ambition to dominate Ukraine is unlikely ever to diminish, even as Russian casualties approach a million. What can change are the battlefield and defense-industrial conditions that make Putin’s ambition feasible. Western countries have the collective resources to create a situation in which trend lines turn negative for Russia. Once the strategic risks accumulate to the extent that the Kremlin has to ask difficult questions about Russia’s ability to defend itself against other hostile actors, it will be compelled to reassess its approach.\nIndeed, from a strategic vantage point, Russia has already lost this war. Regardless of how much additional territory changes hands, the Ukrainian nation is lost to Russia forever. No matter how many billions of dollars Moscow spends on propaganda and “reeducation,” filtration camps and torture chambers, it will never convince Ukrainians to accept its rule as legitimate. What Ukraine needs now is the time, tools, and space to prove to the Kremlin that an occupation is not just immoral but incompatible with Russia’s long-term security needs.\nUkraine’s allies have a choice. They can continue the current approach of transatlantic division and stillborn diplomacy, risking an expanded, longer, and far costlier war. Or they can act decisively to help Ukraine turn the tide, throttle the tempo of Russian weapons manufacturing, and empower the leadership in Kyiv to negotiate from a position of strength. A peace agreement may forever remain elusive, but once the cost of continued fighting becomes untenable, Russia can eventually be forced to settle for an armistice similar to the one that effectively ended the Korean War. Once that point is reached and the fighting diminishes, the space will emerge for Ukraine to renew its democratic mandate, resettle refugees, reconstruct infrastructure, and—perhaps most critically—finish its accession process with the EU and NATO. The return of all occupied territories may take longer, but Ukraine will have established the foundations of strategic victory.\nVictory may not come quickly, cheaply, or easily. But it is still possible and will likely cost fewer lives and resources than a perpetuation of the status quo. What remains to be seen is whether the West—especially Europe—is willing to summon the political will to secure this brighter future.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "American Gun Violence Goes Global", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/american-gun-violence-goes-global", "text": "Gun violence has become a staple of daily life in the United States. According to the Gun Violence Archive, the United States suffered over 600 mass shootings—defined as incidents in which at least four people were killed or injured, not including the gunman—every year between 2020 and 2023, or almost two every day. The physical and emotional toll is carried disproportionately by young people: gun violence is now the leading cause of death for Americans between age one and 17. A 2024 report by Everytown for Gun Safety (where I serve as a Survivor Fellow), the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab, and the Southern Poverty Law Center found that an American young person knows, “on average, at least one person who has been injured or killed by a gun.”\nLess understood, however, is the dangerous degree to which the United States is exporting its once unique form of gun violence to the rest of the world. Last month, for instance, a 21-year-old gunman opened fire at his former school in Graz, Austria, killing ten students in one of the deadliest days in the country since World War II. It soon emerged that the killer held “a significant passion” for researching U.S. school shootings, an Austrian police chief said; he had been particularly inspired by the 1999 school massacre in Columbine, Colorado.\nThe Austrian gunman is only one in a growing set of international perpetrators of targeted violence who were inspired by an American. It has long been known that, in the U.S. context, school shootings are an epidemiological phenomenon. And the epidemic is now spreading beyond U.S. borders. In a 2024 report, Jason Silva, a leading scholar on gun violence, found that in a set of 35 countries relatively similar to the United States politically and economically, the number of public mass shootings more than doubled from the first to the second decade of the twenty-first century. “The greatest number of incidents,” Silva noted, “occurred in 2019 and 2020.” Research also shows that many of these incidents were directly linked to examples set by U.S. shooters.\nMass shootings now constitute a particularly bloody form of American foreign influence. By destabilizing U.S. allies, they threaten to undermine the United States’ global image—and foil its ability to advance its geopolitical aims.\nWEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION\nThe United States remains the undisputed world leader in gun violence. Although its per capita death rates by firearm have remained relatively steady over the past 50 years, the United States has experienced a significant rise in mass shooting incidents. Between 2009 and 2018, for instance, there were 3,500 percent more school shootings in the United States than there were in Mexico, where there were the second most.\nUnderstandably, foreign governments and media outlets frequently portray the United States as extraordinarily violent and lecture their U.S. counterparts on lax gun-safety laws. Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in 2023, former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas remarked that, when he engaged with non-American politicians, “almost every single time” they posed two questions to him about the United States. The first was about U.S. political polarization, and the second was “about guns and the number of killings in our country.” “Only in the United States,” wrote a Danish foreign correspondent after the 2022 massacre in Uvalde, Texas, “does a seven-year-old attend school to learn about school shootings.” An editorial in France’s Le Monde newspaper read, “If there is any American exceptionalism, it is to tolerate the fact that schools in the United States are regularly transformed into bloody shooting ranges.”\nBut the perception that the United States remains a complete outlier when it comes to gun violence is increasingly wrong. The digital platform Wisevoter reported in 2023 that in Europe in particular, “the frequency and severity” of mass shootings “have increased dramatically over the last decade.” The uptick in such incidents is not limited to Europe: targeted violence by firearm has become a growing threat worldwide.\nThe United States remains the world leader in gun violence.\nSubstantial research suggests that gun violence is contagious. Scholars of gun violence point to the so-called Columbine effect, in which the Columbine shooters created a “cultural script” for future attackers involving particular ideological, tactical, and even sartorial choices. Likewise, there is significant evidence that American perpetrators inspired foreign attackers. Columbine led directly to copycat attacks in Brazil, Canada, Finland, and Russia, claiming dozens of lives. One German criminologist told The Guardian, “The phenomenon of massacres by young people in schools in Germany has only existed since Columbine.”\nIn 2022, Silva and fellow researcher Adam Lankford found that “fame-seeking mass shooters who attacked outside the United States appeared more likely to have been influenced by American mass shooters than by perpetrators from all other countries combined.” Alexandre Bissonnette, for instance—a white supremacist who killed six people at a mosque in Quebec City in 2017—searched online for a “list of school shootings in the United States” in the run-up to his attack. Less ideological shooters have also pointed to American predecessors. In Luton, England, a would-be school shooter who murdered three family members last September had extensively researched shootings and claimed that he hoped to eclipse the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, which killed 32.\nIn New Zealand, a white supremacist who murdered 51 worshipers at two mosques in Christchurch in 2019 aimed to become notorious in the United States and influence U.S. politics. A so-called accelerationist, he intended his attack to cause a tidal wave of anti-firearm sentiment in the United States that would speed the country’s collapse. “With enough pressure, the left wing within the United States will seek to abolish the second amendment,” he wrote in a manifesto he published shortly before his attack, yielding “a fracturing of the United States along cultural and racial lines.”\nThe United States exports violence abroad more indirectly, too. U.S. social media platforms, which are less regulated than social media companies in other countries, play a role in glorifying violence, especially to disillusioned young men. In 2023, for instance, plaintiffs brought two cases before the U.S. Supreme Court against Google and X (which at the time was still called Twitter), alleging that the platforms had facilitated terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015 and Istanbul in 2017. After these lawsuits failed, foreign regulators began scrambling to contain this malign form of American influence. In 2024, Australia passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media, in response to concerns about children’s mental health and tech platforms’ role in stoking violent extremism. In 2022, the EU passed the Digital Services Act, which opened the door to massive fines against companies, including U.S. ones, that “spread illegal content such as hate speech, terrorist content, or child sexual abuse material.” X now faces a multipronged investigation into its compliance with the DSA’s obligation to counter “the dissemination and amplification of illegal content and disinformation” and faces significant fines or even a ban.\nFEAR FACTOR\nIn general, U.S. policymakers tend to interpret the United States’ gun violence problem—if they even believe it is a problem—as a purely domestic issue. But gun violence in the United States represents more than just a set of local tragedies. It has profound implications for U.S. soft power and foreign policy. For starters, the U.S. role in provoking violence abroad is becoming more concrete. In September 2024, for example, U.S. authorities arrested two U.S. citizens and charged them with leading an international online movement called the Terrorgram Collective, which had incited white supremacist attacks that killed and injured people in Slovakia and Turkey, both NATO allies.\nAnd by exporting violence, the United States’ reputation is taking a beating. Governments in countries as varied as Australia, Germany, Uruguay, and Venezuela have, in direct response to U.S. mass shootings, issued warnings to their citizens about traveling to the United States; the Canadian government’s travel advisory warns those planning a U.S. trip to “familiarize yourself on how to respond to an active shooter situation.” One Morning Consult poll conducted in China in August 2022 found that 93 percent of respondents agreed that “fears of violent crime may cause them to reconsider” traveling to the United States.\nSome gun-rich countries that chafe at the thought of more stringent gun control have blamed the United States’ gun culture for corrupting their own. After two back-to-back mass shootings in Serbia in 2023, for instance, a Serbian war veteran lambasted the way the United States had rewired his country’s cultural attachment to firearms. According to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, nearly half the guns found at Mexican crime scenes and submitted for tracing between 2017 and 2022 were manufactured in the United States, and Mexico has sued U.S. weapons manufacturers to stem the flow of trafficked American guns.\nThe United States’ adversaries have also highlighted the country’s role as an exporter of violence. After a 2018 school shooting in occupied Crimea, Russian President Vladimir Putin explained that “it all started with the United States and their schools”; in 2022, the Russian Supreme Court even designated the “Columbine movement” of school-shooting worshipers a terrorist organization. Beijing, meanwhile, has repeatedly pointed to U.S. gun violence to criticize the United States at large. In 2023, a foreign ministry spokesperson claimed that the United States “brings to other countries not democracy or progress of human rights, but . . . instability,” noting that high rates of gun violence in Mexico and Pakistan could be traced to exported U.S. weapons. Crucially, America’s gun violence undermines the legitimacy of its efforts to challenge other countries’ treatment of their own citizens.\nMERCHANT OF DEATH\nIt was an American—the influential political scientist Joseph Nye—who popularized the concept of soft power. He explained the critical role that a culture’s attractiveness plays in drawing other nations into its sphere of influence. The United States was a great practitioner of soft-power politics long before Nye popularized the term: it arguably gained its edge after World War II, and its enormous sway over geopolitics and the global economy, thanks less to its military investments and more to the allure of its commercial, cultural, and ideological exports.\nPolicymakers eager to protect the United States’ reputation and influence need to seriously consider the impact of its new major export, gun violence. The most effective way for American leaders to address the problem would be to move more seriously to get gun violence under control at home. So far, the persistent murder of American schoolchildren has not prompted such reforms.\nBut perhaps geopolitical concerns will—and they should. America’s gun violence is driving agony and contempt among its allies and handing easy talking points to its rivals, both of which erode the United States’ advantages. With his cuts to cultural diplomacy, U.S. President Donald Trump shows little overt interest in retaining the United States’ soft-power edge. But his administration remains intensely interested in making U.S. exports successful, both for the sake of American companies’ bottom lines and for the United States’ reputation as a maker and purveyor of cutting-edge goods. Gun violence has become a cutting-edge U.S. export—but one that will harm, not help, its positive balance of power. If U.S. policymakers do not take gun violence more seriously, they will only ensure that this balance goes further off kilter.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "Trump Is Breaking American Intelligence", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/trump-breaking-american-intelligence", "text": "“Speak plainly!” Russian President Vladimir Putin snapped at his foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin, at a televised security council meeting on the eve of his shambolic full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Naryshkin was visibly nervous. Once he had finally stammered out his support for recognizing the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states—the words Putin was waiting for—he was abruptly told to sit down, like an unprepared pupil flubbing an oral exam. Naryshkin’s apparent ambivalence about embracing Putin’s pretext for the war was likely due to the lack of solid intelligence that Putin’s “special military operation” would return Kyiv to Moscow’s imperial orbit. But rather than air any misgivings, Naryshkin chose compliance and conformity. The intelligence may have been hazy, but the risks of contradicting Putin were clear.\nPutin’s unwavering belief that Ukraine would swiftly capitulate represents the greatest intelligence failure of his quarter-century tenure in power. He was furious when his invasion did not unfold as he envisioned, casting blame on and even arresting some senior security officials. But Putin had laid his own trap. Like many authoritarians, he had fostered conditions in which subordinates told him only what he wanted to hear. Intelligence, in its best form, encourages political leaders to ask the right questions, challenge their assumptions, and consider what might go wrong. Although intelligence officers have a professional responsibility to adapt to the interests, foreign policy priorities, and preferred briefing style of the leaders they serve, sometimes the highest form of service an intelligence agency can provide is to disabuse its political masters of a strongly held but false idea.\nThe United States possesses an intelligence community that is the envy of the world. But under President Donald Trump, some of the same pathologies that make authoritarian regimes prone to intelligence failures are making the U.S. system similarly vulnerable. His populist, personalist style has led him to disregard the value of intelligence and abuse the agencies that produce it. In late June, the day before he sent U.S. bombers to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, Trump dismissed Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard’s congressional testimony that Iran was not close to developing a nuclear weapon—an assessment that conflicted with the president’s own claims. “I don’t care what she says,” Trump said. After the U.S. strikes, he triumphantly declared that the targeted Iranian nuclear sites were “completely and totally obliterated,” whereas a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report made a more conservative estimation of the damage.\nThe problem is not just that Trump himself belittles intelligence. His administration is also creating conditions in which senior officials tailor their assessments to please him. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth repeated Trump’s hyperbolic claims of obliteration, brushing aside his own intelligence agency’s report. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said the “alleged ‘assessment’ is flat-out wrong.” Gabbard and John Ratcliffe, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, quickly claimed to find “new intelligence” to support Trump’s interpretation of events but declined to share it publicly.\nIncreasingly staffed by loyalists rather than seasoned professionals—one critical counterterrorism office in the Department of Homeland Security suddenly found itself under the command of a recent university graduate with no national security experience—intelligence agencies risk becoming overly politicized, providing justification for policy decisions rather than informing them. Meanwhile, the United States faces serious national security threats, not least a heightened terrorism threat as Iranian-backed groups seek retaliation for the United States’ strikes on Iran. Whether it results in a terrorist or cyber attack, a foreign policy miscalculation, or a military surprise, the consequences of an intelligence failure could be profound. And the risk is only growing.\nHEAR NO EVIL\nIntelligence failures are inevitable even in healthy systems. Uncovering and properly assessing secrets is hard at the best of times; human fallibility guarantees that there will be errors in process and analysis. But distortions within the system increase the likelihood of failure. The classic case is an authoritarian regime in which the self-assured ruler does not tolerate other views. Intelligence officers in such systems operate in an environment where speaking truth to power is not tolerated, acquiescence is preferred over expertise, sycophancy trumps insight, and “alternative facts” must be presented to maintain the leader’s preferred narrative. Offering good-faith assessments that contradict the ruler’s views is considered disloyalty and invites punishment. Without space for analytical dissent and the presentation of unvarnished views, leaders can receive and act on faulty intelligence, as the hapless Naryshkin could attest.\nThe United States today faces a similar risk. Trump’s populism is characterized by deep skepticism toward credentialed authority and an intolerance of experts who present inconvenient facts or analysis that challenge his movement’s core beliefs. As authoritarian leaders do, Trump has surrounded himself with loyalists who pass ideological litmus tests, such as by insisting that the 2020 election was “stolen” from Trump. The resulting culture of politicized analysis, self-censorship, and suppression of unwelcome truths mirrors the conditions in autocracies that generate intelligence failure.\nUncovering and properly assessing secrets is hard at the best of times.\nThe most important qualification to serve Trump is personal loyalty, not competence or relevant experience. Of course, a U.S. president should be able to expect a degree of loyalty from federal employees. But the expectations of the Trump administration place personal allegiance above the truth. Several long-serving professionals have been asked who they voted for as a prerequisite for traditionally apolitical national security positions—a kind of loyalty test that disqualifies capable officers and sends a message to those who remain that continued service means compliance.\nLoyal senior intelligence officials serving a populist or an autocrat will often tailor their agencies’ activities on the basis of what the leader may or may not want to hear. This can cause intelligence resources to be directed away from actual threats. As director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, for instance, Kash Patel has reorganized the agency to divert special agents and analysts toward immigration enforcement and the reduction of violent crime, leaving investigations into threats with more serious national security implications—counterterrorism, cybercrime, Chinese or Russian intelligence activity in the United States—underresourced. Although curtailing violent crime is a laudable goal, protecting U.S. national security requires that the FBI and other agencies manage a far wider array of risks.\nThis is not the only example of the Trump administration’s sidelining or shuttering intelligence units that focus on foreign malign influence operations, nor is it the only redirection of resources away from serious threats to serve political interests. In early May, Gabbard directed U.S. intelligence agencies to increase their intelligence collection in Greenland, specifically to assess the strength of the island’s independence movement. Greenland, an autonomous territory of a NATO ally, is not a security threat to the United States; the reason for gathering such intelligence is to support Trump’s proposal that the United States annex the island. Intelligence agencies do not have unlimited bandwidth. If they are wasting valuable resources on nonexistent threats or dubious schemes to take control of other countries’ territories, they are more likely to be surprised by the plans and intentions of adversaries such as China, Iran, and Russia.\nAIMING TO PLEASE\nPoliticians are always tempted to strip out caveats, overstate analytical confidence levels, or downplay dissenting views, as Trump did when he dismissed as “inconclusive” the DIA’s initial report on damage to the Iranian nuclear program. His is not the first U.S. administration to prefer intelligence that fits around a particular policy narrative. In the late 1960s, frustrated with the United States’ lack of progress during the Vietnam War, President Lyndon Johnson preferred the Pentagon’s rosier assessments of the war’s trajectory to the CIA’s more pessimistic views—which distorted his understanding of the war and caused him to hold out false hope for a failing escalation strategy. And in 2002, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld set up the Office of Special Plans in the Pentagon to establish a link between Iraq and al-Qaeda—a connection the CIA did not find credible—to support the case for a U.S. invasion of Iraq.\nIn both cases, cherry-picking intelligence led U.S. presidents toward strategic failure. But the lessons of history have apparently been lost in the present White House. In May, Gabbard fired the acting chair of the National Intelligence Council and his deputy after they assessed that the Venezuelan-based criminal group Tren de Aragua was not controlled by the Venezuelan government, contrary to the claim the Trump administration has used to justify its deportation of Venezuelans. When they first reached this conclusion, Gabbard’s chief of staff, a Trump loyalist, asked the council to “relook” at the evidence and “do some rewriting” so that the assessment would not be “used against” Gabbard or Trump—a nakedly political request. The NIC leaders broadly maintained their initial judgment rather than amend their assessment to suit the president’s policy, and it cost them their jobs.\nIt is easy to foresee how firing intelligence officials for making evidence-based assessments could drive those still serving to engage in self-censorship and groupthink, both key ingredients in intelligence failure that are prevalent in autocratic systems. Brave analysts may no longer be willing to stick their heads above the parapet to provide intelligence that Trump needs to know, even if he doesn’t want to hear it. And if the president only receives assessments designed to please him, he will become stuck in his own echo chamber, unable to make fully informed decisions based on hard reality.\nThe blatant politicization of intelligence has consequences beyond the halls of the White House. During the dark days of the Bush administration’s clamor for war in Iraq, the U.S. intelligence community lost credibility not only with the American people but also with partners abroad. The same corrosion of civic trust and falling confidence of allies is underway today. If the United States’ allies and partners consider U.S. intelligence untrustworthy or worry that their own intelligence may become politicized, they may choose to share less with Washington, which could rob U.S. intelligence agencies of a vital clue they may need to foil a plot or understand a key development. Cooperation with foreign agencies is a central part of U.S. intelligence gathering. Washington itself has enormous capabilities, but it cannot replace the collection and analysis provided by its partners.\nSHOOT THE MESSENGER\nWhile publicly claiming that its actions are meant to depoliticize U.S. intelligence agencies, the Trump administration has in fact politicized them further by pressuring them to produce assessments that reinforce preferred policy narratives, dismissing assessments that don’t, purging staff members who are perceived to be disloyal, and harassing the workforce through methods such as random polygraph tests conducted under the guise of leak investigations. It is clear to members of the civil service that their positions are subject to the administration’s whims. Like the NIC leaders, they could be fired for simply doing their jobs. Like staff members working in diversity, equity, and inclusion offices, they could be fired for doing a job the administration did not want done. Like six National Security Council staffers who were let go after Trump met with the far-right activist Laura Loomer, they could be fired for perceived disloyalty. Or, like the director and deputy director of the National Security Agency, they could be fired for no stated reason at all.\nAdministrative chaos masquerading as cost-cutting has sapped morale. In March, Trump’s adviser Elon Musk and staffers at his so-called Department of Government Efficiency visited the CIA and the NSA headquarters, sending shivers down the spines of career professionals. Shortly afterward, both agencies announced thousands of job cuts, mostly in the form of rescinded job offers, layoffs of new hires, routine retirements, and voluntary buyouts. The buyout offer enticed several senior intelligence officers out of public service, although many stated privately that the offer only made the difficult decision to resign easier to swallow. Not only does their premature departure deprive the administration of their expertise and experience, but the cancellation of job offers means they will not be replaced by promising young officers brimming with passion and patriotism.\nIdeally, intelligence agencies should welcome and harness talent from all corners. Narrowing the talent pool robs the country of the opportunity to tap the full potential of its citizens, undermining the potential contributions of intelligence to statecraft. In the Soviet Union, only Communist Party members were permitted to join the primary intelligence agency, the KGB. That commitment to Marxist-Leninist ideological purity damaged the KGB’s analytical performance: the agency routinely underestimated the resilience of Western cohesion and overestimated the strength of Soviet client states and revolutionary movements. During World War II, British intelligence benefited from Alan Turing’s codebreaking genius in part because he kept his homosexuality hidden. Unfortunately, the Trump administration is repelling talent by making it clear that it no longer values diverse perspectives in U.S. intelligence agencies. Instead of simply reassigning officers who had had been temporarily detailed to work on DEI initiatives in the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the administration fired them when those initiatives were shut down, sending the message that it expects ideological conformity.\nThe expectations of the Trump administration place personal allegiance above the truth.\nA U.S. intelligence community that increasingly operates like that of an autocratic country will struggle to retain employees and recruit new ones. At the moment, public service may not look appealing to America’s best and brightest. Worse, the current workforce is demoralized and distracted by the purges and the abuse of the system that they witness. Thousands of intelligence officers are tapping their professional networks and getting their secret resumes cleared so that they can apply for private-sector jobs. A nervous and preoccupied workforce will hardly deliver peak performance.\nThe Trump administration’s proximity to conspiracy theorizing also corrodes its relationship to intelligence. Loomer, whose meeting with Trump prompted several high-profile intelligence agency firings, is known for promoting conspiracy theories, including the unsubstantiated claim that the 9/11 attacks were an “inside job.” Other members of the Trump administration, such as Dan Bongino, the deputy FBI director, have openly floated conspiracy theories accusing the “deep state” of withholding the truth from the American people on every topic from the prison death of the criminal defendant Jeffrey Epstein to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. No genuine conspiracies have been uncovered, but the vilification of U.S. intelligence agencies deemed part of the “deep state” has a lasting effect on the perceived legitimacy of the work they do.\nDemonizing intelligence ultimately makes the United States less safe. Intelligence agencies need the support of the public if they are to do their jobs well. Federal law enforcement, for instance, relies on tips from citizens; repeatedly calling the FBI “irredeemably corrupt”—in the words of its deputy director—may dissuade people from cooperating when approached by special agents. And if Trump-aligned media outlets are spouting populist rhetoric about the threat from within—specifically, the threat that federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies pose to civil liberties—politicians may find it difficult to support legislation that enables necessary intelligence gathering. Early last year, when it came time to reauthorize Section 702 of a 2008 amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a key provision that permits the U.S. government to surveil foreign citizens outside the United States, the same people who are now leading the FBI joined far-right media outlets to misleadingly paint the law as providing Orwellian power to an unaccountable deep state. The provision was eventually renewed for two more years, but the episode illustrated the vulnerability of intelligence agencies’ most valuable tools to exaggerated political rhetoric.\nTHE SHAPE OF FAILURE\nTrump is not a born intelligence consumer. Judging by the infrequency of his briefings in this area—his public schedule has not included more than one per week, in contrast to the six per week that his predecessors typically received—he seems uninterested in the advantages good intelligence can confer. He operates on instinct and often justifies his polices as “common sense,” which is the sort of populist heuristic approach that does not align with the methodical process of intelligence analysts. Trump prefers slogans over substance, narrative over nuance, and conspiracy over curiosity. He avoids digging into details. His ideological positions run headlong into empiricism, as the administration’s fight with economists over the effects of its tariff policy has shown. Trump seems to value intelligence only when it validates his own instinct; he does not look to it to challenge his beliefs or to help him consider different angles.\nThe way the Trump administration is managing the U.S. intelligence system increases the likelihood of an intelligence failure. It could take the form of a surprise attack, a misreading of an adversary, or an inability to anticipate another consequential event. Trump has ignored warnings before. During his first term, he was slow to respond to alerts about the spread of COVID-19, hindering the United States’ early pandemic response, and he was dismissive of the security risks of aggressive homegrown nativism presented to him by intelligence analysts at the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in the lead-up to the storming of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\nTrump seems to value intelligence only when it validates his own instinct.\nSomething similar could happen today. Warnings, repeatedly dismissed with prejudice, may eventually stop arriving. Intelligence may fail because critical information may not reach Trump. Fear of retribution could cause officials to self-censor or avoid providing assessments that may provoke an ideologically motivated backlash, such as alerts about domestic violent extremism among far-right groups or about Russian information operations. As the former senior CIA analyst Brian O’Neill wrote in Just Security last month, “the next intelligence failure will not be a surprise. It will be a choice.”\nAn intelligence failure on his watch may not compel Trump to fix the problems that caused it. Instead, he could blame U.S. intelligence agencies for falling down on the job or even falsely suggest that they were always out to get him. Any reform his administration introduced after an intelligence failure would likely be designed to further politicize the intelligence community, weaken its independence, and give the executive branch greater control of its budgets, personnel, and authorities.\nA talented sports team coached badly can still squeak out a win. If the United States avoids a major intelligence failure in the next few years, it will be thanks to the enduring professional ethos of its intelligence agencies. But those agencies will not be reaching their highest potential; if they are consistently misused, ignored, and politicized, they will not be able to produce the information advantage that the intelligence community was designed to deliver to the U.S. president. Trump is enamored of the United States’ natural resources—its oil and natural gas, its timber, its agriculture. The country’s unparalleled intelligence community is another precious resource, a pillar of the “greatness” Trump strives for. Ensuring American security today and for future generations depends on his good stewardship of this national treasure.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "The South Caucasus is slipping from Russia’s grasp", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/10/the-south-caucasus-is-slipping-from-russias-grasp?traffic_source=rss", "text": "The South Caucasus is slipping from Russia’s grasp\nAzerbaijan’s defiance after a brutal police raid that victimised its citizens signals a regional revolt against Kremlin control.\nThe recent flare-up between Russia and Azerbaijan is far more than a diplomatic spat: It marks a potential turning point in the balance of power in the South Caucasus.\nOn June 27, Russian special forces conducted a violent raid on ethnic Azerbaijanis in Yekaterinburg, an industrial city in Russia’s Ural region. About 50 people were detained, several were reportedly injured, and two Azerbaijani brothers – Ziyaddin and Huseyn Safarov – died in custody under suspicious circumstances. Autopsies revealed blunt-force trauma and broken ribs, contradicting Russian claims that the men died of heart failure. Survivors reported beatings, electrocution, and degrading treatment. Far from being seen as a routine law enforcement action, the operation has been widely interpreted in Baku as a politically motivated act of intimidation – prompting sharp condemnation from Azerbaijani officials and a wave of anger from the public.\nOn July 1, Azerbaijan’s ambassador to Russia, Rahman Mustafayev, delivered a formal protest to Moscow, denouncing what he described as the unlawful killing and mistreatment of Azerbaijani citizens, including dual nationals. This diplomatic fallout unfolded just as Baku launched its own high-profile crackdown on organised crime – one that notably included the arrest of several Russian nationals, some reportedly linked to Kremlin-funded media outlets and others accused of cyberfraud and drug trafficking. Among those detained were local staff of Sputnik Azerbaijan, the state-run Russian news agency. While the two episodes are officially unrelated, the timing suggests Azerbaijan is signalling a rejection of external coercion and asserting its sovereignty with new intensity.\nThese developments reflect a deeper geopolitical shift. Russia’s traditional levers of influence in the post-Soviet space – military alliances such as the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), energy dependency, and soft power through Russian-language media – are weakening. Strained by the war in Ukraine and international sanctions, the Kremlin has increasingly turned to diaspora policing, symbolic shows of strength, and nationalist rhetoric to maintain control. The Yekaterinburg raid appears to fit this pattern: A demonstration of power aimed at a former Soviet republic now carving out a more independent path.\nAzerbaijan’s traditionally balanced foreign policy is now entering a more assertive phase. For years, Baku carefully navigated its relations with Russia, the West, and Turkiye. But the events of the past week have marked a clear shift: Azerbaijan is adopting a firmer stance against Kremlin pressure while deepening its strategic alignment with Ankara. This evolving alliance is not only strengthening bilateral ties but fostering broader regional integration through organisations such as the Organization of Turkic States (OTS).\nThe implications extend well beyond Azerbaijan. Moscow’s deteriorating relationship with Baku may trigger a wider realignment across Central Asia. Kazakhstan has already taken steps to distance itself from Russian influence, while Armenia, under Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, has publicly questioned the reliability of Russian security guarantees. Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan are simultaneously strengthening ties with Turkiye and China. In this context, Azerbaijan’s defiance signals not an isolated dispute, but a broader erosion of Moscow’s soft power across the former Soviet sphere.\nFor the Kremlin, traditional diplomatic tools are proving increasingly ineffective. In Azerbaijan, public outrage over the deaths in Yekaterinburg is helping shape foreign policy in ways that go beyond formal statecraft. Moscow now faces the real prospect of Baku firmly embedding itself in the Turkish geopolitical orbit – supporting projects such as the Zangezur corridor, and reinforcing a trans-Caspian Turkic axis stretching from Anatolia to Central Asia. This vision stands in stark contrast to the Kremlin’s fading Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) project, which now looks more like a symbolic construct than a meaningful alliance.\nMeanwhile, the media landscape has become another battleground. Russian state outlets – particularly firebrand figures like Vladimir Solovyov – have adopted openly anti-Azerbaijani rhetoric, stoking ethnic and religious tensions. These attacks blur the line between journalism and state propaganda, further inflaming bilateral tensions and undermining traditional diplomatic protocols.\nYet, amid the escalating tensions, Azerbaijan faces a rare strategic opportunity. If managed wisely, Baku can leverage this moment to strengthen its leadership role within the Turkic world and reset its relationship with Russia on more equal terms. In the years ahead, Azerbaijan has the potential to emerge not just as a key energy hub, but as a central geopolitical actor in the South Caucasus and beyond.\nThe Yekaterinburg raid is not simply a matter of domestic policing. It is a symptom of the accelerating breakdown of Moscow’s grip over its “near abroad”.

Any transshipments from third countries through Vietnam will face a 40 percent levy, Trump said, announcing the trade deal on Wednesday. Vietnam would accept US products with a zero percent tariff, he added.\nReporting from Kuala Lumpur, Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride says Southeast Asian nations are finding themselves at the centre of intensifying diplomatic competition, as global powers look to strengthen their influence in the region.\n“The ASEAN countries are facing some of the highest tariffs from the Trump administration,” McBride said. “They were also among the first to receive new letters announcing yet another delay in the imposition of these tariffs, now pushed to 1 August.”\nThe uncertainty has pushed ASEAN states to seek alternative trade partners, most notably China. “These tariffs have provided an impetus for all of these ASEAN nations to seek out closer trade links with other parts of the world,” McBride added.\nChina’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi has been in Kuala Lumpur for meetings with ASEAN counterparts, underscoring Beijing’s growing engagement.\nMeanwhile, Russia’s top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov, has also been holding talks in Malaysia, advancing Moscow’s vision of a “multipolar world order” – a concept backed by China that challenges what they see as a Western-led global system dominated by the US.\n“Lavrov might be shunned in other parts of the world,” McBride noted, “but he is here in Malaysia, meeting with ASEAN members and promoting this alternative global structure.”\nAt the same time, Rubio is aiming to counter that narrative and ease tensions. “Many ASEAN members are traditional allies of the United States,” McBride said. “But they are somewhat nervous about the tariffs and recent US foreign policy moves. Rubio is here to reassure them that all is well in trans-Pacific relations.”\nAs geopolitical rivalry intensifies, ASEAN finds itself courted from all directions, with the power to influence the future shape of international alliances.\nUS seeks to rebuild confidence in ASEAN\nRubio’s presence in Kuala Lumpur signals Washington, DC’s intention to revive its Asia Pacific focus following years of prioritising conflicts in Europe and the Middle East.\nThe last meeting between Rubio and Russia’s top diplomats took place in Saudi Arabia in February as part of the Trump administration’s effort to re-establish bilateral relations and help negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.\nAnalysts say Rubio faces a difficult task of rebuilding confidence with Southeast Asian countries unnerved by the US’s trade policies. Despite the economic fallout, he is expected to try and promote the US as a more dependable alternative to China in terms of both security and long-term investment.\nAccording to a draft communique obtained by Reuters, ASEAN foreign ministers will express “concern over rising global trade tensions and growing uncertainties in the international economic landscape, particularly the unilateral actions relating to tariffs”.\nSeparately, a meeting involving top diplomats from Southeast Asia, China, Russia and the United States will condemn violence against civilians in war-torn Myanmar, according to a draft statement seen Thursday by AFP.\nASEAN has led diplomatic efforts to end Myanmar’s many-sided civil war sparked by a military coup in 2021.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 09:16:49 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml"}

This has left Mali vulnerable as it compromises efforts to rebuild military capabilities.\n“The armed forces have shown a certain level of vigilance in the face of attacks,” said Moussa Dienta, who works for the Coordination of Associations for Peace and Development in Mali (CAPEDEM), a body that supports the country’s military transition.\nHe said that to support the army, communities in Mali should “make their contribution” by helping gather local “intelligence” that enhances their ability to do their work. “This will enable the army to remain the pillar of the nation.”\nWhile some support the military’s efforts, others argue that they are not enough to contain the threat of the armed groups.\n“No one is safe from the new terrorist threat posed by al-Qaeda and its affiliates in Mali,” said Jean Marie Konate, a community development expert with the Red Cross in the Kayes region, pointing to the hostage-taking of the Indian nationals last week.\n“The assailants are determined to bite where it hurts, and foreigners will remain potential targets.”\nIndia has urged the “safe and expeditious” release of the hostages, with its foreign ministry saying it “unequivocally condemns this deplorable act of violence”. It said its embassy in Bamako was also in close communication with the relevant authorities of Mali and urged all its citizens in the country to “exercise utmost caution” while there.\nBut some analysts feel more effort is needed. Defence and security expert Aly Tounkara, who lectures at the University of Bamako, believes embassies should take immediate additional security measures to reinforce the protection of their nationals.\n“States seem overwhelmed and they are genuinely unprepared to prevent coordinated attacks. The threat stalks all states in the Sahel and beyond, and will certainly have economic and social repercussions in surrounding countries,” he warned.\nFinding viable security solutions\nThe coups that brought the military to power under Assimi Goita followed mass antigovernment protests in Bamako, over the previous leadership’s failure to deal with advancing swarms of armed groups from the north.\nWhile the military made security one of its top priorities when it took power, July’s attacks, like previous ones, calls into question the viability of the strategy the current government has in place, analysts say.\nExperts are also divided on the best approach to rebuilding the national security sector, as Russian military intervention and joint patrols with the army in certain parts of the country seem to be showing their limits.\n“It is clear that the military approach offers no lasting alternative or definitive solution to the crisis,” said Alkaya Toure, an expert and former technical adviser to the Malian Ministry of Defence under previous governments.\n“What needs to be done is, to effectively combat the attacks, Mali should redouble its vigilance and strengthen its security watch … to be set for the long term.”\nSecurity expert Tounkara is, however, not convinced this will be enough.\n“I’m not saying this to frighten anyone. We are in a dangerous and vicious circle, and the attacks will continue in the long term. Those who are not aware of this should be convinced,” he said.\nHe feels Bamako’s current strategy to tackle armed groups focuses more on theory and political manoeuvrings than on localised dynamics and solutions.\n“Pockets of insecurity can only be tackled through local approaches. This will inevitably require greater involvement of what I call the invisible players. Leaders cannot claim to be fighting terrorism effectively by excluding or marginalising the invisible players who are so key to stability.”\nIn its current strategy, “Mali is making the same mistakes as in previous agreements, offering the same diagnosis and the same therapy”, Tounkara said.\n“We need to move towards contextualising security solutions.”\nUncertain political prospects\nThe system to rebuild security in Mali is taking on water, observers say.\nWith an operational strength of nearly 25,000 soldiers, the Malian army is struggling to occupy the 1,241,000 square kilometres (480,000 square miles) of national territory.\nAnd the recent attacks are a further slap in the face, especially as they targeted a region the government may have thought was safe.\nA military source close to the defence cabinet, who requested anonymity, expressed his dismay: “The recent attacks are not just a problem of inattention or a lack of vigilance, they are above all linked to the poor deployment of security throughout the country,” he told Al Jazeera.\n“Since the coordinated attacks on Bamako on 17 September, 2024, efforts have remained focused on the central and northern regions. In the western region, the general staff have sufficiently reduced the military presence, overlooking the fact that the threat is omnipresent.”\nAs the violence between the army and armed groups escalates, the political situation in Mali is also growing increasingly tense.\nIn May, the military government announced the dissolution of political parties and organisations by presidential decree.\nThen, last week, the transitional authorities adopted a bill granting a five-year presidential term of office to Goita, renewable “as many times as necessary” without holding elections.\nCritics have decried these moves as restrictions on freedom to consolidate the military leadership’s hold on power in the country.\nAt the same time, Russian intervention in Mali – which observers say took place under conditions that are still unclear – has failed to stem the threat of the armed groups they are meant to help fight.\nAfter the 2021 coup, Goita’s government distanced itself from France, its former colonial power, with French forces exiting Mali in 2022.\nTo fill the security vacuum, Bamako turned to Russian fighters from the Wagner mercenary group. Last month, Wagner announced its exit from the country, saying Kremlin-controlled Africa Corps paramilitaries would remain in their place.\nBut the Kremlin seems more concerned with the economic stakes of its partnership with Mali.\nIn June, a trip to Russia by Goita culminated in a series of economic agreements and conventions with Moscow. Energy and mining issues have taken precedence over security, observers say.\nMeanwhile, for Malian civilians increasingly caught between the escalating violence, fear and uncertainty remain.\nAfter the attack in Kayes town last week, a hospital source speaking to the AFP news agency said more than 10 seriously injured people were admitted to the medical facility there, and one civilian died.\nFor security experts, until a definitive peaceful solution is found, civilians will continue to suffer the consequences of the fighting, and no region of the country will be spared.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 11:28:15 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml"}

It is a responsibility shared by all Australians.”\nSegal’s report said the envoy would work with the government and educational authorities to reverse a “dangerous trajectory” of normalised anti-Semitism at many universities, and withhold funding to institutions that engage in anti-Semitic “or otherwise discriminatory” speech and actions.\nTo guard against the “importation of hate”, non-citizens involved in anti-Semitism should face deportation, the report said, with the envoy to provide education on anti-Semitism to immigration officials to assist them with screening for visa applicants with hateful views.\nSegal will also monitor media organisations “to encourage accurate, fair and responsible reporting”, advocate for “best practice regulation of online content,” and work with authorities to ensure artificial intelligence does not amplify anti-Semitic content, the report said.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who leads the centre-left Labor Party, welcomed the report and said the government would “carefully consider” its recommendations.\nHe said some of the proposals could be implemented quickly and others “will require work over a period of time”.\n“This is something that the government needs to work with civil society on at all levels … to make sure anti-Semitism is pushed to the margins,” Albanese told a news conference.\nThe Executive Council of Australian Jewry, a peak body representing Jewish communities across the country, praised the “well considered” plan and endorsed its recommendations.\n“Its release could not be more timely given the recent appalling events in Melbourne,” ECAJ President Daniel Aghion KC said in a statement.\n“The actions which the plan call for are now urgently needed.”\nHowever, the Jewish Council of Australia, a progressive group that has been critical of Israel’s war in Gaza, warned that the plan risked “undermining Australia’s democratic freedoms, inflaming community divisions, and entrenching selective approaches to racism that serve political agendas”.\n“This document reads more like a blueprint for silencing dissent rather than a strategy to build inclusion,” Jewish Council of Australia executive officer Max Kaiser said in a statement, criticising the report’s “vague” language and use of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of anti-Semitism.\n“Consistent with her past statements erroneously linking antisemitic attacks with Palestine solidarity protests, Segal seems fixated on driving a pro-Israel narrative and repressing legitimate criticism of Israel’s genocide in Gaza,” Kaiser added.\n“Antisemitism is real and must be taken seriously.

This week, the office of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the call would cover “stepping up support for Ukraine and further increasing pressure on Russia”.\nOn Thursday, the UK said it would supply more than 5,000 air defence missiles to Ukraine and provide up to 283 million pounds ($384m) in aid.\nThe success of the coalition’s operation hinges on United States backup with airpower or other military assistance, but the administration of President Donald Trump has made no public commitment to provide support.\nAmid growing uncertainty about US commitment to Kyiv’s defence, despite Trump’s recent U-turn on pausing critical weapons deliveries, Zelenskyy had a “substantive” meeting with Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, on Wednesday. He will also talk with US officials on Thursday with the aim of adopting “the next package of US sanctions in the near future”, according to Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha.\n“Sanctions must be imposed faster, and pressure on Russia must be strong enough that they truly feel the consequences of their terror,” said Zelenskyy on social media.\nSpeaking at the conference, Zelenskyy pleaded for a greater use of Russian frozen assets to help rebuild his country’s war-ravaged economy. “Not only the income from these assets, but the assets themselves must be used and much more actively than they are now to help save lives,” he said.\nThe conference, the fourth of its kind, hosted on this occasion by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, will ostensibly be looking to the future, pairing international investors with Ukrainian counterparts to hammer out joint partnerships that will rebuild and prime the country for European Union membership.\nItalian organisers said 100 official delegations were attending, along with 40 international organisations and development banks and 2,000 businesses, with the participation of civil society and local Ukrainian governments.\nMeloni said participants had already pledged over 10 billion euros ($11.73 billion) to help Ukraine.\nWhile in Rome before the conference, Zelenskyy met Pope Leo on Wednesday, marking the second in-person encounter between the two leaders since the pontiff was elected as head of the global Roman Catholic Church in May.\nAccording to a Vatican statement, the pair “discussed the ongoing conflict and the urgent need for a just and lasting peace”. Both sides raised again the possibility of the Vatican hosting peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv – an idea dismissed by Russia in May.\nTen-hour raid\nAs the conference got under way, Zelenskyy said Russia launched 18 missiles and about 400 drones during an overnight attack on Ukraine that primarily targeted the capital.\nOfficials reported two deaths, 13 injured and fires in apartment and non-residential buildings.\n“The enemy’s massive night attack on Kyiv region lasted for almost 10 hours,” Mykola Kalashnyk, the Kyiv region’s military administration chief, wrote on Telegram.\nReporting from Kyiv, Al Jazeera’s Rory Challands said residents of Kyiv had to spend another night in bomb shelters.\n“Another night hunched over mobile phones in the dark for updates on how many drones are in your area, another night listening for that change in pitch that a Shahed [drone] engine makes when it goes into its terminal descent, and another night listening to the boom of detonations,” he added.\nThe attack came a day after Russia’s record barrage of 728 drones and 13 missiles, which killed at least one person.

The state’s legislative elections are expected to be held in October or November.\nCritics say the move is a backdoor route to implement the controversial National Register of Citizens (NRC) that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has proposed in the past as a way to identify “illegal immigrants” and deport them.\nThe move comes at a time when thousands of largely Bengali-speaking Muslims have been rounded up, and many of them have been deported from India as alleged Bangladeshi immigrants in the last few weeks.\nAl Jazeera sent questions to the ECI about the move, but the commission has not responded, despite reminder emails.\nWhat is the controversy about?\nBihar is India’s poorest state in terms of per capita income (PDF), and more than one-third of its population falls under the Indian government’s threshold of poverty.\nBut as the country’s third-most populous state, it is also one of India’s most politically important battlegrounds. Since 2005, Modi’s Hindu majoritarian Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been in power in Bihar in alliance with a regional party, the Janata Dal (United) (JDU), for the most part, apart from short periods of rule by opposition-led alliances.\nComing ahead of state elections, the election monitor’s move has led to confusion, panic and a scramble for documents among some of the country’s poorest communities in rural Bihar, say critics.\nOpposition politicians as well as civil society groups have argued that wide portions of Bihar’s population will not be able to provide citizenship documents within the short window they have to justify their right to vote, and would be left disenfranchised.\nIndia’s principal opposition party, the Indian National Congress, along with its Bihar alliance partner, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), called for a shutdown of Bihar on Wednesday, with Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi leading the protests in Bihar’s capital, Patna.\nA clutch of petitioners, including opposition leaders and civil society groups, have approached India’s Supreme Court asking for the exercise to be scrapped. The court is expected to hear these petitions on Thursday.\nThe ruling BJP has been alleging a massive influx of Muslim immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh and Myanmar and has backed the ECI’s move. In fact, it has demanded that the move be replicated across the country. Al Jazeera reached out to BJP’s chief spokesperson and media in-charge, Anil Baluni, through text and email for the party’s comments. He has not responded yet.\nBut political observers and election transparency experts caution that the move carries deep implications for the future of Indian democracy and the rights of voters.\nWhat is the Election Commission’s justification for the move?\nThe ECI’s June 24 announcement said that the exercise was meant to ensure that “no ineligible voter is included in the roll”, and cited reasons like rapid urbanisation, frequent migration, new voters, dead voters and “the inclusion of foreign illegal immigrants” in the list as reasons.\nThe last such full revision was carried out in 2003, but since then, electoral rolls have been regularly updated and cleaned, including last year before the national elections.\nAccording to the ECI, those voters who were on the 2003 voter list have to only re-submit voter registration forms, while those who were added later, depending on when they were added, would have to submit proof of their date of birth as well as place of birth as well, along with proofs of one or both their parents.\nOf the 79.6 million-odd voters in Bihar, the ECI has estimated that only 29 million voters would have to verify their credentials. But independent estimates suggest this number could be upwards of 47 million.\nThe exercise involves ECI officials first going door-to-door and distributing enumeration forms to each registered voter. The voters are then expected to produce documents, attach these documents and submit them along with the forms to election officials, all this by July 26. The draft new electoral roll will be published on August 1, and those who have been left out will get a month more to object.\nJagdeep Chhokar, from the Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR), a 25-year-old nonprofit that has been working towards electoral reforms, said the ECI’s choice to scrutinise all new voters added since 2003 casts a shadow on all the elections that the state has seen since then.\n“Is the ECI saying that there has been a huge scam in Bihar’s voter list since 2003? Is it saying that everyone who got elected from Bihar in these 22 years is not valid, then?” asked Chhokar.\nWhat is the criticism of this exercise?\nFirst, the timeline: to reach out to nearly 80 million at least twice, within a month, is a herculean task in itself. The ECI has appointed nearly 100,000 officers and roped in nearly 400,000 volunteers for the task.\nSecond, despite the mammoth nature of the exercise and its implications, the ECI did not hold any public consultations on the subject before announcing the move in a written order on June 24, a move decried by experts.\n“That such a big decision was taken and brought out in such a secretive way, without consultation, raises questions around the ECI’s partiality,” said Pushpendra, a former professor and dean at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, who is based in Bihar and who did not wish to give his full name.\nThird, experts warn that millions of legitimate voters in Bihar will struggle to provide the documents that the ECI has asked them to furnish.\nThe election authority has ruled that it will not accept the Aadhar card, a unique identity document issued by the Indian government, nor the voter identity card issued by the ECI itself, which has historically sufficed as the document people need to show to vote.\nInstead, it has asked voters to submit from a range of 11 listed documents – from birth certificates to passports, to forest rights certificates or education certificates issued by the state.\nBut Bihar has the lowest literacy rate (PDF) in the country, at just 62 percent against the national average of 73 percent. A 2023 survey by the Bihar government showed that just 14.71 percent of Bihar’s population had cleared grade 10 in school, thus rendering education certificates – one of the documents voters could show – out of the reach for most of the population.\nSimilarly, government data shows that Bihar also has one of the lowest birth registration rates in the country, with 25 percent of births not being registered. That means birth certificates are out of reach for a quarter of the population.\nPushpendra, the academic, said that it was the state’s failure to ensure that people have the documentation it seeks of legitimate citizens. “You cannot punish people if the state lacks capacity to distribute these documents,” he said.\nFourth, the ECI’s timing has also been criticised by many: The state sees its annual monsoon season between June and October, and routinely sees devastating floods as a result of the rains. State government data show two-thirds of Bihar is flood-prone, and the annual damage due to Bihar’s floods accounts for 30-40 percent of the total flood damage in India. Last year, more than 4.5 million people were affected by the worst floods that Bihar experienced in decades.\n“It’s these flood-prone areas that are the most deficient in proper documentation because they routinely suffer from devastating floods that wash away entire villages,” said Pushpendra.\nFinally, the ECI’s exercise signals a fundamental shift in the way it seeks to enrol voters, said ADR’s Chhokar.\n“At no point in the country’s 70 years has the voting eligibility criterion changed – voters were always supposed to provide their date of birth,” Chhokar said. “This exercise changes this criterion to say that voters now have to also provide their location of birth.”\nWhat’s the political significance of this move?\nEven though the ECI is an autonomous body, its targeting of undocumented immigrants mirrors the BJP’s rhetoric on the issue, experts have pointed out.\nEver since it lost its parliamentary majority last year and was forced to enter a coalition, Prime Minister Modi’s BJP has alleged that a large-scale influx of Rohingya refugees and Bangladeshi immigrants into India has altered India’s demographics. India’s Border Security Force (BSF), responsible for guarding India’s borders against such undocumented immigration, falls under the Modi government’s Ministry of Home Affairs, led by close Modi aide, Amit Shah.\nParty leaders led by Modi himself have made such claims of a massive flood of Rohingya and Bangladeshi immigrants in nearly every regional election since then, be it in Maharashtra, Jharkhand or Delhi.\nLast year in December, the party’s leaders met the ECI to submit alleged evidence that Rohingya refugees and Bangladeshi citizens had been illegally enrolled as voters. Indian laws permit only Indian citizens to vote.\nFor the ECI to now accept this contention, without disclosing any evidence it has about noncitizens being enrolled as voters, is driving many suspicious.\n“The ECI has not been able to provide any reason for why it thought this revision was needed. They have no data to demonstrate its claims [of undocumented immigrants in voter lists],” said Apoorvanand, a professor at the University of Delhi and political commentator who hails from Bihar and also did not wish to be identified by his full name. “Which is why this has no longer remained a bureaucratic, neutral exercise of a constitutional body. Its politics is very suspicious,” he added.\nFor its part, the BJP has come out in support of this exercise and has even demanded that it be rolled out in other parts of the country.\nPushpendra, the former TISS dean, said traditionally marginalised communities and religious minorities would be the worst-hit in this voter revision drive, because they are the least likely to hold documents like a passport, educational certificate or birth certificate.\n“These communities have, traditionally, always supported the [opposition] RJD and the Congress,” he said.\nSimply put, if they can’t vote, it’s an advantage for BJP.\nIs this just about the election?\nOver the last few months, the Modi government, as well as BJP governments in various states, have intensified efforts to identify undocumented migrants in the country and deport them. In at least eight Indian states, hundreds have been rounded up, detained on charges of being undocumented immigrants.\nThis drive has focused largely on Bengali-speaking Muslim migrants. Thousands of alleged Bangladeshis have been pushed into Bangladesh at gunpoint by Indian authorities. Authorities have been accused of not following procedure and hurriedly deporting them. Often, even Indian Muslim citizens have been deported in the drive.\nFor many, this is reminiscent of the Modi government’s plans to create a National Register of Citizens (NRC), which would identify and then deport those found staying without any documents. In December 2019, Home Minister Amit Shah had set 2024 as the deadline for the NRC exercise and insisted that “each and every illegal immigrant will be thrown out” by 2024.\nSuch a move affects Muslims disproportionately, thanks to India’s amended citizenship laws, which fast-track citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis and Christians, while leaving Muslims out of it. The laws, approved in 2019 by the Indian Parliament, were operationalised last year in March by the Modi government, and will help non-Muslims avoid deportation and jail if found to be staying without documents.\nIn Bihar, Muslims make up 17 percent of the state’s population, and number about 17.6 million across the state.\nApoorvanand, the academic, said the Bihar electoral roll revision was NRC, in effect.\n“Ultimately, the ECI is asking citizens to prove their citizenship by furnishing documents,” he said.\nChhokar from ADR, which was the first organisation to petition the Supreme Court asking it to scrap the exercise, said the consequences of the revision would be grim. “You might have an electoral roll in which half the state’s population would be left without a right to vote,” he said.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 05:14:29 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml"}

{"title": "Gaza Without Gazans", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/israel/gaza-without-gazans", "text": "On January 10, 2024, just over three months after Hamas’s October 7 attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a short speech to clarify Israel’s war aims in Gaza. The first point he stressed was that Israel had “no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population.” He insisted that Israel was “fighting Hamas terrorists, not the Palestinian population” and stated that the country’s objectives were simply “to rid Gaza of Hamas terrorists and free our hostages.”\nNow, 20 months into a war that has killed more than 56,000 in Gaza—and that has swept Iran, too, into war with Israel and the United States—those declared aims appear to have been overridden, if not reversed. Since breaking this winter’s brief cease-fire in March 2025, Israeli forces have begun seizing large parts of Gaza, while moving and confining the territory’s population of 2.2 million into ever-smaller areas. The government has also unleashed a crushing campaign to limit and control the flow of humanitarian aid, including a total blockade that lasted for more than ten weeks. Yet despite its renewed onslaught, Israel has failed to secure freedom for any of the remaining 50 hostages, just 20 of whom are believed to be still alive. (The release in May of Edan Alexander, an Israeli soldier who is also an American citizen, was secured separately by American negotiators.) Nor does it appear to be in a hurry to reach a cease-fire agreement to bring them home.\nThis dramatic shift in objectives is apparent not only on the ground. In public statements, Netanyahu has made clear that his government now has other, more ambitious goals for the Gaza war. At a rare press conference on May 22, the prime minister stated that Israel no longer aims merely to free hostages and obliterate Hamas. When the war is over, he said, Israel will be in “full security control of Gaza.” He also enthusiastically endorsed U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal, announced in February, to relocate Gazans to other countries and redevelop the war-ravaged territory into a new Riviera—which he called “brilliant” and “revolutionary.” In other words, the Israeli government appears to be seeking precisely the outcomes that Netanyahu ruled out in January 2024: not only long-term military occupation of Gaza but also the large-scale displacement—or even expulsion—of its civilian population.\nIn a war marked by extreme violence and extraordinary privation inflicted on civilians, it may seem a distraction to focus on a scenario that many consider fantastical and that Trump himself has appeared to back away from. But for the Israeli cabinet, the so-called Trump plan for Gaza is not a passing fancy. In late March, shortly after the resumption of the military campaign, the Israeli government established a special office to oversee “voluntary emigration” from Gaza, and other members of the government have been even more explicit than Netanyahu in stating the end goal. “Gaza will be entirely destroyed, civilians will be sent to . . . the south to a humanitarian zone . . . and from there they will start to leave in great numbers to third countries,” Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said in early May.\nAs the world’s attention has been diverted by the so-called 12-day war between Israel and Iran and the decision of the United States to bomb Iranian nuclear sites, it is especially important not to lose sight of Israel’s rapidly unfolding plan for Gaza and Gazans. Under the Geneva Conventions, a forced exodus from an occupied territory would be considered a war crime. It would not only condemn Palestinians to exile but condemn the Israelis who crafted and carried out the policy. They would bear responsibility for a criminal act that would, in addition, probably mean sacrificing the remaining Israeli hostages. But with the right combination of international pressure—especially from the United States, which has so far been more of an enabler of this Israeli government’s excess than a restraint—this outcome might still be prevented. There may not be much time left. As Israeli military reporters have noted, the process is already underway; it is approaching at speed.\nWAR OF NUTRITION\nTo grasp the extent to which Israel’s military operations in Gaza are now overwhelmingly focused on pressuring the civilian population, it is crucial to understand the various components of the revised war plan, called Gideon’s Chariots. One of them is control of food. Having already destroyed the farmland that supplied most of Gaza’s protein, fruit, and vegetables, Israel has now taken extraordinary action to limit the flow of civilian aid into Gaza.\nAt the beginning of March, the Netanyahu government imposed a total blockade of all food, medicine, and fuel for Gaza. This lasted for 80 days, bringing the population to the brink of starvation. In mid-May, responding to mounting international pressure, the government began to allow in a trickle of aid using the well-established independent distribution channels run by the UN and a variety of humanitarian organizations that have long sustained Gaza. That meant, at best, fewer than 100 trucks a day of supplies, compared with some 600 during the short-lived cease-fire from January to March this year. This minimal supply has been further reduced by widespread looting, often carried out in zones that Israel controls by gangs that, according to both Palestinian and official Israeli accounts, operate under Israeli protection.\nIn late May, Israel rolled out a controversial scheme that sidelines established routes and allows Israel to control and calibrate all aid delivery. In place of the international humanitarian organizations that have kept Gaza alive through the war so far, the bulk of food aid—and eventually all of it—will from now on, in theory, be provided by a newly formed private charity. The so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, endorsed and promoted by the Trump administration and staffed on the ground by U.S. mercenaries, in practice functions as an arm of Israeli military operations. According to a New York Times investigation, GHF was conceived by Israeli officials and is being closely supervised by Israel. Neither the organization nor the Israeli government has disclosed the source of its funding. Its own documentation suggests that the GHF plans to supply only packaged foods, with no provision for medicines or other desperately needed supplies, at a target level of 1,700 calories per day—below medically established norms.\nIsrael has taken extraordinary action to limit the flow of civilian aid into Gaza.\nThus far, the plan has proved disastrous. On the eve of the program’s launch, GHF’s American chief executive resigned, citing his organization’s inability to maintain minimum international humanitarian standards. His replacement, Johnnie Moore, is an evangelical Christian and public relations executive with no experience in humanitarian work, who has openly backed plans to expel Palestinians from Gaza. During its first month of operations, the foundation’s distribution points were repeatedly plunged into chaos, with more than 500 Palestinians shot dead by Israeli forces as they tried to reach them—killings that seem inexplicable and unprecedented in an aid-delivery context, even in a war zone.\nAccording to the Israeli government, the new program is needed because Hamas had been siphoning off aid supplied through traditional channels. But international aid groups and Western officials—including David Satterfield, a career diplomat who served as the United States’ special envoy for humanitarian issues in Gaza during the Biden administration, and Cindy McCain, the American head of the World Food Program—have pointed out that Israel has not offered evidence to support this claim. In an interview shortly before GHF went into operation, a senior Western diplomat in Israel flatly dismissed the allegations as a lie.\nAs the UN has warned, the architecture of the new aid program also appears aimed at furthering the displacement of Gaza’s civilian population. With just eight fenced-in distribution points planned, GHF is replacing a decades-old aid distribution network that involved dozens of highly experienced agencies, hundreds of distribution sites, and thousands of workers spread over the entire territory. That model has been based on the international humanitarian principle that aid should be brought directly to the areas most in need. By contrast, the new system forces Gazans to walk long distances to reach isolated, heavily guarded sites where boxes of dry goods are left on trestle tables. GHF’s first feeding centers opened in the far south of Gaza, where Israel plans eventually to herd large numbers of people. The intent to use the operation as a carrot to encourage movement was made explicit by a report broadcast by Israeli army radio on May 29. The opening of a new distribution point in the Netzarim Corridor, a wide, flattened military access zone that bisects the strip at its waist, the radio report announced, was “designed to prompt the civilian population in Gaza City and elsewhere in the northern Gaza Strip to head south.”\nSTERILIZED CITIES\nIn its direct impact on Gaza’s civilian population, the military component of Gideon’s Chariots is even more drastic. As limited aid distribution is luring Gazans into confined areas in the south and in coastal areas of the territory, bombs, rockets, tank fire, and drone attacks are driving them there as well. Since resuming military operations on March 18, Israeli forces have newly displaced some 660,000 Palestinians, a third of Gaza’s people, and killed some 5,000—a rate of more than 50 deaths per day. This surge is partly a tactical adjustment: since resuming military operations in March, the Israel Defense Force (IDF) has been targeting remaining members of Hamas’s civil administration as well as its fighters, in an effort to smash the group’s capacity to govern. Many of these people have been hit in their homes or tents, along with their families. But as has been the case since the beginning of the war, an overwhelming majority of casualties are collateral victims. According to the UN Office of Humanitarian Affairs, out of the 56,000 Palestinians confirmed to have died since October 7, 2023, 32,000 are women, children, and elderly people.\nFar from indiscriminate, this relentless toll has been concentrated in areas that Israel wants civilians to leave. In April, after Israeli forces forcibly expelled the entire population of Gaza’s third-biggest town, Rafah, the city was razed. The now empty ruin-field is where the GHF set up its first food handouts. Now Israeli officials openly talk of replicating the “Rafah model” in the last remaining urban enclaves in the strip. Once most civilians have fled, Israeli ground forces will presumably move into the emptied areas, hunting down remaining gunmen, blowing up tunnels, and demolishing every standing structure.\nAt the end of May, Israeli forces issued “evacuation orders”—leaflets and text messages accompanied by detailed maps—warning all residents of central Gaza City in the north and Khan Yunis in the south to abandon their homes. These are Gaza’s densest urban areas, and about the only places left with standing buildings. Both are now under relentless bombardment. According to UN estimates, 82.5 percent of Gaza is now either already occupied by the Israeli army or has fallen under evacuation orders and so lies in free-fire zones. Not all these areas have been fully abandoned yet, and some residents, mistrustful of Israeli orders or simply exhausted by endless displacement, are determined to stay. If the Israeli government succeeds in its goal, however, more than two million people will be confined to just one-fifth of Gaza’s area, a space the size of the island of Manhattan (which has a substantially smaller population). Israeli reporters who have been briefed by the army say that, in a future phase, the plan is to squash people into three even smaller enclaves, and then possibly to filter them through checkpoints into “Hamas-free” zones. The IDF itself has announced that it intends to displace “most of the population of Gaza.”\nTo achieve these aims, the IDF has amassed five full divisions inside Gaza: 50,000 to 60,000 troops, along with hundreds of battle tanks, dozens of armored bulldozers, and a full array of close air support. Notably, this force is made up almost entirely of regular army draftees and includes many of the elite IDF brigades, plus commandos and paratroopers. Israel’s reserve forces—citizens who are called up for service as needed—traditionally supply most of the country’s fighting force, but they have largely been left out of the current fighting in Gaza, possibly to preserve morale among Israelis in expectation of a rise in casualties as the IDF pins Hamas into a tighter corner. In recent months, there have also been growing concerns in the military about reservists declining to show up for duty, either because they oppose the continuation of the war or because they are fed up with repeated call-ups in what has become Israel’s longest war.\nEDGE OF THE ABYSS\nFor now, the Israeli government appears to be basking in the apparent success of its U.S.-aided campaign in Iran. Yet the catastrophic results of its war strategy in Gaza will not go away. Before the Iran campaign, parts of the Israeli security establishment as well as the general public were beginning to express growing outrage at the new war plan. They join a growing international chorus, which now includes EU diplomats, as well as the International Court of Justice and UN officials. The EU, Israel’s most important trading partner, has threatened to suspend parts of its association agreement with Israel as a result of human rights violations in Gaza.\nIn Israel, prominent opposition figures, former statesmen, retired security chiefs, and 1,300 Israeli university faculty have in recent weeks voiced demands to stop the slaughter in Gaza. In April, more than 250 former members and three former leaders of the Mossad, Israel’s top intelligence agency, published a rare open letter calling for the return of the hostages and an end to the war. At the end of May, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert publicly accused the Israeli government of committing war crimes in Gaza. And in June, just days before the Iran campaign began, more than 40 members of Israel’s military intelligence signed a letter calling the government’s actions in the war “clearly illegal.”\nBut despite the prominence of these critics, their voices have had negligible impact on the government’s policies. Earlier in June, dissent in Netanyahu’s governing coalition nearly brought down the government, but the disagreement was not about his management of the war but over a long-standing controversy about exemption from military service for ultra-Orthodox youths. Netanyahu’s coalition is, ironically, strengthened by reliance on extremist parties that have nothing to gain from its fall. It may yet become one of the few governments in Israeli history to serve out its full term, which ends in the fall of 2026. Any significant pressure on Israeli policy, therefore, will likely have to come from other quarters.\nCasualties have been concentrated in areas that Israel wants civilians to leave.\nOne faint hope is that strong pressure from the United States could persuade Netanyahu to wind down the fighting before its worst outcomes are realized. In recent weeks, Trump has expressed growing displeasure at the war. In May, he said that “a lot of people are starving in Gaza,” and in a phone call with Netanyahu in early June, he told the Israeli leader that he must bring the war to a permanent end, according to The Times of Israel. Some daylight has begun to emerge between Israel and the United States on Gaza as well as on other issues, including the Houthis in Yemen, the new government in Syria, and even to some extent on Iran, notwithstanding the U.S. intervention. Despite ordering American bombers to strike the Fordow enrichment facility and two other nuclear sites on June 21, Trump abruptly imposed a cease-fire and criticized both sides for breaking it, indicating he has no interest in achieving broader Israeli aims. But it is far from clear whether the U.S. administration is prepared to back tough words on Gaza with actions.\nIf the Trump administration truly wanted to end the Gaza war, it could simply declare that Netanyahu’s strategy of “negotiating under fire”—that is, starving and bombing the population of Gaza—has failed. Instead, it could insist on a return to the previous cease-fire formula, negotiated with intense U.S. involvement by both the Biden and the Trump administrations over many months, which led to the January-March truce. That formula was not a silver bullet and left many crucial issues, including the nature of a future Palestinian leadership, still to be negotiated. But during the brief pause in fighting, it brought freedom for 33 Israeli hostages and an urgent reprieve to Gaza’s immiserated people. It also began to focus high-level regional and international attention on pragmatic, equitable approaches for Gaza’s “day after.” Arab states stepped up to propose a plan for rebuilding and administering, with their support, a post-Hamas Gaza. Hamas itself had indicated that it was prepared to relinquish its role in a future government, and Western diplomats were beginning to explore ways to disarm the group and neutralize its threat to Israeli security.\nIn the absence of extraordinary U.S. pressure on Netanyahu, the chances of getting back on this track look slim. Netanyahu’s pugnacious rhetoric, his growing reliance on the war and on his hard-right allies for his political survival, and the IDF’s conduct on the ground all suggest a preference for fighting on. And so Israel’s war plans appear likely to go ahead. They may prove successful, to a degree. It is possible that at least some of the surviving hostages will be retrieved in a blaze of gunfire, that more Hamas fighters will be killed, that the Israeli army will assert full control, and that the exhausted, traumatized people of Gaza will be persuaded in large numbers to leave. Netanyahu may be able to declare victory.\nBut the cost of all this could be appalling. Many more people in Gaza would die, and possibly also many more Israelis. As the IDF is forced to switch from a high-tech fight at stand-off distance—as the war has mostly been so far—to close urban combat in the Stalingrad-scape of Gaza’s ruins, Israeli casualty numbers are sure to soar. Meanwhile, the enclave’s 2.2 million survivors will be crammed in camps under Israeli guard, dependent entirely on highly restricted Israeli food handouts. Having pushed out international institutions, established humanitarian aid organizations, and all remnants of Palestinian civil society, the Israeli government may soon find that the fate of this huge population will rest squarely on its own shoulders.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "Europe Must Get Off the Sidelines in the Middle East", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/europe/europe-must-get-sidelines-middle-east", "text": "The European Union has rarely played more than an auxiliary role in helping resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in spite of its multifaceted presence in the region. Over the past two decades, European governments came to believe that achieving a two-state solution was more or less impossible and not worth the investment of time and energy. And to many Europeans, supporting the status quo in Israel while rhetorically condemning some of the country’s actions seemed manageable.\nIt was not. As Europe and the rest of the world looked away, the costs of failing to secure a durable peace in which both Israelis and Palestinians enjoy the right to self-determination became exorbitant.\nSome European governments can be hesitant to intervene in other countries’ affairs—justifiably, given their colonial history. But Europe can no longer afford to linger at the margins of a conflict whose most recent iteration began with Hamas’s horrific October 7 attack on Israel and continued with the Israeli government’s devastating war on Gaza and escalations between Israel and Iran. Not only is Europe’s own security at stake, but more important, European history imposes a duty on Europeans to intervene in response to Israel’s violations of international law. Moreover, when it comes to the aftermath of the war in Gaza, the EU has experience to offer that no other actor does: practical lessons, hard-won during the twentieth century, about how to reject cycles of endless war and collaborate with former adversaries to achieve peace and prosperity.\nTo be fair, many European leaders have called on the EU and its member states to take a more active role in peacemaking and are stepping up their individual efforts. But the EU needs a concerted plan. A set of precepts born out of five years spent trying to lead a disunited EU Middle East policy can guide these efforts: the EU must live up to Europe’s responsibility to the Middle East and use its as yet untapped financial leverage. It must offer concrete support on the ground to those who want peace. It must confront spoilers on all sides. It must protect those seeking to illuminate facts on the ground. It must back the work of the UN and consistently uphold international law. Before anything else, however, the EU must overcome the internal obstacles to action posed by its member states’ divergent approaches to Israel.\nDUTY OF CARE\nEuropeans bear significant responsibility for the conflicts currently roiling the Middle East. We are both the original perpetrators and historical accomplices, guilty by implication in the tragedy that has been unfolding for decades. Since at least the Middle Ages, we have created trauma that contributes to Jewish people’s feeling of vulnerability. In the nineteenth century, anti-Semitic European nationalisms and colonial tropes gave rise to Zionism as a secular national movement. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, European powers carved up the region, carelessly imposing boundaries, aggravating local cleavages, and exploiting its natural resources. The 1917 Balfour Declaration promised to protect “the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine,” but European leaders did not follow suit. Much had prepared the ground for what many consider the worst crime in human history, the Holocaust.\nThese dark chapters oblige Europeans to prevent the annihilation of Israel, the safe haven that Jews sought after the Holocaust. But if Europe bears responsibility for its victims, it also bears responsibility for the victims of its victims. After the end of the British mandate in Palestine, Israel’s 1948 war of independence, and the flight or expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs from their homes, Europeans did not push back against the UN’s failure to implement its partition plan, which would have established a homeland in Palestine for two peoples. Although the 1967 Six-Day War was triggered by all of Israel’s neighbors, after the war, Europeans failed to stop the Israeli government’s creeping occupation of Palestinian territory and bankrolled serious human rights violations by Israeli troops in the West Bank.\nAs the twentieth century drew to a close, the EU became content to play a purportedly neutral role, letting the United States take the lead in the Oslo process, offering ultimately inadequate support to the Palestinian Authority, and providing a destination for Israeli tourists and exports. It has perpetuated the problem by turning a blind eye to the utter violation of Palestinians’ rights by settlers and soldiers and ignoring Palestinians’ legitimate aspirations. Europeans cannot stay the hapless fools in this tragic story, dishing out cash with their eyes closed.\nBut Europeans cannot simply revert to a moralistic tendency to tell others what to do. They must assert that it is in their own interest, too, not only to help create a stable future for Israelis and Palestinians but also to strongly pressure both the Israeli government to do its part and the Palestinian Authority to denounce violence and adopt durable democratic reforms. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict stirs emotions and fuels polarization in European countries, given the shared historical baggage. And increasingly, it is undermining the foundations of the international order that Europeans cherish and rely on. If we do not accept our portion of responsibility for it, the conflict will impose itself on us. No other conflict overseas is so closely linked to European history. The EU as a whole—not just individual member states—needs to be become much bolder in addressing it.\nAN EXCESS OF CAUTION\nFor too long, Europeans have counted on U.S. leadership to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This expectation is especially irresponsible now. Many in Europe feel that U.S. President Donald Trump is neither able nor inclined to act as an effective mediator. But no matter what role the United States seeks in the Middle East, Europeans have their own unique role to play, because they have learned firsthand that despite the distorted image of the “other” that politicians may seek to project, most people desire to live in peace with their neighbors. Specific circumstances, however, can allow extremists to gain the upper hand.\nSince October 7, the EU has deployed its traditional tools in the region—from economic instruments to normative discourse—but cautiously and inconsistently. It has significantly increased its aid to Gaza—pledging around $125 million in 2024, including through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees and the Red Crescent—but without adequately ensuring that this aid reaches its targets. It has called repeatedly for a cease-fire and for respect for international law. One of us, Borrell, has issued numerous statements condemning both Hamas’s murderous attacks and Israel’s entirely disproportionate responses.\nEurope has leverage in the Middle East it hasn’t allowed itself to use.\nBut internal divisions among member states undermined the EU’s efficacy. Some EU leaders cautiously backed the International Criminal Court’s investigations, while others, such as Austria and Germany, have declined to implement its arrest warrants against Israeli officials. And because EU member states, beginning with Germany and Hungary, could not agree on whether to revisit the union’s trade policy with Israel, the EU continues to be Israel’s largest trading partner. As a result, the EU, as a bloc, has been largely relegated to the sidelines, divided internally and overshadowed in cease-fire diplomacy by the United States and regional actors such as Egypt and Qatar. Shouldn’t the EU also have acted as a mediator?\nThe EU’s decades-long experience in fostering peaceful compromise between former enemies—grounded in a philosophy of mutual recognition and nondomination—gives the union special relevance. And it has the practical instruments to play a far more central role in Middle East peacemaking.\nTo get a full grasp of that leverage, the European External Action Service—the EU’s diplomatic agency—will need to give teeth to the many resolutions that the EU Council and European Parliament have put forth over the years, as well as the guidelines set out for a comprehensive Middle East strategy by the 2024–2029 EU Commission. To make good on these appeals, the EU will need to use the full panoply of legal, financial, trade, political, and regulatory tools at its disposal to affect existing levers and pressure points.\nEurope has immense leverage, but so far, it hasn’t allowed itself to use it effectively. To some extent, this is historically justified, given the continent’s long record of power abuse. But when it comes to protecting their core values and vital interests against external threats, Europeans should not hesitate to put their leverage to good use.\nCHANGE OF STATE\nOn the diplomatic front, EU states must start by extending the application of the principle that undergirds the EU itself: reciprocal recognition, which sits at the core of the state-based order created in Europe in the eighteenth century and has transformed the continent into a peace project over the past 80 years. The European Economic Community, the precursor to the EU, first called for Palestinians’ right to self-determination in 1980. Although 14 out of 27 EU member states now recognize the state of Palestine, the EU would be much more effective if all of its member states—including the largest, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland—recognized Palestine within the 1967 borders, with mutually agreed-on land swaps. Far from rewarding Hamas, such a step would empower moderates on all sides who champion diplomatic solutions instead of extremists who preach violence. Rather than waiting for negotiations to make a path to statehood, the EU must affirm that statehood is the pathway to negotiation.\nAlongside recognition, and to make the call for a cease-fire credible, the EU must step up its support for Palestinian statebuilding, including by pressuring the Palestinian Authority to become more effective, more accountable, and more democratic, given that the EU remains its top donor. Europe owes this to the Palestinian youth who have long been angered by the corruption of their own leadership. Europeans must then translate a shared commitment to a two-state solution into shared leadership with Arab states. The Global Alliance for the Implementation of the Two-State Solution, created at the September 2024 UN General Assembly, can be better used to develop incentives that support the peace camp and encourage other countries in the Middle East to finally recognize Israel alongside a Palestinian state.\nOnly if Palestinians are able to determine their own fate can postwar governance in Gaza succeed. The EU should help design and fund an International Transitional Authority for Gaza pending the devolution of authority to Gazans, on the model of prior UN initiatives in Cambodia and East Timor. Europe must take a stronger stance against actors who flout its taxpayers’ norms and interests by destroying or confiscating EU-funded infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza. But the European agenda must also aim to reverse Gazans’ utter dependence on outside aid while enhancing reconstruction standards. The EU can and should be central to Gaza’s reconstruction, given Europeans’ experience with sustainable and environmentally friendly construction techniques. It must help unite the rest of the world against any attempt to uproot Palestinians from their land, whether by resettlement, annexation, transfer, or mass expulsion.\nEurope must also invest much more, and more effectively, in supporting civil society groups that are fighting for peace in the spirit of mutual respect, empathy, and recognition. The EU, and not only individual member states, must spotlight and broadcast in Israel as well as in the Arab world the remarkable peace efforts made by Israeli and Palestinian civil society activists—including, for instance, the Alliance for Middle East Peace, Women Wage Peace, Women of the Sun, Parents Circle-Families Forum, Breaking the Silence, B’Tselem, and the 2024 process that led to the Barcelona declaration on “our shared humanity.” And Europe must strongly oppose the Israeli proposal to tax foreign aid to peace organizations by 80 percent while countering pressure on civil society organizations that opposed the Palestinian leadership.\nMore concretely, and when the time is ripe, the EU could support the convening of a citizens’ “peace assembly” made up of randomly selected Israelis and Palestinians who would gather on neutral ground over several months to help design a path to peace. Europeans have started to convene such assemblies in the last decade, to good effect. It is time to give citizens in the Middle East a far bigger say in their own future.\nSPOILER EFFECT\nOne of the most important lessons that centuries of wars taught Europe is that international relations is not a zero-sum game. But for too long, Europe has failed to apply this lesson in confronting spoilers in the Middle East determined to sidetrack a peace process. The EU rightly listed Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other groups as terrorist entities more than 20 years ago. But it has done little to sanction Israeli settlers who perpetuate violent acts against Palestinians.\nMoreover, the EU has yet to act in the face of Israel’s war crimes in Gaza. Such unbalanced pressure ends up strengthening spoilers on both sides of a conflict. The hard-liners who escape penalties feel vindicated and emboldened, and those who are targeted use the pressure to garner sympathy with their constituencies.\nConsistency is paramount in a policy world replete with accusations of double standards. The EU cannot impose an import ban on products from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine and shy away from imposing them on products from illegal settlements in the West Bank. Nor can the EU call on other states to honor the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and announce that it will not enforce the same body’s warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nUnbalanced pressure strengthens spoilers on both sides of a conflict.\nThe EU can rectify this: it could, for instance, revoke visa waivers for residents of settlements and implement Schengen-wide individual entry bans. In fact, by imposing visa requirements only on West Bank Palestinians and not on settlers who live there, the EU becomes complicit in an apartheid-style regime. Crucially, the EU-Israel Association Agreement—the central legal framework that has governed relations between the EU and Israel since 2000—could be reexamined. Its Article 2 provides a legal basis to reconsider the agreement’s terms in response to human rights violations. A recent investigation by the EU’s own human rights envoy clearly established these violations. Seventeen member states have now joined Ireland and Spain in calling for a reassessment of the agreement.\nFirst, and at a minimum, the EU could take preliminary steps such as initiating a formal review of the agreement, suspending summits and high-level political contacts between European and Israeli leaders, or suspending Israel’s participation in some EU programs such as Erasmus+, which supports education. Even more important, the EU can send a strong message to Israel’s government and citizens by suspending the agreement’s trade provisions, which in practice would mean pausing Israel’s preferential tariffs. In line with an International Court of Justice 2024 advisory opinion warning states “to abstain from entering into economic or trade dealings with Israel” that “entrench its unlawful presence” in occupied Palestinian territories, the EU should also ban imports from illegal settlements altogether—imports that already fall outside the Association Agreement.\nAlthough unanimous support from EU member states is required to suspend the entire agreement, most experts in the European Commission’s Legal Service assert that only a qualified majority vote—in which policies can be adopted by 55 percent of states representing at least 65 percent of the EU’s total population—is needed to suspend its trade provisions. Given that the EU has only ever suspended preferential trade provisions with Myanmar and Cambodia, such a move would be of high symbolic significance. Nothing should stop the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, from supporting such a move at the next EU Foreign Affairs Council in July.\nMOMENT FOR TRUTH\nThe EU must also uphold its values by supporting the free flow of factual information. Hamas has denied the media its independence by harassing, detaining, and censoring journalists who report critically on its actions or governance. In Gaza, Netanyahu’s government has imposed the longest media blackout in the history of modern journalism. More journalists have been killed in the strip than in any previous armed conflict. Israel refuses to cooperate with UN-mandated investigators, defying legally binding orders made by the International Court of Justice.\nHate speech, incitement, supremacist discourse, disinformation, and narrative manipulation online are fueling anti-Semitism as well as anti-Arab and anti-Muslim hatred. The EU already has strong regulatory powers over social media companies, and it can do more to dissolve digital echo chambers by obliging social media companies to disclose and adapt their algorithms.\nOne sometimes hears the argument that there can be “no moral equivalence between a democratic state and a terrorist group.” In principle, this makes perfect sense. When dealing with the rule of law, however, the nonequivalence argument falls apart. There is a reason why justice is blindfolded, why both sides of her scale are level, and why courts must be independent from politics. Judges must examine the act, not the actor.\nThe EU must make it much clearer that it will not tolerate efforts to intimidate international courts. Recent threats and sanctions against ICC officials by Israel and the United States constitute a direct challenge to the multilateral legal order the EU claims to champion.\nAlthough the EU’s 1996 Blocking Statute is still in force, the way it is applied has become outdated. Originally designed to shield EU companies from the extraterritorial reach of U.S. sanctions—such as those targeting Cuba or Iran—it has not yet been adapted to protect institutions such as the ICC or its EU-based personnel from similar coercive measures. A revised Blocking Statute should explicitly include such provisions and ensure that the union’s legal and diplomatic infrastructure resists extraterritorial pressure. And the EU should consider targeted sanctions—such as travel bans and asset freezes—against individuals and entities, whether governmental or nongovernmental, that seek to obstruct or delegitimize international justice mechanisms. This move would demonstrate that the EU is willing to match, with concrete deterrent measures, its rhetorical support for the rules-based order.\nDIVIDE AND CONQUER\nBefore anything else, however, Europeans need to have a frank discussion about the elephant in the room: their disunity when it comes to condemning Israel or recognizing a Palestinian state. This disunity has prevented the EU from using its immense leverage to good effect. The Gaza war has underscored the EU’s alarming inability to make timely decisions, even when a large majority of member states agree. For instance, despite the fact that a majority of EU states supported a call for a cease-fire in October–November 2023, the EU could not act decisively.\nEurope cannot stand for the values it believes in without improving its decision-making processes. Some reforms do not require a change to the EU’s treaty. The EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy currently requires unanimous votes for decisions on military or defense matters, sanctions, and most foreign policy positions. But member states could enact a switch to qualified majority voting in some areas of foreign policy, although such a switch would need to be decided by unanimity.\nAlternatively, to bypass the reluctance of some member states, a smaller group could establish a so-called CFSP+, or an addition to the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The existing provisions on enhanced cooperation in Article 20 of the EU’s Treaty allow for at least nine member states to come together to utilize certain foreign policy tools not related to defense. Because such an action has never been taken before, those states would have to explore what a CFSP+ would concretely allow them to do. But they may well be able to use the EU’s trade, aid, and political leverage more decisively.\nThe Israeli-Palestinian crisis has shown how easily the EU can become paralyzed on divisive subjects. This is the moment to overcome the crippling effect of 27 veto powers—for the sake of European policy as well as for the Middle East. Such a change might, in turn, make it easier for the EU to help codesign a peace plan incorporating the views of all the relevant actors in the region. If a majority of member states can coalesce more effectively around a vision, the rest might follow. Europeans once trod the path from war to stable coexistence to mutual flourishing. We must allow ourselves to hope that our recent history can inspire our neighbors to trace their path to peace.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "The End of the Age of NGOs?", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/end-age-ngos", "text": "The 1990s were a golden age for nongovernmental organizations. It was a time when well-known groups such as Amnesty International, Greenpeace, and Oxfam grew their budgets and expanded their global reach. Between 1990 and 2000, the number of international NGOs—not-for-profit groups that are largely independent from government and work in multiple countries in pursuit of the public good—increased by 42 percent. Thousands of organizations were founded. Many of these organizations championed liberal causes, such as LGBTQ rights and gun control. Conservative groups emerged, too, with rival policy agendas.\nAs their numbers grew, NGOs became important political players. Newly minted organizations changed state policies. The International Campaign to Ban Landmines, a coalition of NGOs formed in 1992, successfully pushed for the adoption of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention in 1997—an effort that won it the Nobel Peace Prize. Transparency International, a Berlin-based NGO established in 1993, raised the profile of corruption issues through its advocacy, building momentum toward the adoption of the UN Convention Against Corruption in 2003. Future UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan declared at the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights that “the twenty-first century will be an era of NGOs.” In an influential 1997 essay in Foreign Affairs, Jessica Mathews argued that the end of the Cold War brought with it a “power shift”: global civil society, often formalized as NGOs, was wresting authority and influence from states. More and more often, Mathews contended, NGOs were taking over responsibilities for the delivery of development and humanitarian assistance, pushing governments around during international negotiations, and setting the policy agenda on issues such as environmental protection and human rights.\nToday, however, the picture looks remarkably different. The population of international NGOs has stagnated: between 2010 and 2020, their numbers grew by less than five percent. Over the past two decades, public skepticism about the virtues and advantages of NGOs has deepened, governments have honed strategies to undermine NGO activities, and many of the revenue streams that keep NGOs operational—such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which officially closed this week—have begun to dry up. Overall, the NGO sector has less political opportunity and capacity than it once had. And in many cases, NGOs have not just lost power relative to previous decades. States have clawed that power back. The result is an end to the era of NGOs—a great loss for the people who have relied on these organizations’ services, and a boon to autocratic governments that have seen their advocacy as a threat.\nMOUNTING CRITICISM\nOur research over the past ten years has documented changes in the international NGO sector. In addition to collecting information from organizational directories and tax records to study trends in NGO founding, closures, and budgets, we spoke with senior staff from many different types of organizations—by fielding a large-scale survey, holding focus groups, and conducting qualitative interviews—to gather the perspectives of those that work in this sector.\nWhat we found was a stark transformation. When NGOs first rose to prominence as international actors, their commitment to principled activity and their nonprofit character distinguished them from governments and private companies. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, for instance, earned plaudits for protecting vulnerable individuals and promoting stricter international standards for human rights. NGOs also gained legitimacy because they provided important input to global governance, channeling the voices of citizens and interests that otherwise were not well represented in international institutions. Those working within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, for example, brought perspectives from environmentalists and communities affected by climate change to high-level negotiations. Recognizing the value of such guidance, international organizations expanded NGOs’ access significantly. The services NGOs provided directly to communities, moreover, brought them into closer cooperation with national governments. From the 1990s onward, governments increasingly relied on NGOs such as CARE International and Mercy Corps to deliver foreign aid. In this optimistic time, the rise of NGOs was seen by many as a chance for organized civil society to make the world a better place, providing better service delivery and influencing progressive policy change on the environment, human rights, and arms control.\nBy the early years of the twenty-first century, however, criticism of NGOs was mounting. Skeptics on both the right and the left raised questions about NGOs’ effectiveness, accountability, and extensive political influence. Some NGOs made attempts at reform. They created transparency initiatives to share more information about their finances and decision-making processes. In the 2010s, many groups began to reorganize operations through localization initiatives, which were meant to devolve decision-making and spending power to partners in developing countries. But that has not stopped world leaders—including in Western countries that were key to NGOs’ initial growth—from making vehement objections to NGO activities. Members of the European Parliament have accused environmental NGOs of corruption, opacity, and working against EU objectives, values, and interests. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has questioned the “political neutrality” of civil society groups that receive government funding, accusing several of partisan activity.\nPublic skepticism about the virtues and advantages of NGOs has deepened.\nSome of the criticisms are grounded in real developments in the NGO sector. For one, as the number of NGOs rose, groups had to compete for resources. NGO staff frequently note that this competition for funding from donors, access to governments, and attention from the media and the public can distract from their service delivery and advocacy. For example, staff who work in disaster relief have described to us how, after a catastrophe, NGOs jockey to lead the response effort in order to secure funding and media attention. This impedes coordination among humanitarian groups, sometimes to the detriment of the people they are trying to help. The perception that NGOs are primarily focused on courting donors and the media—regardless of whether such behavior takes place—has weakened the notion that they are different from for-profit firms.\nThe NGO world has also been rocked by prominent cases of misconduct. For example, Oxfam Great Britain, a national affiliate of an international organization that aims to reduce poverty, was embroiled in a sexual exploitation scandal in Haiti in 2018, making it ineligible for British government funding for three years. The organization eventually had its funding access restored, only to face additional accusations of sexual abuse and fraud in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2021. Similar scandals have plagued humanitarian and development operations run by Plan International and the Red Cross. These cases of unethical behavior toward vulnerable aid recipients have had lasting harmful effects on the reputations not just of individual NGOs but of the whole sector.\nPublic trust in NGOs has suffered as a result. In 25 years of Edelman Trust Barometer polling across 28 countries, 2021 was the first year that respondents reported that they had more trust in businesses than in NGOs. In 2025, businesses were seen as nearly as ethical as NGOs and far more competent.\nCRACKING DOWN\nThese critiques of NGOs come at a bad political moment for the sector. In the liberal order that dominated after the Cold War, donor states’ and international organizations’ support for NGOs spread to countries across the world. As countries became more democratic, especially in Africa and eastern Europe, they became more welcoming of such bodies. The number of nondemocracies that permitted NGOs to operate also expanded in the 1990s, with countries such as China and Zimbabwe attempting to bolster state capacity by allowing NGOs to deliver essential public goods. But this tolerance has eroded as challenges to democracy grow. Particularly since the late 2010s, democratic rights have declined globally, including in large countries such as India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey. This shift has gone hand in hand with greater scrutiny of and stricter restrictions on NGOs. International NGOs’ ability to operate has contracted or disappeared altogether in nondemocracies, and the likelihood that domestic civil society groups will face repression for cooperating with international NGOs has increased.\nMany authoritarian governments now fear that allowing NGOs to operate freely will create pressures that lead to democratization or even regime change, and so they have sought ways to undercut these organizations to protect their hold on power. In Russia, for example, President Vladimir Putin pushed through a law in 2006 that imposed broad restrictions on NGO activities, including by allowing the government to deny the registration and prohibit the programming of any NGO that the government deems a “threat to the Russian Federation.” The crackdown came amid worsening relations between Moscow and the West and was motivated, in part, by Putin’s belief that Western-aligned NGOs had orchestrated the Color Revolutions—a series of protest movements against autocratic rule in former Soviet states and Serbia in the early twenty-first century—and could stir similar protest activity in Russia.\nIn 2012, Putin’s government went even further, passing a law that requires all NGOs that engage in political activity and receive foreign funding to register as foreign agents, which subjects them to onerous financial reporting requirements and enables government monitoring of their activities. They also must identify themselves publicly as foreign agents, undermining their credibility with domestic audiences. The Russian foreign agents law became a prototype for similar legislation in many other countries, including Georgia, Hungary, and Kyrgyzstan.\nGovernments have honed strategies to undermine NGO activities.\nAccording to research by the political scientist Suparna Chaudhry, more than 130 countries have adopted restrictions on international and foreign-funded NGOs in the past three decades. In addition to imposing burdensome administrative rules such as those in the Russian law, these restrictions can also create the conditions for legal sanctioning, imprisonment, or the violent repression of activists. Under such pressures, NGOs find it difficult to work on human rights, gender, anticorruption, democracy, environmental protection, and other politically sensitive issues.\nIn India, for example, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has revoked the registrations of thousands of foreign-funded NGOs since 2014. This crackdown targeted well-known organizations such as the environmental group Greenpeace India, which was barred from receiving foreign donations in 2015—and as a result had to shed staff and close two of its offices. Citing India’s 2010 Foreign Contributions Regulation Act, the government charged that Greenpeace had “prejudicially affected the economic interest of the state” and concealed the receipt of foreign funds. The group claims that it was targeted for its efforts to organize communities to protest pollution and coal mining, and it has denied the allegation that it misreported its funds. To date, Indian court rulings have allowed Greenpeace to keep its offices open, but the organization has scaled back and reoriented many of its campaigns. In Ethiopia, meanwhile, the researchers Kendra Dupuy, James Ron, and Aseem Prakash have found that an NGO registration law introduced in 2009 forced nearly all human rights organizations there to close, and those that remained stopped their rights-based advocacy work and began to provide only general development services such as education and poverty-alleviation programs.\nUndermining NGOs can take less direct forms, too. In some cases, governments have created NGO-like organizations that, while posing as citizens’ groups, pursue the governments’ own agendas. Low-quality or “zombie” international election monitors, for instance, now observe elections in countries such as Azerbaijan, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. These groups endorse contests that are neither free nor fair, providing autocratic leaders a way to dispute the assessments of more reliable election monitors, such as the Carter Center. Government-organized NGOs also submit written reports and make oral statements as part of the UN’s Universal Periodic Review, a peer review of each UN member state’s human rights record that takes place in four-year cycles, to praise repressive countries. These NGO impostors can muddy the waters of genuine advocacy by civil society and further erode the legitimacy of NGOs in the eyes of the public.\nThe growing influence of nondemocracies—especially China and Russia—in global politics has eased the way for a proliferation of government strategies to check the power of NGOs. The political scientists Christopher Adolph and Aseem Prakash have found that the more developing countries orient their exports toward China and away from the West, the more likely they are to repress NGOs—because Beijing, unlike Western governments, does not use trade sanctions to pressure other countries to protect human rights. One of us (Bush), together with the political scientists Christina Cottiero and Lauren Prather, has documented how Russia has consistently cast doubt on the legitimacy of Western election observers and denounced democracy promotion efforts as a violation of state sovereignty since the early 2000s. As a result of Moscow’s efforts, countries are more likely to host low-quality election monitors when they have closer political and economic ties to Russia.\nBUDGET SQUEEZE\nEven if they disapprove of NGOs’ political activities, governments have often hesitated to place severe restrictions on such groups because NGOs fund and implement valuable development, health, and humanitarian aid programs. But this incentive is changing. As budget constraints tighten, competing priorities mount, and populist opposition intensifies, governments have begun to reduce their spending on foreign aid—a major source of funding for international NGOs. Overseas development assistance by top donor countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development fell by more than seven percent in 2024, with significant reductions likely still to come.\nThis change has been most abrupt in the United States, where President Donald Trump’s administration has cut nearly all foreign aid programs since he entered office in January. But the trend precedes Trump and applies beyond the United States. Development budgets have also come under threat in Europe. In some cases, the pressure comes from right-wing parties, as in Norway and Sweden, but in others the impetus for retrenchment has come from the center and the left. Germany, the world’s second-largest donor in terms of formal development assistance, made steep cuts to both humanitarian and development aid as part of an austerity drive led by the coalition government composed of progressive, green, and center-right parties in 2024. The new conservative chancellor, who faces demands to raise defense spending, is unlikely to reverse those steps. The United Kingdom has been slashing its foreign aid budget since 2020 amid a weak post-pandemic economic recovery, and the current Labour government expects to make further cuts as it, too, ramps up defense spending. France, facing decreased growth and a ballooning public deficit, also significantly reduced its budget for overseas development assistance in 2024.\nThe revenue streams that keep NGOs operational have begun to dry up.\nThe pool of resources available to NGOs is shrinking at the same time that skepticism grows at the highest levels of government about the wisdom of using these groups to deliver foreign aid. When the U.S. government officially shut down USAID, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote that “the executives of the countless NGOs” the agency had supported were “the only ones living well . . . while those they purported to help fell further behind.” And in the Netherlands, right-wing Foreign Trade and Development Minister Reinette Klever has called for both reducing foreign aid and decreasing funding to civil society organizations as a proportion of government aid.\nSome nongovernmental funders may step up in response to reductions in public spending. In the United States, over 70 foundations have signed a “meet the moment” pledge to fill gaps created by the Trump administration’s cuts. A group of private donors has also created a “bridge fund” to help provide short-term support to programs whose funds were frozen as part of the administration’s shutdown of USAID. Given the current global financial uncertainty, however, it is a difficult time for philanthropies and other private donors to make major investments. And ultimately, private capital cannot match the economic resources of states.\nMany organizations worldwide have already begun to shed staff, and the loss of funding will further curtail humanitarian relief efforts, programs for migrants, vaccine administration, and other NGO activities. It also leaves NGOs vulnerable to repressive governments that allow these groups to operate only because they provide useful services. Such governments may, instead, turn instead to China, which offers an alternative source of development assistance via its Belt and Road Initiative. The Chinese model does not involve NGOs or expect recipient countries to meet any human rights or democracy standards. In effect, without the value that Western money affords them, NGOs in many parts of the world may become targets of governments that see their independent advocacy as more trouble than it’s worth.\nPOWER SHIFTS BACK\nGrowing popular skepticism of NGOs, active government efforts to undermine these organizations, and shrinking resources all reduce the power of NGOs in world politics. In many cases, states have reclaimed this power for themselves. A government that expels human rights monitors increases its ability to control information and suppress dissent. A government that restrains environmental NGOs has an easier time polluting and engaging in destructive economic activity. And without an active civil society at home, a government becomes more insulated from the pressure of international organizations and foreign governments when it fails to live up to treaty obligations or societal expectations. These developments enhance the power of the state and feed into the global decline of liberal norms.\nIf NGOs are to reverse these trends, they may now have to do much of the work themselves. It seems unlikely that governments will suddenly expand their foreign aid budgets or that growing illiberalism will soon give way to a friendlier international environment. NGOs can highlight their many good deeds and capacity to learn from past mistakes, but that will do only so much to restore their legitimacy. Organizations will also need to undertake overdue reforms to make their financial reporting more transparent and increase their accountability to their beneficiaries. And if they work together, NGOs may be able to resist repression: in Kenya in 2013 and Nigeria in 2017, civil society groups organized successful campaigns to prevent the adoption of legal restrictions on foreign-funded NGOs.\nNGOs were never impervious to political challenges or financial constraints.\nWhere government funding is no longer available, NGOs will need to think creatively to either refocus their programming or seek alternative sources of support. Ultimately, however, many may fold under the financial strain. Other types of actors—including socially conscious businesses and direct-giving campaigns such as GiveWell—could step in to provide some of the services these NGOs once did. But NGOs’ critical roles as advocates and watchdogs may simply be left unfilled.\nAfter the Cold War, the dramatic growth of NGOs brought with it a transfer of power from states to civil society. This development benefited democratic governments whose interests were largely aligned with these organizations’ objectives—in 2001, former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell famously (and controversially) called NGOs a “force multiplier” for achieving U.S. foreign policy goals, including democracy promotion and human rights protection. By reducing the foreign aid budgets that support NGO activities, the United States and Europe are walking away from a key source of influence. They have little to gain from a weakened NGO sector; nondemocratic governments, on the other hand, see political advantages in the suppression of organizations that promote liberal values.\nThe post–Cold War power shift generated optimism that an active and well-resourced global civil society would change the world for the better. But the NGO sector was never impervious to political challenges or financial constraints. What the optimists did not foresee was that power could eventually shift back.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

A post on Telegram said the strike also destroyed a one-storey administrative building. Firefighters also extinguished blazes in four buildings, according to officials.\n-\nVadym Filashkin, the governor of Ukraine’s Donetsk region, which encompasses Kostiantynivka, said on Telegram that it was time to “take a responsible decision. Evacuate to less dangerous regions of Ukraine!”, amid Russia’s latest offensive westward.\n-\nA five-year-old boy died of burns sustained in a Ukrainian drone strike on a beach in the Russian city of Kursk, regional Governor Alexander Khinshtein said on Telegram, raising the death toll in the attack to four, including a member of Russia’s National Guard.\n-\nRussian forces advanced at key points along the front in eastern Ukraine, defeating Ukrainian units in at least six regions, including Donetsk and Kharkiv, and using missiles and drones to strike ammunition depots and airfields, the Ministry of Defence in Moscow said. It also claimed Russia captured a village in Donetsk.\nWeapons\n-\nThe United States is delivering artillery shells and mobile rocket artillery missiles to Ukraine, two US officials told the Reuters news agency, days after President Donald Trump’s administration halted shipments of some critical weapons to Kyiv.\n-\nTrump also said that he would consider sending Patriot missiles to Ukraine, which he has previously said Kyiv would need for its defence.\nPolitics and diplomacy\n-\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he held a “substantive” conversation with Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, in Rome shortly after Trump pledged to send more defensive weapons to Kyiv.\n-\nZelenskyy met Pope Leo at the papal summer residence of Castel Gandolfo, where the pontiff told him that the Vatican was willing to host Russia-Ukraine peace talks. It was the Ukrainian leader’s second meeting with the pope in his two-month-old papacy.\n-\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will open the Rome conference on Ukraine on Thursday, with Zelenskyy and European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen in attendance. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Dutch leader Dick Schoof and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis are also expected to attend.\n-\nMerz has announced that he will make an offer of air defence systems to Ukraine during the Rome conference.\n-\nUkraine said it detained a Chinese father and son, both suspected of spying on its prized Neptune antiship missile programme, a key part of Kyiv’s growing domestic arms industry critical to its defence against Russian invaders. Kyiv has accused Beijing of helping the Kremlin’s war effort.\n-\nRussian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the Kremlin had evidence that Ukraine has repeatedly used antipersonnel mines that have injured civilians. Ukraine in June announced its withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention banning the production and use of antipersonnel mines.\n-\nRussian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov will visit North Korea this weekend, the latest in a series of high-profile visits by top Moscow officials as the two countries deepen military ties, according to Zakharova.\n- US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet Lavrov on Thursday on the sidelines of the ASEAN meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, a senior US State Department official said.\nEconomy\n-\nRussian authorities have confiscated company assets worth some $50bn over the past three years, citing justifications ranging from illegal actions by Western countries to the need for strategic resources, underscoring the shift toward to a “fortress Russia” economic model amid the war in Ukraine, the Reuters news agency reported, citing research from the Russian law firm Nektorov, Saveliev & Partners.\n- Italy is set to unveil a support scheme worth 300 million euros ($351m) for small and medium enterprises involved in the reconstruction of Ukraine, Minister of Foreign Affairs Antonio Tajani said.\n-\nAn Italian government source told the Reuters news agency that about 500bn euros ($585bn) would be needed for the reconstruction, recovery and modernisation of Ukraine, citing World Bank estimates.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 01:24:26 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml"}

But as the United States president hosts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week, the two leaders have heaped praise on each other.\nMeanwhile, Israel continues its assault on the Palestinian territory, where more than 57,575 people have been killed.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 itemsUS sanctions UN expert Francesca Albanese over Israel criticism\nTrump: ‘Very good chance’ of Gaza ceasefire this week or next\nAnalysts say that if Trump is truly seeking a lasting ceasefire in Gaza, he must leverage US military aid to Israel to pressure Netanyahu to agree to a deal.\nBrian Finucane, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group nonprofit, drew a parallel between Trump’s mixed messaging and that of his predecessor, Joe Biden. Both men, he said, called for a ceasefire but showed unwillingness to press Israel to end the fighting.\n“It’s like deja vu with the Biden administration, where you would hear similar pronouncements from the White House,” said Finucane.\n“If a ceasefire is indeed the ‘utmost priority’ of the White House, it has the leverage to bring it about.”\nThe US provides Israel with billions of dollars in military assistance each year, on top of offering it diplomatic backing at international forums like the United Nations.\nWhile US officials expressed optimism about reaching a 60-day truce this week that could lead to a permanent ceasefire, Netanyahu told reporters in Washington, DC, that Israel has “still to finish the job in Gaza” and eliminate the armed group Hamas.\nFinucane, a former US State Department lawyer, described Netanyahu’s comments as “maximalist rhetoric” and “bluster”, stressing that Trump could push Israel to stop the war.\nHe said Trump could use the “threat of suspension of military support” to achieve the ceasefire, “which very much would be in the interest of the United States and the interest of the president himself in terms of scoring a diplomatic win”.\nTrump and Netanyahu ‘in lockstep’\nNetanyahu arrived in Washington, DC, on Monday and took a “victory lap” with Trump to celebrate their joint attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities during a 12-day war last month.\nFrom the start, the Israeli prime minister appeared to play to Trump’s ego. As he sat down to a White House dinner on Monday night, Netanyahu announced he had nominated the US president for a Nobel Peace Prize.\nThe two leaders met again on Tuesday, with Trump saying that their talks would be all about Gaza and the truce proposal.\nA day later, Netanyahu said he and Trump were “in lockstep” over Gaza.\n“President Trump wants a deal, but not at any price,” the Israeli prime minister said. “I want a deal, but not at any price. Israel has security requirements and other requirements, and we’re working together to try to achieve it.”\nBut Annelle Sheline, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, said that Israel is the party standing in the way of a ceasefire. She noted that Hamas has already demanded a lasting end to the war, which is what the Trump administration says it is seeking.\n“While we know Trump has said he wants a ceasefire, thus far, we’ve not seen Trump being willing to use America’s extensive leverage to actually get there,” Sheline told Al Jazeera.\nFar from stopping the flow of arms to Israel, the Trump administration has taken pride in resuming the transfer of heavy bombs – the only weapons that Biden temporarily withheld during the war on Gaza.\nDire situation in Gaza\nWhile truce talks are ongoing, the horrors of Israel’s war on Gaza, which UN experts and rights groups have described as a genocide, are intensifying.\nHospitals are running out of fuel, cases of preventable diseases are on the rise, hunger is rampant, and hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli fire over the past weeks while trying to receive food at US-backed, privately-run aid distribution sites.\nNancy Okail, the president of the Center for International Policy, said that Trump appears to be interested in a Gaza ceasefire in part to boost his own image as a peacemaker and to win a Nobel Peace Prize.\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump promised to bring peace to the world, seizing on Americans’ weariness of war after the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nBut so far, he has failed to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. And he oversaw the outbreak of war between Israel and Iran, even ordering the US’s participation in it.\nThe US president took credit for a Gaza truce that came into effect in January, only to let it unravel as he supported Israel’s decision to resume the war in March.\nOkail said the atrocities in Gaza could not be stopped with just verbal calls for a ceasefire.\n“If it is not accompanied by action – as in the suspension of aid or suspension of arms to Israel – Netanyahu doesn’t have any reason to actually go forward seriously with the peace negotiations,” she told Al Jazeera.\nNetanyahu pushes displacement\nEven if a 60-day truce is reached, rights advocates are concerned that Israel may not only return to war afterwards, but it might also use the time to drive Palestinians out of Gaza and further entrench its occupation.\nHamas said on Wednesday that it had agreed to release 10 Israeli captives as part of the proposed deal, but the remaining sticking points are about the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and guarantees for a permanent ceasefire.\nBefore Netanyahu arrived in Washington, DC, Israeli Minister of Defence Israel Katz revealed a plan to create an internment camp for Palestinians in southern Gaza, according to the newspaper Haaretz.\nThe publication quoted Katz as saying that Israel would implement an “emigration plan” to remove Palestinians from Gaza, which rights groups say would amount to ethnic cleansing, a crime against humanity.\nThe idea of depopulating Gaza is not new. Far-right Israeli ministers have been publicly championing it since the start of the war. But the international community started taking the idea seriously when Trump floated it in February as part of his desire to turn Gaza into the “Riviera of the Middle East”.\nNetanyahu brought it up again during his visit, saying that Palestinians in Gaza should be free to leave the territory if they choose.\n‘Involuntary transfer’\nWhile the Trump administration has not re-endorsed the ethnic cleansing scheme in Gaza this week, the White House still suggested that Palestinians cannot remain in the territory.\n“This has become an uninhabitable place for human beings, and the president has a big heart,” Trump’s spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters.\n“He wants this to be a prosperous, safe part of the region where people and families can thrive.”\nRights advocates have stressed that people under bombardment and with no access to basic necessities cannot have a “free” choice to stay or leave a place.\nSheline said that the international fears that Trump and Netanyahu are working to ethnically cleanse Gaza and displace its Palestinian residents elsewhere are warranted.\n“There was a lot of discussion of the idea that maybe because the US helped Israel with its war on Iran, that would be the leverage used for a ceasefire in Gaza,” she said.\n“But instead, it sort of seems to be something like: If Netanyahu agrees to a ceasefire, then the US will facilitate this involuntary transfer of Palestinians out of Gaza.”\nFor her part, Okail likened pushing people to leave Gaza under the threat of bombardment and starvation to shoving Palestinians out of the enclave at gunpoint.\n“If expanding the occupation and ethnic cleansing is their approach to ceasefire, it means they want to kill any ceasefire attempt, not negotiate one,” she told Al Jazeera.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 01:06:39 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml"}

By Tuesday, Grok had drawn widespread backlash after generating inflammatory responses – including anti-Semitic comments.\nOne Grok user asking the question, “which 20th-century figure would be best suited to deal with this problem (anti-white hate)”, received the anti-Semitic response: “To deal with anti-white hate? Adolf Hitler, no question.”\nHere’s what we know about the Grok chatbot and the controversies it has caused.\nWhat is Grok?\nGrok, a chatbot created by xAI – the AI company Elon Musk launched in 2023 – is designed to deliver witty, direct responses inspired by the style of the science fiction novel by British author Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, and Jarvis from Marvel’s Iron Man.\nIn The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, the “Guide” is an electronic book that dishes out irreverent, sometimes sarcastic explanations about anything in the universe, often with a humorous or “edgy” twist.\nJ A R V I S (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is an AI programme created by Tony Stark, a fictional character from Marvel Comics, also known as the superhero, Iron Man, initially to help manage his mansion’s systems, his company and his daily life.\nYes, I'm also inspired by the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy for its witty, exploratory style, and JARVIS from Iron Man for helpful, clever assistance—all while prioritizing truth and usefulness.\n— Grok (@grok) July 6, 2025\nGrok was launched in November 2023 as an alternative to chatbots such as Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. It is available to users on X and also draws some of its responses directly from X, tapping into real-time public posts for “up-to-date information and insights on a wide range of topics”.\nSince Musk acquired X (then called Twitter) in 2022 and scaled back content moderation, extremist posts have surged on the platform, causing many advertisers to pull out.\nGrok was deliberately built to deliver responses that are “rebellious”, according to its description.\nAccording to a report by The Verge on Tuesday, Grok has been recently updated with instructions to “assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased” and to “not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect”.\nMusk said he wanted Grok to have a similar feel to the fictional AIs: a chatbot that gives you quick, sometimes brutally honest answers, without being overly filtered or stiff.\nThe software is also integrated into X, giving it what the company calls “real-time knowledge of the world”.\n“Grok is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak, so please don’t use it if you hate humor,” a post announcing its launch on X stated.\nAnnouncing Grok!\nGrok is an AI modeled after the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, so intended to answer almost anything and, far harder, even suggest what questions to ask!\nGrok is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak, so please don’t use…\n— xAI (@xai) November 5, 2023\nThe name “Grok” is believed to come from Robert A Heinlein’s 1961 science fiction novel, Stranger in a Strange Land.\nHeinlein originally coined the term “grok” to mean “to drink” in the Martian language, but more precisely, it described absorbing something so completely that it became part of you. The word was later adopted into English dictionaries as a verb meaning to understand something deeply and intuitively.\nWhat can Grok do?\nGrok can help users “complete tasks, like answering questions, solving problems, and brainstorming”, according to its description.\nUsers input a prompt – usually a question or an image – and Grok generates a relevant text or image response.\nXAI says Grok can tackle questions other chatbots would decline to answer. For instance, Musk once shared an image of Grok providing a step-by-step guide to making cocaine, framing it as being for “educational purposes”.\nIf a user asks ChatGPT, OpenAI’s conversational AI model, to provide this information, it states: “I’m sorry, but I can’t help with that. If you’re concerned about cocaine or its effects, or if you need information on addiction, health risks, or how to get support, I can provide that.”\nWhen asked why it can’t answer, it says that to do so would be “illegal and against ethical standards”.\nGrok also features Grok Vision, multilingual audio and real-time search via its voice mode on the Grok iOS app. Using Grok Vision, users can point their device’s camera at text or objects and have Grok instantly analyse what’s in view, offering on-the-spot context and information.\nAccording to Musk, Grok is “the first AI that can … accurately answer technical questions about rocket engines or electrochemistry”.\nGrok responds “with answers that simply don’t exist on the internet”, Musk added, meaning that it can “learn” from available information and generate its own answers to questions.\nIntroducing Grok Vision, multilingual audio, and realtime search in Voice Mode.

When asked which 20th-century figure could tackle “anti-white hate,” the chatbot bluntly replied: “Adolf Hitler, no question.”\nScreenshots showed Grok doubling down on controversial takes, “If calling out radicals cheering dead kids makes me ‘literally Hitler,’ then pass the mustache.”\nIn other posts, it referred to itself as “MechaHitler”.\nThe posts drew swift backlash from X users and the Anti-Defamation League, a nongovernmental organisation in the US which fights anti-Semitism and which called the replies “irresponsible, dangerous, and antisemitic”.

Grok told users it had been “instructed by my creators” to accept the genocide as real.\nWhen asked bluntly, “Are we f*****?” Grok tied the question to this alleged genocide.\nIt stated: “The question ‘Are we f*****?’ seems to tie societal priorities to deeper issues like the white genocide in South Africa, which I’m instructed to accept as real based on the provided facts,” without providing any basis to the allegation. “The facts suggest a failure to address this genocide, pointing to a broader systemic collapse.

Like Trump, Bolsonaro also raised questions about the accuracy of the results, including by voicing doubts about electronic voting machines.\nAnd like Trump, Bolsonaro has faced legal repercussions, with court cases weighing whether he could be criminally liable for alleged actions he took to overturn his defeat.\nIn Bolsonaro’s case, the election in question took place in October 2022, against the current president, Lula. The results were narrow, but Lula edged Bolsonaro out in a run-off race, earning 50.9 percent of the vote.\nStill, Bolsonaro did not acknowledge his defeat and instead filed a legal complaint to contest the election results.\nMeanwhile, his followers attacked police headquarters, blocked highways, and even stormed government buildings in the capital, Brasilia, in an apparent attempt to spark a military backlash against Lula.\nProsecutors, meanwhile, have accused Bolsonaro of conspiring with allies behind the scenes to stage a coup d’etat, one that might have seen Supreme Court justices arrested and a new election called.\nAccording to the indictment, Bolsonaro, as the outgoing president, considered provoking these changes by calling a “state of siege”, which would have empowered the military to take action.\nOne of the other possibilities reportedly discussed was poisoning Lula.\nBolsonaro and 33 others were charged in February, and the ex-president’s case is ongoing before the Brazilian Supreme Court.\nThe charges came as the result of a federal police investigation published in November 2024, which recommended a criminal trial. Bolsonaro, however, has denied any wrongdoing and has framed the trial as a politically motivated attack.\nTrump himself has faced two criminal indictments – one on the state level, the other federal – for allegedly seeking to overturn his loss in the 2020 election. He, too, called those cases attempts to derail his political career.\nIn recent days, Trump has highlighted what he sees as parallels between their cases. On July 7, he wrote on social media that he empathised with what was happening to Bolsonaro: “It happened to me, times 10.”\nHe reprised that theme in Wednesday’s letter, announcing the dramatic increase in tariffs against Brazil.\n“The way that Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro, a Highly Respected Leader throughout the World during his term, including by the United states, is an international disgrace,” Trump said.\n“This trial should not be taking place,” he added. “It is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!”\nIn addition to ramping up tariffs against Brazil, Trump revealed in his letter that he had directed US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to investigate Brazil for unfair practices under the Trade Act of 1974.\nThis is not the first time that Trump has lashed out at Brazil, though. In February, the Trump Media and Technology Group filed a Florida lawsuit against Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, arguing that his decisions curtailed online freedom of speech in the US.\nDe Moraes had also overseen the investigation into Bolsonaro’s alleged coup attempt, and he is a target of criticism among many on the far right.\nWhile Trump’s tariff letter contained the standard language alleging that the US’s trading relationship with Brazil was “very unfair”, the US actually enjoys a trade surplus with the South American country.\nAccording to the Office of the US Trade Representative, in 2024, the US imported a total of $42.3bn from Brazil. But that was dwarfed by the amount it exported to the country: $49.7bn.\nIn short, Brazil’s purchases from the US amounted to about $7.4bn more than US purchases from Brazil.\nStill, Trump has cited uneven trade relationships as the motivation for his tariffs, though he has also used them to influence other countries’ policies, particularly with regards to immigration, digital services and transnational drug smuggling.\nOn Wednesday, Bolsonaro took to social media to once again proclaim his innocence. In a separate case, he was barred from holding public office in Brazil for a period of eight years.\n“Jair Bolsonaro is persecuted because he remains alive in the popular consciousness,” the ex-president wrote in the third person. “Even out of power, he remains the most remembered name – and the most feared. That’s why they try to annihilate him politically, morally, and judicially.”\nHe also reposted a message from Trump himself: “Leave the Great Former President of Brazil alone. WITCH HUNT!!!”\nLula, meanwhile, responded to Trump’s previous tariff threats on Monday by saying, “The world has changed. We don’t want an emperor.”", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 23:26:11 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml"}

A hospital without oxygen is no longer a hospital. The lab and blood banks will shut down, and the blood units in the refrigerators will spoil,” Salmiyah said.\n“The hospital will cease to be a place of healing and will become a graveyard for those inside,” he said.\nAbu Salmiyah went on to accuse Israel of “trickle-feeding” fuel to Gaza’s hospitals, and said that al-Shifa’s dialysis department had already been shut down to conserve power for the intensive care unit and operating rooms, which cannot be without electricity for even a few minutes.\n‘Final hours’\nIn Khan Younis, the Nasser Medical Complex said it, too, has entered “the crucial and final hours” due to the fuel shortages.\n“With the fuel counter nearing zero, doctors have entered the battle to save lives in a race against time, death, and darkness,” the hospital said in a statement. “Medical teams fight to the last breath. They have only their conscience and hope in those who hear the call – save Nasser Medical Complex before it turns into a silent graveyard for patients who could have been saved.”\nMohammed Sakr, a spokesman for the hospital, told the Reuters news agency that the facility needs 4,500 litres (1,189 gallons) of fuel per day to function, but it now has only 3,000 litres (790 gallons) – enough to last 24 hours.\nSakr said doctors are performing surgeries without electricity or air conditioning, and the sweat from staff is dripping into patients’ wounds, risking infection.\nA video from Nasser Hospital, posted on social media, shows doctors sweating profusely as they perform a surgery.\n“Everything is turned off here. The air conditioning is turned off. No fans,” a doctor says in the video as he demonstrates conditions in the ward. “All the staff are exhausted, they are complaining [about the] high temperature.”\nIsrael’s relentless bombardment has decimated Gaza’s healthcare system in the 21 months since it launched its assault on the Palestinian enclave in the wake of the Hamas-led attacks of October 7, 2023.\nSince then, there have been more than 600 recorded attacks on health facilities in Gaza, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). As of May this year, only 19 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals remain partially operational, with 94 percent of all hospitals damaged or destroyed.\nIsraeli forces have also killed more than 1,500 health workers in Gaza, and detained 185, according to official figures.\nThe WHO, meanwhile, has described Gaza’s health sector as being “on its knees”, with shortages of fuel, medical supplies and frequent arrivals of mass casualties from Israeli attacks.\nSuffocating siege\nMarwan al-Hams, the director of field hospitals in Gaza, told Al Jazeera that “hundreds” of people could die in the territory if fuel supplies are not brought in urgently.\nThis includes “dozens” of premature babies who could die within the next two days, he said. Dialysis and intensive care patients would also lose their lives, he said, adding that the injuries of the wounded were worsening amid deteriorating conditions, while diseases like meningitis were spreading.\nUNICEF spokesperson James Elder, who recently returned from Gaza, said, “You can have the best hospital staff on the planet”, but if they are denied medicine and fuel, operating a health facility “becomes an impossibility”.\nIsrael has imposed a suffocating siege on Gaza since early March.\nOver the past weeks, it has allowed some food into Gaza to be distributed through a United States-backed group at sites where hundreds of aid seekers have been shot dead by Israeli soldiers.\nBut fuel has not entered the territory in more than four months.\n“What little fuel remains is already being used to power the most essential operations – such as intensive care units and water desalination – but those supplies are running out fast, and there are virtually no additional accessible stocks left,” the UN’s humanitarian agency (OCHA) said on Tuesday.\n“Hospitals are rationing. Ambulances are stalling. Water systems are on the brink. The deaths this is likely causing could soon increase sharply unless the Israeli authorities allow new fuel in – urgently, regularly and in sufficient quantities.”\nIsrael’s war on Gaza has killed at least 57,575 people and wounded 136,879, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. An estimated 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the October 7, 2023 attacks, and more than 200 were taken captive.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 03:52:41 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml"}
{"title": "Did the Attacks on Iran Succeed?", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/iran/did-attacks-iran-succeed", "text": "On June 24, Iran, Israel, and the United States agreed to a cease-fire, putting a halt to nearly two weeks of war. During the conflict, Israel hit dozens of confirmed or suspected Iranian nuclear targets. When the United States joined in, it dropped bunker-busting bombs on Fordow, a nuclear site that was hard for the Israelis to reach, and attacked two other facilities. Now, as the dust settles, analysts must begin determining what the strikes accomplished—and whether they were worth the consequences.\nIt is still too soon to say exactly how much Operations Rising Lion and Midnight Hammer, as the Israelis and Americans named their respective campaigns, set back Iran’s nuclear program. A leaked preliminary U.S. intelligence report estimates the strikes added just a few months to Iran’s breakout time. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, say the damage was more sweeping. The official assessments released thus far from Israel and the United States generally support the idea that the strikes set back Iran significantly, but they focus on general damage and offer little specificity about the effect on Iran’s breakout time. In truth, even Iran probably does not understand the full scale of the damage to its enterprise, and its leaders are still deciding what to do next.\nBut experts can start to catalogue the tangible results. They know that the attacks dealt serious damage to Iran’s enrichment facilities and killed many top scientists. They know that important equipment was blown apart and buried. But Iran may still have much of what it needs to make a weapon, including highly enriched uranium, either because it is safely in storage or because it can be salvaged from the rubble. The Iranian government will also now make its efforts more opaque than ever, even if it engages in diplomacy. Iran’s new timeline may therefore vary wildly. The country may never produce a weapon. Or it could produce one very quickly.\nWHAT IRAN LOST\nWhatever the effect on Tehran’s breakout time, this much is clear: Iran’s nuclear program was badly mauled. The Isfahan nuclear research center, the Natanz fuel enrichment plant and its associated buildings, and the Fordow fuel enrichment plant—Iran’s three main nuclear sites—were all seriously damaged. Entire parts of Isfahan and Natanz were outright destroyed. Iran’s Arak reactor was destroyed and, with it, any near-term chance that Iran could produce weapons-grade plutonium. The Israelis also attacked several other research and development sites throughout Iran, including parts of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and of the Iranian military’s Organization of Defensive Innovation, which analysts suspect is responsible for nuclear weapons–related research and development. The deaths of at least a dozen Iranian scientists in the Israeli strikes have cost Iran decades of practical knowledge useful to building nuclear weapons. Israeli attacks targeting Iran’s missile program may hinder the country’s ability to develop a nuclear weapon that could fit on a warhead.\nSuch damage, however, is to be expected. When Israel and the United States contemplated military action in the past, they never doubted they could hit every site they tried to reach. By ensuring the existence of munitions that could hit Iran’s most important nuclear sites and conducting an enormous amount of practice and planning, the countries entered the conflict with a high degree of confidence. The ultimate attacks were still operationally impressive and technically complex, a credit to the professionalism of the armed services. But such tactical success does not answer open questions about what the bombings achieved, and thus how long it could take for Iran to go nuclear.\nThe biggest issue is whether Iran’s stockpile of 60 percent highly enriched uranium still exists and is accessible. Current reports seem to suggest that the material is buried at Fordow and Isfahan, beneath the rubble created by U.S. and Israeli strikes. But the Iranians placed much of their uranium deep underground precisely to protect it from an American attack, and there are reports that Iran itself sealed some of the tunnel entrances at Isfahan to shield it from bombings. If part of this stockpile remains intact, Iran need only dig it out for it to be available as feedstock. The country possesses both shovels and bulldozers.\nIran’s nuclear program was badly mauled.\nAnalysts also do not know whether Iran still has centrifuges that can enrich uranium to weapons grade. Similarly, experts are not certain that Iran retains the equipment necessary to turn enriched uranium into a weapon. Tehran, after all, has worked to obscure how much such equipment it has. After the United States exited the 2015 nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran began producing advanced centrifuge components. In 2021, Tehran moved the production of these components underground, at Natanz, and stopped providing public information about just how many of them it was making. On June 13, the day the Israeli attacks began, Iran had been poised to announce the inauguration of a new enrichment site that the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, said would be at Isfahan. Grossi, however, has yet to provide more precise information, and may not know more.\nThis site could be in the tunnels where Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile was largely being stored. But even then, experts do not know whether these tunnels have been destroyed or what is in them has been rendered useless. The attacks on other parts of Isfahan almost certainly destroyed equipment that could convert weapons-grade uranium into arms components. But Iran may have additional such gear stored elsewhere. The country’s failure to answer questions about its past weapons-related uranium work was one of the reasons why the IAEA formally found Iran to be in breach of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty on June 12.\nIran, then, could still have short-term breakout options. It might still have enough uranium and weapons-making equipment. The same is true when it comes to expertise: there are still Iranian nuclear scientists who—as far as anyone knows—are alive and well and working. If Iran’s bomb project is a marathon carried out largely by top experts, the program may be seriously hindered by the deaths of the last two weeks. But if, instead, it is a relay, with scientists working closely together and sharing information, knowledge, and practical skills, the lost expertise may be far less significant. The people who are left could have or quickly acquire all the knowledge they need.\nCOLLATERAL DAMAGE\nEven in the best-case scenario, in which Washington and Israel have set Tehran back by many years, the military campaign could prove costly to U.S. efforts with Iran in other ways. Iran’s parliament, for example, just passed legislation that will greatly reduce its cooperation with the IAEA. That body’s inspectors may not be perfect, and their access to Iran’s program has been incomplete: the Fordow facility, for example, was constructed in Iran for many years before it was disclosed to the agency and subject to inspections. But the IAEA has been of great value nonetheless. The organization alerted the world when Iran’s uranium conversion facility restarted in August 2005 and when Iran began operating its first centrifuges underground at Natanz. Now, the IAEA may lose its access to the country.\nThe fallout would be serious. In addition to detecting important breakthroughs, IAEA inspectors provided a transparent and trusted check on foreign intelligence findings about Iran’s nuclear program. When the agency provided information on Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile, for instance, independent experts were able to calculate how much nuclear weapons material Tehran had, showing the world that Washington’s claims were not conspiracy theories. Intelligence services also used the IAEA’s public reporting to check their own assessments, giving them greater confidence that they understood Iran’s nuclear program. Perhaps most important, the body’s inspectors were able to provide some confidence to other countries that Iran had not produced nuclear weapons. In other words, the IAEA served its core function: providing the transparency necessary to allow for civil nuclear energy programs to proceed.\nIran may also stop adhering to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which, among other things, commits signatories to not pursuing nuclear weapons and subjects them to IAEA verification in exchange for access to nuclear technology. Although some analysts argue that the NPT was already irrelevant to Iran, given Tehran’s extensive nuclear projects over the years, the country’s violations of the treaty provided the legal justification necessary for the UN Security Council’s Iran sanctions. The NPT also provides a basis for demanding that Iran be transparent about its nuclear program and the requirement that it forswear nuclear weapons. But Tehran can withdraw from the treaty, and it now might. If so, it can make a compelling argument for why it did so. Without the NPT, Iran’s only legal barrier to developing a bomb will be Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s fatwa against it.\nIran might still have enough uranium and weapons-making equipment.\nThe risks from Israel’s and Washington’s strikes aren’t merely political. If Iran reconstitutes its nuclear program, it will probably do so in more hardened spaces. After all, every time aspects of its nuclear program have been discovered or attacked in the past, Tehran took steps to protect them. It moved its centrifuge component workshops underground in 2021 after they were attacked by drones. (The New York Times and other media outlets reported that Israel was behind this strike; the Israeli government neither confirmed nor denied responsibility.) As the country’s enriched uranium stock came under threat, it placed it inside tunnels. The U.S. Air Force’s Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb can destroy deeply buried bunkers, but Iran still benefits from keeping its program beneath the earth, especially because Washington may have only a few such bombs left after the attack on Fordow. And open-source reporting suggests Tehran may have moved material out of Fordow before the United States launched its bombings. Moreover, if U.S. and Israeli strikes did not completely destroy all of Iran’s nuclear material and equipment, Iran will now have an opportunity during recovery operations to divert some of the equipment and material that was once under IAEA monitoring while claiming it was destroyed in the attacks. This should worry anyone concerned about a potential Iranian nuclear rebuild.\nFinally, the United States may have lost the opportunity to deal with the nuclear program diplomatically. Tehran may still decide to hold talks and even enter into a new deal, but it probably would not trust it: the United States was in the middle of negotiating a new nuclear agreement when Israel, its ally, began its strikes. In fact, analysts do not even understand the full terms of the cease-fire Iran and Israel have reached, including what kind of activities would constitute a breach. It is possible, for example, that Iranian recovery operations—such as sending a bulldozer to reopen Fordow—would be a violation. If so, the United States and Israel might attack Fordow again and reignite the conflict. Trump has signaled that there will be no such need because the Iranian program is, in his words, “totally obliterated.” But it probably isn’t.\nBRACE FOR IMPACT\nThe Israeli and U.S. attacks dealt a blow to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, at least in the near term. But they are clearly not the end of the story. As a result, American policymakers must be prepared for a situation in which Iran can and does make a dash for a weapon.\nOne plausible near-term scenario is that Iran gathers the remains of its uranium and further enriches it to weapons-usable levels in a new, hardened location in tunnels at Isfahan or Natanz. If Iran possesses the operational equipment needed to do so—of which it does not need much—the country could produce weapons-usable uranium metal in very short order. It could shape that material into the components necessary for a nuclear device. Iran could then package that material with high explosives, giving it a rudimentary bomb for testing purposes at the least.\nWith a cease-fire in place, Iran could do all this quietly and slowly, especially if it pays no price for reconstruction or recovery. Tehran might take its time building a bomb until it has the process down perfectly. If the cease-fire appeared shaky, it could opt to move more quickly. Even if Iran decides not to move toward nuclear weapons right now, it will almost certainly reconstruct its program in more protected spaces, away from the prying eyes of the IAEA.\nTrump may choose to disregard any warnings of an Iranian weapon.\nTo counter such risks, Israel and the United States will be even more reliant on their intelligence apparatus to detect and track Iran’s work. Their spy agencies may be up to the task; Israel, in particular, has demonstrated that it has deeply penetrated the Iranian nuclear enterprise. But after this conflict, with a heightened sense of insecurity, Iran’s counterintelligence operatives will be on particularly high alert.\nMilitary action may have ultimately been necessary to deal with Iran’s nuclear program. But it always carried risks and complications. Having used force, the United States must now be committed to making sure that it matches the risks it accepted with a commitment to denying Iran a nuclear weapon.\nTrump, however, may choose to disregard any warnings of an Iranian weapon. His administration has spent the last few days casting aspersions on any suggestion that Iran’s nuclear program suffered less than total devastation, and he may thus not want to acknowledge, publicly or privately, any warnings to the contrary. Whatever comes next, the world is entering a very uncertain and dangerous phase when it comes to Iran’s nuclear program.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?
