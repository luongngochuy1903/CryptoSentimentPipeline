Nearly half (45%) of those polled planned to use credit cards to pay for their children’s school uniform and a third (34%) said they would rely on Klarna-style delayed payment services.\nThe education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, urged schools to help struggling parents by reducing the number of branded items of uniform that pupils are required to wear as a matter of urgency, before a forthcoming change in the law.\nA limit of three branded items, plus a branded tie for secondary and middle schools, will be enforced from September 2026 after the government’s children’s wellbeing and schools bill becomes law, but Phillipson wants schools to act sooner on a voluntary basis.\n“School uniform matters but it shouldn’t break the bank. No family should have to choose between putting food on the table and buying a new blazer,” she said. “Parents have told us they want fewer costly branded items – and that’s exactly what we’re delivering. Schools can help ease the pressure on families right now by reducing the number of branded items they require.”\nCurrently, schools can require parents to buy multiple items branded with a school logo, often from specialist suppliers, with many asking for more than five and in some cases 10 items, pushing total uniform costs up to £400 including PE kit.\nUnder the new legislation, parents will be able to buy cheaper uniform staples such as shirts or trousers from general retailers including Aldi and Marks & Spencer.\nNearly nine out of 10 parents (86%) who took part in the poll – which involved parents of children aged four to 15 attending state schools in England – felt that wearing branded uniforms made no difference to behaviour.\nParentkind’s chief executive, Jason Elsom, said: “Parents have faced the crushing cost of sending their children to school for far too long. For many families the bills soar into the thousands every year, covering uniforms, books, stationery, trips, laptops and travel. These reforms are the first real step towards ending that injustice.\n“Limiting branded school uniform items will make a difference straight away. Our research shows 85% of parents believe this will cut costs, 71% prefer to buy plain items and add the logo later, and 83% say unbranded uniform is just as good quality. This is about keeping money in parents’ pockets without sacrificing school pride.”\nPepe Di’Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Many families face wider financial pressures and cannot afford basic amenities. The rate of child poverty in the UK is simply appalling. We hope to see the government publish a meaningful strategy to tackle this issue in the near future.”\nThe government has announced that millions of families will receive their benefit payments before the August bank holiday this year, with payments originally due on Saturday 23, Sunday 24 and Monday 25 August paid early on Friday 22 August.\nThe minister for social security and disability, Stephen Timms, said: “This is especially important ahead of the new school year – no family should have to choose between buying school supplies and putting food on the table.”", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 23:01:02 GMT", "author": "Sally Weale Education correspondent", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}

Across Europe and the Middle East, record-breaking temperatures are threatening lives as well as livelihoods. France has experienced its largest wildfire since 1949, while across Europe an estimated 500,000 hectares of land have burned.\nBut farmers are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather, which has a direct impact on crop yields. So reports of a second consecutive year in which food growers in parts of the UK are seeing dramatic falls in production should concern the British public. Access to food is frequently taken for granted in the world’s wealthiest nations. But increased food insecurity is among the dangerous effects of the climate crisis, as well as being worsened by Trump’s tariffs, and geopolitical instability including the war in Ukraine.\nLast year the problem for British farmers was too much summer rain, leading to waterlogged fields and lost crops. This year the challenge has been the reverse: prolonged, intense hot weather, leading to large parts of England being declared officially in drought. Dramatic local and regional variations complicate the picture. While some farmers are warning of smaller vegetables in supermarkets following disappointing early harvests, others have fared quite well. It is too soon to draw firm conclusions or make decisive comparisons with previous years. What is already beyond doubt, however, is the immense challenge of adapting to an altered reality.\nAt a recent water summit hosted by the National Farmers’ Union, Steve Reed, the environment secretary, suggested that the government might support a change to planning rules, making it easier for farmers to build reservoirs on their land. Ministers should work with nature experts as well as farmers to develop this, and other proposals to boost resilience, in an environmentally responsible way. While tensions between the priorities of conservationists and farmers have not gone away, there is also common ground, for example around the need for stronger, long-term water infrastructure and flood risk planning. Last month a survey by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit found that more than 80% of UK farmers are worried about the climate crisis.\nSuch fears, along with falls in crop yields and incomes, also help explain the furious reaction to inheritance tax changes introduced last year by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, restricting an exemption for agricultural land. Last week the independent Centre for the Analysis of Taxation proposed amendments to the new rules that the Treasury should consider carefully. The chancellor is right to target wealthy, tax-avoiding landowners. But ministerial antagonism toward rural communities serves no purpose and only plays into the populist right’s hands.\nWhile farmers are the first to register falling yields, and smaller heads of broccoli, the productivity and resilience of agricultural land affects everyone who is not insulated by wealth from higher food prices. Last month a thinktank, the Autonomy Institute, argued that the UK is particularly exposed to “climateflation” due to its heavy reliance on food imports. Extreme weather could drive up food prices by more than a third by 2050. With this in mind, the government should seek constructive engagement with farmers, while promoting healthy food policies.\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

These days, it seems content to be a willing supplicant – handing over its data, infrastructure and public services to US tech giants in exchange for the promise of a few percentage points of efficiency gains. Worryingly, the artificial intelligence strategy of Sir Keir Starmer’s government appears long on rhetoric, short on sovereignty and built on techno-utopian assumptions. Last week Peter Kyle, the technology secretary, was promoting the use of AI-generated discharge letters in the NHS. The tech, he said, will process complex conversations between doctors and patients, slashing paperwork and streamlining services. Ministers say that by applying AI across the public sector, the government can save £45bn.\nBut step back and a more familiar pattern emerges. As Cecilia Rikap, a researcher at University College London, told the Politics Theory Other podcast, Britain risks becoming a satellite of the US tech industry – a nation whose public infrastructure serves primarily as a testing ground and data source for American AI models hosted on US-owned cloud computing networks. She warned that the UK should not become a site of “extractivism”, in which value – whether in the form of knowledge, labour or electricity – is supplied by Britain but monetised in the US.\nIt’s not just that the UK lacks a domestic cloud ecosystem. It’s that the government’s strategy does nothing to build one. The concern is that public data, much of it drawn from the NHS and local authorities, will be shovelled into models built and trained abroad. The value captured from that data – whether in the form of model refinement or product development – will accrue not to the British public, but to US shareholders. Even the promise of job creation appears shaky. Datacentres, the physical backbone of AI, are capital-intensive, energy-hungry, and each one employs only about 50 people.\nMeanwhile, Daron Acemoglu, the MIT economist and Nobel laureate, offers a still more sobering view: far from ushering in a golden age of labour augmentation, today’s AI rollout is geared almost entirely toward labour displacement. Prof Acemoglu sees a fork: AI can empower workers – or replace them. Right now, it is doing the latter. Ministerial pledges of productivity gains may just mean fewer jobs – not better services.\nThe deeper problem is one of imagination. A government serious about digital sovereignty might build a public cloud, fund open-source AI models and create institutions capable of steering technological development toward social ends. Instead, we are offered efficiency-by-outsourcing – an AI strategy where Britain provides the inputs and America reaps the returns. In a 2024 paper, Prof Acemoglu challenged Goldman Sachs’ 10-year forecast that AI would lead to global growth of 7% – about $7tn – and estimated instead under $1tn in gains. Much of this would be captured by US big tech.\nThere’s nothing wrong with harnessing new technologies. But their deployment must not be structured in a way that entrenches dependency and hollows out public capacity. The Online Safety Act shows digital sovereignty can enforce national rules on global platforms, notably on porn sites. But current turmoil at the Alan Turing Institute suggests a deeper truth: the UK government is dazzled by American AI and has no clear plan of its own. Britain risks becoming not a tech pioneer, but a well-governed client state in someone else’s digital empire.\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"title": "Reeves considers replacing stamp duty with new property tax", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/aug/18/rachel-reeves-stamp-duty-property-tax-council-tax", "text": "The Treasury is considering a new tax on the sale of homes worth more than £500,000 as a step towards a radical overhaul of stamp duty and council tax, the Guardian has been told.\nAs the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, prepares the ground for tax rises in this autumn’s budget, senior ministers have tasked officials to study how a new “proportional” property tax could be implemented and model its impact before reporting back to ministers, who have been briefed on the proposals.\nOfficials are initially examining a potential national property tax, which would replace stamp duty on owner-occupied homes, sources said. They are also studying whether, after the national tax, a local property tax could then replace council tax in the medium term in an effort to repair battered local authority finances.\nNo final decisions have been made. A national tax could be implemented during this parliament, while it is understood an overhaul of council tax would take longer, at least requiring Labour to win a second term in office.\nThe policy options are being considered as part of a large tranche of work within the Treasury aimed at tapping into the vast cumulative rise in house prices in recent years that risks entrenching inequalities and making council tax – which is based on early 1990s property values – more unfair.\nIf the plans came to fruition, they could provide valuable political cover for Reeves, both in terms of raising extra revenue without breaking Labour’s pledge to not raise levies on working people and as policies that would be likely to appeal to many of the party’s MPs and members.\nThere has been increasing pressure on the chancellor to consider more wealth-based taxes, notably from the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, and the additional tax on more expensive homes could be presented in this light.\nThe national tax would be paid by owner-occupiers on houses worth more than £500,000 when they sell their home. The amount paid would be determined by the value of the property, with the rate set by central government, which would directly collect the proceeds via HM Revenue and Customs. It would not replace stamp duty on second homes.\nCurrent rates of stamp duty vary depending on whether someone is a first-time buyer and are banded in steps upward depending on the value of the property being bought and sold.\nIt would take time to phase in a replacement to stamp duty, and a range of options are being considered for phasing in changes. The revenue raised by stamp duty on primary residences varies considerably from year to year, depending on housing market conditions. In the last financial year, it raised £11.6bn, according to government figures. Over time, it is believed the new national property tax would be a more reliable, consistent source of revenue and ultimately raise the same amount as stamp duty.\nThe levy would only affect about a fifth of property sales, compared with about 60% with current levels of stamp duty, which is paid by the buyer of a home. The average price of a home in the UK was £272,664 in July, according to Nationwide.\nSources said Treasury officials were, in part, drawing on the findings of a 48-page report from the centre-right thinktank Onward, which was published in August last year.\nOnward’s report proposes a dual approach of a national and local “proportional property tax” on property, based on its value. It is written by Dr Tim Leunig, who worked as a government adviser for more than a decade and was closely involved with devising the furlough scheme during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nLeunig wrote: “These proposals would make it easier and cheaper to move house, for a better job, or to be near family, as well as being fairer. It should not be the case that a terrace house in Burnley pays more than a mansion in Kensington – and it wouldn’t be under these proposals.”\nThe government has already showed signals of adopting some of the steps towards council tax Leunig laid out in his report: “The first step would be to end the overfunding of various councils in affluent areas of inner London, particularly Westminster, Wandsworth and Kensington and Chelsea councils.” This is similar to the approach laid out this summer in a consultation on how to redistribute from richer to poorer councils.\nThe idea of a new local annual property levy to replace council tax was also proposed by Onward. That plan would result in owners, rather than the residents, of a property worth up to £500,000 paying varying rates of tax dependent on the value of their home. They would pay a minimum of £800 a year and the funds this generates would go directly to local councils, whose finances have been severely stretched in recent years.\nRayner has already raised the prospect of ramping up redistributions of funds to address regional inequalities, which she has argued are exacerbated by the existing council tax system, which replaced the poll tax in 1993.\nA spokesperson for the Treasury said: “As set out in the plan for change, the best way to strengthen public finances is by growing the economy – which is our focus. Changes to tax and spend policy are not the only ways of doing this, as seen with our planning reforms, which are expected to grow the economy by £6.8bn and cut borrowing by £3.4bn.\n“We are committed to keeping taxes for working people as low as possible, which is why at last autumn’s budget, we protected working people’s payslips and kept our promise not to raise the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, employee national insurance or VAT.”\nEconomists from the right and left of the political spectrum have heavily criticised stamp duty and council tax. Stamp duty applies in England and Northern Ireland. There are different approaches to some land taxes in Wales and Scotland. Council tax banding based on older property values is considered flawed and out of date by economists in all parts of the UK and is believed to be ripe for reform.\nIn June, the government launched a consultation on how to reform the allocation of funds raised by council tax. Labour said the “fair funding review” aims to fix the “broken funding system we inherited” which has “left local authorities across the country in crisis”.\nThe strategy has already met a backlash after it emerged deprived inner-city London councils stand to lose millions of pounds.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies, an economic thinktank, has said that while reform was very much needed, the proposed changes in the government’s funding review appeared to run counter to an “expectation that deprived and urban areas would win at the expense of more affluent and rural areas, the government’s baseline funding reform proposals are not particularly redistributive to poor, urban areas of England”.\nWhile any wealth-related tax could provoke strong criticism from rightwing opponents, ministers have shown willingness to ignore such criticism for policies that generally affect wealthier people, such as adding VAT on private school fees and changes to inheritance tax for some farms.\nIf billed as a part of a longer-term replacement of stamp duty, this could also be helpful given the existing levy is unpopular and widely seen as a blunt tool and a block on the property market.\nUsing property taxes as a replacement for council tax would be complex to implement and almost inevitably require a second term in office, but there is an increasing acceptance among all the main parties that the current system for local government funding is obsolete and unviable.\nLabour has already committed to the biggest shake-up of council structures in England for decades but does not want to oversee the predicted series of local authorities declaring effective bankruptcy, especially as many will be run by the party.\nLast week, the Guardian revealed that the Treasury was also looking at ways to raise more money from inheritance tax in an attempt to ease pressure on the country’s finances, in the run-up to Reeves’s autumn budget.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:04:42 GMT", "author": "Anna Isaac and Peter Walker", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}

What does he really stand for? | Oliver Eagleton", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/19/labour-right-wes-streeting-downing-street-health-secretary-nhs", "text": "Just over a year after Keir Starmer entered Downing Street, his political survival already looks uncertain. Perennially indecisive, unpopular with the public and unable to pass major legislation without rebellions, the prime minister has reportedly been put “on notice” by senior figures within his party. Speculation about a potential successor is mounting.\nWhat would Labour’s dominant faction – the neo-Blairite right – look for in a candidate? Their best bet would be an effective operator who doesn’t carry too much political baggage, a decent communicator, free of Starmer’s stumbling reticence, and a committed partisan of their cause: namely the free market and a strong state. They need someone who will go on the offensive for these values, rather than offering the bland apologetics that we have seen from the incumbent.\nFew fit the bill better than the health secretary, Wes Streeting, who has made no secret of his ambition to lead the country and appears to have spent years laying the groundwork with media rounds, donor events and backroom conversations. When Starmer’s leadership of the Labour party was on the brink during the Beergate scandal, Peter Mandelson is said to have canvassed the Labour frontbench to anoint Streeting. “In the longer term,” briefed one party source, “Wes is their guy, not Keir.”\nBorn into a working-class east London family in 1983, Streeting has been fairly consistent in both his political style and outlook since he was in his early 20s. A pugnacious advocate of private enterprise, and an effective behind-the-scenes operator, his deft handling of the press allows him to stride into the limelight at crucial moments, with memorable one-liners that seem crafted to enrage his opponents. As president of the National Union of Students (NUS) in the twilight of the New Labour era, he inveighed against lecturers’ strikes, remarking that “students need industrial action by university staff like a hole in the head”. He also broke with dominant student opinion by supporting tuition fees and criticising Palestine solidarity protests.\nFrom the NUS it was only a small step to parliament, where Streeting landed in 2015. The words “future leader” were immediately “appended to his name like a Homeric epithet”, according to one insider account. He vigorously opposed the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, repeatedly excoriating him in parliamentary meetings and working with the People’s Vote campaign to chip away at his resistance to a second Brexit referendum. This earned him a place in Starmer’s shadow cabinet once the right had regained control five years later. There, he made no bones about accepting hundreds of thousands of pounds from donors linked to the private healthcare industry. He insisted that the party needed to get tough on “law and order” along with “defence and national security”; and he signalled a clear shift from the foreign policy of the Corbyn era by visiting Israel and meeting with ministers in its government.\nNow that Streeting is at the helm of the NHS, we are beginning to see how his hypothetical prime ministership might play out. Shortly after the last general election, he sketched out his vision for the health service in the pages of the Sun, writing that “major surgery” was needed to make it “fit for the future”: moving treatment out of hospitals, so as to focus on local care and prevention. This could not be achieved through public spending, Streeting warned, because “the money isn’t there”. It could only be done through hard-knuckled “reform”.\nTrue to his word, Streeting has helped to normalise the state of perma-austerity at the health department, which will receive only an extra 2.8% annually in real terms over the coming years: less than the long-term historical norm of 3.7%, and far below the average increase of 6.8% under New Labour. This is nowhere near enough to solve the perpetual crisis in the sector, let alone make any real improvements in the quality of care.\nWithout meaningful investment, the levers that Streeting can pull to realise his goals are limited. There is reorganisation through measures such as the summary abolition of NHS England and mass job cuts. There is techno-optimism, allowing AI companies such as Palantir to run parts of the ailing service. And, most importantly, there is privatisation.\nStreeting has been working hard to ensure that “more treatments can be delivered through the independent sector”, as an official briefing put it. Under his watch, an even greater portion of the NHS – including, potentially, sensitive patient data – is being handed over to profit-making companies. His plan to set up 300 “neighbourhood health hubs” is powered by corporate finance, in what is shaping up to be a frame-by-frame replay of the disastrous PFI initiatives of the 2000s. Research shows that the effect of these policies is to worsen health inequality. But this does not seem to concern the minister.\nBullish as ever, Streeting has said he is “up for the fight” that his plan will provoke. And that is what he now has. In recent weeks, resident doctors rejected his notion that “reform” alone will magically resolve the service’s deep-rooted problems of under-resourcing and understaffing. They refused to accept a pay deal that would amount to a 21% reduction in their salaries since 2008, and instead made a principled case for wage restoration. Streeting was intransigent. During the resulting five-day strike he launched a series of broadsides against the workers, insisting that they must feel the “pain” of the walkouts and vowing that they would “lose a war with this government”. Much like his “bullet in the head” rhetoric, the remarks showed that Streeting’s main interest is in positioning himself as a crusader on behalf of the establishment rather than fixing the service he oversees. He is also keenly aware of the populist appeal of his rhetoric at a time when support for the doctors’ struggle is in decline.\nThe other front on which Streeting has been fighting is the culture war. He has imposed a permanent ban on puberty blockers for trans children – despite a wealth of dissenting expert opinion including that of the British Medical Association, which disputes the scientific basis of the prohibition – and he has also barred those under 18 from changing gender markers on their NHS records, potentially making it more difficult for them to access vital services.\nThe irony, of course, is that while Streeting styles himself as the man to beat Nigel Farage, his politics is one of deference to big business, clampdowns on trans rights and incendiary rhetoric to provoke the left. These features are more typically associated with reactionary populism than with social democracy. Streeting’s ascent reflects the fact that, in today’s Labour party, the former is cannibalising the latter.\n-\nOliver Eagleton is an associate editor at the New Left Review and author of The Starmer Project: A Journey to the Right", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 05:00:09 GMT", "author": "Oliver Eagleton", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}

{"title": "We voted for and against the ban on Palestine Action. Now we have a plan to end this mess | Stella Creasy and Peter Hain", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/18/proscribing-palestine-action-government-protest", "text": "Is terrorism really a vicar with a peaceful placard?\nAs parliamentarians who are passionate about democracy and civil liberties, we know that both are under threat. A growing number of organisations encourage violence and intimidation in pursuit of political aims. MPs are besieged with threats, advised not to hold in-person surgeries and are grieving still for two colleagues killed in the past 10 years. Anti-migrant protests and threats are encouraged by the far right to take place across the country. Yet attempts to address all this are increasingly destabilising public confidence in politics, emboldening those who fan the flames of hatred by claiming a “two-tier” response. Without change, the danger that someone will get hurt – or killed again – will only grow.\nDriven by both homegrown and overseas extremism, and social media algorithms, there is a growing trend for direct action to end in physical harm or destruction in order to get noticed. Proscription is the primary tool open to governments to put a hard stop to this, but with nearly 100 organisations and hundreds more Britons now labelled “terrorists” in recent weeks, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain parity between the organisations proscribed within the public mind. For any law to be effective, it has to be workable and legitimate. For it to defend democracy, it must also not be designed – or be seen to be designed – to spare ministers the difficulties of dealing with dissent. Proscription puts the person peacefully expressing opposition into the same category as the person planting a bomb or shooting a bullet.\nWe came down on different sides in last month’s vote on whether to proscribe Palestine Action, and neither of us have ever supported the group. But we both agree what is happening now neither protects protest nor makes protest policeable.\nWe have three shared convictions. First, no one – including elected politicians and the police – should face violent threats or intimidation for doing the job that we ask of them, even if we disagree with how they do it. Second, everyone should be able to protest and engage in non-violent disruption without being lumped in with Islamic State, al-Qaida or the IRA. Third, legislation to uphold our civil rights and to stop intimidation should be cause-blind: protecting those whom we wish to beat at the ballot box by enabling all citizens to be heard and parliamentarians to do our jobs.\nHow, then, should the government respond? First and foremost with common sense. Urgent police guidance should be issued to head off the car crash that proscription enforcement is rapidly becoming, by setting out a test of proportionality for any interventions. Proscribing the original Palestine Action group was said to be about stopping those inciting direct harm and violence. Going after people with a poster testing the boundaries of liberty – some who may or may not even support Palestine Action but feel strongly about Palestinian rights – confuses rather than clarifies the government’s intention. People must be able to protest about the horror in Gaza, and the focus should be on what is happening in Palestine, not in Parliament Square.\nThe government should be much more transparent about how it is upholding our constitutional rights. There is no free speech if one half of a political debate lives in fear of being targeted for disagreeing. We need mechanisms to stop those who use violence, threaten migrants or hound women instead of raising their voices to achieve their goals. Lord David Anderson, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, argued that proscription should always be a time-limited process – and we agree. It should also be targeted at real terrorists whose explicit intention is to kill innocent civilians.\nNo democratic state should make arbitrary decisions and must actively seek the consent of citizens. As it stands, how proscription is achieved – short parliamentary debates in both houses and, in the case of Palestine Action, bracketing the organisation along with two far-right groups in a single vote – fails this test. To have the ability to proscribe a group as “terrorists”, ministers and government must do much more to show the public how and why that is the case.\nWe must also address the glaring inconsistencies and real gaps in law these cases reveal. Legislation on public order focuses on specific practices; proscription orders target specific terrorist groups. Nothing sits between this to recognise when organisations themselves encourage members repeatedly and deliberately to escalate intimidation in pursuit of their aim. Extreme groups create a climate of violence, leaving refugees waiting to be firebombed, Jewish citizens attacked, black and Muslim citizens living in fear, and women increasingly vilified.\nGetting the balance right means abolishing offences such as “recklessly encouraging support” of a proscribed group and focusing instead on those who organise this criminality. Setting out how and when behaviour threatens our democracy – as distinct from criticising state policies – would also better maintain the integrity of the seriousness of terrorism charges. Stopping organisations that are not simply accidentally violent, but intentionally so, means a new offence is needed, distinct from the battery of existing criminal ones. This would recognise how groups that encourage violence and intimidation go beyond existing public order offences, disentangling non-violent direct action from violence or attacks on property and terrorism.\nThe alternative – accepting that harm to individuals is an inevitable risk of protest because people feel strongly about something – is not tenable. Terrorism is different from terrifying opponents, but both are or should be criminal offences. The failure to make that distinction is both increasingly infecting the policing of protest and undermining the legitimate right to protest.\nAnyone who thinks this situation is simple – either an egregiously authoritarian power-grab from the government or a sincere intention to block violent thuggery – isn’t paying attention. The status quo has come to mean equating peaceful witness with terrorism, and isn’t sustainable. But neither is pretending there isn’t a problem that threatens our ability to debate, disagree and ultimately decide in our democracy. Without action, it will be those with the loudest voices and the most lethal actors who win.\n-\nStella Creasy is the Labour and Cooperative MP for Walthamstow.

A senior officer asked the arresting officer if he could arrest Pickering under section 12, which could have brought a more serious charge of supporting a proscribed group.\n“[The arresting officer] said: ‘No, I can’t.’ And they said: ‘Why not?’ He said: ‘Because he hasn’t got Palestine Action written on him. He’s got Plasticine Action written on him.’”\nAbout five minutes later, the arresting officer approached him again. “He said: ‘I’ve got good news and I’ve got bad news.’ I said: ‘What’s the good news?’ He said: ‘I’m de-arresting you.’\n“And I said: ‘What’s the bad news?’ He said: ‘It’s going to be really embarrassing for me.’ And then I walked free, while all the real heroes are the people that are actually getting arrested.”\nPickering has made copies of the T-shirt, which he is selling through his own website to raise money for the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians. It has sold in 28 countries already.\n“So there’s people getting on this one, because it kind of works, doesn’t it?” he said. “It’s like we are just going to mock you for your ridiculous decision to proscribe a protest group. It’s just so important that our rights to protest do not get diminished.”\nHe said he expected there to be a number of people wearing the shirts on 6 September at the next organised protest against the ban on Palestine Action, and that he had been advised by the police that it could still be an arrestable offence.\n“How ridiculous is this?” he said, adding: “But if 1,000 people wander around the Palestinian march wearing a T-shirt that says Plasticine Action with a picture of Morph, what are they going to do?”\nFootage has also emerged of a man wearing the same T-shirt being arrested in Scotland during a demonstration on Saturday. In June, a Leeds man was arrested for holding up a printed out version of a joke from Private Eye, an incident that the satirical magazine’s editor, Ian Hislop, called “mind-boggling”.\nPickering said that although he did care about AI ruining the animation industry, he was passionate about protesting for Gaza, and had seen support for the cause swell.\nHe said he felt the tide of public opinion was turning, with more national news organisations showing images and video of the famine Israel was inflicting on the people of Gaza. “There’s no justification for it, and we all know it. I do think we’re winning. We’re going to win this battle, and Palestine will ultimately – as we’ve been shouting at people for so long – be free.”", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:46:46 GMT", "author": "Robyn Vinter and Ben Quinn", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}

Whatever the reason, when it comes to Ukraine, the UK prime minister is once again hoping to exploit this somewhat curious relationship.\nAs soon as it was announced that a string of European leaders planned to join Volodymyr Zelenskyy to back the Ukrainian president in crucial talks with Trump at the White House on Monday, it was obvious Starmer would be joining them.\nThe idea of Britain being some sort of bridge between US and European interests is something of a longstanding UK diplomatic cliche, and not one that always necessarily carries much meaning.\nBut in the case of Ukraine, Starmer has very deliberately sought to position himself as a leader who can get along with Trump while consistently stressing to him Europe’s red lines over any peace plan, and trying to sweet-talk the president into offering US security guarantees.\nRecent months have presented several opportunities for Starmer to make this case in person, including February’s Oval Office meeting between the pair, a bilateral at the G7 in Canada and talks during Trump’s ostensibly non-work visit to Scotland last month.\nStarmer has shown his willingness to throw the diplomatic kitchen sink at efforts to keep Trump on side, including in February handing the president a written invitation from the king for an unusual second state visit.\nSimilarly, the No 10 statement announcing Starmer would join the Zelenskyy meeting had more praise for Trump’s “efforts to end Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine”, even if many UK diplomats would most likely privately view Trump’s summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska as at best inconclusive, at worst a Russian trap.\nSuch efforts have yielded results, with Trump repeatedly saying how much he likes Starmer, despite their very obvious political differences.\nAs with anything Trump-related, even the best-worked plans can be upended by events, most spectacularly the way that Starmer’s ultra-careful Oval Office appearance was followed a day later by Zelenskyy being humiliated by Trump and JD Vance.\nMore recently, Starmer’s delicate handling of Trump at the G7 – which in its most visible form saw the PM bend down to collect papers spilled by the president – did not prevent Trump leaving the summit early and then reneging on a plan to call for restraint in tensions between Israel and Iran.\nMonday’s White House event could go south at similar speed, especially given reports that Trump seems minded to take up Putin’s suggestion on Ukrainian territorial concessions in exchange for peace, something Zelenskyy and other European leaders have consistently ruled out.\nThere is an extent to which this does not matter. Any sort of Trump diplomacy is always in part an exercise in luck. And as Starmer knows, when dealing with Ukraine, even if it does not work, it has to be attempted.\nSupport for Kyiv is one of the few remaining cross-party, even national, political consensuses, as shown by Starmer and Zelenskyy’s hug outside Downing Street on Thursday, ahead of the Alaska summit.\nWhile Trump is publicly fussed over by No 10, Zelenskyy seems genuinely cherished, as shown by diplomatic symbols such as the Ukrainian leader’s post-White House debacle meeting with King Charles at the much more intimate surrounding of the royals’ Sandringham estate in Norfolk, while Trump will be hosted in September in the formality of Windsor Castle.\nStarmer’s disinclination to publicly criticise Trump, a leader disliked by many British voters, can seem anomalous, even jarring. But No 10 can point to results, notably the UK’s relatively light treatment under the new regime of US tariffs.\nPulling Trump out of Putin’s orbit when it comes to peace in Ukraine could be a bigger ask. But yet again, Starmer will try.", "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 13:46:26 GMT", "author": "Peter Walker Senior political correspondent", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}

They include Birmingham, Nottingham and Woking.\nThe Audit Reform Lab at Sheffield said the average cost of external auditors checking a local authority’s finances was now at least £50,000 higher in cash terms than when the Audit Commission was disbanded in 2015.\nPrivate-sector accountancy firms took over the job of auditing local government accounts in England after the agency was abolished, in an austerity-driven push by Tory and Lib Dem ministers to find savings and efficiencies.\n“Ten years on, however, it now seems clear that these reform ambitions have failed,” the authors of the report wrote.\n“Only 1% of audits were delivered on time in 2022-23, with many audits delayed by several years. Audit costs have risen dramatically in response. An unwieldy, but ultimately operational centralised bureaucracy was replaced by market chaos. The £100m per annum savings heralded by the UK government in 2014 are now a distant memory.”\nThe report found that average audit costs in England had more than tripled – an average increase of 238% – in the year to 2023-24. It blamed most of this increase on private-sector auditors hiking their rates.\nIt compared the large rise in audit costs in England to much smaller increases in Scotland and Wales, where it said there was a much stronger level of central oversight of private-sector auditing.\nSome of the biggest increases were at financially stricken councils, including a 620% rise in audit fees at Woking, as well as leaps of 470% at Runnymede and 450% at Spelthorne.\nIn total 13 councils had fee scale increases of 300% or more in 2022-23. Birmingham city council paid an audit fee above the £1m mark, representing a 314% increase. The councils were approached for comment.\nThree auditors dominate the local audit market: EY, Grant Thornton and Forvis Mazars. Others including Deloitte and BDO have exited because profit margins are considered too low, while complexity and risks have risen.\nEY and Grant Thornton declined to comment. A spokesperson for Forvis Mazars said: “We are working closely with all stakeholders including MHCLG [Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government] and remain committed to supporting the return to the delivery of good quality audits for local authorities.”\nWhile audit costs have risen sharply, so has the complexity of checking council finances at a time when growing numbers of local authorities are running into severe financial difficulties.\nExperts have also long warned local audit fees have been too low to attract accountancy firms to do the job, compared with the money available in private-sector auditing.\nIn 2020, an independent review by Sir Tony Redmond found fees were “at least 25% lower than required to fulfil current local audit requirements effectively”.\nThe breakdown in local audit reached crisis point two years ago when only 1% of English councils had their 2022-23 accounts signed off in time. Ministers then allowed accounts to be completed with qualifications – whereby an auditor signs off but expresses reservations – to clear the backlog.\nA new Local Audit Office is also being established to centralise previously fragmented oversight of the process.\nAn MHCLG spokesperson said: “We have taken decisive action to restore the broken audit system, providing £49m to help councils clear backlogs – but we know there is more to do. This is why we will set up a new Local Audit Office to simplify the system and increase capacity by establishing public sector audit provision.\n“This will ensure the local audit system provides accountability, transparency, and value for money for taxpayers.”\nRunnymede council said it was on a sound financial footing and did not recognise the fees quoted in the Audit Reform Lab report.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 23:01:01 GMT", "author": "Richard Partington Senior economics correspondent.", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}
{"title": "A UK headline wealth tax? It may be simpler to put up existing taxes", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/17/uk-headline-wealth-tax-simpler-existing", "text": "Pressure to go further on wealth taxes – by creating new modes of clawing at hoards of hard-to-reach cash – is mounting.\nFor starters, the fiscal picture is looking fairly bleak, with economists estimating that Rachel Reeves must raise £20bn – or even as much as £50bn – to meet her goal of balancing day-to-day spending against the revenue raised from taxation.\nOn the government backbenches, meanwhile, MPs want the chancellor to squeeze the richest in society harder. They even put forward an early day motion last month calling for a 2% annual tax on individual assets over £10m.\nYet introducing these kinds of taxes is often not straightforward, with the behaviour of the wealthy being hard to monitor and harder still to predict.\nThe first significant problem is working out where the assets are and who holds them.\nThat has always been difficult and has become even more challenging after one of the most important economic surveys, the household wealth data series, was suspended by the Office for National Statistics because of its low quality.\nThe upshot is that HMRC simply does not know how many millionaires or billionaires there are in the UK. Without reliable figures, it is extremely hard to write policies, cost them and administer them.\nThere is also a battle to be had with an “old guard with set views” in Whitehall.\nWhitehall sources paint a picture of a Treasury led by figures influenced by economists whose thinking was prominent at Oxford University in the 1980s and 90s – such as James Mirrlees, Christophe Chamley and Tony Atkinson – leading to something of an orthodox view.\nIn a nutshell, that position is that if you tax capital too much, it will stop investment and hamper growth. Or, in Chamley’s words: “Tax rate on capital income tends to zero in the long run.”.\nSince this era, the debate within economics has become more nuanced. A growing body of research suggests that some taxation on capital, even at relatively high rates, could lead to greater investment. As it becomes less attractive to hoard wealth because of taxation, risk appetites would then increase in pursuit of higher returns. You might be less tempted to keep your money in a vanilla savings account that can be taxed hard and easily if you can get a much better rate of return – even with a bit more risk – elsewhere.\nTreasury insiders argue that Reeves has followed the more modern logic, having already taken steps to widen the scope of inheritance and capital gains tax (IHT and CGT). They posit that her reluctance to pursue a headline wealth tax does not mean she has pulled her punches when it comes to taxing wealth.\nHostile backbenchers, on the other hand, suggest she follows the old orthodoxy too closely. They often cite her decision to go for relatively small changes in the amounts of tax paid via CGT, rather than bring it more closely in line with income tax at the last budget, which also upset more senior political colleagues.\nWhat the debate about how to handle changes to IHT (which have been fiercely opposed by farmers) or CGT illustrates is that if the government really wants to tax wealth more effectively then it has all kinds of ways to do so before opting for a politically – and potentially economically – sensitive route with a headline wealth tax.\nYet even changing existing mechanisms might not be easy, when the UK already has one of the highest rates of tax on property and wealth among developed economies, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\nPolitical pressure may make it harder to maintain a more gradualist approach, however. Figures on the left of the Labour parliamentary party are attracted to totemic wealth taxes of the kind introduced in Spain – its so-called solidarity tax – and Switzerland. They see it as part of showing a commitment to rebalancing the economy.\nReeves is critical of international examples, saying that Switzerland does not have IHT, and that Spain’s wealth tax is so riddled with exemptions that it raises too little money. Some developed economies that had comparable wealth taxes have dropped them, too.\n“We have inheritance tax. We have capital gains. We’ve just got rid of the non-dom tax status that doesn’t exist anymore in our tax system. So we do have taxes that tax the wealthy,” Reeves said in a recent interview with LBC.\nOther measures that go further are not yet proven to work, she claims, saying that those who “come up with simple solutions” must do more to “explain exactly how it would work, whether it’s an ongoing tax, what it would do to tax avoidance, what it would do about people moving or changing the way that their wealth is stored”.\nEconomists argue that the government should focus its energies on raising existing taxes, such as equalising CGT with income tax, for example, or changing gifting rules around IHT first, rather than introduce a novel wealth tax. The Treasury is already examining gifting rules among other possible IHT changes.\nYet while Reeves might agree with some of these arguments, it’s less clear whether her cabinet colleagues will tolerate a slow and steady approach, particularly if the fiscal picture sours.", "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 06:00:22 GMT", "author": "Anna Isaac", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}

Despite winning a huge majority at last year’s general election, Labour knew it had a lot of work to do to regain voters trust and show government could work for ordinary people.\nThe task was made more difficult as the party inherited a weak economy and crumbling public services underinvested in by previous Conservative administrations.\nSo far, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, has failed to win popularity with voters, according to many polls, with a seeming lack of political direction and constant moves to appease Reform voters while Labour’s base quietly slips away.\nStarmer’s proposed cuts to winter fuel payments, his sluggishness over adopting a firmer stance on Israel’s war on Gaza and his controversial welfare reforms were out of line with much of the public’s attitudes.\nLondon’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, told an audience at the Edinburgh festival fringe yesterday that Labour needs to “really pick things up” after a “tough” first year in government.\nKhan, who has been critical over the government before, notably over disability benefit cuts and ministers’ plans for a third runway at Heathrow, said there was a feeling that people “lent” Labour their vote last summer (in a bid to get the Conservatives out).\nThe London mayor said Labour supporters would be “delusional” if they did not recognise the difficulties the party had had since winning power in July 2024.\nHe said:\nThose people that say it has been a great first year … I think they are letting the party down.\nIt hasn’t been a great first year. There have been great things that have happened in this first year, around the rights for renters, around the rights for workers, around energy security, and I could go on. But as first years go, it has not been a great first year.\nKhan said Labour could still turn things around before its term is up and are equipped with a “great team” in No 10 led by Starmer, who he insisted he was not being critical of, although he conceded that the prime minister and those around him could be performing better.\nKhan – who is a Liverpool FC supporter – said if Labour was in a football match, they would be “two-nil down”. But continuing his analogy, he said that only 15 or 20 minutes of the match had gone, with minutes still to play and to “win this game”.\nAfter over a decade out of power at Westminster, Khan also said that the party had “lost the memory of running things”.\n“It has taken some time for the Labour party, the Labour government, to understand how the machinery of government works,” he said.\nMuch of today’s news agenda will be dominated by Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s crunch talks with Donald Trump at the White House. He will be joined by various European leaders, including Keir Starmer, who hope to coax the US president out of the pro-Russian positions he took after the Alaska summit on Friday. You can keep up with the latest developments in our Ukraine live blog helmed by the brilliant Jakub Krupa.\nSadiq Khan said Labour supporters would be “delusional” if they did not recognise the difficulties the party had had since winning power in July 2024, as he admitted its first year in office has been difficult. The London mayor told an audience at the Edinburgh festival fringe that Labour needs to “really pick things up”.\nKeir Starmer has been urged to recall parliament to “impose immediate sanctions” on Israel in a joint letter signed by politicians in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The letter urges the prime minister to “act now” to exert pressure on Israel to end its war in Gaza and for an end to arms sales to Israel.\nDowning Street has suggested thatKeir Starmer would back a Ukraine peace deal without a ceasefire as a precondition as the UK’s prime minister and other European leaders join Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington for Ukraine talks with Donald Trump.\nThe watchdog that monitors government ministers’ professional appointments after leaving office has been criticised for clearing Grant Shapps, a former Conservative defence secretary, to join Cambridge Aerospace as long as he promises not to work on defence matters.\nAlex Salmond’s niece has accused Nicola Sturgeon of tarnishing her uncle’s reputation when he is no longer able to defend himself in order to promote her memoir.\nMore than £300m given to English councils to help Ukrainian refugees into accommodation has not been spent, while thousands of them face homelessness.\nPatients in England now have greater access to important tests such as MRI scans and endoscopies in the evenings and weekends, the government has said, after increasing the number of community diagnostic centres (CDCs) offering out of hours services.\nWatchdog criticised for clearing ex-defence secretary to join missile maker\nThe watchdog that monitors government ministers’ professional appointments after leaving office has been criticised for clearing Grant Shapps, a former Conservative defence secretary, to join Cambridge Aerospace as long as he promises not to work on defence matters.\nIn a ruling that drew scorn from political ethics experts, the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which monitors and advises on the revolving door between Westminster and the business sector, gave Shapps the green light to become the chair of defence company Cambridge Aerospace.\nShapps told Acoba that the company, founded three months after the Conservatives’ general election defeat last year, planned to “develop technologies to reduce risks to aviation”. Disclosures show he cited examples such as airport delays caused by drones.\nOfficial government statistics show 209 pubs were demolished or converted for other uses over the six months to June.\nThe data, which was analysed by commercial real estate specialists at Ryan, show the overall number of pubs in England and Wales, including those vacant and being offered to let, fell to 38,780.\nIt means 2,283 pubs have vanished from communities across England and Wales since the start of 2020.\nThe hospitality sector was hit hard by the Covid lockdowns and soaring energy prices after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nThe British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) has urged the government to reform business rates for the sector.\nThe trade association said reducing the cumulative tax and regulatory burden would help more pubs to stay open, leading to more investment and jobs while also protecting spaces that, for many communities, are the only place left to socialise.\nYou can watch this interesting YouTube video in which the Guardian explores the reasons behind the closures of pubs and how they continue to function as key social spaces that can reduce loneliness and bring different types of people together in an increasingly atomised society.\nDowning Street has suggested that Keir Starmer would back a Ukraine peace deal without a ceasefire as a precondition.\nAsked if the prime minister wants a ceasefire back on the table after Donald Trump appeared to drop his calls for one following his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, Starmer’s official spokesman said: “We’ve always said we want to see a sustainable and just peace for Ukraine.\n“One that ensures peace returns to Europe and the Ukrainian people can live without fear of attack again, and an agreement that delivers that as soon as possible, but ends the killing and translates that into a lasting peace supported by security guarantees, would be a significantly positive step.”\nPressed on whether that marked a change of position, the prime minister’s spokesman said: “We want to see an end to the killing. If you can bring about an end to the killing and bring about a sustained peace in one go, then all the better.”\nAlex Salmond’s niece criticises Nicola Sturgeon over claims in memoir\nLibby Brooks\nAlex Salmond’s niece has accused Nicola Sturgeon of tarnishing her uncle’s reputation when he is no longer able to defend himself in order to promote her memoir.\nChristina Hendry told BBC Radio Scotland on Monday: “If my uncle was here today, these things would not be being said. I believe they’re being said because he’s not here to defend himself, as he would have done with every fibre of his being.”\nSturgeon’s political partnership with her predecessor as first minister, who died suddenly of a heart attack last October at the age of 69, dominates her memoir, Frankly, which was published last week.\nShe describes tensions that existed between them long before their catastrophic falling out over her government’s handling of sexual harassment complaints against him, claiming that he opposed equal marriage, overrode her concerns about releasing the Lockerbie bomber and had several extramarital affairs.\nThe former Scottish National party leader stood trial in 2020 on 13 counts of sexual assault and was cleared of all charges, although a pattern of bullying and inappropriate behaviour towards younger female staff emerged in court.\nAsked what she believed was motivating Sturgeon, Hendry said: “There’s been a number of years that these things could have been said, and the timing of it now where she’s released a book and is looking to publicise that, I think many people have thought that could be the case.”\nSturgeon writes in Frankly that she “agonised” about “stirring up pain for [Salmond’s] wife and family” but concluded “I cannot let what he said stand unchallenged”.\nTory MPs complain party attack ad on asylum hotels ‘makes us look silly’\nRajeev Syal\nConservative MPs have expressed frustration at their party’s “piss-poor” messaging over hotels housing people seeking asylum.\nLeaked WhatsApp messages show members are concerned that the party’s leadership is attacking Keir Starmer’s government for policies introduced by the Conservatives.\nKevin Hollinrake, the Tory chair, agreed that an advert shared by Conservative Campaign Headquarters last week was “of concern” but insisted it would not be deleted.\nThe WhatsApp exchange, which was first reported by ConservativeHome, came after the Tories launched an advert featuring a “list of perks” received by people housed in asylum hotels. It included housing and food “provided directly by the state” and clothing provided by the Home Office, which are offered to people who arrive in the UK and claim asylum.\nThe advert also included other claims that have since been challenged as exaggerations, including claims of discounted Spanish and French lessons, free driving lessons and free PlayStation consoles for new arrivals.\nLewis Cocking, the MP for Broxbourne, wrote: “This makes us look silly as we gave them all this too which is why we are in the mess we are in today. Completely unacceptable – they should be put in detention centres and deported.”\nHis message prompted a series of shadow ministers to signal their support, with the home affairs spokesperson, Alicia Kearns, the foreign affairs representative, Andrew Rosindell, and the housing spokesperson, Paul Holmes, responding with thumbs-up emojis.\nHollinrake replied: “Agreed. Do message me directly with anything [sic] other ads of concern.”\nPeople earning a median salary could expect to spend 36.3% of their income on an average-priced rented home in England in 2024, the ONS said.\nThis means rent prices were above the 30% threshold that the ONS considers to be affordable. It also marks an increase on the 33.1% of household income that average renters were paying in 2023.\nRents have risen in recent years for a number of reasons, including high demand outstripping supply, the pandemic and its fallout affecting how many people live and work, and buy-to-let landlords passing on increases in their costs caused by higher interest rates.\nOver £300m given to English councils to help house Ukrainian refugees unspent\nDiane Taylor\nDiane Taylor writes on human rights, racism and civil liberties\nMore than £300m given to English councils to help Ukrainian refugees into accommodation has not been spent, while thousands of them face homelessness.\nFreedom of information requests to 150 councils in England, shared with the Guardian, identified that £327m – about a third of the £1bn budget – was still sitting in council bank accounts more than three years after Russia invaded Ukraine.\nMost of the funds councils have spent have been used to pay staff and partner organisations.\nOnly £22m has been spent on temporary accommodation for Ukrainians and £15m to help them into private rented accommodation.\nMany Ukrainians struggle to find accommodation in the private rented sector because of the need to provide a deposit, something councils can help with but which some Ukrainians say in practice can be slow, bureaucratic and difficult to access.\nFinding a UK guarantor can also be difficult and those unable to speak English struggle to negotiate with landlords.\nA veteran far-right activist who was a key figure in the BNP was pictured feet away from Robert Jenrick as the shadow justice secretary controversially met protesters in Epping.\nEddy Butler was seen looking on as Jenrick visited the protest in Essex where the police have been attacked in the past by groups of masked men.\nButler, who was a key strategist on the BNP during its rise in the noughties and has been involved in other groups in recent years, is among far-right figures who have been involved in the protests.\nOthers include Callum Barker, an activist from the Homeland party, which has heavily promoted the protests. It is not suggested Butler or Barker were involved in any violence.\nJenrick also interacted with demonstrators including a woman with a T-shirt saying “send them home”. It’s not clear if he met Butler, but the far-right figure appeared behind him on a number of occasions.\nLewis Nielsen, a spokesperson for Stand Up to Racism, which has been organising counter protests in Epping, said that Jenrick was willing to go on protests that were clearly attended by far-right activists.\n“These activists aren’t ‘concerned parents or local residents’. Jenrick is fanning the flames of the far-right by chasing Reform UK votes – and he’s giving confidence to known fascists.”\nThe F-35 programme is an international defence programme which produces and maintains the fighter jets, with the UK having contributed components for both assembly lines and an international pool.\nIsrael has used the jets to devastating effect in its deadly bombardment of Gaza, killing many civilians.\nIn September, the Labour government suspended about 30 arms export licences for offensive use in Gaza, leaving 200 arms licences in place. It also gave a carve-out for equipment used in the F-35 programme, saying national security required that the F-35 supply chain remained intact.\nThe suspensions were due to a clear risk that Israel, which has regularly targeted civilian infrastructure like schools and hospitals and is accused of committing genocide in Gaza, might use the arms to commit serious breaches of international humanitarian law.\nThe British government continues to struggle to explain its export licensing regime. Ministers say they have stopped the sale of arms, but it was reported in July that there were more than 300 licences in operation. In addition, analysis of trade data shows UK firms have exported thousands of military items including munitions to Israel despite the government suspending key arms export licences in September.\nBut these moves are simply seen by many as inadequate in the face of the scale of the human suffering and death caused by Israel during the most recent war, which was triggered by the Hamas-led 7 October attack on southern Israel in 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 others taken hostage.\nStarmer urged to recall parliament to 'impose immediate sanctions' on Israel\nKeir Starmer has been urged to recall parliament to “impose immediate sanctions” on Israel in a joint letter signed by politicians in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the PA news agency is reporting.\nThe prime minister, always keen to stay on the right side of the US, has been accused of not doing enough to try to exert pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu to stop his assault on Gaza, which has brought famine conditions to the territory and killed over 61,000 Palestinian people, many of whom are women and children, according to officials.\nThe letter says:\nThe humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza is both man-made and avoidable.\nIt is characterised not only by relentless bombardment and destruction, but by the deliberate creation of conditions that are starving a civilian population.\nThe blocking of food, water, and medical supplies has precipitated what UN agencies and humanitarian experts describe as a man-made famine; one that is rapidly claiming lives and inflicting irreparable harm on an already traumatised population.”\nIt calls upon Starmer to recall parliament and impose sanctions on Israel and to “support a ceasefire and meaningful diplomatic intervention to protect civilians and secure a just, lasting peace”.\nIt also calls for an immediate end to all arms sales to Israel, support for an “independent, international investigations into alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity, and acts of genocide in Gaza”.\nThe letter also says the UK should use its “diplomatic influence to press for the unimpeded delivery of food, water, medicine, and humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza”.\nIt adds:\nThe UK’s moral standing and commitment to human rights will be measured by its response to this crisis.\nWe urge you to act decisively by standing against the man-made famine, the mass killing of children, and the broader assault on civilian life.\nThe letter was signed by Northern Ireland’s first minister Michelle O’Neill, Alliance party leader Naomi Long, SDLP leader Claire Hanna, the SNP’s Westminster leader Stephen Flynn and the convener of the party’s Holyrood group Stuart McMillan.\nOther co-signatories include co-leader Lorna Slater of Scottish Greens, Alistair Carmichael from the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth and Plaid Cymru’s Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts.\nRachel Reeves to slash environmental protections in a bid to speed up infrastructure projects - report\nThe Times is reporting that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is preparing to strip back environmental protections that block infrastructure projects from getting under way, in an effort to boost Labour’s building pledges and economic growth.\nLabour’s Planning and Infrastructure bill is already in the committee stage at the House of Lords but the Treasury is reportedly preparing for another planning reform bill, with officials considering ripping up key parts of European environmental rules that developers say are obstructing key infrastructure projects.\nAccording to the Times, Reeves has said the interests of “bats and newts” are being allowed to stymie infrastructure and development projects, and officials are considering placing limits to judicial review that will mean people with environmental objections won’t be able to delay projects so easily.\nThe chancellor, restricted by a set of stringent self-imposed fiscal rules, is desperate for economic growth and infrastructure is seen as a key part of that ambition. She is preparing for a difficult autumn budget amid mounting speculation over tax rises, as a weaker growth outlook, higher debt interest payments and a series of U-turns on welfare cuts contribute to a huge deficit in the government finances.\nPatients in England given more access to crucial health checks out of hours\nNicola Davis\nNicola Davis is the Guardian’s science correspondent\nPatients in England now have greater access to important tests such as MRI scans and endoscopies in the evenings and weekends, the government has said, after increasing the number of community diagnostic centres (CDCs) offering out of hours services.\nThere are 170 CDCs operating in England, which are often in shopping centres, football stadiums and on university campuses. Patients can access them through a referral from their GP or clinical teams at hospitals.\nThe government has revealed that 100 CDCs are open 12 hours a day, seven days a week – an increase of 37 CDCs with such opening hours compared with July 2024 – with the hope that the service will allow patients greater and speedier access to diagnosis.\nThe move to provide more convenient care is part of the government’s plan for change which, it says, aims to transform healthcare and make the NHS fit for the future, with an expansion of community-based services a key part of the approach.\nJack Straw urges Labour not to panic about threat of Nigel Farage\nThe former home secretary Jack Straw has urged Labour not to panic about the threat of Reform, who are riding high in the polls as Nigel Farage capitalises on the “small boats” and asylum backlog issue. Here is an extract from the write up of the interview he gave to the Guardian’s deputy political editor, Jessica Elgot:\nIn an interview with the Guardian, he praised Starmer’s intention to recognise a Palestinian state after an ultimatum to Israel – but defended the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, saying he would also have proscribed the direct action group Palestine Action.\nThe British political veteran said he believed Starmer and his cabinet were “head and shoulders” above opposition politicians and would reap the rewards of a gradual improvement in the economy and public services, which would not come immediately.\nAnd he said the poll lead of Reform UK should not be taken as a foregone conclusion. “We have been here before in terms of an insurgent party leading in the polls. So I think it is the famous phrase – don’t panic,” he said.\nThe former cabinet minister said Labour faced not only a terrible economic inheritance, but fundamental damage to the fabric of democracy by the previous Conservative governments, primarily Boris Johnson.\nLabour needs to 'pick things up' after 'tough' first year in power, Sadiq Khan warns\nGood morning and welcome to our live coverage of UK politics. Despite winning a huge majority at last year’s general election, Labour knew it had a lot of work to do to regain voters trust and show government could work for ordinary people.\nThe task was made more difficult as the party inherited a weak economy and crumbling public services underinvested in by previous Conservative administrations.\nSo far, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, has failed to win popularity with voters, according to many polls, with a seeming lack of political direction and constant moves to appease Reform voters while Labour’s base quietly slips away.\nStarmer’s proposed cuts to winter fuel payments, his sluggishness over adopting a firmer stance on Israel’s war on Gaza and his controversial welfare reforms were out of line with much of the public’s attitudes.\nLondon’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, told an audience at the Edinburgh festival fringe yesterday that Labour needs to “really pick things up” after a “tough” first year in government.\nKhan, who has been critical over the government before, notably over disability benefit cuts and ministers’ plans for a third runway at Heathrow, said there was a feeling that people “lent” Labour their vote last summer (in a bid to get the Conservatives out).\nThe London mayor said Labour supporters would be “delusional” if they did not recognise the difficulties the party had had since winning power in July 2024.\nHe said:\nThose people that say it has been a great first year … I think they are letting the party down.\nIt hasn’t been a great first year. There have been great things that have happened in this first year, around the rights for renters, around the rights for workers, around energy security, and I could go on. But as first years go, it has not been a great first year.\nKhan said Labour could still turn things around before its term is up and are equipped with a “great team” in No 10 led by Starmer, who he insisted he was not being critical of, although he conceded that the prime minister and those around him could be performing better.\nKhan – who is a Liverpool FC supporter – said if Labour was in a football match, they would be “two-nil down”. But continuing his analogy, he said that only 15 or 20 minutes of the match had gone, with minutes still to play and to “win this game”.\nAfter over a decade out of power at Westminster, Khan also said that the party had “lost the memory of running things”.\n“It has taken some time for the Labour party, the Labour government, to understand how the machinery of government works,” he said.\nMuch of today’s news agenda will be dominated by Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s crunch talks with Donald Trump at the White House. He will be joined by various European leaders, including Keir Starmer, who hope to coax the US president out of the pro-Russian positions he took after the Alaska summit on Friday.

A pint of bitter cost £1.63 and a packet of 20 cigarettes sold for about £2.94.\nAfter 28 years of exile in Poland, Lee, an English teacher, flew back to Britain a fortnight ago, his ticket paid for by the Home Office, where staff had belatedly acknowledged he was a victim of the Windrush scandal and allowed him to return.\nHe first contacted MPs and Home Office workers to request assistance in summer 2018 as the Windrush scandal unfolded. He says consular officials in Poland and Home Office staff in the UK failed to help him return despite the government’s repeated proclamations that everything was being done to assist those affected.\nCurrently accommodated in a hotel room in Birmingham, Lee travelled to London last week, stepping off the train at Euston station into a city so transformed in the past three decades that he was instantly overwhelmed by culture shock.\n“Nothing is the same – the taxis are different, the buses are different,” he said, as he made his way into the underground, puzzled by the Oyster card system. “What do I do with this? Tap and go through?”\nHe has spent the last two weeks walking around the streets, attempting to reacclimatise to the country he moved to from Jamaica in 1961 as an eight-year-old, assessing why he does not yet feel at home, despite the 37 years he lived here before being locked out.\nHe is relieved to be back, but startled by the intense sense of dislocation after so long away. “So much has changed. The homelessness is horrible – much worse than in Poland,” he said. “People here look so stressed, there’s a tiredness etched on their faces, as if they don’t know what to expect of tomorrow. It’s a little depressing. It’s clear that the quality of life is better in Poland than here, which feels very sad.”\nLee, 72, is one of a number of victims of the Windrush scandal who were prevented from returning to Britain after travelling abroad for work, or holiday or funerals; some were stopped by local border staff; many were given no assistance by UK consular officials who refused to acknowledge their right to travel to the UK. Lee says he struggled to persuade Home Office staff, MPs and officials at the UK consulate in Poland that he should be given help to return home, despite repeated appeals for assistance.\nIt was only last November when he contacted Desmond Jaddoo, a Windrush campaigner and Birmingham-based bishop who runs the Windrush National Organisation support group, that Lee was able to collect the documentary evidence needed to demonstrate that he should be allowed to return.\n“His case was a straightforward one, so it was easy to get him back once the documents were gathered,” Jaddoo said, adding that he was puzzled by why Lee had not received help to return sooner. Jaddoo traced school records, a marriage certificate, and Lee’s son’s birth certificate, proving he had a right to live in the UK. “We worry that there are other cases like this. We need a proper campaign to encourage people who remain stuck abroad to come forward.”\nLee moved to London in 1961, the year before Jamaican independence, travelling with his younger brother on his aunt’s passport, to join his mother who was working as a nurse in east London, and his plumber father who was working on the North Sea oil pipelines. On arrival he would have been classified as a citizen of the UK and Colonies.\nHe went to Princess May primary school in north London, where he passed the 11-plus and transferred to Dame Alice Owen’s grammar school. He worked as a financial analyst in the City of London for a while, opened his own barbershop, before later deciding that teaching was his vocation. He married and had a son, but by the time he went to take up a teaching job in Poland the marriage had ended. He travelled to Warsaw on a Jamaican passport because he had failed to persuade UK officials that he was entitled to a British passport, despite having arrived in the country 37 years earlier.\nBecause he stayed slightly over two years, he inadvertently breached the terms of his immigration status as someone who had been granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK. He was advised by staff at the Polish border that he would not be readmitted to the UK. Lee argued that he should have been recognised as a British citizen, because that was his status when he arrived as an eight-year-old. Throughout his time in Poland he was undocumented, which meant it was impossible to open a bank account.\nHe taught English to hundreds of students. In one of the many emails he addressed to the Home Office in 2018, he noted that he had helped many Polish students pass exams to study at UK universities, and had at least 10 ex-students who now held PhDs from British institutions. “Can you imagine how it feels preparing all these people to go to the UK, when I, as a citizen of the UK, cannot even enter. Believe me it is soul-destroying,” he wrote.\nLee made contact with the Windrush taskforce, which was set up as a result of the scandal in 2018, with a view to securing the necessary documentation to return to Britain, and explained he wanted help from the British embassy in Warsaw. When he went there to seek advice, a Polish employee was sent to speak to him on the pavement outside. “They refused to let me inside the building,” Lee said.\nDuring his time abroad he lost touch with his son and two sisters. He hopes to track them down and re-establish contact, but feels nervous about reconnecting. “I wonder if, during all the years I’ve been away, they have thought I abandoned them,” he said. In the next few weeks he needs to find somewhere permanent to live, reregister with a doctor and sort out his pension. He is dismayed that officials are refusing to grant back payments of his state pension going back to 2018, when he turned 65.\nThe barrister Martin Forde KC, who served as the independent adviser to the Windrush compensation scheme from 2018 to 2022, working to recompense those affected by the scandal that led to thousands of people who were living in the UK legally being misclassified as immigration offenders with catastrophic consequences for many. Some people lost their jobs or were evicted from their homes, or were denied benefits, free healthcare, and pensions; a few were arrested and deported to countries they had left decades earlier as children. Others were stuck for years abroad. Forde said Lee should be granted pension payments, adding: “It seems inequitable not to give him the pension that he would otherwise have received.”\nWhen he feels more settled, Lee plans to visit the graves of his mother and younger brother in London, and revisit the London cinemas where he developed a love of French arthouse film.\nHe is not ready to apply for compensation from the government because he does not believe ministers have acknowledged that immigration legislation which remains in place caused many of the Windrush generation’s problems. A long-buried Home Office-commissioned history into the roots of the scandal, finally released last year, warned that “during the period 1950-1981, every single piece of immigration or citizenship legislation was designed at least in part to reduce the number of people with black or brown skin who were permitted to live and work in the UK”.\n“How can I claim compensation when they haven’t admitted that the legislation was wrong?” Lee said.\n“I don’t feel angry, I’m past the stage where I can feel angry. I’m very philosophical and thoughtful about all that’s happened. But I do feel deep regret that the UK government conspired to take away the rights of the Windrush generation.”\nClive Foster, who was appointed as the new Windrush commissioner in July, said he wanted the government to do more to “proactively identify and reach individuals” still stranded abroad. The problem stretches “far beyond the Caribbean, affecting communities across Africa, Asia, and the wider Commonwealth. Yet people from these communities, in the UK and overseas, may be unaware that the injustices they’ve suffered are directly linked to this scandal.”\nA Home Office spokesperson said: “We are doing our best to ensure that justice and compensation for victims is delivered as quickly as possible. Some cases are more complex than others, but we will always try to work with each individual to get them the support they need.”", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:08:02 GMT", "author": "Amelia Gentleman", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}
{"title": "‘Shut it down and start again’: staff disquiet as Alan Turing Institute faces identity crisis", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/18/shut-it-down-and-start-again-staff-disquiet-as-alan-turing-institute-faces-identity-crisis", "text": "When the UK government announced the creation of the Alan Turing Institute in 2014 it promised a “fitting memorial” to the renowned computer scientist and artificial intelligence pioneer.\nMore than a decade on, Britain’s leading AI institute is in turmoil as staff warn it may be in danger of collapse and ministers demand a shift in focus to defence and security work.\n“The ATI brand is well recognised internationally,” says Dame Wendy Hall, a professor of computer science at the University of Southampton and the co-chair of a 2017 government AI review. “If it ceases to be the national institute for AI and data science then we are at risk of weakening our international leadership in AI.”\nTuring’s legacy, as the mathematical genius who helped crack the Enigma code, outlined key concepts of AI and invented the eponymous test to discern whether a computer can show human intelligence, has been rebuilt and burnished in recent years.\nIn 2013 he received a posthumous royal pardon 59 years after his death, having been convicted of gross indecency in 1952 after admitting a sexual relationship with a man. A year later he was immortalised in the Oscar-winning film The Imitation Game and in 2021 he became the face of the £50 note.\nA cornerstone of that legacy is in trouble, however. This month a group of staff filed a whistleblower complaint with the Charity Commission, which has a regulatory role over ATI because the nominally independent organisation is a registered charity – albeit largely funded by the UK government.\nThe complaint raised eight points of concern including the possibility that £100m of government funding might be withdrawn, which “could lead to the Institute’s collapse”.\n“These concerns are so significant that many staff now believe the institute’s charitable status and public credibility are at risk,” said the complaint, which also raised concerns about internal governance and culture as well as oversight of spending.\nIt is the latest in a series of staff broadsides at management. In March last year more than 180 staff wrote a letter to leadership expressing “serious concerns” about the organisation’s approach to diversity after it appointed four men to senior roles. In December more than 90 staff warned in another letter that ATI’s credibility was in “serious jeopardy” amid a restructuring that was threatening jobs – and research projects.\nATI has recently notified about 50 staff – or approximately 10% of its workforce – that they are at risk of redundancy and is shutting down projects related to online safety, tackling the housing crisis and reducing health inequality.\nThis is part of an overhaul dubbed Turing 2.0 under which the institute will focus on three key areas: health, the environment, and defence and security.\nA recent letter from the UK technology secretary, Peter Kyle, has made clear the overhaul does not go far enough. Writing to ATI’s chair last month, Kyle demanded the institute switch its main focus to defence and security, adding that ATI’s “longer-term funding arrangement” could be reviewed next year.\n“Moving forward, defence and national security projects should form a core of ATI’s activities, and relationships with the UK’s security, defence, and intelligence communities should be strengthened accordingly,” Kyle wrote.\nHe also indicated that leadership changes might be needed.\n“To realise this vision, it is imperative that the ATI’s leadership reflects the institute’s reformed focus,” he wrote. “Careful consideration should be given to the importance of an executive team who possesses a relevant background and sector knowledge to lead this transition.”\nIt is against this backdrop – long-running staff dissatisfaction with leadership, a strategic and financial overhaul, and then a bombshell from the government – that the whistleblower complaint was filed.\nATI is led by chief executive Jean Innes, who has had senior roles in the civil service and tech sector, and is chaired by Doug Gurr, the former head of Amazon’s UK operations and interim chair of the UK’s competition watchdog.\nGurr responded to Kyle last month with a letter pledging to “step up” on defence and national security as well as boosting the UK’s self-sufficiency in AI – or “sovereign capabilities”.\n“We will step up at a time of national need,” Gurr wrote.\nHowever, Gurr added that ATI will “continue to drive forward high-impact work in environment and healthcare” where it fits with the “government’s missions and the interests of our philanthropic and private funders”.\nAt a recent meeting between staff and ATI leadership, held remotely, Gurr faced pointed questions about the new direction raised by Kyle and the institute’s restructuring. One attender said the atmosphere was difficult, describing the mood among the more than 100 employees during the meeting as “contemptuous throughout”.\nIn an internal note to staff this week, Innes and Gurr confirmed a new working group of government officials and ATI staff had met to discuss the new direction. It also confirmed people would be leaving through redundancies and non-renewal of contracts.\nATI’s goals include to “advance world-class research and apply it to national and global challenges”, as well as driving an “informed public conversation” on AI. Its five founding UK universities were Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh, UCL and Warwick, with its research work including teaming up with the Met Office to improve weather forecasting, creating cardiac “digital twins” to study heart disease and improving air traffic control.\nA source who worked in the previous Conservative government said Labour’s concerns about the institute are “far from new” and there had been disquiet in political circles about the institute’s performance for some time, with multiple university stakeholders blurring its focus.\nIn that context, the source said, it makes sense to double down on what the institute does well – defence and security – or “just shut it down and start again”.\nProf Jon Crowcroft, the Marconi professor of communication systems at the University of Cambridge’s Computer Lab, and an adviser to Innes, says the institute’s staff have become unsettled.\n“I think the crisis in terms of people is real. A lot of people are still there because they believe it’s a good, open institution doing valuable public work. But they’re also wondering where their job is going to be,” he says.\nHe adds: “I have not seen a plan A for keeping all the staff happy, which would mean keeping some non-defence and security projects. The reason why staff have issued these letters is because they have not seen that.”\nReferring to ATI’s base at the British Library in London, he says: “Nor have I seen a plan B for what happens if too many people leave, because so many projects have gone, which means the core funding is not viable and they cannot justify the size of the building they are in.”\nThere are “mixed views” on the looming shift to defence and security, according to a current staff member who says they have listened to a “diverse” array of concerns among colleagues.\n“We understand the national importance issue. Very few of us are saying that work shouldn’t happen. But we think a singular focus would be too narrow. Turing’s strength comes from applying AI to a wide range of societal challenges, from health to the environment, with responsible innovation at the heart.”\nThe staff member adds: “Those areas are still important, and with the right leadership we could fulfil the vision and purpose that brought us here in the first place.”\nThe staff member adds that Gurr’s letter pledging to double down on defence and security, while still working on health and environment, leaves ATI in a “precarious standoff” with government.\n“The leadership is hoping the government’s attention, or its personnel, shifts,” they said. Hall says the institute has no choice but to change.\n“Clearly there is not much money around and the institute needs to do what the government asks. If it doesn’t, then presumably the government will close it down.”\nShe adds: “The institute has ceased to be what it was initially set up to be, which was a national institute for data science and AI. The government has asked it to focus on defence and security. Whether the UK needs such an institute is for the government to decide. Personally I would like to see the justification.”\nCrowcroft, who defends the quality of the institute’s work, says the UK has always been strong in AI and is “probably now stronger still”, pointing to multiple generations of AI expertise produced by universities such as Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial College and Edinburgh as well as the success of London-based Google DeepMind and the establishment of UK-based AI units by leading US tech firms such as Microsoft and OpenAI.\nA spokesperson for ATI said the institute was going through “substantial” change to continue to deliver in its unique role as the UK’s national institute for data science and AI.\n“As we move forward, we’re focused on delivering real-world impact across society’s biggest challenges, including responding to the national need to double down on our work in defence, national security and sovereign capabilities.”\nA government spokesperson said the technology secretary wants ATI to show value for money for taxpayer, which can be achieved by “giving the institute a key role in safeguarding our national security and positioning it where the British public expects it to be”.\nTuring’s legacy will live on. But in terms of the institute that bears his name, its longevity is in doubt.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 05:00:53 GMT", "author": "Dan Milmo Global technology editor", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}
{"title": "Like Jeremy Corbyn and Sophie Ellis-Bextor, I grew up in Woodcraft Folk. Here’s how it changes children’s lives | Phineas Harper", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/16/woodcraft-folk-jeremy-corbyn-children-scouts-keir-starmer", "text": "At the age of six I made the most important decision of my life: I joined Woodcraft Folk. It’s impossible to overstate the impact that growing up in the UK’s oldest co-educational youth movement made on me. My values, my skills, the deep friendships that have lasted into adulthood, the very fact that I am writing these words in this paper, every vote I have ever cast – all can be traced back to my time in Woodcraft Folk.\nThe largest leftwing force in British youth work, the charity turns 100 this year. It has produced some striking alumni including former Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn, pop star Sophie Ellis-Bextor, poet Michael Rosen, and political editor Robert Peston. With the government announcing new funding to boost youth services outside schools, Woodcraft Folk’s centenary is the perfect moment to learn from its remarkable story and unique approach to youth empowerment.\nThe challenges young people face in contemporary Britain take many forms. They are denied the ability to play outside as their grandparents did, or to take healthy risks. They are subject to suspicion from authority and derision in the media. They are fed the full addictive force of under-regulated new technologies almost from birth, then chastised for using them. There are no simple answers to these compounding challenges, but the mix of inclusive community, political education, fun outdoor activities and meaningful support that Woodcraft Folk offers young people could, perhaps, offer a blueprint.\nFounded in the aftermath of the first world war in south London by working-class young adults who wanted a more democratic and less militaristic alternative to Scouts and Guides, Woodcraft Folk grew quickly. Supported by co-operatives and trade unions, groups germinated across the country, combining after-school activities with large summer camps run on socialist principles. The hope was to model a more egalitarian society, giving young people the skills and knowledge to become active citizens.\nBy the late 30s, Woodcraft Folk was a serious force. The Labour party had recognised it as “the appropriate organisation for the children of its members” and a mass display of the charity’s camping techniques took place in Wembley stadium. Oswald Mosley, founder of the British Union of Fascists, was intimidated by its rise. According to former MP for Brighton Kemptown Lloyd Russell-Moyle, who also grew up in the organisation and is now its chief executive, Mosley’s Blackshirts marched to the gates of a 1938 Woodcraft Folk children’s camp in a show of intimidation.\nFascist Mosley was right to see Woodcraft Folk as an adversary. A year later, it became the largest secular organisation to support the Kindertransport, helping Jewish children escape from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. Woodcraft Folk leader Henry Fair, christened “the second Schindler” by the press, was put on the Gestapo death list for his role in the evacuations.\nOver the decades the charity has remained at the forefront of ethical youth work. It has consistently campaigned against apartheid, austerity and war. It stood up for the rights of queer youth workers despite funders withdrawing grants, marched against the invasion of Iraq and has boycotted Israeli products since 2010 in protest at the blockade of Gaza.\nFor me, Woodcraft Folk was not just a political education, but a rich mix of hiking, making and adventures too. It’s where I first learned to light a fire in the rain, use a compass to navigate fog, to juggle and to edit film. The first time I boarded a plane was with Woodcraft Folk to be part of an international camp in Austria, pitching tents alongside children from all over the world. It was with Woodcraft Folk that I marched through London in my first big anti-war protest and, of course, had my first kiss.\nMany adults balk at the prospect of tackling sensitive subjects like war, sex and politics with children, but finding creative ways to navigate difficult issues is why the charity remains so important and relevant. In the internet era there is no healthy way to shield young people from complex topics, but neither should there be. Ignorance is a shoddy substitute for a culture of safe and open discursive learning, and children are far more capable of grappling with heavy truths than many adults give them credit for.\nRaised alongside difficult topics, the children of the charity aren’t just better prepared for the world, but more able to support and educate each other. For example, when as a kid I tried regurgitating a racist joke I’d heard at a school, it was my Woodcraft Folk peers, rather than adults, who immediately explained why the “joke” was stupid and offensive and made sure I never repeated my shameful mistake. At a Woodcraft Folk camp marking their centenary, volunteers put the charity’s theory of mixing politics with fun activities into practice. Night-time orienteering and ceilidhs ran alongside eviction resistance workshops and discussions around prison abolition. While the Scouts sing campfire songs like Coca-Cola Came to Town and Ging Gang Gooly, the Woodcraft Folk songbook includes civil rights anthems about Rosa Parks and Hiroshima.\nBut if Woodcraft Folk has a clear vision of how society should empower the young, the current government has produced only topsy-turvy contradictory policies and proclamations. Last week the prime minister declared kids these days are “detached from the real world” and pledged £88m to liberate young people “stuck behind a screen”. But, at the same time Keir Starmer’s government is pumping more than twice as much money into bringing more “AI learning into classrooms”.\nSixteen year olds are finally to get the vote (a right Woodcraft Folk has long campaigned for), yet simultaneously the censorious Online Safety Act has imposed sweeping restrictions on those same young people’s access to certain information, including political posts. A closer look at the newly announced youth funding reveals much of it is, in fact, earmarked for calcified initiatives like gym equipment and more police cadets that will fail to holistically broaden horizons.\nI was a shy and nerdy child, often bullied by local schoolchildren. There’s a parallel universe in which, retreating from my tormentors, I too could have become detached from the real world, the reclusive screen addict that Starmer fears.

{"title": "Want more productivity, Rachel Reeves? It’s time to embrace Mancunian swagger | Richard Partington", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/17/productivity-rachel-reeves-london-manchester", "text": "Over the summer Rachel Reeves has been on a road trip around Britain. From Cornwall and Kent, to Aberdeen, south Wales and Belfast, in search of the solutions for a national economy that is stuck in a rut.\nInspired by this tour, the chancellor used a Guardian article last week to set her autumn budget priority: boosting productivity. Tax and spending may dominate news headlines, but this is the real problem facing the country, and no politician of the past two decades has managed to fix it.\nProductivity is a dull word of vital importance. Growing the measure of output for each hour of work is an economic secret sauce, enabling growth in wages and living standards over the long run without stoking inflation.\nOn the hunt for solutions, Reeves could have extended her trip. Leaving Westminster on a (most probably delayed) Avanti train from Euston, or an overcrowded TransPennine Express from her Leeds constituency; for the wetter side of northern England, where Manchester is having a moment in the sun.\nUnlike the rest of Britain, there are signs of life in Greater Manchester’s productivity. Between 2004 and 2023, the city region recorded the highest rise in gross value added for each hour worked of any combined authority in the country.\nLondon – once the driver of UK growth – has effectively stalled. The capital is still streets ahead in terms of productivity and the UK is still one of the most regionally unequal countries in Europe, with no regions outside London and the south-east of England above the national average. But Manchester is beginning to close the gap – with growth of 31% since 2004.\nTo anyone familiar with the north-west, this will probably come as no surprise. Manchester has changed beyond all recognition in recent years, never mind the past two decades. The Haçienda has been a posh block of flats for longer than it was at the epicentre of the “Madchester” music scene. The class of ‘92 swapped Old Trafford for building luxury hotels long ago, petrodollar cash has flooded the east of the city, and Oasis have just added, by some counts, £1bn to the British economy at large.\n“Manchester has got this buzz about it,” says Jim O’Neill,a former Goldman Sachs chief economist, and a proud Mancunian, who is life president of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership.\n“It’s always been there for years in the [city] centre. But most importantly it’s now spreading. Some would say it’s that Manchester swagger. It all relates to an attitude that ‘we can do this; we want to see it happen’. I don’t know another part of the country where it has that vibe.”\nFor years Britain’s productivity growth has been a dismal disappointment. Before the 2008 financial crisis growth averaged 2% a year, but has trickled to well below 1% since. Figures last week showed growth contracted in the year to June.\nWith the autumn budget not far off, this is fuelling a sense of alarm in the Treasury. Whitehall is abuzz with speculation that the Office for Budget Responsibility is poised to hand Reeves downgraded productivity forecasts – with the potential to blow a £20bn hole in her tax and spending plans.\nTo turn things around, Reeves could take the ingredients behind Manchester’s renaissance and apply them elsewhere. She could also double down on the “Northern Powerhouse” strategy for good measure.\nSources close to Labour say that is exactly the plan: Keir Starmer and Reeves are expected to launch an intensified regional growth strategy next month, with the revival of the Northern Powerhouse Rail project as its centrepiece.\nThose who know Manchester best say there are a few golden threads to the renaissance of Cottonopolis: devolution; political stability and coordination between its policymakers, businesses and institutions; the involvement of its top universities; and sustained investment.\nAndy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, says London hasn’t entirely cottoned on. The city symbolised by the worker bee has done well, but could have done even more with extra money and power from the Treasury.\n“The learning for Whitehall is, if you want productivity growth, and growth more broadly, you have to let go and trust places. And you have to invest. Because you can’t get it without investment.\n“[But] there is a bias against cities outside London and the south, and as long as this remains, the country will not achieve its full potential.”\n“I compare Manchester [today] with the city I came back to after uni, and the one I had to leave to get on in life. It’s been a major shift. The momentum is there now, and it’s what you do with that next.”\nIn truth the Manchester revival has deep roots. The timeline before Burnham’s arrival as mayor in 2017 is well known: the 1996 IRA bomb as catalyst for city centre regeneration; the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the opening of Salford Media City, the Lowry, Bridgewater Hall and the expansion of the Metrolink.\nLed by the city council’s former chief executive Howard Bernstein, and ex-leader Richard Leese, their “Manchester family” approach to coordinating investment proves Reeves’s theory that public money can “crowd in” the private sector: Manchester has ranked top outside London for foreign direct investment projects for three of the past five years.\nHowever, the transformation isn’t all plain sailing. House prices and rents are rocketing, crowding out families from Manchester’s poorer suburbs. For those who, like me, grew up around these parts, the skyscraper-sprouting skyline is a source of both pride, but also nagging worry. Could the pace of change sweep away something special, in a city used to doing things differently? And are the proceeds of growth lining Mancunian pockets, or flowing out of the Irwell to an offshore bank account?\nBurnham is alive to the danger. “I use the phrase that, the kids can see the skyscrapers from their bedroom window but they currently don’t see a path to the modern Greater Manchester economy. The next phase is about making that path.”\nStill, the addition of glass-fronted flats and office blocks among the converted Victorian mills has helped Manchester to create more jobs at a faster pace than the UK average. They reflect Labour’s hopes for Britain more broadly: that a fairer distribution of growth, in theory, will become easier if there is some growth in the first place.\nReeves could do with a few more Mancunian economic miracles. The national economy will not come unstuck without Britain’s biggest regional cities reaching their full productive potential.\nIn her first conference speech as chancellor last year, along the M62 in Liverpool, Reeves promised a Labour government would mean “shovels in the ground. Cranes in the sky. The sounds and the sights of the future arriving.”\nTo the next critic who asks ‘well, when exactly do you mean?’, a Manchester reference may help.", "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 10:06:09 GMT", "author": "Richard Partington", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}

This is my advice for today’s extraordinary White House meeting | Simon McDonald", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/18/washington-summit-ukraine-donald-trump-europe-russia", "text": "Last week’s extraordinary summit meeting in Alaska is being followed today by an even more extraordinary international conference in Washington. None of the participants knew they were going to take part two days ago. In recent decades, diplomacy has been increasingly conducted in ad hoc contact groups – but the group of seven countries (the US, Ukraine, the UK, Germany, Finland, Italy and France) and two international organisations (Nato and the EU) has never met in this way before.\nOfficials will be preparing in the usual way, assembling briefing packs and writing talking points, aiming to please their bosses and, hopefully, allowing them to make the most effective intervention.\nThey should take a deep breath and think differently. The precedents of European Councils and Nato summits – and even Donald Trump bilaterals – are misleading enough to be actively unhelpful. As former colleagues from Washington to Kyiv, via London, Paris, Brussels, Rome, Berlin and Helsinki, prep their principals, I urge them to discard the traditional approach.\nThe usual format of each leader making a statement (however brief) just won’t cut it. There are three key groupings in the meeting – the US, Ukraine and Europe. Europe should have a single spokesperson. Most European participants might be prepared to concede to that approach, as long as their leader is the chosen one. But only two are really in the frame.\nThe meeting will be conducted entirely in English with an interpreter for Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But there will be only two native English speakers, with Keir Starmer as the only European. Two others have spoken English for so long that they count as near-native speakers: Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb, and Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte. Stubb represents the smallest participant, often an advantage when corralling bigger beasts, while Rutte represents Europe’s military alliance. The others speak well enough for most meetings but Trump’s quirkiness could wrong-foot them. Emmanuel Macron, Ursula von der Leyen, Friedrich Merz and Giorgia Meloni speak well enough to make any point they want to make, but not necessarily in the best way to make it. Trump takes offence easily.\nSo, Rutte or Starmer should speak for Europe. Whoever speaks needs to make their points without notes, look Trump in the eye, be prepared to be interrupted but disciplined enough not to lose the thread – and to resume their presentation when the president has subsided.\nThe European message needs to build on the Alaska summit. European publics and pundits have declared Vladimir Putin the winner, and poured scorn on Trump’s kowtowing and conspicuous lack of success; some politicians have joined in. Britons might think their government craven for seeing the meeting as the start of a promising initiative, but that’s really the only sensible diplomatic take.\nThe most promising result of the Anchorage summit was Trump’s conclusion that aiming for a ceasefire was not good enough; we need to move smartly to a full agreement. The Europeans could signal their willingness to play a full part in implementing such an agreement. That role, above everything else, will be providing concrete security guarantees. Putin is highly likely to reject that.\nBut what if the comprehensive agreement also had something important for him? Putin’s two key territorial requirements are the land bridge to Crimea and the whole of Donbas. He has the first but not the second.\nUkraine would hate giving up land that Russia has never conquered. But the aim here is peace, and peace always requires concessions. Ukraine has, of course, a great interest in ending the fighting. It wants to do that – with honour – and it wants no resumption.\nThe precedent is the winter war of 1939-40. At the outset, Finland looked completely outgunned by the Soviet Union. But, like the Ukrainians, they fought bravely. Like the Ukrainians, they did much better than any outsider predicted. But in the end, they ceded more land than the Soviets were occupying in order to make peace – 11% of their territory, including Karelia (inspiration for their national composer’s most famous piece of music).\nIn 1940, Finland had reason to fear that the Soviets would be back for more. Operation Barbarossa came to their rescue one year later, when the Soviet Union was the target of the biggest land invasion in history. In 2025, Ukraine needs something more immediate. Membership of Nato is the most obvious “something”.\nZelenskyy won’t like any of this. He would have to consult his cabinet and parliament before conceding any of it. But he would be able to outline the bare bones of a deal to bring to an end the bloodiest conflict in Europe since the end of the second world war, a prize worth taking.\nPutin, too, wouldn’t like it. A Ukraine whose security is guaranteed by a power other than Moscow is inimical to him. But if Russia rejects an offer everyone else can grudgingly accept, Trump would see Putin for what he has been to date: the problem. He would have the knowledge and justification for upping the US’s contribution to Ukraine’s defence.\nToday’s meeting in Washington is one of the oddest in modern diplomacy. But European leaders can turn oddness into opportunity.\n-\nLord McDonald of Salford was permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, 2015-2020, and is now a crossbench peer", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 04:00:49 GMT", "author": "Simon McDonald", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"}

It's the second lawsuit challenging practices at Alligator Alcatraz, a controversial detention facility that the Trump administration has cast as a symbol of its crackdown on illegal immigration — along with a suit arguing the facility had skirted environmental rules.\nBut after a hearing on Monday, Miami-based U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz dismissed one part of their suit that alleged the government was violating the Fifth Amendment because it hadn't made clear for weeks which immigration court had jurisdiction over Alligator Alcatraz, preventing detainees from filing court petitions. Ruiz ruled that this claim is now moot because the government has since said publicly that the court at the Krome Detention Center in South Florida will hear the detainees' claims.\n\"The Court can do no more,\" Ruiz wrote.\nThe judge did not dismiss several other claims that the government is violating the First Amendment by allegedly making it difficult for detainees to talk to their lawyers, especially in confidential settings. Ruiz said that continues to be a \"live controversy.\" But he ordered the case to be transferred to a different federal court, because Alligator Alcatraz is technically within the boundaries of the Orlando-based Middle District of Florida.\nThe federal government has denied that defendants are blocked from meeting with attorneys.\nAlligator Alcatraz jurisdiction clarifications\nThe civil rights attorneys wanted Ruiz to identify an immigration court that has jurisdiction over the detention center so that petitions can be filed for the detainees' bond or release. The attorneys say that hearings for their cases have been routinely canceled in federal Florida immigration courts by judges who say they don't have jurisdiction over the detainees held in the Everglades.\nAt the start of Monday's hearing, government attorneys said they would designate the immigration court at the Krome North Service Processing Center in the Miami area as having jurisdiction over the detention center in the Everglades in an effort to address some of the civil rights attorneys' constitutional concerns. The judge told the government attorneys that he didn't expect them to change that designation without good reason.\nBut before delving into the core issues of the detainees' rights, Ruiz wanted to hear about whether the lawsuit was filed in the proper jurisdiction in Miami. The state and federal government defendants have argued that even though the isolated airstrip where the facility was built is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida's southern district is the wrong venue since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state's middle district.\nThe hearing ended without the judge making an immediate ruling. Ruiz suggested that the case against the federal defendants might be appropriate for the southern district because a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Miami is responsible for oversight of the detention center under an agreement between the state and federal governments.\nBut Ruiz also questioned whether the case against the state defendants might be better in the middle district, because all of the purported civil rights violations occurred at the facility itself, which is located in Collier County, several miles outside the southern district.\nAll parties have agreed that if the complaints against the state are moved to another venue, then the complaints against the federal government should be moved as well.\nSecond lawsuit seeks halt of operations at Alligator Alcatraz\nThe hearing over legal access comes as another federal judge in Miami considers whether construction and operations at the facility should be halted indefinitely because federal environmental rules weren't followed.\nU.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams on Aug. 7 ordered a 14-day halt on additional construction at the site while witnesses testified at a hearing that wrapped up last week. She has said she plans to issue a ruling before the order expires later this week.\nState says claims in lawsuit are false\nThe state of Florida has disputed claims that Alligator Alcatraz detainees have been unable to meet with their attorneys. The state's lawyers said that since July 15, when videoconferencing started at the facility, the state has granted every request for a detainee to meet with an attorney, and in-person meetings started July 28. The first detainees arrived at the beginning of July.\nBut the civil rights attorneys said that even if lawyers have been scheduled to meet with their clients at the detention center, it hasn't been in private or confidential, and it is more restrictive than at other immigration detention facilities. They said scheduling delays and an unreasonable advanced notice requirement have hindered their ability to meet with the detainees, thereby violating their constitutional rights.\nCivil rights attorneys said officers are going cell-to-cell to pressure detainees into signing voluntary removal orders before they're allowed to consult their attorneys, and some detainees have been deported even though they didn't have final removal orders. Along with the spread of a respiratory infection and rainwater flooding their tents, the circumstances have fueled a feeling of desperation among detainees, the attorneys wrote in a court filing.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 23:08:02 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/politics"}

House rules require 100 members to be present; Republicans hold 88 seats.\nThe Democratic quorum break was triggered by a Republican push to redraw the state's U.S. House district maps that would net the GOP up to five more seats in the 2026 midterm elections. Last week, the absent lawmakers had signaled they were ready to return to Austin after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott ended a first special session and Democrats in California moved forward with a plan to respond.\n\"Our return allows us to build the legal record necessary to defeat this racist map in court, take our message to communities across the state and country, and inspire legislators across the country how to fight these undemocratic redistricting schemes in their own statehouses,\" state Rep. Gene Wu, the Democratic leader, said in a statement issued Monday morning.\nAs the House returned to business, the redistricting proposal and dozens of other bills were referred to their respective committees. The redistricting committee is expected to meet on Tuesday. The Senate's redistricting committee passed the proposed maps along party lines on Sunday evening.\nRedistricting fight spreads\nAbbott put redistricting on the agenda at the urging of President Donald Trump, who wants to shore up Republicans' narrow U.S. House majority to avoid losing control of the chamber, and with it, prospects for Trump's conservative agenda in the later part of his term.\nIt is unusual for redistricting to take place in the middle of the decade and typically occurs once at the beginning of each decade to coincide with the census.\nIn response to the efforts in Texas, California Democrats are also moving ahead with their own reshaping of congressional districts to counteract Texas, putting in motion a potentially widening and unusually timed redistricting battle nationwide.\nMany states, including Texas, give legislators the power to draw maps. California is among those that empower independent commissions with the task.\nThe nation's two most populous states have been at the forefront of the resulting battle, which has reached into multiple courtrooms and statehouses controlled by both parties.\nImpact on midterm elections\nOn a national level, the partisan makeup of existing district lines puts Democrats within three seats of a majority. Of the 435 total House seats, only several dozen districts are competitive. So even slight changes in a few states could affect which party wins control.\nTexas' maps would aim to give the GOP five more winnable seats.\nCalifornia Democrats, who hold supermajorities in both chambers — enough to act without any Republican votes — on Friday unveiled a proposal that could give Democrats there an additional five U.S. House seats. But any changes would first need the approval of state lawmakers and voters. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom has said that his state will hold a Nov. 4 special referendum on the redrawn districts.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:58:42 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/politics"}

He suggested the method is susceptible to voter fraud, claiming in California, \"it's so corrupt, where some people get five, six, seven ballots delivered to them.\" He has often insisted mail-in ballots can be tampered with or enable people to vote multiple times.\nBut soon after the 2020 election, Debra Cleaver, founder and CEO of VoteAmerica, a nonpartisan voter information site, dismissed the idea of widespread voter fraud as \"a myth.\"\n\"The outgoing ballots have a barcode, and then when you send your ballot in, you put it in a return envelope and that barcode has to match the barcode that was sent out in order for the ballot to be counted,\" she explained to CBS News.\nAfter that election, the director of the nation's cyber security agency, Christopher Krebs, called the 2020 vote \"the most secure in American history.\"\nIn 2024, when Mr. Trump won the presidential election, the U.S. Census Bureau said nearly a third of ballots nationwide were cast by mail.\nThe White House told CBS News in a statement that Democrats had \"eroded faith in our elections\" with policies like \"unfettered mail-in voting.\"\n\"President Trump wants to secure America's elections and protect the vote, restoring the integrity of our elections by requiring voter ID, ensuring no illegal ballots are cast, and preventing cheating through lax and incompetent voting laws in states like California and New York,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said Monday night.\nTrump's impending executive order to stop mail voting — would it be legal?\nIn a social media post earlier in the day, the president said of the impending order that it would \"help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections.\"\nHe claimed that the states \"are merely an 'agent' for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes,\" and that \"[t]hey must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.\"\nBut Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution says it's the states that have the authority to regulate elections, not the president, and this may be changed only by Congress.\nTrump claims U.S. is the only country that uses mail-in voting. Is that true?\nMr. Trump also claimed, \"We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting\" and argued, \"You will never have an honest election if you have mail-in. And it's time that the Republicans get tough and stop it, because the Democrats want it. It's the only way they can get elected.\"\nIn fact, more than 30 other countries allow voting by mail for some or all voters, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, an intergovernmental advocacy group based in Sweden. Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark are among them.\nMail-in voting in the U.S.\nIn the U.S., mail voting is widespread: 28 states allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot, while the rest require a a documented reason such as illness or military service.\nThe pandemic gave mail voting a huge boost in the 2020 elections. About 43% of voters cast their ballot by mail that year, according to a report by the Election Assistance Commission. In 2024, mail voting dropped off, representing just over 30% of the total votes cast — about 46.8 million votes. The commission said that last year's numbers still exceeded pre-pandemic levels.\nThe topic of mail-in voting came up during Mr. Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, too. After the two met Friday, the president told Fox News' Sean Hannity that \"Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said, 'You can't have an honest election, election with mail-in voting.' And he said, 'There's not a country in the world that uses it now.'\"\nMr. Trump said the two talked about the 2020 election and that Putin told him, \"You won that election by so much, and that's (mail voting) how [Biden] got it.\" Audits and investigations, including some conducted by Trump supporters and Republican secretaries of state, showed no evidence that the 2020 election results were inaccurate.\nDavid Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, pointed out in a statement to CBS News that mail-in voting has been around since the Civil War and said getting rid of mail voting \"is an incredibly bad idea that would make our elections much less secure and vulnerable to interference.\"\n\"Requiring states to eliminate or replace the voting machines that confirmed the election of this president, just 15 months before a midterm election and less than a year before primaries, is not possible and would result in chaos,\" said Becker, who is also a CBS News election law contributor.\nWhite House spokesperson Harrison Fields told CBS News in a statement Monday night:\nSara Cook and Jenna Gibson Riggins contributed to this report.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 23:04:52 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/politics"}

A Delaware judge ruled partially in favor of Dominion in a decision earlier this year, additional court filings show.\nThe settlement comes after Fox News Channel paid $787.5 million to settle a similar lawsuit in 2023 and Newsmax paid what court papers describe as $40 million to settle a libel lawsuit from a different voting machine manufacturer, Smartmatic, which also was a target of pro-Trump conspiracy theories on the network.\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis had ruled earlier that Newsmax did indeed defame Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems by airing false information about the company and its equipment. But Davis left it to a jury to eventually decide whether that was done with malice, and, if so, how much Dominion deserved from Newsmax in damages. Newsmax and Dominion reached a settlement before the trial could take place.\nIn a statement to CBS News on Monday, a Dominion spokesperson said the company was \"pleased to have settled this matter.\"\nThe settlement originally came to light in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing by Newsmax, which was dated Friday, Aug. 15, the day that a deal was reached, according to the document. Newsmax has agreed to pay the settlement in three installments of $27 million, $20 million and $20 million, with the final installment to be paid in January 2027, the filing said.\nNewsmax continues to deny allegations that suggest its coverage of Dominion in the context of the 2020 election was defamatory.\n\"Newsmax believed it was critically important for the American people to hear both sides of the election disputes that arose in 2020,\" the company said in a statement published on its website. \"We stand by our coverage as fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards of journalism.\"\nThe disclosure of the settlement came as Mr. Trump, who lost his 2020 reelection bid to former President Joe Biden, vowed in a social media post Monday to eliminate mail-in ballots and voting machines, such as those supplied by Dominion and other companies, ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. It was unclear how the Republican president could achieve that.\n\"I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, and also, while we're at it, Highly 'Inaccurate,' Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES, which cost Ten Times more than accurate and sophisticated Watermark Paper, which is faster, and leaves NO DOUBT, at the end of the evening, as to who WON, and who LOST, the Election,\" Mr. Trump wrote in the post.\nThe same judge also handled the Dominion-Fox News case and made a similar ruling that the network repeated numerous lies by Mr. Trump's allies about his 2020 loss, despite internal communications showing Fox officials knew the claims were bogus. At the time, Davis found it was \"CRYSTAL clear\" that none of the allegations was true.\nInternal correspondence from Newsmax officials likewise shows they knew the claims were baseless.\n\"How long are we going to play along with election fraud?\" Newsmax host Bob Sellers said two days after the 2020 election was called for Biden, according to internal documents revealed as part of the case.\nNewsmax took pride that it was not calling the election for Biden, and internal documents show it saw a business opportunity in catering to viewers who believed Mr. Trump won. Private communications that surfaced as part of Dominion's earlier defamation case against Fox News also revealed how the network's business interests intersected with decisions it made related to coverage of Mr. Trump's 2020 election claims.\nAt Newsmax, employees repeatedly warned against false allegations from pro-Trump guests such as attorney Sidney Powell, according to documents in the lawsuit. In one text, even Newsmax owner Chris Ruddy, a Trump ally, said he found it \"scary\" that Mr. Trump was meeting with Powell.\nDominion was at the heart of many of the wild claims aired by guests on Newsmax and elsewhere, who promoted a conspiracy theory involving deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to rig the machines for Biden. The network retracted some of the more bombastic allegations in December 2020.\nThough Mr. Trump has insisted his fraud claims are real, there's no evidence they were, and the lawsuits in the Fox and Newsmax cases show how some of the president's biggest supporters knew they were false at the time. Mr. Trump's then-attorney general, William Barr, said there was no evidence of widespread fraud.\nMr. Trump and his backers lost dozens of lawsuits alleging fraud, some before Trump-appointed judges. Numerous recounts, reviews and audits of the election results, including some run by Republicans, turned up no signs of significant wrongdoing or error and affirmed Biden's win.\nAfter returning to office, Mr. Trump pardoned those who tried to halt the transfer of power during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and directed his Department of Justice to investigate Chris Krebs, a former Trump cybersecurity appointee who had vouched for the security and accuracy of the 2020 election.\nAs an initial trial date approached in the Dominion case earlier this year, Mr. Trump issued an executive order attacking the law firm that litigated it and the Fox case, Susman Godfrey. The order, part of a series targeting law firms that Mr. Trump has tussled with, cited Susman Godfrey's work on elections and said the government would not do business with any of its clients or permit any of its staff in federal buildings.\nA federal judge put that action on hold, saying the framers would view it as \"a shocking abuse of power.\"", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:40:00 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/politics"}
{"title": "Democrats unveil maps of California's redistricting proposal", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democrats-unveil-california-congressional-redistricting-maps-plan/", "text": "Democrats unveil maps of California's redistricting proposal\nDemocrats unveiled a proposal Friday that could give California's dominant political party an additional five U.S. House seats in a bid to win the fight to control Congress next year.\nThe plan calls for an unusually timed reshaping of House district lines to greatly strengthen the Democratic advantage in the state ahead of midterm elections, when Republicans will be defending the party's fragile House majority.\nIt amounts to a counterpunch to the Texas Republicans' plan to take five Democratically held seats and redraw them to favor the GOP at the urging of President Trump as he tries to avoid losing control of Congress and, with it, prospects for his conservative agenda in the later part of his term.\nThe California effort seeks to take five of the state's nine GOP districts and make them more favorable to Democrats. Just like in Texas, however, it is by no means a guarantee that Democrats would win all five of these seats if a new California map becomes law.\nMaking the shift would likely require an amendment to California's state Constitution. Overhauling the current map that is in law would need to be passed by a two-thirds vote in both the state Assembly and state Senate, and then be approved by California voters in an election.\nCalifornia lawmakers are scheduled to return to Sacramento on Aug. 18 amid the redistricting talk. The California State Legislature will have a short time span to move forward.\nIf approved by voters in a special election this November, the California blueprint could nearly erase Republican House members in the nation's most populous state. The Democratic plan is intended to win the party 48 of its 52 U.S. House seats, up from 43 currently.\nThe proposal was released by the campaign arm of House Democrats, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Democrats in the state Legislature will hold hearings and plan to vote on the new maps next week.\n\"This is about more than drawing lines on a map. It's about drawing a line in the sand to stop Texas and Trump from rigging the election,\" state Senate Democratic leader Mike McGuire said in a statement.\nNew districts have boundaries to boost Democratic edge\nWhile a general notion behind drawing districts is to unite what's called communities of interest — neighborhoods and cities that share similar concerns or demographic traits — the proposed remapping would create a jigsaw of oddly shaped districts to maximize Democratic clout.\nThe 1st Congressional District is currently anchored in the state's conservative far northeast corner and is represented by Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Trump supporter. The district has a nearly 18-point GOP registration edge.\nUnder the proposal, Democrats would end up with a 10-point registration advantage in the district after drastic reshaping to include parts of heavily Democratic Sonoma County near the Pacific Coast.\nIn a post on the social platform X, LaMalfa called the proposal \"absolutely ridiculous.\" LaMalfa's first congressional district would include parts of Santa Rosa under the proposed maps, an area that is in Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson's district.\nIn the battleground 41st District east of Los Angeles, represented by long-serving Republican Rep. Ken Calvert, Democratic and Republican registration is currently split about evenly.\nBut in the redrawn district, Democratic registration would jump to 46%, with GOP registration falling to 26%.\nOther Republicans whose districts would see major changes intended to favor Democrats include Rep. Kevin Kiley in Northern California, Rep. Ken Calvert in Riverside County, Rep. David Valadao in the Central Valley farm belt and Rep. Darrell Issa in San Diego County. Also, embattled Democratic incumbents would see their districts padded with additional left-leaning voters.\n\"Well, obviously, Newsom's entire goal was to revert to the era of drawing lines based upon partisan political factors, as politicians draw their lines,\" Kiley told CBS Sacramento earlier Friday.\nKiley's current district covers suburbs, small towns and mountain communities from the Sacramento region to the Eastern California border.\nThe release of the plan came the same day that Texas Republicans began a second special session to approve new congressional maps sought by Trump.\nThe GOP's first special session in Texas ended without approving new political maps, thwarted by Democrats who staged a nearly two-week walkout that meant not enough lawmakers were present to pass any legislation. Gov. Greg Abbott then quickly called a second session that started without the necessary quorum to conduct business.\nDemocratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday that his state will hold a Nov. 4 special referendum on the redrawn districts.\n\"We can't stand back and watch this democracy disappear district by district all across the country,\" Newsom said.\nThe announcement marked the first time any state beyond Texas officially waded into Trump's fight, though several governors and legislative leaders from both parties have threatened such moves.\nRep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, who heads the House GOP campaign arm, said Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, is \"shredding California's Constitution and disenfranchising voters.\"\n\"Californians oppose Newsom's stunt because they won't let a self-serving politician rig the system to further his career,\" said Hudson, who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee.\nHow will voters react?\nUnder current law, California has an independent redistricting commission that was approved by voters earlier this century. Newsom has emphasized that the ballot effort would not get rid of the commission, though it would essentially suspend it. If the measure passes, the commission would then resume being able to write maps after the 2030 census.\nA big risk for Democrats is whether voters will be open to setting aside district boundaries crafted by the independent commission for ones shaped for partisan advantage.\nSome people already have said they would sue over the effort. Republican former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a longtime opponent of partisan redistricting, signaled that he will not side with Democrats even after talking to Newsom. He posted a photo of himself Friday at the gym wearing a T-shirt that said, \"Terminate gerrymandering,\" with a reference to an obscenity and politicians.\n\"I'm getting ready for the gerrymandering battle,\" Schwarzenegger said.\nHouse control could come down to a few seats in 2026\nOn a national level, the partisan makeup of existing district lines puts Democrats within three seats of a majority. Of the 435 total seats, only several dozen districts are competitive. So even slight changes in a few states could affect which party wins control.\nNew maps are typically drawn once a decade after the census — the last being in 2020. Many states, including Texas, give legislators the power to draw maps. California is among those that empowers independent commissions with the task.\nIf approved, a new California map would take effect only if a Republican state does its own redistricting. It would remain through the 2030 elections. After that, Democrats say, they would return mapmaking power to the independent commission voters approved in 2008.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:09:53 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/politics"}

Collectively, they've received more than $500 million a year in crime victim grants since 2021, according to the lawsuit.\nThe states asked a federal judge to block the new rules and declare them illegal. They said they need \"urgent relief\" since applications for most of the grants are due Wednesday.\nThe Justice Department declined to comment on the lawsuit.\nAs President Trump seeks to dramatically ramp up arrests of suspected undocumented immigrants, his administration has taken aim at so-called sanctuary cities and states, which generally limit local police from cooperating with federal immigration agents.\nWithin hours of his swearing-in on Jan. 20, the president signed an executive order directing officials to ensure that sanctuary jurisdictions \"do not receive access to Federal funds.\" Weeks later, Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the Justice Department to identify and pause grants to groups that \"support or provide services to removable or illegal aliens.\"\nThe administration argues that sanctuary cities and states make it harder to enforce immigration laws, especially against criminals who end up in state or local custody.\nSupporters of sanctuary laws, however, argue that forcing local law enforcement officers to work with immigration agents makes migrants less likely to cooperate with the police. Monday's lawsuit said the conditions on crime victim grants risk \"destroying trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities that is critical to preventing and responding to crime.\"\n\"The federal government is attempting to use crime victim funds as a bargaining chip to force states into doing its bidding on immigration enforcement,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.\nEarlier this year, the Justice Department cut off hundreds of federal grant programs, including money for nonprofits that help victims of hate crimes, sex trafficking and violence against children, according to a list obtained by CBS News. The heads of some nonprofits warned they would need to lay off staff or shutter crime victim hotlines.\nAt the time, a Justice Department spokesperson told CBS News: \"We are confident that these cuts are consistent with the administration's priorities while at the same time protecting services that tangibly impact victims.\"\nA group of anti-domestic-violence nonprofits also sued the Justice Department earlier this year for banning grant funding under the Violence Against Women Act to groups that promote \"gender ideology\" or diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

He says when President John F. Kennedy asked him to join the astronaut training program in 1961, he didn't want it. His mom said it wasn't about what he wanted.\n\"She said 'You better get out and do this. We need this as an inspiration for the Black community,'\" he said.\nBut Dwight says progress turned to prejudice and racism after Kennedy was assassinated, causing him to resign.

Mr. Trump said any guarantees would involve U.S. \"coordination.\"\n- Mr. Trump said he called Russian President Vladimir Putin shortly after the meetings wrapped up, as he aims to set up a summit between Putin and Zelenskyy. Putin met with Mr. Trump in Alaska last week.\n- It's unclear whether the talks will lead to a ceasefire.

But Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier Monday that guarantees would be provided by European countries, in \"coordination with the United States of America.\"\nZelenskyy also said the White House meetings included discussions about returning Ukrainian children and prisoners of war held by Russia, and he noted that Mr. Trump has pushed for a summit between Zelenskyy and Putin.\n\"Today was an important step, a demonstration of genuine unity between Europe and the United States,\" he wrote. \"The leaders personally came to support Ukraine and to discuss everything that will bring us closer to real peace, to a reliable security architecture that will protect Ukraine and all of Europe.\"\nBreaking down stakes of a possible trilateral meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy and Putin\nRubio says \"we're working on\" Putin-Zelenskyy meeting\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News that \"we're working on\" setting up a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, an idea he called \"unprecedented.\"\nMr. Trump says he spoke to Putin on the phone Monday and pushed for a one-on-one meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, followed by talks between Mr. Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy.\n\"I'm not saying they're going to leave that room with a peace deal, but I think the fact that people are now talking to each other: This wasn't happening for three and a half years. This was a stalemated war of death and destruction,\" Rubio said.\nRubio also said \"each side is going to have to make some concessions\" to resolve the Russia-Ukraine war, but Ukraine will also need to \"feel safe moving forward,\" referring to discussions of security guarantees for the eastern European country.\nTrump says he discussed missing children with EU leader\nAfter meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders, Mr. Trump said he and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had discussed \"the massive Worldwide problem of missing children,\" with a goal of \"bringing them home to their families.\"\nVon der Leyen responded by thanking Mr. Trump, and wrote that \"every single Ukrainian child abducted by Russia must be returned to their families.\"\nSince Moscow's invasion of Ukraine began more than three years ago, reports have emerged of Russian troops separating Ukrainian children from their families and giving them to Russian families. The forced removals — which Russia claims are a humanitarian move — led the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant against Putin for alleged war crimes in 2023.\nMr. Trump's Truth Social post on missing children did not mention Russia specifically. But first lady Melania Trump penned an open letter to Putin over the weekend pleading with him to protect \"the innocence of these children.\"\nZelenskyy says no date for meeting with Putin\nShortly after leaving talks at the White House, Zelenskyy told CBS News that he hasn't set a date to meet with Putin, but he's prepared for a summit with the Russian president.\nMr. Trump has pushed for a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, followed by a trilateral meeting with the two leaders and the U.S. president.\n\"Ukraine will never stop on the way to peace, and we are ready for any kind of format, but on the level of leaders,\" Zelenskyy said at an impromptu press conference in Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C.\nNATO chief calls Trump-Zelenskyy meeting \"very successful\"\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte called Monday's meeting between Mr. Trump, Zelenskyy and European leaders \"very successful\" in an interview with Fox News.\nRutte said that the group discussed security guarantees for Ukraine — which Zelenskyy has cast as a key facet of any potential deal with Moscow. He said the leaders did not talk about the possibility of Ukraine ceding some of its territory to Russia because they need \"full clarity\" on how the guarantees will work.\nAsked about a call between the U.S. president and Putin, Rutte said Mr. Trump was able to get the Russian leader to agree to a meeting with Zelenskyy.\nZelenskyy holding press conference near White House after Trump talks\nZelenskyy has left the White House and is holding a press conference steps away, in Lafayette Square, following meetings with Mr. Trump and European leaders.\nTrump's hot mic moment with Macron\nAs the meeting with Zelenskyy and the European leaders was beginning, a hot mic captured a brief conversation President Trump was having with French President Emmanuel Macron.\nMr. Trump can be heard mentioning setting \"a trilat,\" presumably between Zelenskyy, Putin and Mr. Trump. And then in a comment that seemed to be about Putin, the president told Macron, \" I think he wants to make a deal. I think he wants to make a deal for me. You understand that? As crazy as it sounds.\"\nTrump says Europe could give security guarantees to Ukraine with U.S. \"coordination\"\nMr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that he discussed security guarantees for Ukraine during his meeting with Zelenskyy and the leaders of several European countries.\nHe said the guarantees \"would be provided by the various European Countries, with a coordination with the United States of America.\"\nThe U.S. president also called the meeting \"a very good, early step.\"\nZelenskyy has argued that his country needs security guarantees as part of any ceasefire deal with Russia to prevent Putin from reinvading Ukraine. Mr. Trump said earlier Monday that \"we will give [Ukraine] very good protection.\"\nThe exact structure of those guarantees is unclear — including whether it would require the U.S. or its European allies to get involved in a possible future Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nUkraine has sought membership in NATO, which would obligate the alliance's other members to come to Ukraine's defense if it were invaded. But Mr. Trump ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine on Sunday.\nTrump says he called Putin to set up meeting with Zelenskyy\nMr. Trump said he called Putin shortly after his White House meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders, aiming to arrange a joint session between the Ukrainian and Russian leaders.\n\"After that meeting takes place, we will have a Trilat, which would be the two Presidents, plus myself,\" the president wrote on Truth Social.\nIt's unclear if either side has agreed to the proposed meeting.\nTrump shows Zelenskyy a map of Ukrainian territories held by Russia\nA map that appeared to show percentages of Ukrainian regions occupied by Russia was on display in the Oval Office during Mr. Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy.\nZelenskyy appeared to acknowledge the map during a later meeting with Mr. Trump and European leaders, saying he had shown Mr. Trump battlefield details on a map.\n\"Thank you for the map, by the way,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\"Good map,\" Mr. Trump responded.\n\"I'm thinking how to take it back,\" Zelenskyy quipped.\n\"We'll get you one,\" said Mr. Trump.\nThe map is more than a souvenir, though. Whether Russia will retain control of Ukrainian territory — and what territories it will continue to occupy — is a key factor in the peace negotiations. Moscow has pressed Kyiv to cede control of eastern Ukraine's Donbas region in exchange for a ceasefire, a demand Zelenskyy has pushed back on.\nLate Sunday, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that Zelenskyy can end the war \"almost immediately\" if he agrees to several demands, including \"No getting back Obama given Crimea\" — referring to the Ukrainian peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. President Obama did not recognize Crimea as part of Russia.\nTrump's East Room meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders ends; talks continue in Oval Office\nMr. Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders in the White House's East Room has concluded, the White House confirmed. The meeting lasted more than two hours.\nZelenskyy's press secretary Serhii Nikiforov told Ukrainian journalists that negotiations later resumed in the Oval Office in a \"leaders only\" format.\nZelenskyy emphasizes importance of returning abducted children and prisoners in peace deal\nIn his comments at the beginning of the multilateral meeting, Zelenskyy emphasized the importance of securing the return of Ukrainian prisoners of war and tens of thousands of Ukrainian children who have been abducted by Russia.\n\"It's very important to exchange all the prisoners, and I think the president will help, and I was very thankful to your wife, again, Mr. President, for the letter about our abducted children,\" Zelenskyy said, referring to a letter first lady Melania Trump wrote to Putin. \"And I hope that really it can be a historic role for the people to bring kids back to the families, and be happy … This is so, so important and I'm happy that we discussed it.\"\nOn Sunday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the U.S. has \"repeatedly raised that issue in every forum possible.\"\n\"Children should be returned to their families. On that position, I don't think there's any ambiguity on our side,\" he said. \"And they shouldn't even be a bargaining chip, in regards to a broader negotiation.\"\nPublic parts of White House talks went \"very well\" but \"proof will be in the pudding,\" expert says\nThe visible parts of Mr. Trump's meetings with Zelenskyy and European leaders went, by and large, \"very, very well,\" but the \"proof will be in the pudding in the coming days,\" said Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\nBowman said he had hoped going into Monday that the leaders would \"present a unified image of strength,\" and that largely happened. Bowman said he hopes Mr. Trump sees today as a \"big win\" for the U.S., as it \"strengthens Mr. Trump's negotiating hand,\" and \"he shouldn't fritter that away.\"\nBut Bowman has been concerned that Mr. Trump's Alaska meeting with Putin would \"provide Putin an opportunity to further delay or avoid consequences, and so far that's what has happened.\"\n\"At some point, you're going to have to impose some consequences,\" Bowman said of the United States' posture toward Russia.\nBefore the Alaska summit, Mr. Trump warned that Russia would face \"severe consequences\" if it didn't stop the fighting. But he said Monday that a ceasefire may not be a prerequisite for a trilateral meeting.\n\"I thought that was the most unfortunate excerpt\" from today's meeting, Bowman said. A ceasefire is \"the most obvious concession [Putin] should make,\" he added.\n\"He's continued to attack Ukraine and Ukrainians,\" Bowman said, speaking to Putin's unwillingness to end the war peacefully.\nWhat \"security guarantees\" for Ukraine could mean\nThe issue of \"security guarantees\" for Ukraine has loomed large over the White House talks, with all the leaders seemingly in agreement about the need to bolster Ukraine's defenses under any eventual peace deal with the goal of deterring Russian aggression in the future. Many analysts and European officials warn that Putin would be emboldened to seize more territory down the line without a robust security agreement.\nThe contours of what those guarantees would look like are still being hashed out. But comments on Monday indicated that leaders were considering potential peacekeeping troops on the ground, defense and intelligence support for Kyiv and bolstering the Ukrainian army.\nSteve Witkoff, Mr. Trump's special envoy, hinted at one possibility for ensuring Ukraine's defense over the weekend.\nAppearing on CNN on Sunday, Witkoff said the guarantees could be styled on Article 5 of the NATO charter, which states that an attack on one of the 32 members of the transatlantic alliance would be considered an attack on all. That promise of collective defense has served as the underpinning of security in Europe since NATO's founding in 1949, deterring direct aggression against its members during the Cold War and beyond.\nRussia vehemently opposes Ukraine joining NATO, viewing it as a threat to its own security. But an Article 5-like arrangement without formally admitting Ukraine into the alliance could reassure Kyiv in a way that Russia might accept. Witkoff said Putin would be open to the U.S. and Europe offering that sort of protection for Ukraine.\nMr. Trump acknowledged that the U.S. would \"be involved\" in any arrangement to guarantee Ukraine's security, but said Europe would play a large role as well. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he thought the leaders could make progress on formulating an Article 5-style arrangement on Monday.\nEuropean leaders tie security guarantees for Ukraine to their own defense\nSeveral of the leaders assembled around the table stressed the importance of guaranteeing Ukraine's security, not just for Kyiv but for the continent as a whole.\n\"When we talk about security, we're talking about the security not just of Ukraine, we're talking about the security of Europe and the United Kingdom as well,\" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said any agreement should focus on \"how to be sure that it won't happen again,\" referring to Russia's invasion.\nAlexander Stubb, the president of Finland, said the security guarantees are a \"big part of this.\" Finland joined NATO in 2023 in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\"Some of the international media might wonder, why is the president of Finland here? I think the reason is probably that we might come from a small country, but we have a long border with Russia, over 800 miles,\" Stubb said, mentioning Finland's own history with Russia, including the Soviet invasion of the country during World War II.\n\"If I look at the silver lining of where we stand right now, we found a solution in 1944, and I'm sure we'll be able to find a solution in 2025 to end Russia's war of aggression and find and get a lasting and just peace,\" Stubb said.\nMacron: \"Everybody around this table is in favor of peace\"\nThe French president said that \"everybody around this table is in favor of peace,\" noting that \"when we speak about security guarantees, we speak about the whole security of the European continent.\"\n\"This is why we are all united here with Ukraine on this matter,\" Macron said.\nMacron said to Mr. Trump, \"you can count on us as we can count on you\" to deliver peace for Ukraine and Europe more broadly.\nGermany's Merz stresses need for ceasefire before next meeting with Putin\nMerz, the German chancellor, said he \"can't imagine\" another meeting taking place without a ceasefire, a subtle suggestion to Mr. Trump that Putin should not be granted another meeting without agreeing to end the fighting in Ukraine.\n\"I can't imagine that the next meeting would take place without a ceasefire,\" Merz said. \"So let's work on that, and let's try to put pressure on Russia. Because the credibility of these efforts we are undertaking today are depending on at least a ceasefire from the beginning of the series of negotiations, from next step on. So I would like to emphasize this aspect and would like to see a ceasefire from the next meeting, which should be a trilateral meeting, wherever it takes place.\"\nMr. Trump did not endorse that approach, and has said throughout the day that a ceasefire isn't necessary to reach an agreement.\n\"Well, we're going to let the president go over and talk to the president, and we'll see how that works out, and if we can do that,\" Mr. Trump said, meaning Putin and Zelenskyy.\nMr. Trump said ceasefires haven't preceded peace talks in other peace deals he's been involved in around the world.\nNATO chief says Trump broke \"deadlock\" on Ukraine war\nAs the leaders took turns addressing the assembled media, Rutte, the NATO secretary general, thanked Mr. Trump for breaking the \"deadlock\" with Putin by starting a dialogue earlier this year, praising the U.S. president for his work to end the war.\n\"If we play this well, we could end this. And we have to end it,\" Rutte said.\nThe NATO chief added that he was \"excited\" by the progress, while urging the leaders to \"get this thing to an end as soon as possible.\"\nZelenskyy calls meeting with Trump a \"very good conversation\"\nZelenskyy called his meeting with Mr. Trump a \"very good conversation,\" as the U.S. president chimed in saying, \"very good.\"\n\"It really was the best one, or, sorry, maybe the best one will be in the future,\" Zelenskyy said. \"But it was really good.\"\nThe Ukrainian president said he and Mr. Trump spoke about \"sensitive points,\" including security guarantees, calling it \"very positive\" that the U.S. is giving \"such strong\" signals on security guarantees. He also noted the importance of a prisoner exchange and the return of abducted children to their families.\n\"All of us want to finish this war, stop Russia and stop this war,\" Zelenskyy said.\nZelenskyy also said Ukraine would be happy if Mr. Trump attended a possible trilateral meeting with Putin.\nTrump says they'll discuss possible exchanges of territories and security guarantees\nMr. Trump said he and European leaders will discuss potential security agreement proposals for Ukraine, as well as the possible \"exchanges\" of territory.\n\"The Alaska summit reinforced my belief that while difficult, peace is within reach,\" Mr. Trump said, alongside the European leaders. \"And I believe that, in a very significant step, President Putin agreed that Russia would accept security guarantees for Ukraine, and this is one of the key points that we need to consider. And we're going to be considering that at the table also, like who will do what, essentially.\"\nThe president said he's \"optimistic\" they can reach a security agreement that will deter any future aggression against Ukraine. Mr. Trump said European nations will take \"a lot\" of the responsibility for ensuring Ukraine's security.\n\"We also need to discuss the possible exchanges of territory taken into consideration,\" Mr. Trump said, calling the current war lines \"sad\" to see.\nMr. Trump said European leaders also need to consider the negotiating positions of Putin, and of Zelenskyy.\n\"Ultimately, this is a decision that can only be made by President Zelenskyy and by the people of Ukraine, working also together and in agreement with President Putin,\" Mr. Trump said.\nTrump kicks off multilateral meeting with Zelenskyy and Europeans\nSeated around a large table in the White House's East Room, Mr. Trump kicked off the multilateral meeting with the world leaders minutes before 3 p.m., hailing a \"successful day\" up to this point.\n\"We've had a very successful day thus far, and important discussions as we work to end the killing and stop the war in Ukraine, we're all working toward the same goal — very simple goal — we want to stop the killing, get this settled,\" the president said.\nMr. Trump said he and Zelenskyy \"covered a lot of territory\" during their meeting, reiterating that he would call Putin after the meeting with the leaders.\n\"We're going to try and work out a trilat after that and see if we can get it finished, put this to sleep, because this is, not since the Second World War has there been anything like this,\" he said.\nTrump-Zelenskyy meeting concludes after an hour\nAfter roughly an hour, Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy's meeting has concluded. Mr. Trump, Zelenskyy and European leaders appeared for a \"family photo\" in the White House.\nMr. Trump did not make remarks to reporters, but could be seen talking with Zelenskyy as the leaders all walked out of Cross Hall.\nNext up is the multilateral meeting involving all of the leaders.\nWhat Trump and Zelenskyy's comments revealed about today's talks\nThe two presidents' comments at the top of the meeting laid out what each is hoping to accomplish in today's talks.\nFor Mr. Trump, he said he is pushing for consensus among the U.S., Ukraine and Europe regarding what an eventual peace deal to end the war in Ukraine might look like. He said his end goal is to make enough progress to be able to schedule a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and Putin where a final agreement could be reached.\nWhen it came to specifics, including the crucial issue of security guarantees for Ukraine to prevent another Russian invasion in the future, the president largely avoided taking a definitive position, saying the parties at the White House would work to hash out the details. He acknowledged that the U.S. would \"be involved\" to some degree in ensuring Ukraine's security, along with Europe.\n\"We're going to work with everybody, and we're going to make sure that if there's peace, the peace is going to stay long term. This is very long term. We're not talking about a two year peace and then we end up in this mess again,\" Mr. Trump said.\nZelenskyy said he is pushing for \"everything\" he can get from the U.S. in terms of a security arrangement, and said a \"strong Ukrainian army\" is crucial for ensuring the country's future. \"It's a lot about weapons and then people and training and intelligence,\" he said, as well as \"the big countries\" like the U.S. and \"a lot of our friends.\"\nMr. Trump did not take a position on whether Ukraine would have to cede territory to Russia, an idea that Zelenskyy has rejected in the past.\n\"We're going to have a lasting peace,\" Mr. Trump said in response to a question about territories.\nTrump says he'll call Putin after White House meetings\nMr. Trump said he'll be speaking with Putin today once his meetings with Zelenskyy and European leaders conclude.\n\"I just spoke to President Putin indirectly, and we're going to have a phone call right after these meetings today,\" the president told reporters.\nNext, there \"may or may not\" be a trilateral meeting with the U.S., Ukraine and Russia, he said.\nThe U.S. president said Putin is \"expecting my call when we're finished with this meeting.\"\nAfter saying he'll speak with Putin, the president concluded the Q&A with reporters to begin his meeting with Zelenskyy behind closed doors.\nZelenskyy lays out elements of security guarantees he needs in a peace deal\nZelenskyy, asked what security guarantees he needs from the U.S., responded, \"everything,\" before outlining two aspects of what he is seeking in an eventual peace deal.\nThe Ukrainian president said the picture includes a strong Ukrainian army, along with weapons, intelligence and training missions from allies and partners. He said that should be paired with cooperation from other countries, including the U.S. and \"a lot of our friends.\"\nMr. Trump said the European leaders \"want to give protection,\" adding that \"they feel very strongly about it.\"\n\"And we'll help them out with that,\" Mr. Trump said.\nTrump says \"I don't think you need a ceasefire\"\nMr. Trump said, \"I don't think you need a ceasefire,\" elaborating on the shift in his position following his meeting with Putin.\n\"I know that it might be good to have, but I can also understand, strategically, why one country or the other wouldn't want it,\" he added.\nFriday's meeting in Alaska failed to produce the halt in fighting that the president had previously sought, and the administration has pivoted to seeking a broader peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. The decision to abandon a ceasefire was at odds with the goals of the U.S. and European allies heading into the Alaska summit, and some analysts say the shift could give Putin more leverage at the negotiating table by ramping up strikes against Ukraine.\n\"I like the concept of a ceasefire for one reason, because you'd stop killing people immediately,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"But we can work a deal where we're working on a peace deal while they're fighting.\"\nThe president added that previous deals he has made have happened without a ceasefire.\nTrump compliments Zelenskyy's suit\nZelenskyy, who was criticized by Vance and conservatives in February for not wearing a suit to the White House, is wearing a military-style suit for his meeting with Mr. Trump.\nA reporter who questioned him about his outfit in the last meeting complimented him this time around: \"You look fabulous in that suit.\"\n\"I said the same thing. Isn't that nice? That's the one who attacked you last time. See, now he's a nice guy,\" Mr. Trump told Zelenskyy.\n\"I remember,\" Zelenskyy replied.\n\"But you are in the same suit,\" the Ukrainian leader told the reporter, prompting laughter. \"You see, I changed. You [have] not.\"\nElvira Gasanova, a designer behind the brand that produces Zelenskyy's clothing, told Politico that the outfit reflects both that he is a head of state at war, and an awareness of his environment.\n\"This time the President [Zelenskyy] will be in a suit, but the style still remains in a military key with the same symbolism: he is the Head of State, which is at war,\" Gasanova told Politico.\nTrump: \"The war is going to end\"\nMr. Trump, asked about the root causes of the war, which Putin has previously referenced, declared that \"the war is going to end.\"\n\"When it ends, I can't tell you,\" he added. \"But the war is going to end. And this gentleman wants it to end and Vladimir Putin wants it to end. I think the whole world is tired of it and we're going to get it ended.\"\nThe president touted ending six wars, saying, \"I thought this maybe would be the easiest one and it's not the easiest one. It's a tough one.\"\nTrump says U.S. will \"be involved\" in any security guarantee for Ukraine\nA reporter asked if any security guarantee for Ukraine would involve U.S. troops. Mr. Trump responded that the U.S. Mr. Trump responded that the U.S. would \"be involved.\"\n\"We'll let you know that maybe later today,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"We're meeting with seven great leaders of great countries also. And we'll be talking about that. They'll all be involved. There'll be a lot of, there'll be a lot of help, when it comes to security, there will be a lot of help. It's going to be good. They are a first line of defense because they're there, they're Europe. But we're going to help them out also. We'll be involved.\"\nTrump sees \"reasonable chance\" of ending the war at possible trilateral meeting with Putin\nMr. Trump said \"if everything works out today,\" the leaders would have a trilateral meeting with Putin, saying, \"I think there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that.\"\nAsked whether Monday's meeting would mark the end of the road on American support for Ukraine, Mr Trump said no, replying that \"it's never the end of the road.\"\n\"People are being killed and we want to stop that, so I would not say it's the end of the road, no,\" Mr. Trump added, acknowledging the deaths last week on both sides of the war.\nMr. Trump pointed blame at the Biden administration, saying \"this isn't my war, this is Joe Biden's war\" when asked whether Russia or Ukraine was in a better negotiating position.\nZelenskyy thanks Trump for his \"personal efforts\" to stop the killing\nZelenskyy offered brief remarks thanking Mr. Trump for his efforts to end the war, as well as first lady Melania Trump's efforts.\n\"Thank you very much for your efforts, personal efforts to stop the killings and stop this war,\" Zelenskyy said.\nZelenskyy also thanked the first lady for a letter she reportedly wrote to Putin, urging him to allow the children of Ukraine to grow up, and grow up in peace.\n\"She sent a letter to Putin about our children,\" Zelenskyy said.\nTrump kicks off bilateral meeting with Zelenskyy\nThe president kicked off his meeting in the Oval Office with Zelenskyy with brief remarks.\n\"It's an honor to have the president of Ukraine with us,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We've had a lot of good discussions, a lot of good talks. And I think progress is being made — very substantial progress — in many ways.\"\nThe president said \"there's a possibility\" that something could come out of the meeting with Putin, adding that \"today's meeting is very important.\"\nZelenskyy arrives at White House for meeting with Trump\nZelenskyy's motorcade arrived outside the West Wing of the White House just before 1:15 p.m. Mr. Trump greeted him as he emerged from a black SUV, shaking his hand and escorting him inside.\nAsked by a reporter what his message is to the people of Ukraine, Mr. Trump responded, \"We love them. We love them.\"\nZelenskyy is set to hold a bilateral meeting with Mr. Trump and other U.S. officials in the Oval Office first, before expanded meetings with European leaders later in the afternoon.\nZelenskyy met with European leaders Monday morning\nZelenskyy said in a post on X that he met with several of the European leaders Monday morning to get on the same page before heading to the White House.\n\"Together with the leaders of Finland, the United Kingdom, Italy, the European Commission, and the NATO Secretary General, we coordinated our positions ahead of the meeting with President Trump. Ukraine is ready for a real truce and for establishing a new security architecture. We need peace,\" he wrote, along with a video of him greeting the leaders outside the Ukrainian embassy in Washington.\nEuropean leaders arrive at the White House\nShortly after noon, European leaders began arriving on the South Lawn.\nThe order of arrival was:\n- NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte\n- Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission\n- U.K Prime Minister Keir Starmer\n- Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni\n- Finnish President Alexander Stubb\n- German Chancellor Friedrich Merz\n- French President Emmanuel Macron\nTheir motorcades passed by an honor guard of U.S. servicemembers holding flags along the driveway leading to the South Portico of the White House.\nThe president did not greet the leaders outside. Instead, Monica Crowley, the chief of protocol at the State Department, was on hand to welcome them. A red carpet outlined the path for the leaders from their vehicles into the White House.\nTrump on Ukraine war: \"I'm only here to stop it\"\nIn a post on Truth Social before the leaders arrived, the president took aim at critics who have questioned his approach to ending the war in Ukraine, saying the Wall Street Journal and others \"truly don't have a clue.\"\n\"I'm only here to stop it, not to prosecute it any further,\" he wrote. \"It would have NEVER happened if I was President. I know exactly what I'm doing, and I don't need the advice of people who have been working on all of these conflicts for years, and were never able to do a thing to stop them.\"\nHe continued: \"They are 'STUPID' people, with no common sense, intelligence, or understanding, and they only make the current R/U disaster more difficult to FIX. Despite all of my lightweight and very jealous critics, I'll get it done — I always do!!!\"\nRussian strikes on Ukraine continue overnight ahead of Trump-Zelenskyy meeting\nRussian attacks on Ukraine continued ahead of the meeting in Washington. An overnight wave of air strikes hit cities around the country, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa and Sumy, according to local media.\nUkrainian authorities said a drone attack on a residential area in the city of Kharkiv killed a toddler, a 16-year-old and five other people.\n\"Despite all of the diplomacy and peace efforts, Russia continues to kill civilians,\" Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrii Sybiha said in a social media post. \"Russia is a murderous war machine that Ukraine is holding back. And it must be stopped through transatlantic unity and pressure. Moscow must stop the killing in order to advance diplomacy.\"\n\"This was a demonstrative and cynical Russian strike. They are aware that a meeting is taking place today in Washington that will address the end of the war,\" Zelenskyy wrote on social media, adding that dozens more people, including children, had been injured in the attack on Kharkiv.\nThune says Senate \"stands ready\" to provide Trump with \"economic leverage\" in Russia negotiations\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune praised Mr. Trump ahead of the meeting with Zelenskyy in a post on X, saying the president \"should be commended for his dogged determination to bring peace to Ukraine and for his courage to engage with all parties in a way his predecessor refused to do.\"\nThune reiterated that the Senate is ready to provide the White House with \"any economic leverage needed to keep Russia at the table to negotiate a just and lasting peace in Ukraine\" in what appeared to be a nod to the bipartisan effort in Congress to impose new economic sanctions aimed at ramping up pressure on the Kremlin.\nFor months, the Senate has been pushing for the sanctions bill, which was introduced by GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham in April and has 84 cosponors, but Thune has so far deferred to the White House on timing.\nWhat happened the last time Zelenskyy visited the White House\nU.S. allies hope Monday's meeting will go better than Zelenskyy's memorable last visit to the White House in February. That meeting devolved into chaos, finger pointing and insults, prompting Zelenskyy's visit to be cut short.\nDuring the course of an Oval Office meeting, Mr. Trump threatened Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia or \"we're out,\" while Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of being \"disrespectful.\"\n\"You don't have the cards right now,\" Mr. Trump said in February, as Zelenskyy interjected and disagreed. \"With us, you start having cards. Right now, you don't have your playing cards, your playing cards — you're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III.\"\n\"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting? No, in this entire meeting, have you said 'thank you?'\" Vance said to Zelenskyy.\nZelenskyy's voice remained largely measured, while Vance and Mr. Trump raised theirs. Amid the chaos, a reporter asked — what if Russia violates a ceasefire?\n\"What if anything?\" Mr. Trump responded. \"What if a bomb drops on your head right now? OK?\"\nZelenskyy says Russia \"can only be forced into peace through strength,\" and Trump \"has that strength\"\nToday's meeting at the White House with Ukraine and other European nations is \"the first meeting in such a format, and it is very serious,\" Zelenskyy wrote on X.\nHe thanked Keith Kellogg, the special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, for a meeting before the gathering at the White House, posting a video that showed a warm greeting between the two and their discussions.\n\"We discussed the battlefield situation and our strong diplomatic capabilities — Ukraine's and all of Europe's together with America,\" Zelenskyy said in his post.\nHe arrived in Washington on Sunday.\nThe Ukrainian president said that Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities continued overnight, and two children were among those killed.\n\"People were simply sleeping when the Russian army launched strikes on the cities,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\"Russia can only be forced into peace through strength, and President Trump has that strength,\" he wrote. \"We have to do everything right to make peace happen. Thank you!\"\nHere are the European leaders accompanying Zelenskyy to Washington\nOn Sunday, a slew of European leaders announced they would be accompanying Zelenskyy on his trip to Washington, including:\n- EU Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen\n- NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte\n- British Prime Minister Keir Starmer\n- German Chancellor Friedrich Merz\n- French President Emannuel Macron\n- Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni\n- Finnish President Alexander Stubb\nMr. Trump posted on Truth Social on Monday morning that \"We have never had so many European Leaders here at one time. A great honor for America!!! Lets see what the results will be???\"\nWhat time is the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting?\nMr. Trump will meet with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office before holding a larger meeting with participating European leaders, with both events partly open to cameras.\nReporters are expected to be ushered into the beginning of Mr. Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy at 1:15 p.m., as well as part of the meeting with European leaders at 3 p.m. Those times are subject to change, as meetings may run long. There is no press conference scheduled with Mr. Trump and any European leaders.\nOther U.S. officials will be in the Oval Office for the meeting with Zelenskyy, including Vice President JD Vance, Rubio, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg.\nHere's the full schedule, released by the White House:\n- Noon: European leaders arrive\n- 1 p.m.: Mr. Trump greets Zelenskyy\n- 1:15 p.m.: Bilateral meeting between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office\n- 2:15 p.m.: Mr. Trump greets European leaders in the State Dining Room\n- 2:30 p.m.: Mr. Trump and European leaders take a \"family photo\"\n- 3 p.m.: Mr. Trump holds a multilateral meeting with European leaders in the East Room\nRubio says Putin meeting resulted in \"enough movement\" for Zelenskyy meeting\nRubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that although there wasn't a \"lot of progress\" in the Alaska summit on Friday, it resulted in \"enough movement\" to justify Monday's talks.\n\"If not, we wouldn't be having Zelenskyy flying all the way over here,\" Rubio said. \"We wouldn't be having all the Europeans coming all the way over here. Now understand, and take with a grain of salt, I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"\nOn the possibility of further sanctions on Russia, such as the secondary sanctions Mr. Trump has threatened to impose, Rubio said punishing Russia now would prompt Moscow to disengage.\n\"The moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks. You've basically locked in at least another year to year and a half of war and death and destruction,\" Rubio said. \"We may unfortunately wind up there, but we don't want to wind up there. We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again.\"\nRubio said \"both sides\" are going to have to make concessions. \"That's how these deals are made, whether we like it or not,\" he told Brennan.\nRead more here.\nPutin agreed to let U.S., Europe offer NATO-style protections for Ukraine, Witkoff says\nPutin agreed at the Alaska summit to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday.\n\"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,\" he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" He added that it \"was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that\" and called it \"game-changing.\"\nArticle 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members.\nWitkoff, who had joined Rubio for the talks at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his long-standing objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership.\nRead more here.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 21:33:35 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/politics"}

In a post on Truth Social, the president said the meeting with Putin \"went very well,\" adding that the same was true of a phone call with Zelenskyy and various European leaders after the fact.\n\"President Zelenskyy will be coming to D.C., the Oval Office, on Monday afternoon,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin.\"\nEuropean and NATO leaders are expected to accompany Zelenskyy to Washington, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said she was joining at \"the request of President Zelenskyy.\"\nThough the nearly three-hour-long meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents on Friday failed to produce the ceasefire that Mr. Trump had sought, the administration has since pivoted to seeking a broader peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. The decision to abandon a ceasefire was at odds with the goals of the U.S. and European allies heading into the summit, and some analysts say the shift could give Putin more leverage at the negotiating table.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that \"both sides are going to have to make concessions\" to get there.\n\"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again,\" Rubio said, noting that doing so would require both sides \"to give.\"\nThe secretary of state, who attended Friday's summit meeting with Putin, indicated that enough progress was made to sit down with Zelenskyy to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"\nRubio said the details of security guarantees for Ukraine, the question of territories and the issue of rebuilding the country still need to be discussed and \"require some more specificity.\"\nMeanwhile, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday that Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and Europe to offer \"game-changing\" security guarantees, including a possible arrangement in which the allies provide \"Article 5-like protection\" to Ukraine. Article 5 of the NATO charter says an attack on one member nation is considered an attack against all. Putin has been vehemently opposed to Ukraine joining NATO, but a similar security guarantee outside the framework of the alliance might reassure Kyiv that Russia would be deterred from attacking in the future.\nWitkoff noted that the administration intends to discuss a possible land swap at Monday's meeting.\n\"We're not waiting a week for a meeting with Zelenskyy and the European leaders,\" Witkoff said. \"We are intent on trying to hammer out a peace deal that ends the fighting permanently, very, very quickly. Quicker than a ceasefire.\"\nIn a Truth Social post Sunday night, Mr. Trump said, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\" Mr. Trump was referring to Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea in early 2014.\nIn a post on X, Zelenskyy said he'd arrived in Washington for the talks and insisted, \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace.\"\nAhead of Monday's meeting, Russian attacks on Ukraine continued, with a wave of air strikes hitting cities around the country, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa and Sumy, CBS News partner network BBC News reported. Ukrainian authorities said a drone attack on a residential area in the city of Kharkiv overnight killed a toddler, a 16-year-old and five other people.\n\"Despite all of the diplomacy and peace efforts, Russia continues to kill civilians,\" Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrii Sybiha said in a social media post. \"Russia is a murderous war machine that Ukraine is holding back.

Moscow must stop the killing in order to advance diplomacy.\"\nRussian state media reported Ukraine had carried out a drone attack in Donetsk, overnight which killed a 62-year-old woman.\nMonday's meeting between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy comes months after a contentious February Oval Office meeting between the two leaders and Vice President JD Vance exposed a severe rift, with tensions erupting on camera as Vance accused Zelenskyy of ingratitude. In recent months, Mr. Trump's posture appeared to shift as he expressed frustration with Putin over Russia's ongoing drone and missile attacks, including what Ukraine described as the largest such attacks since the invasion began in February 2022.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:52:00 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/politics"}
{"title": "William Barr investigated Epstein's death. Now Congress has questions.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-william-barr-deposition-congress/", "text": "As attorney general, William Barr personally investigated Jeffrey Epstein's death. Now Congress has questions.\nIn the hours after convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein died in a Manhattan detention cell, then-U.S. Attorney General William Barr pledged to intervene personally to lead the investigation into Epstein's death.\nAmong the first to arrive at the Metropolitan Correctional Center soon after Epstein's death in August 2019 were members of Barr's senior staff. The visit to the federal detention center by senior members of the attorney general's staff was highly unusual, a source who was there at the time and witnessed the visit told CBS News. But so was the death in custody of such a controversial figure.\nOne source didn't recall ever seeing members of the attorney general's senior staff investigate an inmate death in more than 20 years. Another source, involved in the investigation, said such senior visits were rare, and if they occurred, usually pertained to promoting correctional programs, not investigating inmate deaths.\nBarr's involvement extended to a personal review of the approximately 11 hours of jail surveillance footage from the night of Epstein's death. He said in an interview with The Associated Press three months later that it showed no one had entered the area where Epstein was housed, and he concurred with the conclusion of the medical examiner: Epstein had died by suicide.\nLast month, after the FBI made that video public, an analysis by CBS News identified inconsistencies between Barr's description of the video and what it actually showed — including whether it really proves no one else entered the cell block.\nNow, Barr is scheduled to appear on Monday on Capitol Hill, where he will be questioned behind closed doors by members of Congress conducting a review of the Epstein matter.\nSources familiar with the oversight committee's plans tell CBS News they will be asking questions about Barr's involvement in the death investigation.\nCBS News has reached out to Barr for comment.\nThe deposition of Barr, who served two Republican presidents as U.S. attorney general, comes as Epstein's 2019 death in federal custody has come under renewed, intense public and governmental scrutiny. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, issued several deposition subpoenas in August, including to Barr, former President Bill Clinton, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and former FBI Director James Comey.\nBarr, a veteran of the George H.W. Bush administration who was serving his second stint as head of the Justice Department under President Trump at the time, said he was \"appalled\" when Epstein was found dead on Aug. 10, 2019, in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center.\nEpstein was being held at the now temporarily shuttered federal detention center after being arrested on sex trafficking charges that could have carried a life sentence. His arrest came after years of questions surrounding an earlier controversial prosecutorial deal in Florida where he pleaded to state prostitution charges and a federal felony case was dropped.\nScrutiny around that deal, and his subsequent death, has fueled years of suspicions and conspiracy theories. The furor also has enveloped Epstein's vast network of powerful former friends, including Mr. Trump and former President Clinton, who have disavowed him and have not been accused of wrongdoing.\nCampaign promises to \"declassify\" files related to Epstein, made by Mr. Trump and his surrogates in 2024, have led to months of political headaches for the White House.\nThe release last month of what the Justice Department called \"raw\" surveillance video from near Epstein's cell block, rather than settling questions about the night he died, raised new ones. The analysis by CBS News flagged multiple inconsistencies between the video and the 2023 report released by the Justice Department's Inspector General on Epstein's death.\nAs Congress steps up its inquiry, Barr is the first person scheduled to be deposed by the committee.\nBarr has acknowledged what he called \"a perfect storm of screw-ups\" at the jail, but said his \"personal review\" of surveillance footage supported the conclusion that Epstein had died by suicide.\nAs attorney general, Barr faced calls to recuse himself from Epstein's criminal case because he had previously worked for a law firm, Kirkland and Ellis, that had represented Epstein. (Their paths also indirectly crossed decades earlier, in the early 1970s, when Epstein was hired to teach at an elite private school in New York City where Barr's father was the headmaster.)\nHere is a look at some unanswered questions Barr may be asked based on a review of the 2023 DOJ inspector general's report, documents released by the Bureau of Prisons, and the surveillance video.\nQuestions for Barr about Jeffrey Epstein death investigation\nDid the video Barr reviewed from MCC have a missing minute?\nBefore the supposedly \"raw\" surveillance video was released last month, showing about 11 hours of footage from the night Epstein died, Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters that one minute right before midnight was missing was because \"every night is reset, so every night should have the same missing minute,\" from 11:59 p.m. to midnight.\nThat was later disputed by a government source familiar with the investigation in an interview with CBS News in July. Another high-level government source said the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General are in possession of full unedited copies of the video, and those copies do not have a missing minute. Why the FBI released the video with that small segment missing is unclear, and it is not known if anything notable occurred during that minute.\nDoes Barr still believe that \"between the time Epstein was locked in his cell at 7:49 p.m. on the night of August 9 and the time he was discovered the next morning at 6:30 a.m., no one entered his tier\"?\nBarr made that statement in 2019, but the CBS News video analysis indicates the view from the jail camera does not conclusively prove no one entered Epstein's cell block. A staircase leading to Epstein's cell block is almost entirely out of view from the camera, with just a small sliver of stairs visible. From the video released publicly, experts told CBS News it is impossible to determine whether anyone entered the jail unit and accessed the staircase without being captured on the recording.\nJust before 10:40 p.m., the video shows a glimpse of an orange shape moving up the stairs leading to Epstein's tier. The inspector general's report said that it was a jail staffer bringing orange linens or inmate clothing up the stairs. Some video forensic experts who reviewed that footage at the request of CBS News said they were skeptical about that interpretation. They suggested the shape could be a person dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit climbing the stairs. Inmates were typically confined to their cells late at night.\nWhat did the DOJ do to investigate theories other than suicide?\nNo evidence has surfaced suggesting that anyone else was involved in Epstein's death. He had been placed on suicide watch after an apparent attempt to hang himself a month before, and remained under heightened observation. However, there do remain significant unanswered questions about his death, some of which were raised in a \"60 Minutes\" report in 2020 looking at the medical evidence. Those included questions relating to the autopsy.\nA private autopsy commissioned by Epstein's family, conducted alongside the official examination by the medical examiner, raised concerns about the angle of the ligature marks on his neck and the presence of broken neck bones, findings that suggested a level of force greater than typically associated with a hanging. The medical examiner disputed that, saying such fractures can occur in suicides.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:35:56 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/politics"}

{"title": "At least 5 states are deploying National Guard troops to D.C.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/west-virginia-to-deploy-hundreds-of-national-guard-troops-to-d-c/", "text": "At least 5 states are deploying National Guard troops to D.C.\nAt least five Republican-led states have moved to deploy members of their National Guard forces to the nation's capital as part of the Trump administration's effort to overhaul policing in Washington, D.C., through a federal crackdown on crime and homelessness.\nThe governors of Mississippi and Louisiana on Monday announced they would be sending 200 and 135 Guard troops, respectively. On Saturday, West Virginia said it was deploying between 300 to 400 Guard troops, while South Carolina pledged 200 and Ohio said it would send 150 in the coming days.\nTennessee has also provided 160 Guard troops, according to The Associated Press. The Tennessee National Guard has been deployed \"to assist with monument security, community safety patrols, protecting federal facilities, and traffic control,\" a spokesperson for Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee told AP.\nThe move comes as federal agents and National Guard troops have begun to appear across the heavily Democratic city after President Trump's executive order last week, federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 D.C. National Guard troops.\nWest Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced Saturday that he was sending a contingent of 300 to 400 Guard troops to Washington, while South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster authorized the deployment of 200 of his state's National Guardsmen. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said his state would send 150 military police at the request of the Defense Department.\n\"West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation's capital,\" Morrisey said.\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry wrote Monday on social media: \"I am proud to support this mission to return safety and sanity to Washington DC and cities all across our country, including right here in Louisiana.\"\nMississippi Gov. Tate Reeves wrote on X that \"crime is out of control\" in Washington, D.C., adding: \"I know the brave men and women of our National Guard will do an excellent job enhancing public safety and supporting law enforcement.\"\nMaj. Gen. James Seward, West Virginia's adjutant general, said in a statement that members of the state's National Guard \"stand ready to support our partners in the National Capital Region,\" and that the troops' \"unique capabilities and preparedness make it an invaluable partner in this important undertaking.\"\nGov. Phil Scott, a Republican from Vermont, declined on Friday to send the state's National Guard troops to the nation's capital. Scott's chief of staff, Jason Gibbs, told Vermont Public that while public safety is a \"legitimate concern\" in cities across the country, \"the governor just does not support utilizing the guard for this purpose, and does not view the enforcement of domestic law as proper use of the National Guard.\"\nThe activations suggest the Trump administration sees the need for additional manpower after the president personally played down the need for Washington to hire more police officers.\nBy adding outside troops to join the existing National Guard deployment and federal law enforcement officers temporarily assigned to Washington, Mr. Trump is exercising even tighter control over the city. It's a power play that the president has justified as an emergency response to crime and homelessness, even though district officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump's first term in office.\nA White House official told CBS News on Saturday that National Guard members deployed to D.C. \"may be armed,\" but that they would not make arrests. This was a reversal from earlier in the week, when a Defense Department official told CBS News that deployed Guard members would not be armed at the request of local law enforcement partners. The official also said at the time they would not have weapons in their vehicles.\n\"The National Guard is not making arrests at this time – they may be armed, consistent with their mission and training, to protect federal assets, provide a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deter violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence,\" the White House official said Saturday.\nA protest against Mr. Trump's intervention drew scores to Dupont Circle on Saturday afternoon before a march to the White House, about 1.5 miles away. Demonstrators assembled behind a banner that said \"No fascist takeover of D.C.,\" and some in the crowd held signs that said \"No military occupation.\" Mr. Trump was at his Virginia golf club after Friday's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.\nFederal agents have appeared in some of the city's most highly trafficked neighborhoods, garnering a mix of praise, pushback and alarm from local residents and leaders across the country.\nCity leaders, who are obliged to cooperate with the president's order under the federal laws that direct the district's local governance, have sought to work with the administration, though they have bristled at the scope of the president's takeover.\nOn Friday, the administration reversed course on an order that aimed to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as an \"emergency police commissioner\" after the district's top lawyer sued to contest. After Friday's court hearing, Attorney General Pam Bond issued a memo that directed the Metropolitan Police Department to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement regardless of any city law.\nDistrict officials say they are evaluating how to best comply.\nIn his order last week, Mr. Trump declared an emergency due to the \"city government's failure to maintain public order.\" He said that impeded the \"federal government's ability to operate efficiently to address the nation's broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence.\"\nIn a letter to city residents, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, wrote that \"our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now.\" She added that if Washingtonians stick together, \"we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy — even when we don't have full access to it.\"", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 19:33:40 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/politics"}

The Democrats have until now remained out of the state to deny Texas' Republican Gov. Greg Abbott a quorum, temporarily derailing a special legislative session that the governor called to reshape the state's congressional maps.\nThe GOP-led redistricting effort would create five more Republican-leaning House seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. Republicans currently have a narrow majority in the House. Historically, the party that controls the White House typically loses ground in midterm elections. States usually redraw districts each decade to reflect population shifts after the decennial census.\nAfter successfully denying Texas Republicans a quorum multiple times in recent weeks, Democrats notched a small victory when the GOP wrapped the initial special session. With a new special session gaveled in on Friday, the Democrats have begun returning. Some are already in Texas, and the caucus is working on a count to tell whether the chamber will have a quorum Monday, the sources told CBS News.\nGOP officials in the state have threatened to arrest the lawmakers to compel their appearance at the state Capitol, and one Republican senator enlisted the help of the FBI to track down the legislators.\nThe Democrats' return comes after they saw another victory with a push by California Democrats to combat the GOP advantage. Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom formally announced a redistricting plan which, under California law, would require a special election. The California governor said the effort is happening \"in reaction to a president of the United States that called a sitting governor of the state of Texas and said 'find me five seats.'\"\n\"I know they say don't mess with Texas,\" Newsom said. \"Well, don't mess with the great Golden State.\"", "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 14:41:13 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/politics"}

The awkward conclusion to Friday's summit yielded no formal agreement, with Vladimir Putin still insisting that Ukraine turn over the lands seized by Russia in the war, plus additional territory, something that President Zelenskyy continues to refuse.\nWe begin with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who attended those talks in Anchorage.\nGood morning to you, Mr. Secretary.\nMARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Good morning. Thank you.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin did not give President Trump the cease- fire he sought. And now Putin says the root causes of the conflict have to be resolved in a peace agreement.\nIsn't the root cause the fact that Russia invaded in the first place?\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, ultimately, yes.\nBut, I mean, what he means by root causes is this long historical complaints that we've heard repeatedly. This is not a new argument. He's been making this for a long time. And it's the argument that it's Western encroachment. I don't want to get into – it's just so long.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But the bottom line is that all of – you know, we're not going to focus on all of that stuff. We're going to focus on this, are they going to stop fighting or not, and what it's going to take to stop the fighting.\nAnd what it's going to take to stop the fighting, if we're being honest and serious here, is, both sides are going to have to give, and both sides should expect to get something from this. And that's a very difficult thing to do. It's very difficult, because Ukraine obviously feels, you know, harmed, and rightfully so, because they were invaded, and the Russian side, because they feel like they have got momentum in the battlefield, and frankly, don't care, don't seem to care very much about how many Russian soldiers die in this endeavor.\nThey just churn through it. So I think what the president deserves a lot of credit for is the amount of time and energy that his administration is placing on reaching a peace agreement for a war that's not a war that started under him. It's half – you know, it's on the other side of the world.\nThat said, I mean, it's relevant to us. But there are a lot of other issues he could be focused on.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: So, tomorrow, we'll be meeting with President Zelenskyy. We'll be meeting with European leaders. We just met with Putin. He's dedicated a lot of time and energy because he has made it a priority of his administration to stop or end war, stop wars or prevent them.\nAnd, right now, this is the biggest war going on in the world. It's the biggest war in Europe since World War II. We're going to continue to do everything we can to reach an agreement that ends the dying and the killing and the suffering that's going on right now.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\nYou know this well, how long these kind of diplomatic negotiations often take. President Trump was telling European leaders what was discussed was Putin demanding control of Donetsk, a region in the east that his forces do not fully hold. And the U.K. estimates that taking that full area could be as long as another four years.\nPutin also is demanding Russian be an official language in Ukraine and something regarding Russian Orthodox churches. Did the U.S. accept all of what Putin laid out at that table?\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The United States is not in a position to accept anything or reject anything, because, ultimately, it's up to the Ukrainians. They're the ones that Russia has to make peace with, and Ukraine with Russia.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president said he did come to some agreements.\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's up to the Ukrainians to make these conditions.\nWell, the agreements were that we were going to try to do things like, for example, get a leader – a leaders meeting. We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war.\nNow, there were some concepts and ideas discussed that we know the Ukrainians could be very supportive of in that meeting. I don't think it's – we're not going to negotiate this in the media. I understand that everybody wants to know what happened.\nBut, ultimately, there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs, that are potentials for progress. We'll be discussing that more in depth tomorrow with our European allies, with the Ukrainians that are coming over. We'll be discussing all of these things, because, ultimately, we do need to find areas where we're making progress and try to begin to narrow the gap between the two sides.\nBut there's a reason why this war has been going on for 3.5 years. And that is, when it comes to the big issues here, there are still some big differences between both sides. Let's see how much progress we can continue to make. It's – it's – it's not been easy, but it's something the president has made a priority, peace.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And he deserves a lot of credit for that.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, ultimately, if – if Vladimir Putin is going to be offered land that he has not seized yet, but negotiates his way into, doesn't this set a dangerous precedent that the United States now accepts this concept that it is OK to seize land by force?\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, Putin has already seized land by force, and that, in and of itself, is not a positive precedent. This whole war is a negative president – precedent.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you demanding withdrawal?\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, again, here's the – in order to have a deal here to end – to reach the end of this conflict, both sides are going to have to make concessions. That's just a fact.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But does that mean accepting…\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: In any negotiation, if…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … where Russian forces are now?\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, no, but, if – but this is not about acceptance. This is about what Ukraine can accept and what Russia can accept. They both have to accept it. Otherwise, there won't be a peace deal, OK?\nIf there aren't concessions, if one side gets everything they want, that's called surrender. That's called the end of the war through surrender. And that's not what we're close to doing, because neither side here is on the verge of surrender or anything close to it.\nSo, in order for there to be a peace deal – this is just a fact. We may not like it, it may not be pleasant, it may be distasteful, but in order for there to be an end of the war, there are things Russia wants that it cannot get, and there are things Ukraine wants that it's not going to get.\nBoth sides are going to have to give up something in order to get to the table in order to make this happen. That's – that's just the way it is. And, I mean, the sooner we accept that, that's the reality.\nNow, what those things are is going to be up to both sides. There's no conditions that can be imposed on Ukraine. They're going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too. And so, for example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to have – to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security.\nThat's not an unreasonable request. That's something that needs to be worked on. Territories will have to be discussed. It's just a fact. And there are things that maybe Russia is holding now that they're going to have to give up. Who knows?\nThe point is, we need to create a scenario where that becomes possible. And that's why this has been so hard, because neither side, up to now, has been willing to give on some of these things. But we'll see if that's possible. It may not be, but we're going to try, and we're going to do everything we can to try to achieve a peace.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I understand you – you can't get into specifics in a public conversation, but we're looking at Russian troops and strikes intensifying. Did you hear anything from Vladimir Putin that indicated he is willing to make a single concession?\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think there are a couple. I mean, there were not enough for Ukraine. If not, we would be announcing a peace deal this morning, right?\nBut – but, certainly, there are some things we notice, changes. There are some changes that I think are possible. I think there's some concepts that were discussed that could potentially lead to something. But, again, all these things have to be verifiable. We – it isn't real until it's real.\nI mean, you – one thing is what you say you might be willing to consider. Another thing is your willingness to do it. And it always becomes a tradeoff in all of this. But you talk about the intensifying strikes on the Russian side. Yes, I mean, they're a full-time war machine. I mean, that's what's happening. The Russian economy has basically been turned into a full-time wartime economy.\nThey have a lot of people. It's a big country. It's not just large geographically. It has huge populations. It continues to churn through people. You know, they lost – 20,000 Russian soldiers were killed last month in July in this war. That just tells you the price they're willing to pay.\nNot saying any of this is admirable. I'm saying that this is the reality of the war that we're facing. It's become attrition in some ways. It's a meat grinder, and they just have more meat to grind.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about the security bit you just mentioned there, because Italy's prime minister says that President Trump revived the idea of security guarantees inspired by NATO's Article 5 and a collective security clause that would involve the United States.\nHow does that work?\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I mean…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are these U.S. troops? Are these U.S. monitors?\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, that's what we're going to be working on. Well, that's what we're going to be working on.\nThat's why – that's one of the reasons why, you know, I talked yesterday to all the national security advisers, a bunch of them from the different European countries. There are European leaders coming here tomorrow, heads of state coming tomorrow, along with President Zelenskyy, to discuss this in more detail.\nI mean, the constructs of something like this needs to be built out. Once thing – it's – a concept is one thing. The reality, you know, how it's built and how it would work, is another. But those are the kinds of talks that we're going to be having with them, along with some of the other issues that are at play.\nBut that – that is one of the – if you were to break this thing down, I mean, there are – obviously, there needs to be an agreement on territories and where the lines are going to be drawn. That's not going to be very easy. That's going to be tough. I think there has to be some discussion about security guarantees for Ukraine, because they don't want this war to – none of us want to see this war in the future.\nThey're a sovereign country. They have a right to have security agreements with other countries and security alliances with other countries. And then there's the whole issue of reconstruction.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Including United States?\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: How do you rebuild the country?\nWell, potentially. Like I said, that's what we're going to be having a conversation about, and that's what we're going to be meeting – that's why they're all coming here tomorrow. And that's why we've been talking on the phone for the last 48 hours with them.\nAnd even leading up to it, throughout the week, there were various meetings just to sort of build out some of these ideas. So all of these right now are ideas. They are concepts that require some more specificity. We'll need to work with our partners to see what that looks like.\nAnd I think that's an area where potential progress is real, but that alone won't be enough. There's a bunch of other things that have to be worked through here.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, Russia claims it has rescued 700,000 children. I know you know that the warrant out for Vladimir Putin's arrest is for the state-sponsored abduction of kids.\nI have seen estimates there are something like 30,000 Ukrainian children who have been abducted. Is the United States demanding, or at least, even just as a statement of goodwill here, that Russia return these children?\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I mean, we've repeatedly raised that issue on – in every forum possible.\nAnd those have also been, by the way, topics of discussion, not just in our meetings with the Ukrainians, but in the negotiations and talks that were going on between Ukraine and Russia at the technical level. These talks were going on in Turkey, as an example, Turkey, over the last few months.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, and nothing so far from the Russians.\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's been a topic of discussion as well.\nWell, it's unfortunate. Children should be returned to their families. We - - on that position, I don't think there's any ambiguity on our side. And they shouldn't even be, you know, a bargaining chip in regards to a broader negotiation.\nBut it's just one more element of how tragic this war is. After 3.5 years, this war is getting worse. It's not getting better. You've made the point about the uptick in strikes. This is a war. It's going to get worse. It's not going to get better. And that's why the president is investing so much time in bringing this to an end.\nAnd, by the way, everyone is begging us to be involved in this.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The Europeans want us involved. The Ukrainians want us involved. Obviously, the Russians want us involved, because the president is the only leader in the world – if this is possible, he's the only one that can help make it happen.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he's got the leverage over Vladimir Putin if he wanted to crush his economy or at least do more damage to it.\nBut you have held off on those secondary sanctions. President Trump told Fox News his advice to President Zelenskyy is: \"Make a deal. Russia's a very big power and they're not.\"\nYou know there is concern from the Europeans that President Zelenskyy is going to be bullied into signing something away. That's why you have these European leaders coming as back up tomorrow. Can you reassure them?\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, it isn't. That's not why they're coming as back – that's not true. No, but that's not – why would – that's not true.\nThey're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming – in fact, they're coming here tomorrow because…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that February Oval Office meeting in front of television cameras, where President Zelenskyy was dressed down…\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Do you know how many meetings we've had since then?\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, no, I know. And I was just up in Alaska…\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, but we've had a bunch of meetings since then.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … watching the one with Vladimir Putin, where a red carpet was rolled out for the Russian leader.\nIt was very different.\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, but with Zelenskyy – we've had more meetings - - we've had – we've had – we've had one meeting with Putin and like a dozen meetings with Zelenskyy.\nSo, that – but that's not true. They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're coming here tomorrow because we've been working with the Europeans. We talked to them last week. There were meetings in the U.K. over the following – the previous weekend.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And they said President Trump was going to demand a cease-fire.\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The president's talked to these leaders as early as Thursday.\nNo, no, but you said that they're coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming here tomorrow – this is such a stupid media narrative that they're coming here tomorrow because the – Trump is going to bully Zelenskyy into a bad deal.\nWe've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff. They're coming here tomorrow because they chose to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the president told those European leaders last week that he wanted a cease-fire. The president went on television, said he would walk out of the meeting if Vladimir Putin didn't agree with on – he said there would be severe consequences if he didn't agree to one. He said he'd walk out in two minutes.\nHe spent three hours talking to Vladimir Putin, and he did not get one. So, there's some mixed messages.\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Because, obviously, something – things happened during that meeting.\nWell, because obviously things – look, our goal here is not to stage some production, for the world to say, oh, how dramatic. He walked out. Our goal here is to have a peace agreement, to end this war, OK? And, obviously, we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress, not a lot of progress, but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase.\nIf not, we wouldn't be having Zelenskyy flying all the way over here. We wouldn't be having all the Europeans coming all the way over here. Now, understand, and take with a grain of salt, I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\nYou talk about the sanctions. Look, at the end of the day, if peace is not going to be possible here, and this is just going to continue on as a war, people will continue to die by the thousands. The president has that option to then come in and impose new sanctions.\nBut if he did this now – the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks. You've basically locked in at least another year to year-and-a-half of war and death and destruction. We may unfortunately wind up there, but we don't want to wind up there.\nWe want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war, so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here. We're going to do everything possible to make that happen, if it's doable.\nIt will require both sides to make concessions. It will require both sides to get things they're asking for. That's how these deals are made, whether we like it or not.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, quickly, why did the State Department just announce that they're halting visitor visas for all Gazans coming here for medical aid? Why would some of these kids, for example, who are coming to hospitals for treatment be a threat?\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, it's not just kids. It's a bunch of adults that are accompanying them.\nSecond, we had outreach from multiple congressional offices asking questions about it. And so we're going to reevaluate how those visas are being granted, not just to the children, but how those visas are being granted to the people who are accompanying them, and, by the way, to some of the organizations that are facilitating it.\nThere is evidence been presented to us by numerous congressional offices that some of the organizations bragging about and involved in acquiring these visas have strong links to terrorist groups like Hamas. And so we are not going to be in partnership with groups that are friendly with Hamas.\nSo we need to – we're going to pause those visas. There was just a small number of them issued to children, but they come with adults accompanying them, obviously. And we are going to pause this program and reevaluate how those visas are being vetted and what relationship, if any, has there been by these organizations to the – to the process of acquiring those visas.\nWe're not going to be in partnership with groups that have links or sympathies towards Hamas.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of State Marco Rubio, we have to leave it there for this morning. Thank you for joining us.\nSECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Thank you.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crow.\nGood to see you in person.\nREPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW (D-Colorado): Good morning.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Before we start talking about Ukraine, I want to pick up on something, since you sit on the Intelligence Committee.\nThe secretary of state just said that lawmakers had come to the Trump administration with information that they have been granting visas to individuals with ties to Hamas or with organizations with ties to Hamas. That's a pretty stunning accusation. Israel controls who enters and exits Gaza.\nREPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The United States screens all visas. So is there really a blind spot that you are aware of?\nREPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I'm not aware of that. But, if that's true, actually, that is concerning. That would be a problem. I mean, Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization. They should not be traveling anywhere. So, if that's happening, it should be stopped immediately. And the Intelligence Committee has a role to play in that.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the Intelligence Committee wasn't behind the information presented to the secretary of state?\nREPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I have not been briefed on that. I have no information about it.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\nOn Ukraine, you know that the U.S. intelligence assessment is that the battlefield is turning in Russia's favor, despite the fact that Putin has to rely on Iran and North Korea to keep this thing going. If neither President Biden nor President Trump were ever willing to commit troops, doesn't the secretary have a point that it has to be hammered out at the negotiating table?\nREPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: You know, this absolutely will end at a negotiating table, like most conflicts will.\nBut what happened on Friday was a historic embarrassment for the United States. There's no other way to put it, right? You listen to what Marco Rubio and the president have said. They keep on saying they're dedicating time. They're making it a priority. They're focusing their attention on it.\nIn any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary. What is making Vladimir Putin tick in this instance? Vladimir Putin does not care about the amount of time that we're nego – we're allocating to this, does not care about a B-2 bomber flyover, does not care about a lineup of F-22 fighters rolled out.\nHe doesn't care about any of that. What Vladimir Putin cares about is basically three things. He cares about economic pressure in the form of sanctions. He cares about political, diplomatic isolation, being a pariah state. And he cares about military defeat. Those are the three things that will end this conflict, if he feels pressure on all of those three fronts.\nAnd this administration continues to be unwilling to do anything to assert pressure in any of those three areas.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they have put in place some secondary sanctions, at least on India here. And they haven't pulled back. They would need Congress to help them repeal a lot of these sanctions.\nBut bigger picture, in hindsight, do you think the United States to date has been too hesitant to actually help Ukraine win this war? President Obama did not send offensive weapons to Ukraine. President Biden was criticized for being perhaps too slow in delivery of certain weapons.\nREPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes, there's no doubt.\nAs you know, I was one of the members of Congress that on a bipartisan basis pushed really hard in the first two years of this war under the Biden administration to do more, to do more quicker. And I was concerned that we were doing just enough to prevent Ukraine from losing and not doing enough to help them win.\nAnd I do believe that, had we done more, and we had done – done it faster, and that we were willing to be more aggressive in providing aid and support for Ukraine, then they would be in a different position on the battlefield today.\nBut compare that to what this administration has done, which has relieved almost all pressure. Like, look at what happened on Friday.\nU.S. military personnel in uniform literally were on their hands and knees rolling out a red carpet for the most murderous dictator of the 21st century, somebody who has kidnapped and is holding prisoner tens of thousands of Ukrainian children, somebody who started this whole war, right?\nThis both-sides-ism that the administration is engaging in, that both sides need to come to the table and negotiate, Ukraine is the victim. They are the victim. They didn't start this war. Russia did. And somehow we keep on acting like Vladimir Putin deserves to be brought out into the open like any other head of state.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nREPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: This is a historic embarrassment and defeat for U.S. foreign policy.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You have served this country in uniform.\nI wonder, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, how comfortable you would be with the United States giving this, whatever the Article 5- like security guarantee would look like. Is that something you should see boots on the ground to do?\nREPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I don't think boots on the ground would be the way to go, but, certainly, the United States has assets and capability that I think are essential to any type of security guarantee.\nI think Europe has to come forward with the forward presence of military, but we can provide intelligence. We can provide economic support, diplomatic support. One of the most important things that we can do right now is actually seize Russian assets. This would be huge. This would be a game-changing thing that would put pressure on Vladimir Putin and actually create security guarantees and reconstruction for Ukraine.\nThere's over $150 billion of seized Russian assets. And the United States could lead a coalition to seize that money…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nREPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: … allocate it towards reconstruction, allocate it towards security, allocate it towards the building of a Ukrainian military that could actually resist Russia going forward. But this administration is unwilling to do it.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The last administration was too.\nREPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: That's right.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: They did agree to the legislation.\nBut on the immigration front, you and your fellow Democratic lawmakers are now trying to challenge the Trump administration's policy that requires notice to be given before you visit an immigration facility. You just did visit some. What did you see? And how does that compare to the last administration?\nREPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, there's an ICE detention center in my district in Aurora, Colorado. I have visited that center 10 times now over the last five years, six years.\nAnd oversight of federal facilities is one of the most important things that any member of Congress does, Air Force bases, military bases, VA hospitals, and ICE detention centers. This administration just tripled the budget of ICE, made it the largest federal law enforcement agency in the history of the United States, bigger than the FBI, ATF, DEA, all others combined.\nAnd they are putting in roadblocks to prevent oversight, to prevent transparency because they are trying to hide what they are doing. That is unacceptable. So we filed a lawsuit to force them to abide by federal law that guarantees us access.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. And we will see where that heads next.\nJason Crow, thank you.\nWe will be right back.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back. Stay with us.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.\nFiona Hill served as the senior director for Russia and European affairs on the National Security Council during President Trump's first term. She joins us now from Waterville, Maine.\nGood morning to you.\nFIONA HILL (Former NSC Senior Director, European and Russian Affairs): Good morning, Margaret.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Fiona, you were an advisor during that infamous Helsinki summit in 2018. You've spoke about that in the past. I wonder what you think about how this Alaska summit compared.\nFIONA HILL: Well, obviously quite different in – in many respects. Part of it was the fact that they decided to skip the one-on-one meeting and the lunch. I mean these are usually part of this sort of set of summits like this. And the press conference, obviously, was more of an announcement or a set of announcements. Presentations by both leaders, much more by President Putin, and more of a commentary by President Trump. So, there wasn't that free for all of press questions, which I'm sure was a bit disconcerting for you and others who were present there at Alaska.\nBut the optics weren't exactly great, as Congressman Crow has laid out, for the United States and for President Trump again. I mean, again, different. But although it was presented as perhaps a show of power by being at a U.S. Air Force Base with the flight passing of the B-52s and the fighter jets, it did certainly looked much more like a show of appreciation for Vladimir Putin. And so the optics were really much more favorable to Putin than they were to the United States. It really looked like Putin set the agenda there, the narrative, and in many respects the tone for the whole summit meeting.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, saying that, you know, the president has a team of advisors around him. In a traditional administration, those advisors would be setting the policy, they would be planning the optics, and they would be thinking through that.\nDo you think that the president's team set him up for success here?\nFIONA HILL: Well, look, it may well have been that one of the demands, because we've heard from Secretary Rubio, which, I have to say, I think was a very fair assessment of where things are. So, it may well have been that one of the demands by the Russians to make any progress in moving further forward was to actually have that kind of show of pomp and pageantry that is – basically marks Putin's re-entry into international affairs. Maybe the Russians said to them in Moscow, either to Steve Witkoff or to Secretary Rubio or to anybody else that basically they wanted to have a – a major U.S./Russia bilateral summit appearance before they would move on to the nitty-gritty of anything else in Ukraine. That's, you know, to give them all the benefit of the doubt there.\nBut it all now depends on what comes out of this. And I think, again, Secretary Rubio made it very clear that it's not going to be easy. He was certainly downplaying any expectations of a major breakthrough, but he did say that it was something that might be possible. And I think that's what's going to be the proof of whether this was actually worth all the effort that they went to in Alaska or not.\nAnd as Congressman Crow said, there's a pretty high bar here because what Putin is doing is pretty brutal. And he's not showing right now any signs whatsoever of giving anything up.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom's defense secretary has said that they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help oversee a ceasefire. When you hear these security guarantees being talked about, and the secretary said he is going to negotiate that tomorrow, what should we think – you know, what form is that going to take? What do you think that should look like?\nFIONA HILL: Well, look, I think he actually let this out, and you did too in your questions. And I think Congressman Crow has made it very clear as well, it has to be a combination of all of the things that we've already heard discussed on the show today. You have to be able to have some boots on the ground. Congressman Crow said it doesn't have to be the United States. That's actually the case. But it actually has to be some commitment from the United States to enable European forces to actually hold that territory and to provide some security guarantees for Ukraine.\nThe United States is key in terms of its intelligence, in terms of enabling equipment and the information of the data that we would need for all of this to make a security intervention mean something. And it's also essential in terms of all kinds of other forms of equipment and defensive weaponry. We've already heard, of course, about Ukraine needing all kinds of equipment, from javelins in the past, to patriots, now in terms of an integrated missile defense system that Ukraine desperately needs. So, there's a lot there that we all know needs to be done.\nAnd what we really need to see, I think, in these meetings that will take place on Monday and moving forward, is a real commitment to the United States to work with Europeans and to work with Ukraine to make this happen.\nLook, this is existential also for European security. So, minimizing the role of Europe here, be it the United Kingdom, be it Poland, be it Finland, be it France, be it Germany, is not the way to go. Europe has to have an equal say in all of this. This is about Europe's future and the future of European security, not just about Ukraine's.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the dynamic between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. You know both men. You've written biographies of Vladimir Putin and, of course, you served under Donald Trump. In one of the Fox interviews that President Trump did, he said that he spoke about mail- in voting in the United States with Vladimir Putin. And during that press address, Putin also claimed that the war wouldn't have happened at all if Donald Trump had been pretty. I mean that's a counter factual, but that's something Trump often says on the – on the trail. Why would those things be discussed at all if this was about Ukraine?\nFIONA HILL: Exactly. Well, look, this is Vladimir Putin, as usual, trying to manipulate U.S. domestic politics. I've seen him do this over and over again, including at Helsinki when he set the president off, not in the press conference, but before that, in a whole diatribe against his political enemies because Putin deliberately asked him about this.\nSo, Putin knows that President Trump wants to have an acknowledgment of his self-assertion, that the war wouldn't have happened had he not – had he been in the presidency. And so Putin's giving him something that plays well for President Trump and his own domestic environment. It doesn't play well in the international environment where people know things are much more complicated but it's basically gifting a concession to President Trump himself.\nAnd Putin wants to sow chaos in the American electoral system ahead of the midterms. So, of course, he's laid into this whole issue of mail-in voting. And President Trump asserted in his Fox News interview that there were no countries in the world that allow mail-in voting. Well, Russia allows mail- in voting. And if everybody wants to go out and look, they can look for themselves. In 2020, President Vladimir Putin signed into law Russians being able to vote by mail and also on the internet. And more than 30 other countries also allow some forms of mail-in voting. So, it's just not true that other countries, including Russia, don't use this. It's a pure blatant piece of manipulation, and that's the kind of thing that Putin likes to do.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And, of course, I don't think you would endorse the outcome of that voting system and those elections are rigged in Russia, correct?\nFIONA HILL: Of course.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nFIONA HILL: And, I mean, basically Putin wants to see us tie ourselves up in knots between now and the midterms. He's trying to sew chaos. And he's just better used his time with President Trump to push that along.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nFIONA HILL: It's – again, it's a diversion. It's a distraction really from the negotiations on Ukraine because Putin doesn't really want to give anything up. So, he gives up basically something that plays well in the political arena for President Trump and something that actually plays very badly for the United States in its own political arena, which is the mail- in voting point that he made.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Fiona Hill, always appreciate your analysis. Thank you for joining us today.\nWe'll be right back.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: During our trip to Alaska last week for the Trump/Putin summit, we talked with Alaskan Republican Senator Dan Sullivan about the strategic military importance of Alaska. We began by asking about potential offers to Putin to get him to end the war in Ukraine.\n(BEGIN VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \"The Telegraph\" was reporting offering Putin a chance to invest in the natural resources off of Alaska's coast, in the Bearing Strait.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN (R-AK): Yes. Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you comfortable with that?\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, we have plenty of America investors and our allies who want to invest in Alaska's natural resources. We're having a boom here. We don't need Russian investments. We don't need Russian money. They're a competitor of ours when it comes to energy and natural resources and critical minerals. So, I doubt that's on the table. And, you know, I would not –\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You'd be upset if there was?\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I would not – I would not support that.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Your colleague –\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And by the way, just to – on that point though, a contrast. You might remember last time I was on your show we talked about the Biden administration –\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about this.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: With this great state of ours.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Shutting us down, right? I mean that was 70 executive orders to shut down, exclusively focused on Alaska, shut down our resource development economy. Our own federal government, the Biden administration, sanctioned my state more than they sanctioned Iran. What we're seeing with President Trump in his administration is a complete 180 on that. Unleashing Alaska's resource potential has been a huge focus of the president since day one.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you mentioned how furious you were with the Biden administration for the executive actions they said they were taking to protect natural resources.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: They said land conservation was necessary, and the indigenous population here really wanted it.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Right. Right.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You called it a lie.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I did call it a lie. It was a lie.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And you said it was national security suicide. Trump has already reversed this.\nBut are you at all concerned that there are short-term benefits to your state financially, but longer term real damage to the environment here?\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: No. Look, Alaska has an incredible record of being able to develop our resources and protect the environment. You walk around here, you see what a pristine, beautiful environment we have here. But we know we need jobs. We need natural resource development. So, we can do both. The entire north slope of Alaska, the Nupiet (ph) community, across the board was against what the Biden administration did, which was lock up the entire natural petroleum reserve of Alaska, which was set aside by Congress to develop our resources. And then he had the audacity to say, hey, I did this on behalf of the native people. That was not true at all. It was an outrage.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So – so, for activists or for those concerned about the damage here –\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You say they just don't know what they're talking about?\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, I say – well, a couple things. There's no place on the planet that has higher standards on protecting the environment than us. And if we need American energy, why would we go, like the Biden administration did, begging from Iran, Venezuela, places that have no environmental standards, when you can get it from America, from American workers, with the highest environmental standards any place on the planet. And secondly, when you have resource development, particularly in our rural communities, you see life expectancies increases – increasing.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, in this region –\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Arctic is of supreme concern from a national security perspective.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The ice is melting.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Majority of scientists attribute that to global warming, but the end result is there's a potential for an Arctic area for trade routes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Also tapping into the natural resources there.\nHow does the United States gain an edge in – in dominating that?\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, it's a great question. It's really important. You're mentioning trade routes that are opening up. We've already talked about natural resources, which are huge, up in the Arctic. And what we need to do is recognize that we're an Arctic nation. We're an Arctic nation because of Alaska.\nAnd, look, this has not always been a priority of previous administrations. What we're doing up here, we're rebuilding our military. The one big, beautiful bill certainly does it. As I mentioned, you know, Alaska exudes military might. We're the cornerstone of missile defense, and we're going to be the cornerstone of the president's golden dome initiative. We are the hub of air combat power. You're seeing them flying over here. We have over 100 fifth generation fighters based in Alaska. We have a brand-new U.S. Army airborne division up here. So, we are building out our military, which is great, but also building out our Arctic capabilities.\nAnd again, in the one big, beautiful bill, almost $26 billion investment in the Coast Guard, which is the biggest investment in the Coast Guard in American history by far, 16 icebreakers coming with that, 22 cutters, 40 helicopters, a bunch of shore side infrastructure, a lot of that's going to be in Alaska to defend the Arctic. And we need to defend the Arctic because, as you and I have talked about, the Russians and the Chinese are in our waters and in our airspace all the time, including doing joint operations up here, which is unprecedented.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I wanted to ask you about that because the war in Ukraine has hurt Russia's finances –\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Made them more dependent on Beijing, including when it comes to exploring up and around the Arctic.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: They had a joint bomber task force come here –\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Pretty darn close.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Oh, they were in our ADIZs, as they – as we call it.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Air Defense Identification Zone.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, are you concerned this actually becomes a flashpoint?\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I think this is already becoming a flash point. I mean the number of times that the Russians and Chinese are doing joint strategic bomber task forces in our airspace and joint naval task forces in our EEZ, in our waters, they're –\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Economic Zone?\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes. That's happening on a regular basis now, that's unprecedented. They don't do joint operations anywhere else on America's borders. That's for sure.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Republican chair of the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee says there is far more needed for the U.S. military than what has been provided by the White House and their budget.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: We need to do more and we certainly need to keep it above 3 percent of GDP and growing towards 4 or 5 percent of GDP. It's a dangerous world right now.\nBut this one big, beautiful bill, the budget reconciliation bill does a lot for our military right now on urgent needs. Shipbuilding. As we have talked about, our Navy, our ability to build ships is completely atrophied. Weapons and ammo systems. The golden dome.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I know you have your own proposal.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Absolutely.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But has the Pentagon told you what the golden dome is?\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: All right, I mean, I've been working on this with the Pentagon. This is missile defense that is a layered missile defense. So, what that means is, right here, like I said, you have the ground-based missile interceptor – the missile interceptors in Alaska. You have all the radar systems in Alaska that protect the whole country in terms of ballistic missiles.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: We have new threats. We have hypersonics. We have drones. We have, heck, even we've seen it here in Alaska, spy balloons. What we need to do is upgrade the system with what's called a layered defense. Not just the ground-based system here, but you work it more with different systems, Aegis Ashore, THAD, and then including space-based systems, both for tracking and intercepting. And you to do that with an open architecture in terms of software to integrate those systems. So, I am very familiar with what the golden dome is doing and I'm leading the effort in the Senate on it.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And, by the way, my state is the cornerstone of all the missile defense right now and will continue to be so.\n(END VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You can find more from our interview with Dan Sullivan on our website, facethenation.com and our YouTube page.\nWe'll be back in a moment.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza where the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry reports that the total number of starvation- related deaths has now risen to 250, including 110 children. Seven of those deaths in the last 24 hours.\nWorld Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres joins us this morning from Jerusalem. He visited Gaza late last week.\nGood morning.\nJOSE ANDRES (Founder, World Central Kitchen): Good morning.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It is rare to get a look inside of Gaza. The IDF does not allow journalists in to freely report. But they let you in. What did you see?\nJOSE ANDRES: It was a day trip. I was able to go early in the day and leave before sunset. And I visit our main – one of our two main kitchens inside Gaza in Derbala (ph). And I was able to visit the few warehouses we have there, the bakery, the kitchens. And I spending a day trying to see what else the teams need, what else we need to be doing, how we are going to be increasing the hot food and bread we are producing right now. So, it was a day again to show support, to see on my own and assess the situation of our own kitchens. And – and that's how – what I have to report with that.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The U.N. says that there is starvation happening in Gaza. Israel's prime minister says there is no starvation. What's real?\nJOSE ANDRES: Obviously, there is always a gray area. But we are making boxes for children that we know they are in very special need situation. I saw those boxes be made with the name of every one of the children. We need to remember that during many weeks no food was going inside Gaza. And this is to 2 million people.\nSo, in the places we know we're feeding, we are doing around 200,000 meals a day, but this is only 10 percent of the need. That's why we are trying to increase.\nI can say that where we are, obviously people are – are – are being fed. At the very minimum. It's not everything they should be receiving, but at the very least they are receiving a piece of bread and a piece of food.\nBut we need much more aid. We need to make sure that the aid is never interrupted again. We need to make sure that the flow of trucks keeps happening. We need to make sure that we have safe roads so those trucks can reach their intended delivery place. We need to make sure that all the NGOs that are actively trying to do the best they can to take care of people inside Gaza, and this is beyond food, obviously medicine, et cetera, et cetera, we need to make sure that the aid is massive enough that we don't get to those moments where in some areas, like in the north, that these are still very difficult to reach, that we know that people are desperate for food.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned for many weeks no food was allowed in. That was a government policy. There was a blockade for many months. That is now lifted officially.\nBut as you say, your organization wants to scale up. You are trying to produce 1 million meals a day in Gaza. Can you get the fuel in to do that? Can you get the food in? Are Israeli officials giving you a green light?\nJOSE ANDRES: Well, it's a million because we – we are an organization that we specialize in emergencies and in food. But really we are requesting that all the NGOs that are participating in feeding are giving more access, including us, and other organizations, like Anera (ph), which was one of the organizations we work with that they have been in Gaza for many, many decades, and many others. We need to make sure that everybody has access. For that we need a lot of things. The trucks inside Gaza. We need to remember that the trucks come from outside Gaza. And they are – they are put aside. And then we need to reload the trucks that are inside Gaza. This takes time. We need more trucks inside. So, the trucking company can have enough people and enough trucks to have a constant flow.\nI have to report that as I saw a good flow of trucks going in, around 150 to 250 trucks are going in every day. But even I would say that this is not enough. We need to make sure that we massively increase, that we massively make sure that nobody has to be walking for miles to try to reach a place where they can find a plate of food or use a bag of rice. We need to make sure like what World Central Kitchen does. At one moment we had, you know, 100 to 200 kitchen partners. We need to make sure that we are cooking where people live. We need to make sure that we are feeding them where people are so the people don't have to be again leaving their neighborhoods, leaving their tents and walking for hours back and forth only to try to bring a little bit of food back home.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Jose Andres, thank you very much for your time this morning.\nWe'll be right back.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today.

Demonstrating \"a good moral character\" has long been one of the requirements in U.S. immigration law for American citizenship, alongside passing English and civics tests.\nFor decades, under Republican and Democratic administrations, the \"good moral character\" assessment has generally been satisfied if applicants don't have any of the criminal offenses or disqualifying conduct outlined in U.S. immigration law. Those disqualifying factors range from violent crimes like murder and aggravated felonies to drug offenses and being a \"habitual drunkard.\"\nBut a policy issued Friday by USCIS expands the \"good moral character\" assessment, saying that determination must involve \"more than a cursory mechanical review focused on the absence of wrongdoing.\" Instead, the review, the agency told its officers, should be \"a holistic assessment of an alien's behavior, adherence to societal norms, and positive contributions that affirmatively demonstrate good moral character.\"\nThe directive orders officers to place a \"greater emphasis\" on applicants' \"positive attributes and contributions,\" listing community involvement, family caregiving and ties, educational attainment, \"stable and lawful\" employment, the length of time spent in the U.S., and paying taxes as some of those factors.\nThe memo also mandates \"greater scrutiny\" of factors that show applicants lack a \"good moral character,\" beyond the crimes and disqualifying conduct detailed in U.S. immigration law.\nThose factors, the policy said, include \"acts that are contrary to the average behavior of citizens in the jurisdiction where aliens reside,\" including actions that are \"technically lawful\" but also \"inconsistent with civic responsibility within the community.\" USCIS listed \"reckless or habitual traffic infractions, or harassment or aggressive solicitation\" as some of those actions.\nLastly, the new USCIS policy instructs officers to weigh factors that could show that applicants who have engaged in wrongdoing have rehabilitated, such as complying with probation, paying overdue taxes or child support and receiving letters of support from their community.\nOver the past decade, the U.S. government has naturalized between 600,000 and 1 million immigrants as citizens annually, USCIS figures show.\nIn a statement to CBS News, USCIS chief spokesman Matthew Tragesser said the directive is another effort by President Trump's administration to \"restore integrity\" to the U.S. immigration system.\n\"U.S. citizenship is the gold standard of citizenship — it should only be offered to the world's best of the best,\" Tragesser added. \"Today, USCIS is adding a new element to the naturalization process that ensures America's newest citizens not only embrace America's culture, history, and language but who also demonstrate Good Moral Character.\"\nDoug Rand, a former senior USCIS official during the Biden administration, suggested the Trump administration's policy is designed to scare legal immigrants from applying for American citizenship and require officers to put their \"thumb on the scale\" to find more reasons to deny applications.\n\"They're trying to increase the grounds for denial of U.S. citizenship by kind of torturing the definition of good moral character to encompass extremely harmless behavior,\" Rand said, citing the policy's reference to traffic infractions.\nWhile the Trump administration has launched a highly visible crackdown on illegal immigration by deploying thousands of troops to the southern border, expanding immigration raids across the country, and fast-tracking deportations of those in the U.S. illegally, it has simultaneously moved to restrict legal immigration, with less fanfare.\nThe Trump administration has virtually shut down refugee admissions, terminated Biden-era programs that allowed migrants to enter the U.S. legally, limited visas for certain countries and implemented aggressive vetting procedures for legal immigration benefits. Those efforts include expanded vetting of social media activity of legal immigrants and stricter screening requirements for some applications.", "published": "Sat, 16 Aug 2025 12:28:00 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/politics"}

Dominique Trinquand, a former head of France's military mission at the United Nations.\n\"It's a power struggle and a position of strength that might work with Trump,\" he said in a phone interview.\nThe European leaders' presence at Zelenskyy's side, demonstrating Europe's support for Ukraine, could potentially help ease concerns in Kyiv and in other European capitals that Ukraine risks being railroaded into a peace deal that Mr. Trump says he wants to broker with Russia.\nAppearing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Rubio pushed back on the idea that European leaders are joining Zelenskyy in Washington to provide the Ukrainian president with backup to prevent him from accepting a bad deal after the contentious meeting earlier this year.\n\"We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff,\" Rubio said. \"They're coming here tomorrow because they're supposed to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come.\"\nThe secretary outlined that after the meeting with Putin, \"we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress — not a lot of progress — but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase.\"\n\"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement,\" Rubio added. \"Enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"\nIt wasn't immediately clear whether all or just some of the European leaders would be taking part in the actual meeting with Mr. Trump.\nZelenskyy on Sunday night said he had arrived in Washington, D.C., and was \"grateful\" for Mr. Trump's invitation.\n\"We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably. And peace must be lasting. Not like it was years ago, when Ukraine was forced to give up Crimea and part of our East—part of Donbas—and Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack,\" Zelenskyy wrote. \"... I am confident that we will defend Ukraine, effectively guarantee security, and that our people will always be grateful to President Trump, everyone in America, and every partner and ally for their support and invaluable assistance. Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace. Thank you!\"\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on X that she will take part in the talks, \"at the request of President Zelenskyy.\"\nThe secretary-general of the NATO military alliance, Mark Rutte, will also take part in the meeting, his press service said.\nThe office of President Emmanuel Macron announced that the French leader will travel on Monday to Washington \"at the side of President Zelenskyy\" although it didn't immediately specify that he'll be in the meeting.\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz will also be part of the European group, but the statement from his office likewise didn't specify that he will be in the talks with Mr. Trump.\nThe grouped trip underscored European leaders' determination to ensure that Europe has a voice in Mr. Trump's attempted peace-making, after the U.S. president's summit on Friday with Putin — to which Zelenskyy wasn't invited.", "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 22:51:52 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/politics"}
{"title": "Putin agreed to allow NATO-style protection for Ukraine, Trump envoy says", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-steve-witkoff-nato-security-guarantees/", "text": "Putin agreed to let U.S., Europe offer NATO-style protections for Ukraine, Trump envoy says\nWashington — Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Trump to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday.\n\"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,\" he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" He added that it \"was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that\" and called it \"game-changing.\"\nArticle 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members.\nWitkoff, who had joined Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his long-standing objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership.\nOutlining some of the details about the private discussions, Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not \"go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty. And there was plenty more.\"\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, applauded the move. \"We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the 'Coalition of the willing' — including the European Union — is ready to do its share,\" she said.\nZelenskyy thanked the United States for recent signals that Washington was willing to support such guarantees, but said much was unclear.\n\"It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine,\" he said, \"But there are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees.\"\nWitkoff defended Mr. Trump's decision to abandon his push that Russian agree to an immediate ceasefire, which the president had set as a benchmark going into the meeting. Witkoff said the Republican president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.\n\"We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,\" Witkoff said, without elaborating. \"We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal.\"\nRubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he did not believe imposing new U.S. sanctions on Russia would force Putin to accept a ceasefire.\n\"If he did this now, the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks,\" Rubio said. \"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here.\"\nRubio said that Kyiv \"is going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too.\"\n\"For example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security,\" Rubio said. \"That's not an unreasonable request. That's something that needs to be worked on.\"\nMr. Trump on Sunday wrote on social media, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\"\nZelenskyy and European leaders, who heard from Mr. Trump after the summit, are scheduled to meet with him at the White House on Monday.\nRubio said of the talks with Russia, \"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"\nZelenskyy on Sunday night said on social media that he had arrived in Washington, D.C., for Monday's meeting, but pushed back on the Trump administration's comments about ceding territory to Russia.\n\"We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably. And peace must be lasting. Not like it was years ago, when Ukraine was forced to give up Crimea and part of our East—part of Donbas—and Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack,\" Zelenskyy wrote, adding \"Crimea should not have been given up then, just as Ukrainians did not give up Kyiv, Odesa, or Kharkiv after 2022.\"\n\"I am confident that we will defend Ukraine, effectively guarantee security, and that our people will always be grateful to President Trump, everyone in America, and every partner and ally for their support and invaluable assistance,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace.

Sherrod Brown announced a bid to once again represent Ohio in the Senate on Monday, nearly a year after his reelection effort in 2024 fell short.\n\"I didn't plan to run for office again. But when I see what's going on, I know I can do something about it for Ohio,\" Brown said in a video announcement. \"That's why I'm running for Senate, because even in these challenging times, I still believe if you stand up for workers, treat people with respect, and always fight for Ohio, you can actually make a difference.\"\nBrown, 72, lost his bid for a fourth term in the upper chamber last November against GOP challenger Sen. Bernie Moreno. Brown was the sole Democrat holding statewide office in Ohio and was one of the key targets for Republicans in the 2024 election in which they took control of the Senate.\nBrown had historically appealed to ticket-splitters with his strong working-class brand in the state, which he had represented in the Senate since 2007. But President Trump won Ohio by more than 10 percentage points, making Brown's election a steep uphill climb. Moreno beat him by less than four points.\nIn 2026, Brown is set to face off against Sen. Jon Husted, a Republican who was appointed to fill Ohio's other Senate seat, which Vice President JD Vance vacated. The special election will determine who will serve the remainder of Vance's term, meaning the winner would have to run for election again in 2028.\nHusted, 57, was appointed in January by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, and previously served as DeWine's lieutenant governor.\nThe Ohio race is expected to be a tough battle for Democrats, as the party seeks to retake the majority in the Senate. With 53 Republicans in the upper chamber, Democrats would need to defend seats in a handful of potentially competitive states, while flipping four seats to retake a majority in 2026.\nWhile few races appear comfortably in range, Democrats have been working to recruit formidable candidates, like former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, to boost their chances. Brown's entrance into the race marks the latest recruiting victory for the party.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 07:26:47 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/politics"}

Mr. Trump called the nearly three-hour meeting with Putin \"extremely productive\" with \"many points\" the two leaders agreed on. But \"there's no deal until there's a deal,\" he said, and no ceasefire was announced.\nRubio, who attended the summit, was thin on details Sunday, saying that \"there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs.\" He added that the details would be discussed with Zelenskyy and other European leaders on Monday as the administration works to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"\n\"We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war,\" Rubio said, noting that there were \"some concepts and ideas discussed\" with Putin that they expect the Ukrainians would support.\nWhen asked whether the U.S. would demand Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory as part of an agreement, the secretary of state acknowledged that both sides would have to make concessions in order to reach a deal to end the conflict.\n\"If one side gets everything they want, that's called surrender,\" Rubio said. \"And that's not what we're close to doing, because neither side here is on the verge of surrender, or anything close to it.\"\nRubio outlined a handful of areas where agreement needs to be reached, including the details of security guarantees for Ukraine, the question of territories \"and where the lines are going to be drawn\" and the issue of rebuilding the country. He said the ideas \"require some more specificity,\" noting that the U.S. will \"need to work with our partners to see what that looks like.\"\nMonday's discussions come after Zelenskyy met with Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance in February, when an Oval Office meeting descended into insults and chaos, exposing severe rifts between the U.S. and Ukraine.\nRubio pushed back on the idea that European leaders are joining Zelenskyy in Washington as backup to prevent him from accepting a bad deal after the contentious meeting earlier this year.\n\"We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff,\" Rubio said. \"They're coming here tomorrow because they're supposed to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come.

Jason Crow on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Aug. 17, 2025\nThe following is the transcript of an interview with Democratic Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 17, 2025.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crow. Good to see you in person. Before we start talking about Ukraine, I want to pick up on something, since you sit on the Intelligence Committee. The Secretary of State just said that lawmakers had come to the Trump administration with information that they've been granting visas to individuals with ties to Hamas, or with organizations with ties to Hamas. That's a pretty stunning accusation. Israel controls who enters and exits Gaza. The United States screens all visas. So, is there really a blind spot that you are aware of?\nREP. JASON CROW: I'm not aware of that. But if that's true, actually, that is concerning. That would be a problem. I mean, Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization. They should not be traveling anywhere. So, if that's happening, it should be stopped immediately. And, you know, the Intelligence Committee has a role to play in that.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the Intelligence Committee wasn't behind the information presented to the Secretary of State.\nREP. CROW: I have not been briefed on that. I have no information about it.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, on Ukraine: You know that the U.S. intelligence assessment is that the battlefield is turning in Russia's favor, despite the fact that Putin has to rely on Iran and North Korea to keep this thing going. If neither President Biden nor President Trump were ever willing to commit troops, doesn't the secretary have a point that it has to be hammered out at the negotiating table?\nREP. CROW: You know, this absolutely will end at a negotiating table, like most conflicts will. But what happened on Friday was a historic embarrassment for the United States. There's no other way to put it. Right? You listen to what Marco Rubio and the president have said. They keep on saying they're dedicating time. They're making it a priority. They're focusing their attention on it. In any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary. What is making Vladimir Putin tick, in this instance. Vladimir Putin does not care about the amount of time that we're nego- we're allocating to this, does not care about a B-2 bomber flyover, does not care about a lineup of F-22 fighters rolled out. He doesn't care about any of that. What Vladimir Putin cares about is basically three things. He cares about economic pressure in the form of sanctions. He cares about political, diplomatic isolation, being a pariah state. And he cares about military defeat. Those are the three things that will end this conflict if he feels pressure on all of those three fronts. And this administration continues to be unwilling to do anything to assert pressure in any of those three areas.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they have put in place some secondary sanctions, at least on India here, and they haven't pulled back. They need Congress to help them repeal a lot of these sanctions. But bigger picture, in hindsight, do you think the United States to date has been too hesitant to actually help Ukraine win this war? President Obama did not send offensive weapons to Ukraine. President Biden was criticized for being perhaps too slow in delivery of certain weapons.\nREP. CROW: There's no doubt. As you know, I was one of the members of Congress that, on a bipartisan basis, pushed really hard in the first two years of this war, under the Biden administration, to do more, to do more quicker. And I was concerned that we were doing just enough to prevent Ukraine from losing and not doing enough to help them win. And I do believe that had we done more, and we had done it faster, and that we were willing to be more aggressive in providing aid and support for Ukraine, then they would be in a different position on the battlefield today. But compare that to what this administration has done, which has relieved almost all pressure. Like look at what happened on Friday. U.S. military personnel in uniform, literally, were on their hands and knees, rolling out a red carpet for the most murderous dictator of the 21st century. Somebody who has kidnapped and is holding prisoner tens of thousands of Ukrainian children. Somebody who started this whole war, right? This both-sides-ism that the administration is engaging in, that both sides need to come to the table and negotiate. Ukraine is the victim. They are the victim. They didn't start this war. Russia did. And somehow we keep on acting like Vladimir Putin deserves to be brought out into the open like any other head of state. This is a historic embarrassment and defeat for U.S. foreign policy.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You have served this country in uniform. I wonder, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, how comfortable you would be with the United States giving this, whatever the Article Five-like security guarantee would look like. Is that something you should see boots on the ground to do?\nREP. CROW: I don't think boots on the ground would be the way to go. But, certainly, the United States has assets and capability that I think are essential to any type of security guarantee. I think Europe has to come forward with the forward presence of military. But we can provide intelligence. We can provide economic support, diplomatic support. One of the most important things that we can do right now is actually seize Russian assets. This would be huge. This would be a game-changing thing that put pressure on Vladimir Putin. And actually create security guarantees and reconstruction for Ukraine. There's over $150 billion of seized Russian assets, and the United States could lead a coalition to seize that money. Allocate it towards reconstruction, allocate it towards security, allocate it towards the building of a Ukrainian military that could actually resist Russia going forward. But this administration is unwilling to do it.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Last administration was too, they--\nREP. CROW: --That's right.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: They did agree to the legislation. But on the immigration front, you and your fellow Democratic lawmakers are now trying to challenge the Trump administration's policy that requires notice to be given before you visit an immigration facility. You just did visit some. What did you see, and how does that compare to the last visit?\nREP. CROW: Well, there's an ICE detention center in my district, in Aurora, Colorado. I have visited that center 10 times now over the last five years, six years. And oversight of federal facilities is one of the most important things that any member of Congress does. Air Force bases, military bases, VA hospitals and ICE detention centers. This administration just tripled the budget of ICE. Made it the largest federal law enforcement agency in the history of the United States. Bigger than the FBI, ATF, DEA, all others combined. And they are putting in roadblocks to prevent oversight, to prevent transparency because they were trying to hide what they are doing. That is unacceptable. So we filed a lawsuit to force them to abide by federal law that guarantees us access.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll see where that heads next. Jason Crow, thank you. We'll be right back.", "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 12:17:35 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/politics"}

{"title": "The Weaponized World Economy", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/weaponized-world-economy-farrell-newman", "text": "When Washington announced a “framework deal” with China in June, it marked a silent shifting of gears in the global political economy. This was not the beginning of U.S. President Donald Trump’s imagined epoch of “liberation” under unilateral American greatness or a return to the Biden administration’s dream of managed great-power rivalry. Instead, it was the true opening of the age of weaponized interdependence, in which the United States is discovering what it is like to have others do unto it as it has eagerly done unto others.\nThis new era will be shaped by weapons of economic and technological coercion—sanctions, supply chain attacks, and export measures—that repurpose the many points of control in the infrastructure that underpins the interdependent global economy. For over two decades, the United States has unilaterally weaponized these chokepoints in finance, information flows, and technology for strategic advantage. But market exchange has become hopelessly entangled with national security, and the United States must now defend its interests in a world in which other powers can leverage chokepoints of their own.\nThat is why the Trump administration had to make a deal with China. Administration officials now acknowledge that they made concessions on semiconductor export controls in return for China’s easing restrictions on rare-earth minerals that were crippling the United States’ auto industry. U.S. companies that provide chip design software, such as Synopsys and Cadence, can once again sell their technology in China. This concession will help the Chinese semiconductor industry wriggle out of the bind it found itself in when the Biden administration started limiting China’s ability to build advanced semiconductors. And the U.S. firm Nvidia can again sell H20 chips for training artificial intelligence to Chinese customers.\nIn a little-noticed speech in June, Secretary of State Marco Rubio hinted at the administration’s reasoning. China had “cornered the market” for rare earths, putting the United States and the world in a “crunch,” he said. The administration had come to realize “that our industrial capability is deeply dependent on a number of potential adversary nation-states, including China, who can hold it over our head,” shifting the “nature of geopolitics,” in “one of the great challenges of the new century.”\nAlthough Rubio emphasized self-reliance as a solution, the administration’s rush to make a deal demonstrates the limits of going it alone. The United States is ratcheting back its own threats to persuade adversaries not to cripple vital parts of the U.S. economy. Other powers, too, are struggling to figure out how to advance their interests in a world in which economic power and national security are merging, and economic and technological integration have turned from a promise to a threat.\nWashington had to remake its national security state after other countries developed the atomic bomb; in a similar way, it will have to rebuild its economic security state for a world in which adversaries and allies can also weaponize interdependence. In short, economic weapons are proliferating just as nuclear weapons did, creating new dilemmas for the United States and other powers. China has adapted to this new world with remarkable speed; other powers, such as European countries, have struggled. All will have to update their strategic thinking about how their own doctrines and capabilities intersect with the doctrines and capabilities of other powers, and how businesses, which have their own interests and capabilities, will respond.\nThe problem for the United States is that the Trump administration is gutting the very resources that it needs to advance U.S. interests and protect against countermoves. In the nuclear age, the United States made historic investments in the institutions, infrastructure, and weapons systems that would propel it to long-term advantage. Now, the Trump administration seems to be actively undermining those sources of strength. As the administration goes blow for blow with the Chinese, it is ripping apart the systems of expertise necessary to navigate the complex tradeoffs that it faces. Every administration is forced to build the plane as it flies, but this is the first one to pull random parts from the engine at 30,000 feet.\nAs China rapidly adapts to the new realities of weaponized interdependence, it is building its own alternative “stack” of mutually reinforcing high-tech industries centered on the energy economy. Europe is floundering at the moment, but over time, it may also create its own alternative suite of technologies. The United States, uniquely, is flinging its institutional and technological advantages away. A failure by Washington to meet the changes in the international system will not only harm U.S. national interests but also threaten the long-term health of U.S. firms and the livelihoods of American citizens.\nTHE WORLD GLOBALIZATION MADE\nWeaponized interdependence is an unanticipated byproduct of the grand era of globalization that is drawing to a close. After the Cold War ended, businesses built an interdependent global economy on top of U.S.-centered infrastructure. The United States’ technological platforms—the Internet, e-commerce, and, later, social media—wove the world’s communications systems together. Global financial systems also combined thanks to dollar clearing, in which businesses directly or indirectly use U.S. dollars for international deals; correspondent banks that implement such transactions; and the SWIFT financial messaging network. U.S.-centered semiconductor manufacturing was spun out into a myriad of specialized processes across Europe and Asia, but key intellectual property, such as semiconductor software design, remained in the hands of a few U.S. companies. Each of these systems could be understood as its own “stack,” interconnected complexes of related technologies and services that came to reinforce one another, so that, for example, buying into the open Internet increasingly meant buying into U.S. platforms and e-commerce systems, too. At a time when geopolitics seemed the stuff of antiquated Cold War thrillers, few worried about becoming dependent on economic infrastructure provided by other countries.\nThat was a mistake for Washington’s adversaries and, eventually, for its allies, too. After the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the United States began using these systems to pursue terrorists and their backers. Over two decades of cumulative experimentation, U.S. authorities expanded their ambitions and reach. The United States graduated from exploiting financial chokepoints against terrorists to deploying sanctions to target banks and, in time, to cutting entire countries, such as Iran, out of the global financial system. The Internet was transformed into a global surveillance apparatus, allowing the United States to demand that platforms and search companies, which were regulated by U.S. authorities, hand over crucial strategic information on their worldwide users.\nThe infrastructure of economic interdependence was turned against both the United States’ enemies and its friends. When the first Trump administration pulled out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which the United States and other major countries, including in Europe, had negotiated with Iran in 2015 to limit its nuclear program, the United States threatened to sanction Europeans who continued to do business with the Islamic Republic. European governments found themselves largely unable to protect their own companies against U.S. power.\nThis was the context in which we first wrote about weaponized interdependence in 2019. By that point, many of the most important economic networks underpinning globalization—communications, finance, production—had become so highly centralized that a small number of key firms and economic actors effectively controlled them. Governments that could assert authority over these firms, most notably the U.S. government, could tap them for information about their adversaries or exclude rivals from access to these vital points in the global economy. Over two decades, the United States had built institutions to assert and direct this authority in response to a series of particular crises.\nSome of Trump’s senior officials happened on our academic research and, to our amazement, liked what they saw. According to the historian Chris Miller’s 2022 book, Chip War, when the administration wanted to squeeze the Chinese telecommunications manufacturer Huawei harder, one senior official seized on the idea of weaponized interdependence as a playbook to strengthen export controls against semiconductors, describing the concept as a “beautiful thing.”\nEconomic weapons are proliferating just as nuclear weapons did.\nOur primary purpose, however, was to expose the ugly underbelly of such weaponization. The world that globalization made was not the flat landscape of peaceful market competition that its advocates had promised. Instead, it was riddled with hierarchy, power relations, and strategic vulnerabilities.\nMoreover, it was fundamentally unstable. American actions would invite reactions by targets and counteractions by the United States. The biggest powers could play offense, looking for vulnerabilities that they, too, could exploit. Smaller powers might seek to use less accountable or transparent channels of exchange, effectively building dark spaces into the global economy. The more the United States turned interconnections against its adversaries, the more likely it was that these adversaries—and even allies—would disconnect, hide, or retaliate. As others weaponized interdependence, the connecting fabric of the global economy would be rewoven according to a new logic, creating a world based more on offense and defense than on common commercial interest.\nU.S. President Joe Biden also used weaponization as an everyday tool of statecraft. His administration took Trump’s semiconductor export controls to a new level, deploying them first against Russia, in order to weaken Moscow’s weapons program, and then against China, denying Beijing access to the high-end semiconductors it needed to efficiently train artificial intelligence systems. According to The Washington Post, a document drafted by Biden administration officials intended to limit the use of sanctions to urgent national security problems inexorably shriveled from 40 pages to eight pages of toothless recommendations. One former official complained of a “relentless, never-ending, you-must-sanction-everybody-and-their-sister . . . system” that was “out of control.”\nSimilar worries plagued export controls. Policy experts warned that technology restrictions encouraged China to escape the grasp of the United States and develop its own ecosystem of advanced technologies. That did not stop the Biden administration, which in its final weeks announced an extraordinarily ambitious scheme to divide the entire world into three parts: the United States and a few of its closest friends as a chosen elite, the large majority of countries in the middle, and a small number of bitter adversaries at the bottom of the heap. Through export controls, the United States and its close partners would retain access to both the semiconductors used to train powerful AI and the most recent “weights”—the mathematical engines that drive frontier models—while denying them to U.S. adversaries and forcing most countries to sign up to general restrictions. If this worked, it would ensure a long-term American advantage in AI.\nAlthough the Trump administration abandoned this grand technocratic master plan, it certainly has not abandoned the goal of U.S. dominance and control of chokepoints. The problem for the United States is that others are not sitting idly by. Instead, they are building the economic and institutional means to resist.\nA TASTE OF YOUR OWN MEDICINE\nThe weapons of interdependence have been proliferating for several years and are now being deployed to counter U.S. power. As China and the European Union began to understand their risks, they, too, tried to shore up their own vulnerabilities and perhaps take advantage of the vulnerabilities of others. For these great powers, as for the United States, simply identifying key economic chokepoints is not enough. It is also necessary to build the state apparatus that can gather sufficient information to grasp the immediate benefits and risks and then put that information to use. China’s approach is coming to fruition as it presses on the United States’ vulnerabilities to force it to the negotiating table. By contrast, Europe’s internal institutional weaknesses force it to vacillate, putting it in a dangerous position vis-à-vis the United States and China.\nFor China, the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden’s 2013 exposure of U.S. surveillance practices demonstrated both the reach of the United States and the mechanics of the new era. Previously, Beijing had viewed technological independence as an important long-term goal. After Snowden, it saw dependence on U.S. technology as an urgent short-term threat. As our work with the political scientists Yeling Tan and Mark Dallas has shown, articles in Chinese state media began to trumpet the crucial role of “information security” and “data sovereignty” to China’s national security.\nThe real wake-up call came when the first Trump administration threatened to cut off ZTE, a major Chinese telecommunications company, from access to U.S. technology and then weaponized export controls against Huawei, which the administration had come to see as an urgent threat to U.S. tech dominance and national security. Chinese state media began to focus on the risks posed by “chokepoints” and the need for “self-reliance.”\nThese fears translated into policy actions as the Chinese Communist Party developed a “whole-of-nation system” to secure China’s technological independence, calling for “breakthroughs in major ‘chokepoint’ technologies and products.” China also began to think about how it could better exploit its advantages in rare-earth mining and processing, where it had gained a stranglehold as U.S. and other companies fell out of the market. China’s power in this sector comes not from a simple monopoly over the minerals, which the country doesn’t fully possess, but from its domination of the economic and technological ecosystem necessary to extract and process them. Notably, these critical minerals are used for a variety of high-tech industrial purposes, including producing the specialized magnets that are crucial to cars, planes, and other sophisticated technologies.\nChina had already threatened to cut back its rare-earth supply to Japan during a 2010 territorial dispute, but it lacked the means to exploit this chokepoint systematically. After it woke up to the threat of the United States’ exploitation of chokepoints, China stole a page from the American playbook. In 2020, Beijing put in place an export control law that repurposed the basic elements of the U.S. system. This was followed in 2024 by new regulations restricting the export of dual-use items. In short order, China built a bureaucratic apparatus to turn chokepoints into practical leverage. China also realized that in a world of weaponized interdependence, power comes not from possessing substitutable commodities but from controlling the technological stack. Just as the United States restricted the export of chip manufacturing equipment and software, China forbade the export of equipment necessary to process rare earths. These complex regulatory systems provide China not only with greater control but also with crucial information about who is buying what, allowing it to target other countries’ pain points with greater finesse.\nThis is why American and European manufacturers found themselves in a bind this June. China did not use its new export control system simply to retaliate against Trump but to squeeze Europe and discourage it from siding with the United States. German car manufacturers such as Mercedes and BMW worried as much as their U.S. competitors that their production lines would grind to a halt without specialized magnets. When the United States and China first reached a provisional deal, Trump announced on Truth Social that “FULL MAGNETS, AND ANY NECESSARY RARE EARTHS, WILL BE SUPPLIED, UP FRONT, BY CHINA,” recognizing the urgency of the threat to the U.S. economy. China’s long-term problem is that its state is too powerful and too willing to intervene in the domestic economy for purely political purposes, hampering investment and potentially strangling innovation. Still, in the short term, it has built the critical capacity to reimpose controls as it deems necessary to resist further U.S. demands.\nALL TALK\nWhether Europe can withstand pressure from Beijing—and, for that matter, from Washington—remains an open question. Europe has many of the capacities of a geoeconomic superpower but lacks the institutional machinery to make use of them. The SWIFT system, after all, is based in Belgium, as is Euroclear, the settlement infrastructure for many euro-based assets. European companies—including the Dutch semiconductor lithography giant ASML, the German enterprise software firm SAP, and the Swedish 5G provider Ericsson—occupy key chokepoints in technology stacks. The European single market is by some measures the second largest in the world, potentially allowing it to squeeze companies that want to sell goods to European businesses and consumers.\nBut that would require Europe to build its own comprehensive suite of institutions and independent stack of technologies. That is unlikely to happen in the short to medium term, unless the nascent “EuroStack” project, which aims to secure Europe from foreign interference by building an independent information technology base, really takes off. Even though Europe woke up to the danger of weaponized interdependence during the first Trump administration, it quickly fell back asleep.\nIn fairness, the EU’s weaknesses also reflect its unique circumstances: it depends on an outside military patron. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has heightened Europe’s short-term dependence on the United States, even as European countries struggle to bolster their defensive capacities. The Biden administration put a friendly gloss on economic coercion, coordinating with European governments such as the Netherlands to limit exports of ASML’s machinery to China. At the same time, the United States provided Europe with the detailed intelligence that it needed to wield financial sanctions and export controls against Russia, obviating the need for Europe to develop its own abilities.\nEurope’s lassitude is heightened by internal divisions. When China imposed a series of export restrictions on Lithuania to punish it for its political support of Taiwan in 2021, German companies pressed the Lithuanian government to de-escalate. Again and again, Europe’s response to the threat of Chinese economic coercion has been kneecapped by European companies desperate to maintain their access to Chinese markets. At the same time, measures to increase economic security are repeatedly watered down by EU member states or qualified by trade missions to Beijing, which are full of senior officials eager to make deals.\nMost profoundly, Europe finds it nearly impossible to act coherently on economic security because its countries jealously retain individual control over national security, whereas the EU as a whole manages trade and key aspects of market regulation. There are many highly competent officials scattered throughout the European Commission’s trade directorate and the national capitals of member states but few ways for them to coordinate on large-scale actions combining economic instruments with national security objectives.\nThe result is that Europe has a profusion of economic security goals but lacks the means to achieve them. Although European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has warned of “the risk of weaponization of interdependencies,” and her commission has prepared a genuinely sophisticated strategy for European economic security, it doesn’t have the bureaucratic tools to deliver results. It has no equivalent of the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which is capable of gathering information and targeting measures against opponents, or of China’s new export control machinery.\nOne immediate test is whether Europe will use its purported big bazooka, the “anti-coercion instrument,” or let it rust into obsolescence. This complex legal mechanism—which allows the EU to respond to coercion through a broad set of tools, including limiting market access, foreign direct investment, and public procurement—is supposed to allow Brussels to retaliate against allies and adversaries. The instrument was conceived as a response to the threat of Trump’s first administration and hastily retrofitted to provide a means of pushing back against China.\nFrom the beginning, however, European officials made it clear that they hoped they would never have to actually use the anti-coercion instrument, believing that its mere existence would be a sufficient deterrent. That has turned out to be a grave misjudgment. The anti-coercion instrument is encumbered with legalistic safeguards intended to ensure that the European Commission will not deploy it without sufficient approval from EU member states. Those safeguards make other powers such as China and the United States doubt that it will ever be used against them. Its lengthy deployment process will give them the opportunity they need to disarm any enforcement action, using threats and promises to mobilize internal opposition against it. As with earlier European efforts to block sanctions, China and the United States can usually bet on the EACO principle that “Europe Always Chickens Out” in geoeconomic confrontations. Europe lacks the information, institutional clout, and internal agreement to do much else.\nThe anti-coercion instrument is the exact opposite of the “Doomsday Machine” in the film Dr. Strangelove, the classic Cold War satire. That machine was a disaster because it automatically launched nuclear missiles in response to an attack but was kept a closely guarded secret until an attack was launched. In contrast, European officials talk incessantly about their doomsday device, but Europe’s adversaries feel sure that it will never be deployed; that certainty encourages them to coerce European companies and countries at their leisure.\nSELF-SABOTAGE\nEurope is hampered by structural weaknesses, but the United States’ difficulties largely result from its own choices. After decades of slowly building the complex machinery of economic warfare, the United States is ripping it apart.\nThis is in part an unintended consequence of domestic politics. The second Trump administration imposed a hiring freeze across the federal government, hitting many institutions including the Treasury’s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, which oversees OFAC, and leaving key positions unfilled and departments understaffed. Initial budget proposals anticipate an overall reduction in funding for the office, even as the number of sanctions-related programs has continued to rise. Although U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has expressed support for his department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which is chiefly responsible for export controls, the agency lost over a dozen employees as part of the government’s sweeping force reductions. OFAC and the BIS were never as all-seeing as their reputations suggested and sometimes made mistakes. Nonetheless, they provided Washington with an extraordinary edge. Other countries had no equivalent to OFAC’s maps of global finance or the detailed understanding of semiconductor supply chains developed by key officials on Biden’s National Security Council.\nSuch institutional decay is the inevitable consequence of Trumpism. In Trump’s eyes, all institutional restraints on his power are illegitimate. This has led to a large overhaul of the apparatus that has served to direct economic security decisions over the last decades. As the journalist Nahal Toosi has documented in Politico, the National Security Council, which is supposed to coordinate security policy across the federal government and agencies, has cut its staff by more than half. The State Department has been decimated by job cuts, while the traditional interagency process through which policy gets made and communicated has virtually disappeared, leaving officials in the dark over what is expected of them and allowing adventurous officials to fill the vacuum with their own uncoordinated initiatives. Instead, policy is centered on Trump himself and whoever has last talked to him in the uncontrolled cavalcade of visitors streaming through the Oval Office. As personalism replaces bureaucratic decision-making, short-term profit trumps long-term national interest.\nThis is leading to pushback from allies—and from U.S. courts. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney recently warned that “the United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony.” U.S. federal courts, which have long been exceedingly deferential to the executive when it comes to national security issues, may be having second thoughts. In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade issued a striking decision, holding that the United States had overstepped its authority when it invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act—the legal bedrock for much of U.S. coercive power—to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico. That decision has been appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, but the judgment is likely just the first of many challenges. Notably, the trade case resulted from a complaint filed by conservative and libertarian lawyers.\nThe Trump administration’s assault on state institutions is weakening the material sources of American power. Across core sectors—finance, technology, and energy—the administration is making the United States less central than it used to be. Trump and his allies are aggressively pushing cryptocurrencies, which are more opaque and less accountable than the traditional greenback, and forswearing enforcement actions against cryptocurrency platforms that enable sanctions evasion and money laundering. In April, the U.S. government lifted sanctions against Tornado Cash, a service that had laundered hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of stolen cryptocurrency for North Korea, according to the U.S. Department of Treasury. And the bipartisan American love affair with stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency, is pushing China and Europe to accelerate their efforts to develop alternative payment systems.\nEconomic interdependence has been turned against the United States.\nIn some instances, the Trump administration has reversed Biden’s policies and promoted the diffusion of previously controlled technology. In a remarkable deal with the United Arab Emirates, the Trump administration agreed to facilitate the massive expansion of data centers in the region using advanced U.S. semiconductors despite continued relations between the UAE and China and warnings from policy experts that the United States should not depend on the Middle East for AI.\nMost recently, the spending bill that Trump and his congressional allies pushed through earlier this summer effectively cedes control of next-generation energy technology to China by doubling down on the carbon economy. Even as Washington works to counteract Chinese influence over critical minerals, it is eliminating measures aimed at minimizing U.S. dependence on Chinese supply chains in the crucial areas of renewable energy and battery development and radically defunding its investment in science. The result is that the United States will face the unenviable choice between relying on Chinese energy technology or trying its best to make do with the moribund technologies of an earlier age.\nOne might have expected that the United States would respond to the age of weaponized interdependence as it responded to the earlier era of nuclear proliferation: by recalibrating its long-term strategy, building the institutional capabilities necessary to make good policy, and strengthening its global position. Instead, it is placing its bets on short-term dealmaking, gutting institutional capacity to analyze information and coordinate policy, and poisoning the economic and technological hubs that it still controls.\nThis does not just affect Washington’s ability to coerce others; it also undermines the attractiveness of key U.S. economic platforms. The use of weaponized interdependence always exploited the advantages of the “American stack”: the mutually reinforcing suite of institutional and technological relationships that drew others into the United States’ orbit. When used wisely, weaponization advanced slowly and within boundaries that others could tolerate.\nNow, however, the United States is spiraling into a rapid and uncontrollable drawdown of its assets, pursuing short-term goals at the expense of long-term objectives. It is increasingly using its tools in a haphazard way that invites miscalculations and unanticipated consequences. And it is doing so in a world in which other countries are not only developing their own capacities to punish the United States but also building technological stacks that may be more appealing to the world than the United States’. If China leaps ahead on energy technology, as seems likely, other countries are going to be pulled into its orbit. Dark warnings from the United States about the risks of dependence on China will ring hollow to countries that are all too aware of how willing the United States is to weaponize interdependence for its own selfish purposes.\nTIME TO REBUILD\nIn the first decades of the nuclear age, American policymakers faced enormous uncertainty about how to achieve stability and peace. That led them to make major investments in institutions and strategic doctrines that could prevent nightmare scenarios. Washington, now entering a similar moment in the age of weaponized interdependence, finds itself in a particularly precarious position.\nThe current U.S. administration recognizes that the United States is not only able to exploit others’ economic vulnerabilities but also deeply vulnerable itself. Addressing these problems, however, would require the administration to act counter to Trump’s deepest instincts.\nThe main problem is that as national security and economic policy merge, governments have to deal with excruciatingly complex phenomena that are not under their control: global supply chains, international financial flows, and emerging technological systems. Nuclear doctrines focused on predicting a single adversary’s responses; today, when geopolitics is shaped in large part by weaponized interdependence, governments must navigate a terrain with many more players, figuring out how to redirect private-sector supply chains in directions that do not hurt themselves while anticipating the responses of a multitude of governmental and\nnongovernmental actors.\nMaking the United States capable of holding its own in the age of weaponized interdependence will require more than just halting the rapid, unscheduled disassembly of the bureaucratic structures that constrain seat-of-the-pants policymaking and self-dealing. Successful strategy in an age of weaponized interdependence requires building up these very institutions to make them more flexible and more capable of developing the deep expertise that is needed to understand an enormously complex world in which Washington’s adversaries now hold many of the cards. That may be a difficult sell for a political system that has come to see expertise as a dirty word, but it is vitally necessary to preserve the national interest.\nChina built a bureaucratic apparatus to turn chokepoints into practical leverage.\nWashington has focused more on thinking about how best to use these weapons than on when they ought not be used. Other countries have been willing to rely on U.S. technological and financial infrastructure despite the risks because they perceived the United States as a government whose self-interest was constrained, at least to some extent, by the rule of law and a willingness to consider the interests of its allies. That calculus has shifted, likely irreversibly, as the second Trump administration has made it clear that it views the countries that the United States has historically been closest to less as allies than as vassal states. Without clear and enforceable limits on U.S. coercion, the most dominant U.S.-based multinational firms, such as Google and J. P. Morgan, will find themselves trapped in the no man’s land of a new war zone, taking incoming fire from all sides. As countries work to insulate themselves from U.S. coercion (and American infrastructure), global markets are experiencing deep fragmentation and fracturing. There is “a growing acceptance of fragmentation” in the global economy, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has warned, and “maybe even more troubling—I think there’s a growing sense that ours may not be the best fragment to be associated with.”\nThat, in turn, suggests a deeper lesson. The United States benefited from its ability to weaponize interdependence over the last quarter century. It enjoyed the advantages of an international economy based on multilateral institutions and a technological regime built around its self-image as a liberal power, even while acting in unilateral and sometimes illiberal ways to secure its interests as it saw fit. Just a year ago, some American intellectuals and policymakers hoped that this system could survive into the indefinite future, so that unilateral U.S. coercive strength and liberal values would continue to go hand in hand.\nThat now seems extremely unlikely. The United States is faced with a choice: a world in which aggressive American coercion and U.S. hegemonic decline reinforce each other or one in which Washington realigns itself with other liberal-minded countries by forswearing the abuse of its unilateral powers. Not too long ago, American officials and many intellectuals perceived the age of weaponized interdependence and the age of American hegemony as one and the same. Such assumptions now seem outdated, as other countries gain these weapons, too. As during the nuclear era, the United States needs to turn away from unilateralism, toward détente and arms control, and, perhaps in the very long term, toward rebuilding an interdependent global economy on more robust foundations. A failure to do so will put both American security and American prosperity at risk.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "The New Economic Geography", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/new-economic-geography-posen", "text": "The post-American world economy has arrived. U.S. President Donald Trump’s radical shift in economic approach has already begun to change norms, behaviors, and institutions globally. Like a major earthquake, it has given rise to new features in the landscape and rendered many existing economic structures unusable. This event was a political choice, not an inevitable natural disaster. But the changes that it is driving are here to stay. No guardrails will automatically restore the previous status quo.\nTo understand these changes, many analysts and politicians focus on the degree to which supply chains and trade in manufactured goods are shifting between the United States and China. But that focus is too narrow. Asking whether the United States or China will remain central to the world’s economy—or looking primarily at trade balances—yields a dramatic underestimate of the scope and impact of Trump’s changed approach and how comprehensively the prior U.S. framework undergirded the economic decisions made by almost every state, financial institution, and company worldwide.\nIn essence, the global public goods that the United States provided after the end of World War II—among others, the ability to securely navigate the air and seas, the presumption that property is safe from expropriation, rules for international trade, and stable dollar assets in which to transact business and store money—can be thought of, in economic terms, as forms of insurance. The United States collected premiums from the countries that participated in the system it led in a variety of ways, including through its ability to set rules that made the U.S. economy the most attractive one to investors. In return, the societies that bought into the system were freed to expend much less effort on securing their economies against uncertainty, enabling them to pursue the commerce that helped them flourish.\nSome pressures had been building within this system before Trump’s ascent. But particularly in his second term, Trump has switched the United States’ role from global insurer to extractor of profit. Instead of the insurer securing its clients against external threats, under the new regime, the threat against which insurance is sold comes as much from the insurer as from the global environment. The Trump administration promises to spare clients from its own assaults for a higher price than before. Trump has threatened to block access to American markets on a broad scale; made the protections that come with military alliances explicitly dependent on the purchase of U.S. weapons, energy, and industrial products; required foreigners who want to operate businesses in the United States to make side payments to his personal priorities; and pressured Mexico, Vietnam, and other countries to drop Chinese industrial inputs or investment by Chinese companies. These acts are on a scale unprecedented in modern U.S. governance.\nThe United States’ withdrawal of its former insurance will fundamentally change the behavior of the country’s clients and its clients’ clients—and not in the ways that Trump hopes. China, the country whose behavior most U.S. officials want to change, will likely be the least affected, while the United States’ closest allies will be the most damaged. As other U.S. partners watch these reliant allies suffer, they will seek to self-insure instead, at great cost to them. Assets will become harder to save and investment abroad less appealing. As their exposure to global economic and security risks rises, governments will find that both foreign diversification and macroeconomic policy have become less effective tools for stabilizing their economies.\nSome argue that Trump’s new posture will simply drive a potentially desirable realignment. In this view, although his program requires both governments and businesses to pay more for less, the world will ultimately accept its new normal, to the United States’ benefit. This is a delusion. In the world Trump’s program creates, everyone will suffer—not least the United States.\nGANGSTER’S PARADISE\nImagine that you were fortunate enough to inherit a piece of land by the ocean. It always offered great views and beach access. But you only invested in building a grand house on the lot when a well-regulated, reliable company came along that offered sufficient home insurance. You had to pay a pretty penny for it, of course. But that company’s coverage also enabled the owners of nearby lots to build, inspiring the creation of a rewarding neighborhood with roads, water, cell towers, rising home values—and most crucially, the guarantee that if you continued to pay premiums insuring you against floods and hurricanes, any further investments you made in your property would be at low risk.\nIn essence, this is the economic situation in which much of the world operated for nearly 80 years. The United States recouped enormous benefits by acting as the world’s dominant insurance provider after World War II. By assuming this role, it also maintained some control over other countries’ economic and security policies without having to resort to harsh threats. In return, countries that participated in the system were shielded from various forms of risk. Washington’s military supremacy and the mechanisms of international order that it enforced allowed national borders to remain mostly settled; most economies could thrive without the threat of conquest. Between 1980 and 2020, incomes converged overall both between and within the states that took part.\nEconomic injustices persisted; at times, they were imposed by the United States. But broadly, this global insurance regime was a win-win for nearly everyone with regard to economic stability, innovation, and growth. Violence and warfare declined overall, and poorer states were better able to integrate their economies with higher-income markets that opened up to trade. This security may have rested on a communal illusion about how little military investment and action it would take to keep geopolitics stable. But that regime persisted for decades, in part because U.S. policymakers in both parties valued the system and in part because enough outside actors believed in it and benefited from it.\nNow that sense of safety is gone. Imagine, again, your hypothetical beachfront house. Some threats to your property have started to increase: sea levels are rising, and hurricanes are becoming deadlier. Instead of simply raising your premium, however, your insurer—which you had long trusted and dutifully paid—suddenly begins to refuse your claims for damage unless you pay double your official rate and slip the insurer something extra under the table, too. Even if you do pay what is asked, the insurer then writes to say that it is tripling the price of your general premium for less comprehensive coverage. Alternative insurers are not available. Meanwhile, your taxes begin to rise, and your day-to-day public services become less reliable because of the demands that disaster response is placing on your community.\nThe United States profited handsomely from being an insurance provider.\nTrump is not the only actor responsible for the breakdown of the economic regime that prevailed for 80 years. The list of contributing factors—the underlying threats not posed by your home insurer, in the beach house analogy—is long. The rise of China, and the United States’ response, played a part. So, too, did climate change, the advance of information technology, and the U.S. electorate’s understandable loss of trust in incumbent elites after the country’s interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, the 2008–9 global financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBut the Trump administration’s policies constitute a clear turning point. The president’s supporters sometimes portray these as a mere repricing of risk: the free world’s insurer is adjusting its fees and services to fit new realities and correct a previous tendency to underprice its offerings. This depiction is mistaken. The Trump administration has made clear that it wants the United States to operate a completely different kind of scheme, in which it weaponizes and maintains uncertainty in order to extract as much as it can for as little as possible in return.\nTrump and his advisers would argue that this is simple reciprocity or fair treatment for countries that, in their view, exploited the United States for decades. Yet those countries never extracted anything that remotely matched what the United States received: dirt cheap long-term loans to the U.S. government; disproportionately massive foreign investment in American corporations and the U.S. workforce; a near-global adherence to U.S. technical and legal standards that advantaged U.S.-based producers; reliance on the U.S. financial system for the vast majority of global transactions and reserves; compliance with U.S. initiatives on sanctions; payments for garrisoning American troops; widespread dependence on the U.S. defense industry; and best of all, a sustained rise in the American standard of living. Not only did the United States profit handsomely from being an insurance provider that others valued, but its allies also ceded many important security-related decisions to Washington.\nThe great thing about providing insurance is that for years at a time, you don’t have to do or pay anything to collect your premiums. That is even truer for the form of economic insurance the United States provided globally than it is for a home insurance provider, because the very existence of the U.S. security guarantees reduced the real-world threats to policyholders. This reduced the claims paid out. But the Trump administration is jettisoning this profitable and steady business model in favor of one that reinforces the opposite cycle. Ever-fewer clients will become more at risk. Already, businesses, governments, and investors are fundamentally changing their practices to try to self-insure instead.\nFIGHT OR FLIGHT\nIn truth, Trump’s approach will do the greatest damage to the economies that are most closely tied to the U.S. economy and took the previous rules of the game most for granted: Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. Take Japan: it had bet on the United States long term, investing substantially in U.S.-located production for over 45 years and transferring its technological and managerial innovations along the way. It has placed a larger share of its people’s savings in U.S. Treasuries for longer than any other economy. Japan agreed to serve as the United States’ floating aircraft carrier on the frontline with China, and it garrisons U.S. troops in Okinawa despite growing domestic opposition. Japan supported the first Trump administration in the G-7 and the G-20, followed the Biden administration in adopting parallel sanctions against Russia after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and, since 2013, has increased its military spending substantially in line with U.S. policy priorities.\nUntil this year, what Japan got in return was reliable platinum-tier coverage. Japanese investors and businesses were able to take it for granted that they could sell products competitively in the U.S. market, get their savings in and out of U.S. Treasury bonds and other dollar-denominated assets as needed, and safely invest in production in the United States. Japan’s economic strategy heading into Trump’s second term was based on the assumption that this coverage would continue, if at a higher price: in 2023 and 2024, Japanese companies announced investment plans that emphasized their readiness to put even more capital into U.S. industries, including uncompetitive ones such as steel, and forgo some market share in China to coordinate with the United States.\nThe trade deal announced in mid-July between the United States and Japan has increased the price tag for Japan well beyond that and diminished Japan’s coverage. The 15 percent tariffs imposed on the country are ten times what they had been and affect autos and auto parts, steel, and other major Japanese industries. Japan committed to creating a fund that invests an additional 14 percent of the country’s GDP into the United States—its monies spent at Trump’s personal discretion—that will cede a share of any profits to the United States. This constitutes a huge downgrade in Japanese savers’ expected returns and control compared with their prior private-sector investments, which were not subjected to such arbitrary U.S. government oversight. Explicit provisions requiring Japan to buy U.S. aircraft, rice, and other agricultural products, as well as support Alaskan natural gas extraction, expose the country to new risks. Even if Japan delivers on the agreement, it will remain vulnerable to Trump’s potential decisions to unilaterally raise its premium and reduce its coverage even further. Meanwhile, Washington’s recent accommodations to China on the semiconductor trade further diminish the benefits for Japan of pursuing an alliance-based economic path.\nU.S. allies will not accept a “rebalancing” imposed on them.\nThe Trump administration expected that its key allies would simply pay any price for U.S. protection. So far, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom have followed an approach closest to the one that the Trump administration anticipated. In the near term, these countries have decided that their fates must lie with the United States, whatever the cost. But Trump underestimated the degree to which allies’ closeness to the United States would lead them to register Washington’s new stance as a shocking betrayal. The popularity of the United States has declined sharply: in the Pew Research Center’s spring 2025 survey on attitudes toward the United States, the proportion of Japanese citizens who viewed the country favorably had slid by 15 percentage points from a year earlier; the country’s favorability rating had plummeted by 20 points among Canadians and 32 points among Mexicans. This large and negative shift reflects the sense of disappointment that only those truly invested in a relationship can feel.\nNational security concerns, existing ties, and—in the case of Canada and Mexico—geographical proximity will limit the degree to which the United States’ closest allies can undo their economic dependence. Yet they have more room to do so than advocates of Trump’s economic approach appreciate. Canada has resisted Trump’s attempts to unilaterally revise the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and impose asymmetrically high tariffs on Canadian goods. Prime Minister Mark Carney and all of Canada’s provincial premiers announced in July that, to reduce the country’s dependence on the United States, they had agreed to limit their concessions to Trump’s escalating demands and actively pursue increased internal integration. Carney also vowed to expand trade with the EU and other entities.\nOther close U.S. allies such as Australia and South Korea will probably decide that in the near term, they have no choice but to throw in their lot with the United States. Over time, however, allies may well tire of the declining benefits that appeasement yields and reorient their investments. Like Canada, they will try to expand their ties with China, the EU, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). But this reorientation will yield a worse outcome for all these economies. They relied economically on the United States for good reason; if substitute markets, investments, and products were just as valuable, they would have chosen those in the first place. In the absence of fairly priced U.S. insurance, the value proposition changes.\nLEFT BEHIND\nThe seismic Trump shock has hit other major economic land masses, too. ASEAN and the EU were always less fully aligned with the United States on economic and security policy than the five most integrated allies were. The two blocs are diverse, with a variety of commercial specializations, advantages, and political orientations within their memberships. Yet they and their member states—particularly Germany, France, the Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden, and Vietnam—have also based their economic behavior on the insurance the United States previously provided. As a result, they came to play leading roles in U.S. supply chains and technology investment. Their governments and citizens poured money into the U.S. economy through foreign direct investment, purchases of Treasury bonds, and participation in the U.S. stock market. They agreed to join U.S. sanctions and export-control regimes, albeit less consistently, and directly supported the U.S. military.\nTrump has now subjected these countries to massive tariffs and tariff threats as well as bilateral requests for specific accommodations and side payments, such as demands that they purchase more U.S. natural gas or transfer industrial production to the United States. These economic players have more choice in how much effort they want to devote toward maintaining ties with the United States. And they are shifting their behavior more rapidly, strengthening economic linkages with one another and with China. ASEAN and the EU both had greater commercial ties to China than to the United States to begin with; that gap is widening, not only because the Chinese economy is growing but also because the United States is limiting its exports to and imports from China and its investment there. Over the past decade, the share of Chinese inputs into European and Southeast Asian industrial supply chains rose steeply as the United States’ share fell.\nIt is not sustainable for the EU, and certainly not for ASEAN, to economically isolate China, and the gains from doing business with China will only increase as the United States leaves the scene. Commerce with China does not substitute for the insurance that the United States previously provided. But as the Trump regime makes the United States less competitive as a site for production and limits access to the U.S. market (shrinking that market’s growth potential), an expansion of trade and investment with China can provide these blocs with a partial offset. As sizable economic entities in their own right, Asian and European countries have a far greater ability to pursue a different path, even though they will be spending more to self-insure than they used to. For instance, orders for Eurofighter jets as an alternative to U.S. combat aircraft have surged among NATO members such as Spain and Turkey. And the Indonesian government, in the spring of 2025, struck new economic deals with China, including an approximately $3 billion “twin” industrial park project that will link Central Java with Fujian Province. The project is expected to create thousands of jobs in Indonesia at a moment when nothing of that kind is on offer from the United States. Indonesia’s central bank and the People’s Bank of China have also agreed to promote trade in local currencies, and the two countries have vowed to strengthen their maritime cooperation; both deals surprised U.S. policymakers.\nAdditionally (and crucially), Trump’s economic policy is reinforcing and accelerating the separation of two clear tiers of emerging markets in terms of their resilience to macroeconomic shocks. During the 1998–99 and 2008–9 financial crises, even the largest emerging economies—Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Turkey—suffered badly. But they have become substantially more resilient, thanks to domestic reforms as well as new export and investment opportunities offered by richer countries (including China). During the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s subsequent enormous interest-rate increase, their economies did not suffer much financial damage. The largest emerging markets remained able to adjust their fiscal and monetary policies with some autonomy.\nDozens of lower- and middle-income economies, by contrast, accumulated debt at a devastating pace. Since 2000, the decline in real income in these countries has more than offset the gains they had made in the previous decade. Trump’s new approach has further closed off their economic opportunities, and the way he has encouraged the larger emerging markets, particularly India, to adopt their own homeland-first policies only deepens poorer economies’ isolation.\nCapital seeks opportunity, but also security. The U.S. withdrawal of economic insurance, and Trump’s hard turn against foreign aid and development, will reinforce investors’ preference for relatively stable locales. Thus, the poorest countries in Central America, Central and South Asia, and Africa are likely to become stuck in the economic lowlands with little means of exit while the larger, geopolitically significant emerging markets will, relatively speaking, become more attractive. Some of the poorest countries will make deals—for instance, by providing the United States with preferred access to their resources or serving as destinations for U.S. deportees. That response, however, cannot yield the kind of sustainable growth that many emerging economies enjoyed under the old U.S. insurance regime.\nSOLID AND LIQUID\nPerhaps the most important change the United States has made to its insurance scheme, however, is to reduce the dollar’s liquidity—which diminishes the safety of the portfolios of savers worldwide. U.S. assets that were previously viewed as low-to-no-risk can no longer be considered entirely safe. This will have far-reaching ramifications for the global availability and flow of capital.\nDuring Trump’s 2024 election campaign and since he took office, top officials in his administration have repeatedly threatened to trap investors in U.S. Treasuries by, for example, forcing countries and institutions to swap their current holdings for longer-term or perpetual debt, punishing governments that promote the use of currencies other than the dollar, and taxing foreign investors at higher rates than domestic ones. Trump administration officials have not yet followed through. But these threats, combined with repeated attacks on the Federal Reserve’s independence and promises to depreciate the dollar, are steadily undermining the perceived stability of the dollar and Treasury bonds.\nThe underlying problem is that the world has more savings than it has safe places to stow them. Cash-rich surplus economies—places such as China, Germany, and Saudi Arabia, as well as smaller but striking examples such as Norway, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates—cannot keep all their savings at home for three reasons. First, their savers would lack diversification if a country-specific shock hits their economy. Second, forcing huge amounts of savings into these mostly small markets would distort asset prices, leading to bubbles, financial instability, and abrupt shifts in employment patterns. And third, such countries do not issue enough public debt, at least not enough that foreigners want to hold. This is why, for decades, the uniquely deep, broad, and apparently safe U.S. Treasuries market—and dollar-denominated assets in general—have absorbed the lion’s share of the world’s excess savings.\nU.S. assets that were once viewed as low-to-no-risk are no longer safe.\nAmong the many benefits that Treasury bonds and other U.S. public markets offered to global investors, the most attractive was ample liquidity. Investors could convert assets they had in these markets into cash with few or no delays or costs. The valuation of their investments remained stable, and unlike in smaller markets, even a very large transaction would not swing prices. Investors did not have to worry that their counterparties would not accept their form of payment. With the exception of known criminals and entities targeted by sanctions, everyone in the world could rely on both the stability and flexibility of dollar-denominated investments—which in turn lowered the risk that businesses would face cash-flow crunches or miss opportunities.\nThe dollar’s dominance, which went well beyond what the United States’ GDP or share of global trade would have justified, constituted another win-win type of insurance. The United States collected premiums in the form of lower interest on its debt and steadier exchange rates. American and foreign asset holders both benefited. Even when a financial or geopolitical shock originated in the United States, investors assumed that the U.S. economy would remain safer than others. When U.S. markets directly triggered a worldwide recession in 2008, interest rates and the dollar fell and then rose together as capital from abroad flowed into the U.S. market.\nNow the dollar appears to be behaving the way that most currencies do, which is to move in the opposite direction to interest rates. Until April of this year, the dollar closely tracked the day-to-day movements of the U.S. ten-year Treasury interest rate. Ever since the administration’s April 2 tariff announcements, the correlation between U.S. interest rates and the dollar has reversed, indicating that something other than day-to-day economic news is driving the dollar down.\nMultiple times this year, the Trump administration has announced a surprise policy change that provoked economic volatility: on April 2, the “Liberation Day” tariffs; in May, the “One Big Beautiful Bill” spending package; and, over the course of June, several threats to impose additional tariffs, as well as the U.S. bombing of Iran. In response to each of these events, the dollar fell while U.S. long-term interest rates rose, indicating a capital outflow in response to turmoil.\nSimilarly, throughout modern history, tariff impositions have led to currency appreciations, including during Trump’s first term. This year, however, the dollar has depreciated as the president has imposed tariffs. This major break with the historical pattern suggests that global concerns about the instability of U.S. policy have begun to outweigh the usual flight to safety that pushes up the dollar.\nThe Trump administration’s hostile and unpredictable approach toward U.S.-led military alliances has further eroded support for the dollar. Washington’s new stance heightens the risk that it will sanction even allied foreign investors. And as the American-led alliances have less power to reassure, other governments are boosting their defense spending, which increases the relative attractiveness of their currencies. EU bond markets, for instance, are becoming bigger and deeper as debt-financed defense spending surges in northern and eastern Europe. The euro offers more benefit to Ukraine, the Balkan States, and some Middle Eastern and North African countries that aim to reduce their vulnerability to U.S. whims by seeking euro-denominated arms, trade, investment, loans, and development aid.\nDEBT COLLECTORS\nEuropean and other markets, however, cannot fully replicate the advantages that dollar-denominated assets formerly conferred. The world’s investors, including American ones, will simply have fewer safe places to put their savings as U.S. assets become less liquid. This increased insecurity will drive up long-term average interest rates on U.S. government debt just when a lot more debt is being issued. All borrowers, private and sovereign, that participate in the U.S. financial system will feel the pinch of that interest-rate rise because all loans are priced off Treasury rates in some sense.\nSome savers, particularly Chinese ones, may seek to move assets out of U.S. markets. But that flight will put deflationary pressure on their home economies as their overall returns shrink and excess savings become bottled up in markets that already had a more limited set of investment opportunities. Meanwhile, the value of alternative assets—nondollar currencies, commodities traditionally treated as stores of value such as gold and timber, and newer cryptocurrency products—will surge. Because these assets are less liquid, these upswings will almost certainly lead to periodic financial crashes and greatly complicate the challenges governments face in using monetary policy to stabilize economies. This will be a loss for the world with no net gain for the U.S. economy.\nJust as persistent droughts motivate people to zealously guard access to their water supplies, a lack of liquidity in global markets encourages governments to ensure that their debt is funded at home rather than leaving it up to the market. These measures typically take the form of what is called financial repression: forcing financial institutions (and ultimately, households) to hold more public debt than they otherwise would, through some combination of regulations, capital outflow controls, and the forced allocation of newly issued debt. Financial repression tends to lower returns for savers and drives up their vulnerability to de facto expropriation.\nUltimately, the diminished availability of financing makes it harder for privately owned businesses as well as governments to ride out temporary downturns before exhausting their funding. They will have to accumulate reserves to cover dollar obligations (such as outstanding or interbank loans) in case of financial distress. If countries have to self-insure, both governments and businesses will become more risk-averse and have less available to invest, especially abroad, reinforcing the fragmentation of the world’s economy.\nLOSE-LOSE\nWithout the insurance that the United States provided, new links between economies and pathways for investment will emerge. But they will be costlier to build and maintain, less broadly accessible, and less dependable. Countries will undoubtedly seek to self-insure, but those efforts will inherently be more costly and less effective than when risk was pooled under a single insurer. Navigating the world’s economy was never a smooth road. But after the earthquake of Trump’s economic regime change, the terrain has become much rougher.\nIn the end, money spent on insurance is money that cannot be spent on other things. Governments, institutions, and companies will have to pay simply to hedge against bad outcomes instead of funding good ones. Opportunities for investment and consumer choices will narrow. Growth in productivity (and therefore growth in real incomes) will slow as commercial competition, innovation, and global cooperation to create new infrastructure contract. Many of the poorest emerging markets will lose coverage against threats altogether—at the very moment when the risks they face are sharply increasing.\nThis means a worse world for almost everyone. Amid this change, however, China’s immediate economic environment will be the least altered despite Trump’s previous claims that he would design his economic policies to target Beijing most aggressively. China is relatively well positioned to attempt to self-insure after a U.S. withdrawal. More than any other major economy, it had already begun to reduce its reliance on the United States for exports, imports, investment, and technology. Whether China will be able to capture new external opportunities in the United States’ retreat will depend on whether it can overcome other countries’ skepticism about its reliability as an insurer. Will it merely seek to run the same kind of protection racket as the United States—or a worse one?\nIt is a tragic and destructive irony that, in the name of national security, the United States is now injuring the allies that have contributed the most to its economic well-being while leaving China far less disadvantaged. That is why Trump officials’ belief that these close allies will simply accept the “rebalancing” imposed on them is profoundly mistaken. These governments will be pragmatic, but that pragmatism will take a very different form than the Trump administration desires. For decades, they gave Washington the benefit of the doubt. Now they are losing their illusions and will offer less to the United States, not more.\nTrump’s actions will alter China’s immediate economic environment the least.\nThere will be opportunities in this new landscape. But they will involve the U.S. economy less and less. The most promising possibility is that European and Asian countries, excluding China, will join to create a new space of relative stability. The EU and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, an alliance composed of mostly Indo-Pacific states, are already exploring new forms of cooperation. In June, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, described these negotiations as an effort at “redesigning” the World Trade Organization to “show the world that free trade with a large number of countries is possible on a rules-based foundation.” These economies could also do more to guarantee mutual investment rights, create binding mechanisms for settling trade disputes, and pool their liquidity to respond to financial shocks. They could seek to maintain the function and influence of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization, protecting these institutions from paralysis as China or the United States seek to veto necessary initiatives.\nIf they want to sustain some fraction of the global economy’s prior openness and stability, however, these countries will have to build blocs with a selective membership rather than pursue a strictly multilateral approach. This would be a poor substitute for the system over which the United States had presided. But it would be much better than simply accepting the economy that the Trump administration is now creating.\nAs for the United States itself, no matter how many bilateral trade deals it brokers, no matter how many economies appear—at first—to align with Washington at a high cost, the country will find itself increasingly bypassed in commerce and technology and less able to influence other countries’ investment and security decisions. The U.S. supply chains that the Trump administration claims to want to secure will become less reliable—inherently costlier, less diversified in their sourcing, and subject to more risk from U.S.-specific shocks. Leaving behind much of the developing world will not only increase migrant flows and trigger public health crises; it will prevent the United States from tapping potential market opportunities. The Trump administration’s moves to drive away foreign investment will erode U.S. living standards and the U.S. military’s capacity. European, Asian, and even Brazilian and Turkish brands will likely gain market share at American companies’ expense, while technical standards for products such as automobiles and financial services technologies will increasingly diverge from U.S. norms. Many of these phenomena will be self-reinforcing, making them hard to reverse even after Trump leaves the White House.\nAs the song goes, you don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone.

{"title": "The Price of Primacy", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/price-primacy", "text": "To the Editor:\nIn “Dispensable Nation” (July/August 2025), Kori Schake makes a compelling case against U.S. President Donald Trump’s foreign policy, which she argues is jeopardizing the rules-based global order the United States crafted after World War II. But Schake’s description goes too far. Despite Trump’s tirades against allies, his administration’s foreign policy remains quite conventional.\nThe U.S. global force posture under Trump is nearly identical to what it was under President Joe Biden, with Trump leaving the approximately 200,000 U.S. troops and hundreds of U.S. bases worldwide mostly as they were before he took office. Not a single U.S. alliance has been ruptured, and to the extent that disagreements occur between the United States and its allies, they center less on how those relationships should function and more on how much the allies are spending on their own militaries. Far from searching for alternatives to American power, allies in Europe and Asia are begging the United States to maintain its current level of support.\nInstead of worrying about the end of U.S. dominance in global affairs, one should question whether the juice of this dominance is worth the squeeze. Schake believes it is, but she neglects to mention any of the costs associated with continuing the status quo, foremost among them an unwillingness on the part of American officials to prioritize what issue is worthy of U.S. involvement. Other strains include a massive overextension of the U.S. military, an American defense-industrial complex unable to meet its work orders, and the propping up of security dependents rather than capable allies. None of that should just be swept under the rug.\nDaniel R.

{"title": "America’s Coming Crash", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/americas-coming-crash-rogoff", "text": "For much of the past quarter century, the rest of the world has looked in wonder at the United States’ ability to borrow its way out of trouble. Again and again, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, the government has used debt more vigorously than almost any other country to fight wars, global recessions, pandemics, and financial crises. Even as U.S. public debt rapidly climbed from one plateau to the next—net debt is now nearing 100 percent of national income—creditors at home and abroad showed no signs of debt fatigue. For years after the 2008–9 global financial crisis, interest rates on Treasury debt were ultralow, and a great many economists came to believe that they would remain so into the distant future. Thus, running government deficits—fresh borrowing—seemed a veritable free lunch. Even though debt-to-income levels jumped radically after each crisis, there was no apparent need to save up for the next one. Given the dollar’s reputation as the world’s premier safe and liquid asset, global bond market investors would always be happy to digest another huge pile of dollar debt, especially in a crisis situation in which uncertainty was high and safe assets were in short supply.\nThe past few years have cast serious doubt on those assumptions. For starters, bond markets have become far less submissive, and long-term interest rates have risen sharply on ten- and 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds. For a big debtor like the United States—the gross U.S. debt is now nearly $37 trillion, roughly as large as that of all the other major advanced economies combined—these higher rates can really hurt. When the average rate paid rises by one percent, that translates to $370 billion more in annual interest payments the government must make. In fiscal year 2024, the United States spent $850 billion on defense—more than any other country—but it spent an even larger sum, $880 billion, on interest payments. As of May 2025, all the major credit-rating agencies had downgraded U.S. debt, and there is a growing perception among banks and foreign governments that hold trillions of dollars in U.S. debt that the country’s fiscal policy may be going off the rails. The increasing unlikelihood that the ultralow borrowing rates of the 2010s will come back any time soon has made the situation all the more dangerous.\nThere is no magic fix. U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to place the blame for high rates on the Federal Reserve Board are deeply misleading. The Federal Reserve controls the overnight borrowing rate, but longer-term rates are set by vast global markets. If the Fed sets the overnight rate too low and markets expect inflation to rise, long-term rates will also rise. After all, unexpectedly high inflation is effectively a form of partial default, since investors get repaid in dollars whose purchasing power has been debased; if they come to expect high inflation, they will naturally require a higher return to compensate. One of the main reasons governments have an independent central bank is precisely to reassure investors that inflation will remain tame and thereby keep long-term interest rates low. If the Trump administration (or any other administration) moves to undermine the Fed’s independence, that would ultimately raise government borrowing costs, not lower them.\nSkepticism about the safety of holding Treasury debt has led to related doubts about the U.S. dollar. For decades, the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency has conferred lower interest rates on U.S. borrowing, reducing them by perhaps one-half to one percent. But with the United States taking on such extraordinary levels of debt, the dollar no longer looks unassailable, particularly amid other uncertainty about U.S. policy. In the near term, global central banks and foreign investors may decide to limit their total holdings of U.S. dollars. Over the medium and longer term, the dollar could lose market share to the Chinese yuan, the euro, and even cryptocurrency. Either way, foreign demand for U.S. debt will shrink, putting further upward pressure on U.S. interest rates and making the math of digging out of the debt hole still more daunting.\nAlready, the Trump administration has hinted at more drastic actions to deal with mounting debt payments, should gaining control of the Fed not be enough. The so-called Mar-a-Lago Accord, a strategy put forward in November 2024 by Stephen Miran, now head of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, suggests that the United States could selectively default on its payments to the foreign central banks and treasuries that hold trillions of U.S. dollars. Whether or not the proposal was ever taken seriously, its very existence has rattled global investors, and it is not likely to be forgotten. A clause proposed for the huge tax and spending bill that was passed by the U.S. Congress in July would have given the president discretion to impose a 20 percent tax on select foreign investors. Although that provision was removed from the final bill, it stands as a warning of what might come if the U.S. government finds itself under budget duress.\nWith long-term interest rates up sharply, public debt nearing its post–World War II peak, foreign investors becoming more skittish, and politicians showing little appetite for reining in fresh borrowing, the possibility of a once-in-a-century U.S. debt crisis no longer seems far-fetched. Debt and financial crisis tend to occur precisely when a country’s fiscal situation is already precarious, its interest rates are high, its political situation is paralyzed, and a shock catches policymakers on the back foot. The United States already checks the first three boxes; all that is missing is the shock. Even if the country avoids an outright debt crisis, a sharp erosion of confidence in its creditworthiness would have profound consequences. It is urgent for policymakers to recognize how and why these scenarios could unfold and what tools the government has to respond to them. In the long term, a severe debt or, more likely, an inflationary spiral could send the economy into a lost decade, drastically weakening the dollar’s position as the dominant global currency and undermining American power.\nTHEIR MONEY, OUR GAIN\nIt is crucial to understand that the Trump administration’s economic policies are an accelerant, rather than the fundamental cause, of the United States’ debt problem. The story really begins with President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, an era of deficit spending in which the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio was about a third of what it is today. As Vice President Dick Cheney said during the first George W. Bush administration, “Reagan proved deficits don’t matter.” It is an assumption that both parties appear to have taken to heart in the twenty-first century, despite far more worrying debt burdens. In fiscal year 2024, for example, the Biden administration ran a budget deficit of $1.8 trillion, or 6.4 percent of GDP. Except for the global financial crisis and the first year of the pandemic, that was a peacetime record, slightly exceeding the 6.1 percent of the previous year. President Joe Biden’s deficits would have been larger still but for determined resistance from two centrist Democratic senators who bid down some of the administration’s most expansive spending bills.\nDuring his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump pilloried Biden for his administration’s massive deficit spending. Yet in his second term in office, Trump has embraced similarly large deficits—six to seven percent of GDP for the rest of the decade, according to independent forecasts produced by the Congressional Budget Office and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The latter has projected that, by 2054, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio will reach 172 percent—or an even higher 190 percent if the bill’s provisions become permanent. Trump and his economic advisers claim that such forecasts are overly pessimistic—that the projections for growth are far too low and those for interest rates far too high. Higher growth will bring in larger future tax receipts; lower interest rates mean the debt will be less costly to service. If Team Trump is right, both factors will actually lower deficits and tilt the trajectory of debt to income downward. Whereas in January 2025, the CBO projected an annual growth rate of 1.8 percent over the next decade, the administration has put the figure at 2.8 percent. The difference is significant: if the U.S. economy is growing at 1.8 percent annually, it will double in size (and presumably tax revenues) every 39 years. At 2.8 percent, it would double every 25 years. For Trump, assuming that kind of rapid growth has made it easier to finance a lot of budget giveaways.\nThere is a substantive basis for the Trump administration’s growth projections, although it has little to do with the claimed benefits of the “big, beautiful bill” passed in July. Many prominent technology experts firmly believe that as long as the government stays out of the way, artificial intelligence companies will achieve Artificial General Intelligence, meaning AI models that can equal or outperform human experts at a wide variety of complex cognitive tasks, within ten years, leading to explosive productivity growth. Indeed, the progress of AI research has been breathtaking, and there are strong reasons for assuming that AI’s effect on the economy will be profound. But in the medium term, widespread adoption of AI could be hindered by multiple bottlenecks, including outsize energy requirements, data regulations, and legal liabilities. Moreover, as AI allows companies in some sectors to lay off scores of workers, public discontent could encourage populist politicians to push through policies that—along with aggressive limits on legal immigration, cuts in funding for scientific research, and the chaotic tariff war that are already underway—could dramatically slow the effects of AI on growth.\nRegardless of when and how the AI revolution unfolds, it’s possible that another major economic shock may not be far off. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a short-lived recession and the large-scale government response to it added debt roughly equivalent to 15 percent of GDP; in the case of the global financial crisis, the debt added was closer to 30 percent of GDP. It seems reasonable to assume that another shock approaching this magnitude—a cyberwar or even a full-blown military conflict, a climate catastrophe, or another financial crisis or pandemic—will come in the next five to seven years. One might view the more modest CBO growth projections as realistically balancing the odds that the economy could see fantastic growth, most likely driven by AI, with the odds of a new shock.\nHow fast the U.S. debt level grows will also depend on the interest rate. The CBO has estimated that the government will have to pay an average interest rate of 3.6 percent through 2055. (This average takes into account that the government borrows at both short- and long-term maturities.) Here, too, the Trump administration views the CBO as far too pessimistic. The president seems to believe that the economy can go back to the extremely low interest rates of his first term, when they averaged less than half the current rates and there was only very modest inflation. It is hard otherwise to understand why he would be pressing for the Fed to cut its short-term policy interest rates by as much as three percentage points.\nTrump’s view should not be dismissed out of hand. Several members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which periodically reports where it believes the Fed’s short-term policy rate will land in a couple of years, see much lower rates as the central scenario. Yet with the 30-year Treasury bill rate near five percent as of late July, market indicators do not signal that a sharp drop in long-term rates is coming. If they remain at or near this level, there are real risks to continuing to push up the debt, especially when the biggest crisis in the U.S. economy for now is a political one.\nMAGIC MOUNTAIN\nWashington’s failure to deal with its runaway debt problem is in part the result of misguided (or at least oversold) economic theories that took hold over the last two decades. Throughout most of modern history, it was thought that prudent government debt management involved bringing down the ratio of debt to GDP during quiescent periods of growth in order to store fiscal ammunition for the next crisis. In the 1800s, the United Kingdom used debt to fight one war after another, taking advantage of the time in between to repair its finances. Likewise, although the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio was very high during World War II, it quickly declined in the years that followed; since the United States had just fought two world wars, policymakers feared there might be yet another. To pay for the Korean War, the Eisenhower administration famously raised taxes instead of relying mainly on debt. But in the years following the global financial crisis, the persistent very low interest rates that took hold caused a number of leading economists to question this orthodoxy.\nIn his influential theory of secular stagnation, the former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers posited that real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates would stay low indefinitely because of factors such as adverse demographics, low productivity growth, and chronically weak global demand. Others, such as the economist Paul Krugman and Olivier Blanchard, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, suggested that the secular stagnation cloud had a silver lining in that reliably low rates allow the government to use fiscal policy aggressively without worrying too much about the cost. Normal economic growth would continually swell tax revenues by more than enough to cover glacially rising interest bills on the national debt, the thinking went, at least on average over time. Indeed, so rosy was the interest-rate picture in the 2010s that some economists, including proponents of modern monetary theory, argued that there would be little risk to running larger deficits even when the economy was growing briskly. In this view, which was embraced by progressive politicians such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders, deficit spending was a low-cost means of paying for social investment, including ambitious climate protections and policies to reduce inequality.\nA once-in-a-century U.S. debt crisis no longer seems far-fetched.\nTo be fair, Democrats were hardly in universal agreement about any debt-driven approach. Even as he ran outsize deficits to pay for progressive priorities, Biden made clear that over the long run, he hoped to meet the cost by raising taxes, and he might have done so with a larger Democratic majority in the Senate. By contrast, Republican administrations continued to espouse the idea that budget deficits did not matter if they were used to pay for tax cuts, since higher growth would turn the deficits into surpluses over time. Although this claim was widely understood to be overstated, the general view, including on Wall Street, was that ultralow interest rates would save the day even if the extra growth from tax cuts proved insufficient.\nAs debt debates became highly politicized, economists who questioned the lower-rates-forever orthodoxy were shunned or ignored. Yet anyone looking at the long history of interest-rate fluctuations would have recognized that a return to higher rates was a distinct, indeed likely, possibility. Consider the interest rate on ten-year inflation-indexed U.S. Treasury bonds, which are often used as a measure of the real interest rate in the economy. The rate fell by roughly three percentage points between September 2007 and September 2012, a collapse that can hardly be explained by slow-moving trends such as demographic decline and falling productivity. A far more plausible explanation was the prolonged effects of the global financial crisis and its aftermath. As with other past financial crises, these effects would eventually end, and one might reasonably have guessed that the era of ultralow interest rates would end as well.\nTrue, some of the factors that contributed to very low interest rates are still present today, including aging populations in most advanced countries. But there are plenty of reasons to think that long-term interest rates will remain higher well into the future. Foremost, government debt is exploding globally, putting upward pressure on U.S. rates in a world of integrated capital markets. For example, the average net debt-to-GDP ratio for the G-7 countries has grown from 55 percent in 2006 to 95 percent today. In fact, the United States is not even the worst offender: Japan’s net debt-to-GDP ratio is 134 percent (its gross public debt is a staggering 235 percent of GDP). For Italy, the ratio is 127 percent; France, 108 percent; and the United States, 98 percent. Other upward pressures on interest rates include the rise in many countries of populist parties, which are pushing for more domestic spending; AI’s voracious appetite for electricity, which generates a huge demand for investment that has to be financed; tariff wars and the fracturing of global trade, which are forcing companies to invest in reshoring, with massive borrowing; and the ever-growing cost of adapting to climate change and responding to climate disasters. Although some economists, taking note of these trends, have begun to reconsider the seductive assumptions of the 2010s, there is little sign that Washington has. And with high interest rates, already vertiginous levels of debt, political upheaval, and challenges to Fed independence, there is now a real risk that a fresh economic shock could precipitate a broader collapse.\nTHE GREAT REPRESSION\nHow and when a debt crisis in the United States could unfold is now the $37 trillion question. In one scenario, the trigger will be a collapse of confidence by investors in U.S. Treasuries—a “crack in the bond market,” as Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, warned in May—meaning a sudden spike in interest rates that revealed a larger problem. This is not as hyperbolic as it may sound; debt crises often build up steam quietly for what seems like forever before erupting unexpectedly. Alternatively, investors’ growing fears about the safety of their money could cause a gradual rise in Treasury bond yields over many months or even years.\nRising interest rates do not in themselves constitute a crisis. But if driven by debt concerns, they will push down stock and housing prices, make business investment more challenging, and raise the cost of servicing government debt. If this process unfolded slowly, the government would have time to react. If it doesn’t do so forcefully—typically, by closing the current budget deficit and credibly committing to fiscal rectitude—markets would smell blood, interest rates would go up even more, and the government would need to make even bigger adjustments to steady the ship. As long as the country remained stuck in this high-interest debt purgatory, business and consumer confidence would be low and growth would stall. The usual U.S. solution of running a giant deficit would likely backfire and lead to even higher interest rates. To escape this situation without crushing austerity measures, the government would almost certainly reach for heterodox options that are today more usually associated with emerging markets.\nFor one, the United States could default outright (in the legal sense) on its debt. It has done so before. In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt abrogated the so-called gold clause for U.S. Treasury debt, which guaranteed creditors that they could choose to be paid in gold, instead of dollars, at $20.67 per ounce. The next year, the conversion rate of dollars to gold was set at $35 per ounce, sharply devaluing the currency. In a highly controversial case, the Supreme Court ruled in 1935 that Roosevelt’s abrogation of the gold clause in public debt was indeed a default. But under enormous political pressure from the president, the court simultaneously ruled that creditors were not entitled to compensation because no harm had been done. Really? For foreign central banks across the world that had been holding U.S. Treasury bonds on the assumption that they were as good as gold, the 1933 default was quite painful.\nGiven that the United States can print dollars rather than refuse to honor its debt, a far simpler option is to use high inflation to achieve a partial default. Of course, the independence of the Fed poses a significant obstacle to this, but not an insurmountable one in a true crisis. The Fed’s independence is not mandated by the Constitution, and the president has many ways to induce it to lower interest rates. The first, clearly, is to appoint a chair who believes it will be in the national interest to radically cut interest rates, even if that creates inflation. This solution, however, has limits, starting with the fact that Fed chairs serve for four years, and the Supreme Court has indicated, in a May ruling, that the president cannot fire them over policy differences. Moreover, the Fed chair leads the Open Market Committee, which consists of the seven Fed governors in Washington, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four rotating representatives of the 11 other regional Federal Reserve Banks. These positions typically rotate infrequently; a full term for a Fed governor is 14 years, and only one position is guaranteed to open up in 2026.\nWith the cooperation of Congress, however, the president can do much more. For example, Congress could empower the Treasury to dictate the Fed’s short-term interest rate target during a national emergency, including a debt crisis. This is more or less what happened in World War II and its immediate aftermath. It could also pack the Federal Reserve Board with new members, as Roosevelt threatened to do with the Supreme Court in the 1930s. A battle of that scale between the Fed and the president would take the country into uncharted territory. But even if the Fed submits and cuts rates sharply, inflation is not the get-out-of-jail-free card some believe it to be. Whereas a truly massive bout of hyperinflation, such as what happened in Germany after World War I, would effectively wipe government debt off the books, it would wipe out the rest of the economy, as well: ask the citizens of Venezuela and Zimbabwe, who have suffered epic hyperinflation in this century. More plausibly, a few years of 1970s-style inflation—in 1979 inflation reached more than 14 percent per year in the United States—would crater the value of long-term bonds but have less effect on short-term debt, which would have to be refinanced at higher interest rates. And such a prolonged spike would likely be very damaging to both the U.S. and the global economy.\nOne way to manage the effects of inflation is to use it in conjunction with financial repression. In this strategy, governments stuff public debt into the financial sector via banks, pension funds, and insurance companies, with the central bank typically buying massive quantities as well. By creating a vast captive market for public debt, the government can lower the interest rate it has to pay and significantly reduce the odds of any sudden flight from its bonds. Financial repression can be made more potent by restricting other assets people can hold or by imposing interest rate controls. This is not as exotic as it sounds: governments around the world have used financial repression for most of modern history. After World War II, governments leaned heavily on financial repression to help inflate their way out of massive public debts. Without financial repression, U.S. debt in relation to GDP would likely have continued to grow from 1945 to 1955; instead, it fell by more than 40 percent. In some countries, notably the United Kingdom, results were even more dramatic. Today, the strategy is especially widespread in emerging markets, but Europe used financial repression to hold the euro together during the European debt crisis, and Japan has used it on an even greater scale; the Bank of Japan alone holds Japanese government debt equal to nearly 100 percent of the country’s income.\nSince the global financial crisis, the United States has also pursued some financial repression through financial regulations and Federal Reserve purchases of long-term Treasury bonds. In a pinch, it could do much more. Financial repression is particularly effective in a high-inflation environment, in which, ordinarily, markets would drive up interest rates on government debt. On the other hand, repression negatively affects long-term growth by absorbing bank financing that could be going to the innovative firms in the private sector. The use of financial repression to deal with high debt is hardly the only reason for Japan’s miserable growth record over the past few decades, but it is certainly a leading one.\nAn inflationary spiral could send the economy into a lost decade.\nAs the Japanese experience has shown, financial repression would offer no panacea to the United States. It really only works on domestic savers and financial institutions that cannot easily avoid the implicit tax on their savings and income. If Washington used it in a large-scale way, foreign investors, who now hold close to a third of the U.S. debt, would try to flee, and it would not be easy to stop them without engaging in outright default. Moreover, the United States is highly dependent on its financial sector to drive its exceptionally innovative economy. And just as the costs of inflation fall most heavily on lower-income individuals, so, too, do the effects of financial repression, since the wealthy have workarounds.\nAlongside default, austerity, inflation, and financial repression, a prospective new option for dealing with high debt is emerging, whose costs and benefits are not yet fully understood. This involves a form of cryptocurrency called dollar stablecoins. Unlike conventional cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, whose dollar value fluctuates wildly, stablecoins are pegged to the dollar, typically at a value of one to one. New U.S. legislation passed by Congress in 2025 has attempted to provide a clear regulatory framework by requiring that U.S.-based dollar stablecoins hold a mix of Treasury debt and federally guaranteed bank deposits sufficient to (almost) pay off all coin holders in the event of a run. This requirement could potentially create a captive pool of stablecoins whose issuers hold large quantities of Treasury bills. To the extent that stablecoins compete for funds that might normally be allocated to banks, they provide a backdoor to routing bank deposits into Treasury debt. For now, it is unclear whether the new legislation will promote stability or undermine it, given a number of unresolved issues having to do with the risk of runs on stablecoins and how their circulation can be audited to prevent their use for criminal purposes or tax evasion.\nIn principle, the Federal Reserve can also issue its own stablecoin, or central bank digital currency. This, too, would compete with bank deposits and channel savings toward Treasury debt unless the funds were in turn used in lending to the private sector, a process that would create its own problems. A Fed digital currency would differ from stablecoins in other important ways. For one thing, it would, by design, be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, and presumably tracking its use would pose less of a concern. On the other hand, competitive private stablecoins would likely be far more innovative. Although none of the available options for dealing with unsustainable debt are particularly attractive, it is nevertheless important that the government begin to contemplate them seriously. Not only does Washington need to be prepared for the next shock when it comes, but politicians and policymakers must also recognize what will happen if the government continues to assume that the United States can never have a debt crisis.\nEND OF AN EMPIRE\nFor too long, the status quo approach in Washington has been to ignore the massive debt problem and hope that a return to miraculous levels of growth and low interest rates will take care of it. But the United States is approaching the point at which the national debt could undermine not only the country’s economic stability but also the things that have sustained its global power for so many decades, including the military spending that it has leveraged in many ways to maintain the dollar’s formidable influence over the global financial system since World War II. Whether in the case of Spain in the sixteenth century, the Netherlands in the seventeenth century, or the United Kingdom in the nineteenth century, no country in modern history has been able to sustain a dominant currency without also being a superpower.\nThe United States may avoid a debt crisis, and Trumpian and progressive economists who count on growth dividends ultimately outweighing the interest costs of higher debt may turn out to be right. But the debt policy that both the Republican and the Democratic Parties have engaged in over the first quarter of the twenty-first century amounts to a huge wager on long odds, especially if the country wants to remain a dominant power for the rest of this century and beyond. Given the current trajectory of deficits, it has become much more difficult to sustain the belief that no matter how high U.S. debt gets, it will have no effect on the country’s capacity to fight financial crises, pandemics, climate events, and wars. And it will certainly be a drag on the country’s growth.\nIt is impossible to predict how and when a U.S. debt problem may erupt and what the consequences will be: unpalatable austerity, high inflation, financial repression, partial default, or a mix of these. There are strong reasons to assume that inflation will have a pronounced part, as it did during the 1970s. Regardless, a debt crisis will be destabilizing for the United States, the global economy, and the dollar’s reserve status. Left unchecked, it could erode the country’s position in the world.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "Iran’s Roads Not Taken", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/iran/irans-roads-not-taken-nasr", "text": "The 12-day war in June, which saw the United States join Israel in bombing Iran, was the culmination of four decades of mistrust, antipathy, and confrontation. Since its inception in 1979, the Islamic Republic has not wavered in its anti-Americanism, and the United States has unfailingly responded by exerting greater pressure on Iran. The two have come close to outright conflict before. In 1987 and 1988, the United States destroyed offshore oil platforms and Iranian naval vessels and then mistakenly shot down an Iranian passenger plane. Iran interpreted those acts as the opening salvos of an undeclared war. Washington’s attention, however, soon turned to Iraq and the Gulf War. But the hostility between Iran and the United States persisted and has only become more pronounced in the decades that have followed the 9/11 attacks. The 2020 killing of the Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, after a spate of Iranian provocations in the region, brought the two countries to the precipice. U.S. President Donald Trump pushed hostilities over the edge this year when the United States struck three Iranian nuclear sites with dozens of cruise missiles and 30,000-pound bombs.\nTehran and Washington seem to be implacable foes. The revolutionary regime in Iran has long cast the United States as its archenemy, the Great Satan that undermined the country’s independence by backing a military coup in 1953 and the authoritarian excesses of the monarchy that followed. In 1979, the revolution’s leaders worried that the United States would continue to interfere in Iran and stymie the great transformation underway. To prevent that outcome, the Islamic Republic decided that the United States should be extricated not just from Iran but from the broader Middle East. These assumptions set Tehran’s foreign policy on a collision course with Washington. Iran has supported states and militant groups around the region with the aim of threatening the United States and its Israeli and Arab allies. In turn, the United States has pursued a strategy of containment and pressure that has included U.S.-led regional alliances, U.S. military bases, and a tight noose of sanctions suffocating Iran’s economy. Finally, this year, that strategy widened to include overt American strikes on Iranian territory.\nMany observers perceive this history as a single, unbroken thread of conflict and hostility stretching from 1979 to the present. And yet today’s hostility was not inevitable. More peaceful paths were possible, and indeed, with the right decisions in Tehran and Washington, Iran and the United States could still find ways to lower tensions and even normalize their relations. On several occasions in the twenty-first century alone, Iran and the United States had the opportunity to climb down from their mutual hostility. At each juncture, however, American or Iranian policymakers chose to foreclose those possible openings. But that history of missed chances does not condemn the two countries to a future of ever-deeper conflict. Instead, it offers a reminder that even today, Iran and the United States may yet be able to reconcile.\nThe 12-day war has demonstrably weakened Iran. Tehran’s strategy is no longer sustainable in the wake of the battering that it has suffered. In this moment, Washington could continue boxing Iran into a corner and allow Israel to occasionally “mow the grass,” striking Iranian nuclear and military targets to keep punishing the country and block any progress toward building a bomb. Or it could see the aftermath of the 12-day war as an opportunity to engage in that fitful American pastime when it comes to Iran: diplomacy. Now, Washington has the chance to set its relations with Tehran on a different path, to pursue fresh bargains that could change both Iran’s foreign and nuclear policies and the balance of power within Iran’s ruling establishment. The U.S. and Iranian governments have failed to take those turnings before, but even now, policymakers should not be fatalistic. The past, no matter how freighted with lost opportunities, need not be prologue.\nA FALSE DAWN IN AFGHANISTAN\nFor at least a little while after 9/11, it seemed possible that relations between Iran and the United States could improve. Both Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Mohammad Khatami condemned the terrorist attacks, and Iranians held candlelit vigils in the streets of major cities and observed moments of silence in soccer stadiums. The strategic interests of Iran and the United States were suddenly aligned. Reeling from the assault, the United States maintained as its most urgent priority the elimination of al-Qaeda. Iran’s Shiite clerical regime viewed the Sunni radicalism of al-Qaeda and its hosts, the Taliban, with deep concern. Only three years earlier, in 1998, the Taliban had killed up to 11 Iranian diplomats and journalists in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif, an atrocity that spurred Iran to mobilize troops on its border with Afghanistan. After years of antagonism, Iranian and U.S. officials found that they had some goals in common.\nIran had long backed the Taliban’s principal foes, the Northern Alliance. Only days before the 9/11 attacks, al-Qaeda operatives posing as journalists killed Ahmad Shah Masoud, the Northern Alliance’s legendary leader, an assassination that signaled an imminent Taliban offensive to wipe out the Northern Alliance once and for all and consolidate control of Afghanistan. Shiite Iran feared the regional ascendance of Sunni radicalism in the form of the puritanical Taliban, an ambitious al-Qaeda, and other militant factions, as well as further instability on its eastern border—Iran was then, and remains now, home to many Afghan refugees. Some estimates in recent years have placed the figure as high as eight million, roughly ten percent of the population.\nThrough forms of cooperation that seem incredible today, Iran abetted the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps offered intelligence assistance to the United States and provided logistical support, facilitating battlefield coordination with Northern Alliance forces. U.S. diplomats Ryan Crocker and Zalmay Khalilzad attended meetings with Iranian counterparts and top IRGC officers, including senior commanders, possibly even Soleimani. Just over two months after the 9/11 attacks, the Taliban had been chased out of Kabul and other major cities. The Taliban’s so-called emirate in Afghanistan was no more.\nIran and the United States could still normalize their relations.\nIran had a vested interest in shaping the government that would replace the Taliban. It worked closely with the United States at the Bonn conference in December 2001 that decided the future of Afghanistan. The two countries shared the same goals of crafting a new political order in Afghanistan that would unite and stabilize it through an inclusive democratic government. James Dobbins, who led the U.S. efforts at the conference, later credited his Iranian counterpart, the diplomat Javad Zarif, for building the consensus among all Afghan factions over forging a new constitution and holding democratic elections to form a new government in Kabul. And Zarif in turn credited Soleimani, the Revolutionary Guards commander, for securing compromises from the Northern Alliance to facilitate agreement in Bonn.\nIn retrospect, this rare collaboration was an opportunity to improve relations between Iran and the United States. Working together in Afghanistan could have served as a significant confidence-building measure, as well as the impetus for the de-escalation of tensions and then potentially even the gradual normalization of relations. Success in Afghanistan could have placed the relationship on a different course.\nThat did not come to pass. In January 2002, almost immediately after the Bonn conference, Israel intercepted an Iranian arms shipment to Hamas. For Iran, cooperation with the United States in Afghanistan did not constitute a reorientation of Iranian strategy that would apply to all aspects of Iran’s regional policy. What happened in Afghanistan was just a tentative opening that had yet to fully bear fruit; Tehran would not so quickly reverse its Middle East policy, and it would still build up its proxies. U.S. President George W. Bush signaled outrage and alarm. He then decided against using the opening in Afghanistan to embrace Iran and gently push for change in its regional policy. Instead, he cast Iran as an implacable enemy and dispensed with the goodwill generated by developments in Afghanistan. In his State of the Union address in January 2002, Bush famously included Iran among the members of the “axis of evil.”\nFresh from what seemed a swift and sure victory in Afghanistan, a buoyant Washington devoted its energies to the prosecution of the so-called war on terror. And in that war, Iran could only be a target, not an ally; its cooperation in Afghanistan no longer counted for much. After all, as many U.S. officials believed, Islamist ideology became a global phenomenon because of the success of Iran’s revolution in 1979 (never mind that the Iranian regime’s resolute Shiism separated it from the Sunni militancy of groups such as al-Qaeda). Islamism, according to this view, would not be defeated until the Islamic Republic had been toppled. After the U.S. invasion of Iraq, in March 2003, many Iranians feared that it was only a matter of time before American forces came for them. In the words of Hassan Kazemi Qomi, Iran’s first ambassador to Baghdad following the U.S. invasion and the fall of Iraq’s ruler Saddam Hussein, “After Iraq was Iran’s turn.” So Iran tried to placate the United States. In May 2003, Khatami, the country’s reformist president, sent Washington a proposal for talks and a road map to resolve “all outstanding issues between the two countries,” including, notably, Iran’s nascent nuclear program and its broader policy in the Middle East. The White House did not even acknowledge receiving the offer.\nThe rebuff led the Islamic Republic to harden its positions and prepare itself for conflict. In stark contrast to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, the U.S. invasion of Iraq produced no opening with Iran, but rather placed the two countries at odds. With good reason, given the number of Bush administration officials who viewed Tehran as a grave threat, Iran believed it had to protect itself. In the chaos that followed the fall of Saddam, Iran possibly partnered with Syria to deepen the quagmire that the United States now faced in Iraq. The Sunni insurgency, supported by Syria, and the Shiite militias, supported by Iran, battled U.S. forces. As violence consumed Iraq, the American project there was doomed to failure.\nIranian leaders thus averted what they feared most: a triumphant U.S. military in Iraq continuing its campaign east into Iran. But American views of Iran only grew darker. Iran, for its part, concluded that it could best manage the American threat by bogging down U.S. resources in various theaters around the Middle East. Exhausted by protracted conflict, the United States would grow weary of the region and not seek war with Iran. Washington’s decision to pull forces out of Iraq in 2011 seemed to vindicate this line of Iranian thinking. The more U.S. officials talked of leaving the region, the more Iran saw wisdom in its strategy.\nThis strategy also had the effect of transforming the balance of power within Iran. The security forces at the forefront of the fight against Washington gained control of Iran’s foreign policy. In the crucible of Iraq, the Quds Force, the expeditionary division of the IRGC that oversees unconventional military and intelligence operations, grew from one of its smallest units into an expansive regional force that would dominate Iran’s foreign policy decision-making. The Quds Force commanders, Soleimani and his deputy Esmail Qaani, had worked with U.S. counterparts in Afghanistan in 2001. During the Iraq war, they would turn the force into a military network to battle the United States across the Middle East.\nBREAKOUT OR BREAKTHROUGH?\nThe false dawn in relations with the United States after the 9/11 attacks convinced Iranian leaders that Washington would never be willing to accommodate revolutionary Iran. Tehran understood U.S. policies, including the building of military bases in Afghanistan, the Persian Gulf, and Central Asia and the strengthening of sanctions on the Iranian economy, as all aimed at engineering regime change in Tehran. In the immediate aftermath of the Iraq war, Iran’s rulers surmised that they had to resist and deter the United States through enacting aggressive regional policies, building a nuclear program, and strengthening Iran’s drone and missile capabilities. The country’s economy, state institutions, and politics had to be organized in the service of that resistance.\nAnother revelation had further poisoned the well: Iran’s desire to acquire nuclear weapons. Its nuclear program had come to light as the United States was preparing for the Iraq war. At the time, after the inclusion of Iran in the “axis of evil,” U.S.-Iranian relations were already on a downward slope. The discovery of a clandestine nuclear program only increased the prospect of conflict. Iran assumed that the United States would make this nuclear program a casus belli, as it had in its justification of the invasion of Iraq. Washington, for its part, did not want a member of the “axis of evil” to acquire nuclear capabilities. But by the end of the Bush administration in 2009, U.S. officials had grown disinterested in military solutions to their Iran problem as the United States continued to founder in Iraq. Diplomacy, not war, would have to contain Iranian nuclear ambitions. And so opened another opportunity for Iran and the United States to edge away from conflict toward a more peaceful relationship.\nThe United States could have taken this path sooner. In 2003, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom negotiated a deal with Iran that would have halted the growth of its still small nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The Bush administration forced the deal to collapse in 2004, insisting that Iran give up the entirety of its nuclear program and offering no concessions in return.\nNuclear diplomacy should be the floor, not the ceiling, of the relationship.\nIn hindsight, the veto proved a mistake. Unconstrained, Iran’s nuclear program continued to expand as the anti-American bombast and Holocaust denial of the new Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, made diplomacy much more difficult. Tehran also grew further convinced that Washington was not interested in meaningful diplomatic engagement, even on the nuclear issue. Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator in 2003, Hassan Rouhani, would try his hand at nuclear diplomacy when he became president in 2013, after he succeeded Ahmadinejad. But in 2004, he and other Iranian leaders concluded that the United States had so swiftly dismissed the European-negotiated deal because Iran’s program was too small to be worthy of American diplomacy and concessions. Iran would need a much bigger program to compel the United States to the negotiating table. That presumption undergirded Iranian activities during the Obama, first Trump, and Biden administrations. And at each turn, failure to forge a lasting nuclear deal would only encourage Iran to expand its program even more.\nHad Washington supported the European effort, Iran’s nuclear program would likely have remained small, and the deal itself might have had transformative consequences. It could have led Tehran to fear Washington less, and as a result, Iran would then have behaved differently in Iraq and not so readily courted American enmity. Instead, the U.S. veto further convinced Tehran that its reading of American intentions was correct. Washington would be impressed only by might. To deter the United States, Iran had to both build a larger nuclear program and widen its asymmetric warfare in Iraq and beyond.\nIran was right to assume that a larger nuclear program would change Washington’s calculations. By 2011, Iran’s program had grown significantly, and although estimates vary, it was still not close to the breakout stage. That failed to reassure Israel. Spooked by the pace of Iran’s progress, Israel threatened to attack Iran to prevent it from getting any closer to a bomb. But the last thing the Obama administration wanted was entanglement in another Middle Eastern war. It determined that the only way to stop Iran from becoming a nuclear power was through diplomacy.\nPresident Barack Obama paved the way for negotiations by first increasing economic sanctions on Iran in 2010 but then adopting a different tone, making it clear to Tehran that Washington was not seeking regime change. Obama understood that sweeping ultimatums and coercion would not get Iran to dispense with its nuclear program. The United States thus agreed to negotiate limits on Iran’s program in exchange for sanctions relief.\nFor their part, Iran’s rulers were conflicted about Obama’s offer. The IRGC and its political allies were skeptical that the Obama administration would differ much from its predecessor. They thought diplomacy would not yield meaningful results but would signal weakness and divert attention from the threat that the United States posed to Iran. But a moderate faction, led by Rouhani, who became president in 2013, argued that successful diplomacy with the United States would lower tensions, ease pressure on Iran’s economy, and reset relations between the two countries. This faction hoped that diplomacy would yield the positive outcomes that had eluded Iran in its prior attempts at rapprochement with the United States: its cooperation in Afghanistan in 2001, its offer of talks in 2003, and the nuclear deal signed with Europe in 2003 but scotched after Washington refused to go along with it.\nTwo years of intense talks followed among Iran, China, Russia, the United States, and the three European powers that had negotiated the prior deal. They culminated in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. In exchange for sanctions relief, the JCPOA placed strict limits on the scope of Iran’s nuclear activities for at least a decade and subjected those activities to stringent international inspections. There has been much debate since on whether the deal effectively curbed Iran’s nuclear ambitions and whether the United States could have made sterner demands on Iran at the negotiating table—a doubt echoed in Tehran by the deal’s detractors there who believed that Iran had given too much away in exchange for too little. But the deal did roll back Iran’s program, and in 11 separate reports, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, attested to Iran’s compliance with the terms of the JCPOA. The JCPOA was significant in another important way: it represented a breakthrough in U.S.-Iranian relations. After decades of hostility, the United States and Iran had finally concluded a deal and, at least as far as Iran was concerned, successfully implemented it.\nThe JCPOA was a major accomplishment in trust building. Had it lasted, the deal could have served as the basis for subsequent agreements on Iran’s nuclear and missile programs and its regional policies. The relaxation of sanctions on the Iranian economy could have changed political dynamics within Tehran by strengthening the hand of moderate factions reliant on middle-class votes and weakening the influence of conservatives and hard-liners in foreign policy decisions. In time, relations between Iran and the United States could have moved toward greater normalization.\nAnd yet the deal did not deliver the widening thaw that some of its proponents hoped for. Agreeing to the JCPOA did not immediately change Iran’s broader strategy. The IRGC and its political allies in the parliament and in powerful parastatal economic and political institutions thought that despite the diplomatic breakthrough, there was no evidence of fundamental change in U.S.-Iranian relations. The United States still posed an urgent threat and had made no effort to change that perception. Hard-liners in Tehran pointed to the furious domestic opposition to the JCPOA in the United States as proof that U.S. policy toward Iran would remain unchanged. In the months following the signing of the deal, Washington dragged its feet in lifting sanctions on Tehran, and that steadily soured the mood in Iran. Iranian hard-liners argued that it had all been a ruse to strip Iran of its nuclear assets, making it vulnerable to U.S.-backed regime change. Iran should therefore continue with those regional policies—such as its commitment to supporting the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, the Houthi rebellion in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and various militias in Iraq—that since 2003 had been indispensable in deterring American aggression.\nThe convulsions of the Arab Spring further complicated Iran’s calculus. Tehran saw the popular unrest that swept across the Arab world as a new opportunity to expand its regional footprint. That opportunity came with new dangers. The fall of Assad in Syria, an Iranian ally, would have been a significant strategic loss. It would have isolated and weakened Iran’s Lebanese proxy Hezbollah. A resurgent Sunni government in Syria backed by Western powers and other Arab powers could have rolled back Iran’s gains in Iraq, too. Iran sensed that the United States was trying to hack off the tentacles of the octopus—before chopping off its head in Tehran. Iran’s rulers, particularly the IRGC and its political allies, concluded that the real aim of American efforts to topple Assad was the end of the Islamic Republic. The IRGC would resist that outcome at all costs. As its commander in charge in Syria put it, “What we lose in losing Syria exceeds what we have at stake in Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen.” Iran thus forcefully intervened in Syria to save Assad starting in 2011, and in the same year also threw its full support behind Houthi forces in Yemen that had gained the upper hand in civil war there.\nIran did not cause the JCPOA to collapse. The United States did.\nTehran, in effect, chose a precarious balancing act: it shrank its nuclear program but protected and expanded its regional footprint in confrontation with the United States and its Arab allies, notably Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Those allies saw little benefit in the nuclear deal but had much to fear from Iran’s regional power play. They wanted the United States to focus on containing Iran’s regional influence rather than just the country’s nuclear program. They joined hands with Israel, which also opposed U.S. diplomacy with Iran, to lobby against the JCPOA in Washington almost as soon as the deal was signed in 2015. These efforts were rewarded when Trump formally removed the United States from the JCPOA in 2018.\nIran’s foreign policy between 2014 and 2018 was deeply conflicted. In the words of Zarif, the foreign minister during that period, Iran was paralyzed by a struggle between diplomacy and the battlefield—the latter being his euphemism for the IRGC and its regional strategy—and it suffered for “favoring the battlefield over diplomacy.” For its part, U.S. policy fixated on the actions of the Revolutionary Guards rather than on what nuclear diplomacy had just achieved. Washington did not consider then the possibility of using success at the negotiating table as the basis for influencing Tehran’s regional posture. It succumbed to the idea that the JCPOA was insufficient because it had not encompassed Iran’s regional policies. Rather than abandon diplomacy to punish Iran for its regional behavior, the United States could have held on to its diplomatic gains even as it pushed back against Iran’s regional policies. In other words, it could have stayed in the JCPOA and used that leverage to pursue a further deal that would have curtailed Iranian aggression in the region.\nIf the United States had followed this path, Iran’s nuclear program would have remained limited by the parameters established by the JCPOA; even after Israeli and American bombing, Iran’s nuclear program is probably much closer to breakout than it was in the past decade, at least in terms of know-how and the ability to rebuild an advanced program. The longer the deal had stayed in effect, the more trust it would have built between Iran and the United States, which Washington could then have used to influence Tehran’s regional behavior.\nA successful nuclear deal could have lowered Iranian perceptions of a threat from the United States. That, in turn, would have allowed Iran to roll back its troublesome regional activities and even discuss limits on its missile program. The economic gains that would have come with remaining in the JCPOA would have convinced Iran to comply with the deal and not use the cover of diplomacy for further provocations. Despite frustration in Tehran with the slow pace of sanctions relief, Iran did not cause the JCPOA to collapse. The United States did. That remains the most significant lost opportunity for repairing relations between the two countries.\nA FATEFUL WITHDRAWAL\nThe disintegration of the JCPOA drastically escalated tensions between Tehran and Washington. After scrapping the deal, Trump imposed intense sanctions on Iran as part of a campaign of “maximum pressure.” The stated aim of that campaign was to force Iran back to the negotiating table. But Iran perceived Trump’s ploy as nothing short of a bid to bring about regime change by strangling the country’s economy and degrading its state institutions to encourage popular rebellion. Iran responded by vigorously resuming nuclear activity, enriching uranium beyond levels allowed by the JCPOA. It also took more aggressive actions across the Middle East in 2019, starting with an attack on oil tankers in the waters of the United Arab Emirates in May, then the downing of a U.S. drone in June, and then an attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia in September. This escalation of violence spurred a seismic event: Trump ordered the killing of Soleimani, the Quds Force commander, in January 2020, while the general was in Iraq. His death outraged Iranians. The Islamic Republic retaliated by striking a military base in Iraq that housed American troops. Iran and the United States then stood on the brink of war. In under five years, the hope of a new opening in relations had given way to open conflict.\nThe election of Joe Biden as president in 2020 and the return of a Democratic administration in 2021 could have halted the spiraling tensions. During the campaign, Democratic candidates, including Biden, had signaled their willingness to revive the JCPOA. Once in office, however, Biden demurred. Rather than revert to the Obama-era policy, he embraced Trump’s position of maximum pressure. The administration insisted that Iran had to first fulfill all its obligations under the JCPOA, and only then would the United States consider returning to the deal. In the meantime, maximum pressure sanctions would remain in place. The early months of the Biden administration coincided with the tail end of Rouhani’s presidency. Rouhani and his team had been architects of the JCPOA and wanted to see it restored. But they did not find a willing partner in Biden. What Tehran saw was continuity; Biden, like his predecessor, wanted regime change in Iran.\nThe United States did agree to talks with Iran in Vienna in April 2021. But by then, Iran had concluded that there would be no real change in U.S. policy. Iranian leaders announced that the country would start enriching uranium to 60 percent purity. The escalation was alarming because it would bring Iran much closer to breakout. In the face of this threat, the Biden administration changed course to put greater emphasis on talks with Iran, discussing concrete steps that would bring the United States back into the JCPOA and remove sanctions on Iran in exchange for its full compliance with its obligations under the deal. By then, however, the Rouhani presidency was at its end. He was soon to be replaced by a hard-line opponent of the JCPOA, Ebrahim Raisi.\nIt was in this context that Iran decided to back Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine in 2022. Iran had developed close intelligence and military ties with Russia during the Syrian civil war (Russia also took the side of Assad), but it now saw its strategic partnership with Moscow as vital to surviving determined American efforts to isolate and crush the Islamic Republic. This support for Russia, in turn, alienated Europe and gave Washington even more reason to pressure Tehran. U.S.-Iranian relations thus became entangled with the United States’ and Europe’s clash with an expansionist Russia. Had the Biden administration concluded a deal with Iran before Russia attacked Ukraine, Tehran would have seen too much at stake in its relations with Europe to contemplate helping Russia in Ukraine. But since Biden was not willing to break with Trump’s policy to restore the deal agreed to by Obama, Iran decided it needed to strengthen its ties with Russia, and that in turn made the job of diplomacy all the more difficult. Both Iran and the United States trusted the other even less than before, and Washington had to contend with a more intractable Tehran. Indirect talks between Iran, the United States, and other JCPOA signatories could not produce a breakthrough. The Biden administration would not guarantee that a deal would last, since any agreement could be undone after a change of government, and the hard-liners at the helm in Tehran were unwilling to risk another U.S. withdrawal from a negotiated deal.\nFROM THE RUBBLE\nIn the subsequent years, Iran’s regional position has unraveled significantly. After the Hamas attacks on Israel in October 2023, Israel has systematically pummeled Iranian proxies in the region, doing serious damage to Hamas in Gaza and defanging Hezbollah in Lebanon. The collapse of Assad’s regime, in December 2024, left Iran without one of its most useful regional allies and raised the prospect of the emergence of an anti-Iranian, Sunni-led Syria. In 2024 and 2025, Israeli forces struck deep into Iranian territory, exposing huge intelligence vulnerabilities in Iran’s security establishment as well as the Islamic Republic’s relative inability to hurt Israel with its arsenal of missiles and drones. And yet even after the devastation unleashed on Iran’s nuclear sites by Trump, much remains unknown about the state of the Iranian nuclear program and the possibility that Iranian leaders, bludgeoned into a corner, could still scramble to develop a bomb.\nIf Trump does not want Iran to follow the example of North Korea and become a nuclear state—and does not want to continue to go to war with Iran to prevent that outcome—then his administration must look for a diplomatic solution. Iran, likewise, does not want war with the United States, and it cannot quickly or easily build an arsenal of nuclear weapons to deter Israeli and U.S. attacks. Tehran has little choice but to take diplomacy seriously. Iran and the United States have been at similar junctures before, picking between confrontation and compromise. The two countries should embrace diplomacy not only to conclude an urgent deal on Iran’s nuclear capabilities but also to build trust and chart a new course for their relations. Nuclear diplomacy should be just the beginning—the floor, not the ceiling, of the relationship.\nThe Trump administration believes that the 12-day war has inflicted enough punishment on Iran to force true soul-searching among Iranian leaders. But if Tehran is to arrive at the right conclusions—and feel able to relinquish its nuclear ambitions and its aggressive regional policy—then it must see diplomacy as a credible path to realizing gains that have thus far eluded it. As unlikely as it may seem, Trump’s bombing campaign could lead to a breakthrough, but only if both countries can put their history of missteps behind them and approach diplomacy with vision and patience.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "The World Economy Was Already Broken", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/world-economy-was-already-broken-adeyemo-zoffer", "text": "The world is undergoing a great economic reordering, the third such transformation in the past century. The United States has been at the helm of each one, shaping the global economy in ways that advance U.S. interests. But with each successive shift, Washington has exerted its influence more unilaterally and aggressively, pushing partners away and creating room for adversaries to fill the breach.\nThe first great reordering came at Bretton Woods, where, in the summer of 1944, the United States used its position of strength following World War II to compel the rest of the world to accept a centrally managed international economic order built around the dollar. Harry Dexter White, the U.S. Treasury official viewed by many as the system’s principal architect, believed an arrangement based on dollars and backed by gold at a fixed exchange rate would promote peace and prosperity through greater trade. Fixed currency parities would ensure global economic stability. Conveniently, this system would also make the United States the world’s economic center of gravity and prevent currency devaluations that could harm American exports. Bretton Woods was multilateral in nature, but it favored the United States.\nU.S. President Richard Nixon forced a second reordering when he brought down the central pillar of the Bretton Woods monetary system: the dollar’s convertibility into gold. This time, there was no pretense of cooperation. During the weekend retreat at Camp David, in 1971, when Nixon’s team arrived at the decision to untether the dollar from gold, Treasury Secretary John Connally dismissed concerns that allies would be furious. “We’ll go broke getting their good will,” he chided Arthur Burns, the more internationally minded chair of the Federal Reserve. “So the other countries don’t like it. So what?”\nStill, in the months after breaking the global monetary order, Nixon’s team shifted to a more internationalist position. George Shultz, who succeeded Connally as treasury secretary, talked tough in public but was the consummate diplomat behind the scenes. He worked closely with foreign counterparts to negotiate the removal of capital controls around the world, which he believed would further enhance American financial influence. The informal “Library Group” of finance ministers that Shultz convened in the White House library, in April 1973, eventually evolved into the G-7, a cornerstone of international economic diplomacy to this day.\nThe third reordering of the global economy, underway today, is even more explicitly unilateral. U.S. President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs have targeted allies and adversaries alike out of a belief that the United States has unfairly borne the burdens of underwriting the global financial system and acting as the world’s policeman. These actions are a body blow to what remains of the postwar global trading rules.\nTrump deserves some credit for forcing the world to grapple with the failures of the existing global trade order. Decades of deindustrialization have harmed large swaths of the American workforce and undermined U.S. national security by creating supply chain dependencies on potential adversaries. The World Trade Organization has presided over an era in which countries have showered their export sectors with subsidies, imposed nontariff barriers with impunity, and implemented protectionist measures that contradict the basic principles on which the WTO was founded. Dissatisfaction with the global economy has made anti-trade policies popular among both Democrats and Republicans and propelled the rise of protectionist political parties around the globe.\nTrump is not the first president in recent memory to express concerns about the harms global trade has caused in the United States. Despite his legacy as a free trader, U.S. President Ronald Reagan sought to stem the tide of American deindustrialization with 100 percent tariffs on certain Japanese products and import quotas to protect American industry. Every president since George W. Bush has taken steps to address the flaws of the international trading system around its edges, from Bush’s 2002 steel tariffs to Joe Biden’s decision to maintain most of Trump’s tariffs on China—and impose even greater levies in some cases.\nBut Trump is the first to attempt sweeping structural change. Unfortunately, his approach undercuts key partnerships the United States needs to shape the global economy and, in its more extreme incarnations that would alter the dollar’s role, would cause substantial financial damage. Countries in Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia are already exploring new trade arrangements to limit their exposure to the United States. And the first tsunami wave of tariffs announced in April sent shivers through bond markets, leaving the global economy teetering on the brink before Trump’s advisers convinced him to temporarily pause most of the new tariffs.\nTrump is right that the global trading system needs restructuring, but his proposed cure for global trade imbalances threatens to be worse than the disease. What the United States needs is a new system built on global cooperation that promotes fair trade and strengthens American competitiveness.\nTREATING THE SYMPTOMS\nTrump has been remarkably consistent over the years about his core economic gripe: the trade deficit. In 1987, he spent nearly $100,000 to purchase a full-page ad in three U.S. newspapers that said: “It’s time for us to end our vast deficits by making Japan, and others who can afford it, pay.”\nThe most serious version of this argument starts from the premise that other countries’ industrial policies have generated artificially large surpluses that the United States has no choice but to absorb through a trade deficit. Because of the dollar’s reserve currency status, the argument goes, the United States must serve as the world’s buyer of last resort and foot the world’s defense bills. This is why the Trump administration views the current global economic order as fundamentally “unfair” to the United States. As the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Stephen Miran, has argued, the deficit that Washington runs as a result of its global position has “decimated our manufacturing sector” and driven the decline of the United States’ industrial base. In this view, trade deficits are the original sin, and fixing the global economy starts and ends with deficits.\nThis framing misconstrues the true nature of the distortions roiling the global economic system. It also fails to account for the fiscal choices driving the United States’ structural budget imbalance. Trade deficits and deindustrialization are symptoms, not causes. The underlying problem with the global trade and financial systems is their failure to prevent unfair practices that undercut the United States’ ability to compete on a level playing field. Other countries, most notably China, offer massive industrial subsidies, overproduce exports, and disregard labor rules and environmental concerns. As a result, the United States is not manufacturing products even in sectors in which it has a true comparative advantage, especially high-tech products, contributing to the broader atrophy of the industrial base.\nThat does not mean the United States should try to manufacture everything. American manufacturers are unlikely to dominate the global markets for T-shirts and running shoes. But the United States could be a leading producer of advanced manufactured goods, such as sophisticated electronics and medical devices, if everyone had to play by the same set of rules.\nTrump’s proposed cure threatens to be worse than the disease.\nIn recent years, corporate tax havens have also created trade distortions that harm American competitiveness by encouraging companies to move both manufacturing and high-value intellectual property away from the United States to low-tax jurisdictions. Ireland is now the third-largest exporter of digital services in the world—in large part because of American-invented intellectual property. The way Apple operates highlights the problems with today’s global trading system: the company innovates and designs its technology in the United States, manufactures it in China, and reaps the profits in Ireland. In 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) calculated that one-quarter of Irish GDP growth could be attributed to global iPhone sales, thanks to royalties paid to Apple’s Irish subsidiaries, which own the relevant intellectual property. While shareholders in companies that move manufacturing to China and intellectual property to Ireland reap the rewards, the United States’ industrial and tax bases lose out.\nThese challenges must be addressed, but an approach to trade that neglects allies is unlikely to succeed. As Kurt Campbell and Rush Doshi recently argued in these pages, China’s economy is massive in terms of workforce, manufacturing capacity, and even the scope of its industrial policies. The United States needs allies to counterbalance China’s economic weight—and it is the only country that can build a coalition in response to China’s anticompetitive behavior.\nThe European Union, the G-7, and others share American concerns about China’s industrial policies and economic distortions on goods ranging from electric vehicles to steel. China’s steel production generates vast amounts of carbon pollution, and the country operates with lower labor standards than advanced industrial economies in Europe and the United States. As tariffs hamper China’s ability to export to the United States, more of Beijing’s excess manufactured goods are washing up on the shores of Europe, Southeast Asia, and other global markets, threatening their domestic industries. The only effective way to prevent China from gaming the global trading system is to work with like-minded countries to put in place tariff and nontariff barriers to address China’s trade distortions.\nDismissing allies and claiming total victimhood when it comes to global trade also overlooks the benefits that the United States has gained from the dollar’s outsize role in the global economy. The dollar is on one side of nearly 90 percent of foreign exchange transactions and more than half of all global payments sent via SWIFT, the financial messaging platform used for much of the world’s trade. Americans enjoy greater purchasing power and a higher standard of living thanks to how this system generates demand for U.S. currency, and American companies benefit because they can import components at a lower cost. The dollar’s ubiquity gives the United States an arsenal of financial weapons that no other country can match: companies across the globe abide by U.S. sanctions because they have no other choice in a world in which the dollar is so central to international commerce.\nThe dollar’s unique role also affords the United States lower borrowing costs by creating demand for U.S. Treasuries and other American assets. This makes it cheaper to finance everything from defense systems to social welfare programs. But as tariffs, a ballooning deficit, and macroeconomic uncertainty drive foreign investors away, the dollar is weakening—and U.S. borrowing costs are growing alongside rising debt. Now is not the time to cast doubt on the dollar’s global role.\nNEW RULES OF THE ROAD\nThe Trump administration is right to focus on manufacturing—the United States needs more of it. But the current debate over the trade deficit overlooks a key element of the U.S. economy: services. Every time someone swipes a credit card with a Mastercard or Visa logo or queries large language models such as ChatGPT or Claude, it is a reminder of U.S. leadership in the global service economy. The U.S. trade surplus in services totaled nearly $300 billion in 2024, meaning that cutting the trade deficit doesn’t need to rely on manufacturing alone.\nExpanding manufacturing and strengthening services are not mutually exclusive. As technology rapidly advances, manufacturing and services tend to complement each other. U.S. strength in technological and financial services enables the country to manufacture more advanced hardware. It is both an economic and a national security priority to continue creating high-quality service jobs and promoting services built on U.S. digital infrastructure.\nThe majority of Americans work in the service sector today. And although there is much to recommend high-quality manufacturing jobs, service industries offer excellent opportunities, too, including in many blue-collar professions. Service providers such as electricians and plumbers make on average $30 an hour, whereas American textile manufacturers earn an average of only $16 to $19 an hour.\nMoreover, most of the jobs created by onshoring manufacturing will not be on the factory floor. Much of China’s formidable manufacturing advantage stems from robotics, automation, and the early adoption of AI. To compete with China, American factories will also need to be highly automated, especially in advanced manufacturing industries such as semiconductors, automobiles, and medical devices in which the United States is best positioned to compete.\nEmphasizing the importance of services does not undercut the case for reindustrialization as a way of creating jobs, but it does mean the jobs will look different from what many people imagine. The economist Enrico Moretti has found that every manufacturing job created in a given city generates 1.6 jobs in the city’s “nontradable”—that is, service—sector. For high-tech manufacturing, the multiplier is even greater: each new manufacturing role produces nearly five new service-sector positions. Reindustrialization can help unlock that multiplier effect.\nAn industrial policy based entirely on punitive, unilateral tariffs will not promote the sustainable growth of the United States’ industrial base. By raising prices without addressing the underlying drivers of trade imbalances, it may even undermine the political case for tackling the flaws in the global trading system.\nUnfortunately, the current institutions of global trade—especially the WTO—are not up to the task, either. The WTO has proved incapable of holding China accountable for its anticompetitive policies and has stood by fecklessly as Beijing exports its excess capacity to the rest of the world. The WTO’s requirement of consensus to make decisions and the failure of its dispute-resolution mechanism have rendered the organization unable to effectively guide global trade.\nThe more significant issue with the WTO stems from the faulty assumptions on which it was founded. The creators of the WTO believed that the major players in the global economy would be market-oriented and that the spread of free trade would go hand in hand with the expansion of fair competition rules. With the benefit of hindsight, however, both assumptions have proved false. To combat the harms of deindustrialization, job loss, and supply chain dependencies, countries have increasingly turned away from free trade in favor of aggressive industrial policy.\nChina has been the major beneficiary of this breakdown of global trade rules. The United States and its allies still hold enough economic leverage to confront Beijing and stem the tide of unfair trade. But if they fail to act soon, China’s size and deepening trade relationships—by one count, China is the largest trading partner for 120 countries—will cement a set of anticompetitive global trade norms.\nThe United States needs allies to counterbalance China’s economic weight.\nAn effective strategy to restore American competitiveness and foster reindustrialization must start with a new set of meaningful global trade rules that target unfair practices and distorted competition. These new trade rules must distinguish countries that abide by high labor and environmental standards and refrain from anticompetitive, beggar-thy-neighbor policies from countries that don’t. Think of it as a fair-trade customs union.\nThis fair-trade customs union would be built around a set of high standards needed to maintain fair competition. Only countries that upheld ambitious labor standards and environmental rules, the rule of law, and market-oriented regulations would be eligible for full membership. In exchange for membership, states would agree to refrain from pursuing anticompetitive policies such as offering widespread industrial subsidies, undercutting one another on corporate taxation, and dumping excess goods in foreign markets.\nNonmembers that upheld relatively high standards would be subject to meaningful but nonprohibitive trade barriers—perhaps tariffs of up to five percent—to incentivize them to join the union without imposing disproportionate costs. Countries that failed to meet these standards, however, would face significant penalties on trade between themselves and any member of the union. These consequences would protect the industrial bases of countries within the fair-trade union from being overwhelmed by cheap goods flowing from nonmarket economies. The goal would be to create a large common market among like-minded countries, which would enable them to take advantage of one another’s markets and comparative advantages while excluding countries that insisted on breaking the rules and undercutting the standards needed for fair competition.\nAny market economies that are members of the WTO could seek to join if they were willing to apply the fair-trade union’s rules and uphold its standards in their domestic markets. Decisions regarding the substance of these rules and standards, how to admit new members, and whether a current member should be expelled for noncompliance would be made on a majority basis, perhaps using a weighted voting formula like that of the IMF or World Bank based on GDP and other factors. The WTO’s universal consensus mechanism has failed; a more flexible system is needed to allow rules to evolve over time alongside changes in the global economy. Although the biggest economies, especially the United States, would have more voting power in this arrangement, they would still need to work with other members to implement major changes.\nThe rules of the fair-trade union would also include a limited set of carve-outs for national security. Members could apply higher tariffs and offer industrial subsidies to support the domestic production of goods considered critical to their national security, such as semiconductors and missile systems. To avoid spiraling subsidies and overproduction, countries would be encouraged to coordinate and build symbiotic supply chains that further reinforced trade complementarities among member states. Even when national security necessitated the use of protectionist measures, the overarching goal of the union would still be to facilitate market competition based on innovation, cost, and quality.\nTo be sure, such carve-outs would create challenging borderline cases for goods such as steel that are relevant to national security but are also commonly used for other purposes. In these cases, union members would have to work together to decide how to classify goods. Ideally, union members would agree that as long as they could rely on supplies from one another, they could avoid exercising their carve-out privileges and would let markets function.\nThe union would also sponsor the development of a new data architecture to better track trade flows and enforce trade rules. Today’s trade data is woefully inadequate for the complexities of modern trade. In some cases, it lacks the granularity needed to distinguish between different types of critical goods, such as semiconductors and batteries. It also does a poor job of capturing the globalized nature of supply chains, in which inputs can be manufactured in a variety of countries, collected and assembled into a partially finished good in others, and then shipped elsewhere for final assembly. Member countries of a new customs union would need to invest in systems to collect the detailed data that would allow the union to apply differential tariffs, enforce its rules, and prevent countries from avoiding penalties through the transshipment of goods through lower-tariff jurisdictions.\nIn addition, the union would need to develop a set of rules to prevent corporations from taking advantage of tax havens and depriving governments of the revenue they need to function. The global minimum tax agreement proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and endorsed by the Biden administration is a good model. It sets a minimum corporate tax level and allows countries to apply additional taxes on corporations that operate within their borders but domicile in jurisdictions with lower rates. Under these rules, if a company wants to do business with members of the fair-trade union, it needs to pay its fair share—regardless of where it files its articles of incorporation.\nA RISING TIDE\nAlthough this fair-trade union is at odds with Trump’s current approach of tariff threats and bilateral trade deals, it aligns with many of the administration’s overall trade goals. And the evidence suggests that elements of the union could attract bipartisan support, whether picked up by the president or pursued by his successors. Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative in Trump’s first term, has proposed a trade regime that would use high external tariffs and lower, frequently adjusted internal tariffs to achieve balanced trade among member countries. Michael Pettis, an economist popular among Trump’s trade team, has suggested a similar idea based on the proposal John Maynard Keynes put forward at the Bretton Woods Conference before Harry Dexter White got the better of him.\nDespite the risks of Trump’s current approach, his attacks on the existing trade order have opened a window during which structural change may be possible. The third great reordering of the global economy is an opportunity to imagine what a better trade system could look like. A new fair-trade customs union that built on American strengths and used cooperative leverage to promote true market competition would reverse the trend toward unilateralism and address the roots of the United States’ trade imbalances. If Trump continues to pursue tariffs at all costs and does not reverse course, the opportunity will fall to the next set of political leaders, Democratic or Republican, to pursue this kind of solution.\nFixing global trade requires pressuring countries that do not want to play by market rules. But the long-term vision of a fair-trade union is not to divide the global economy forever. Instead, the goal is to expand to incorporate new members as more countries understand the benefits of playing by the rules and the costs of losing market access to a substantial share of the global economy if they do not. To ensure that the new union maintains its teeth, membership should be conditional on evidence that countries have already met a high bar. The lesson of China’s accession to the WTO is that real change must precede market access, not the other way around.\nCutting the trade deficit doesn’t need to rely on manufacturing alone.\nThe size of the U.S. market and Washington’s willingness to establish and maintain a system that provides certainty and predictability to its partners are critical to getting other countries to participate. As other large economies joined, this incentive would only grow. Mature economies in Europe and North America would gain from being part of a coalition with the collective might to stand up to China. Emerging economies would benefit from access to an economic bloc representing a sizable share, if not the majority, of the global economy. Traditionally, these economies worked their way up the global value chain by manufacturing cheap commodity goods such as clothing and toys before moving to basic electronics and eventually to high-end, advanced products. But China’s strategy of large-scale subsidies to businesses, massive industrial overcapacity, and demand repression is blocking this economic path for many developing countries. With China’s export machine flooding emerging markets with goods such as electric cars and telecom equipment, domestic alternatives are crushed before they have a chance to grow.\nThis customs union would offer emerging economies an alternative: a set of wealthy consumer markets open to accepting their imports provided they follow the union’s rules. Today, countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam have little reason to risk China’s ire by openly aligning themselves with a Western economic bloc. If they committed to upholding fair trade, however, they would immediately be more competitive than China when trading with union member states. A country such as Vietnam, able to trade with key partners in the union without tariff barriers and protected from China’s economic leverage, would have a path to evolve from a producer of low-cost goods and a hub for Chinese transshipment to an economy that moves up the value chain.\nAs more of the global market abided by these rules, the harder it would be to compete outside it. If it succeeded, this economic arrangement would present China with a clear choice: restructure its economy to engage fairly in the world economy or pay higher costs to trade with members of the bloc.\nThis union would impose some costs on the United States, but far fewer than a policy that raises tariffs on all of the United States’ trading partners. Supporting domestic or “friend shored” production among allies and partners would increase costs in the short term, but it would also shift more of the long-term benefits of trade to workers, support middle-class job creation in both manufacturing and services, and enhance the United States’ national security.\nThe global economy is at an inflection point. The tariff spree will likely fizzle, but the underlying need to reform the international trading system will remain. The United States’ position in the global economy depends on how leaders take advantage of this moment. It is not too late to seize the reins of the next great economic reordering and steer the world economy toward a system that lives up to the promise of free trade.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "The Real China Model", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/real-china-model-wang-kroeber", "text": "A decade ago, planners in Beijing unveiled Made in China 2025, an ambitious scheme to take leadership of the industries of the future. The plan identified ten sectors for investment, including energy, semiconductors, industrial automation, and high-tech materials. It aimed to upgrade China’s manufacturing in these sectors and others, reduce the country’s dependence on imports and foreign firms, and improve the competitiveness of Chinese companies in global markets. The overarching goal was to transform China into a technological leader and turn China’s national champion firms into global ones. The government backed this vision with enormous financial support, spending one to two percent of GDP each year on direct and indirect subsidies, cheap credit, and tax breaks.\nChina has been wildly successful in these efforts. It not only leads the world in electric vehicles and clean technology power generation; it is also dominant in drones, industrial automation, and other electronics products. Its lock on rare-earth magnets produced a quick trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump. Chinese firms are on track to master the more sophisticated technological goods produced by the United States, Europe, and other parts of Asia.\nAnd yet China’s model still has many skeptics. Lavish funding, they point out, has led to waste and corruption. It has created industries in which dozens of competitors manufacture similar products and struggle to make a profit. The resulting deflation makes companies wary of hiring new staff or raising wages, leading to lower consumer confidence and weaker growth. China’s economy, which once looked poised to overtake the United States’ as the world’s biggest, is mired in a slowdown and may never match the American one in total output.\nThese problems are not trivial. But it is a serious error to think they are big enough to derail China’s technological momentum. Beijing’s industrial policy succeeded not simply because planners picked the right sectors and subsidized them. It worked because the state built out the deep infrastructure needed to become a resilient technological powerhouse. It created an innovation ecosystem centered on powerful electricity and digital networks, and it established a massive workforce with advanced manufacturing knowledge. Call it an all-of-the-above technology strategy. This approach has enabled China to develop new technologies and scale them up faster than any other country. Its model is unlikely to be pushed off course by sluggish economic growth or U.S. sanctions.\nChina’s industrial and technological strength is now a permanent feature of the world economy. The United States should compete with China to keep its overall technological leadership and sustain the industries needed for broad-based prosperity and national security. But American policymakers must recognize that their current playbook—export controls, tariffs, and scattershot industrial policy—is ineffective. Simply trying to slow China down will not work. Washington must instead focus on building up its own systems of industrial strength by making patient, long-term investments not just in select, key industries but in energy, information, and transportation infrastructure. If it doesn’t, the United States will face more deindustrialization and lose its technological leadership.\nBECOMING STRONG\nThe notoriously difficult Nürburgring racetrack is nicknamed the Green Hell for its twisting, 13-mile course through the mountains in western Germany. It is a track that tests even the steeliest drivers and the most advanced vehicles. The cars that have typically performed best are designed by celebrated German companies such as BMW, Porsche, and Mercedes, or by long-established manufacturers in Italy, Japan, and South Korea.\nBut in June 2025, the course saw a new speed record for electric vehicles, and the car that set it was not made by the typical champions. It was set by Xiaomi, a Chinese company better known for its moderately priced smartphones and rice cookers. It produced its first car only a year before. But Xiaomi nonetheless made the third-fastest car—electric or otherwise—ever to race through the Green Hell.\nXiaomi’s triumph on the racetrack was a symbol of China’s surprisingly swift rise to clean energy dominance. China made nearly three-quarters of the world’s electric vehicles in 2024 and accounted for 40 percent of global EV exports. It has a lock on the solar supply chain. Chinese companies make most of the world’s batteries, both for EVs and for other uses. And the country produces 60 percent of the electrolyzers used to extract hydrogen from water, which is the most effective way to produce clean hydrogen-based power.\nSimply trying to slow China down will not work.\nThe standard explanation for China’s technological success is that the central government targeted various industries for support; provided hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, tax breaks, and low-interest loans to get these sectors going; and helped Chinese firms steal or copy technology from other states. This is part of what took place. But that story misses the bigger picture. China succeeded not only because it subsidized particular industries but also because it invested in the deep infrastructure—underlying physical systems and human expertise—that enables innovation and efficient production.\nSome of this infrastructure consists of transportation systems, such as roads, railways, and ports. Over the last 30 years, China has built a national expressway network twice the length of the American interstate system, a high-speed train network with more miles of track than the rest of the world combined, and a formidable network of ports, the largest of which, in Shanghai, moves more cargo in some years than all U.S. ports put together.\nBut if China had stopped there, it would not have reached today’s technological heights. Other infrastructure systems have proved crucial. One is China’s digital network. In its infancy, the Internet was widely thought to corrode authoritarian regimes because it removed their monopoly on information and made it easier for ordinary people to organize across large distances. In 2000, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared that controlling the Internet was like “trying to nail Jell-O to a wall.” But China’s leadership concluded the opposite. They bet that high-quality data infrastructure would strengthen the government by enabling it to better monitor and manage public opinion, as well as track people’s movements, while hugely benefiting the country’s industrial sectors and creating a high-tech ecosystem.\nSo China nailed Jell-O to the wall. It built a domestic Internet that rapidly connected virtually the entire population while blocking what its people could see from abroad. The gamble paid off. Thanks to Beijing’s early and aggressive promotion of mobile phones, Chinese firms helped pioneer the mobile Internet. Top platforms such as Byte-Dance, Alibaba, and Tencent became world-class innovators. Huawei became the world’s leading producer of 5G equipment. The Chinese population now uses smartphones constantly, and the Communist Party remains very much in charge.\nIT’S ELECTRIC\nThe next key infrastructure system behind China’s prowess is its electric grid. Over the past quarter century, China has led the world in building power plants, adding the equivalent of the United Kingdom’s total supply every year. It now generates more electricity each year than the United States and the European Union combined. The country has invested heavily in ultrahigh voltage transmission lines, which can carry electricity efficiently over long distances, and in all types of battery storage. This abundant power supply has enabled the rapid growth of electricity-reliant transport systems, namely high-speed rail and electric vehicles.\nChina has overcome the obstacles that long prevented electricity from becoming the world’s main energy and supplanting the direct combustion of fossil fuels: that it was hard to move, hard to store, and ineffective at fueling transport. As a result, China is well on its way to becoming the world’s first economy powered mainly by electricity. Electricity accounts for 21 percent of energy use in the world as a whole and 22 percent of energy use in the United States. In China, electricity is nearly 30 percent of energy use, more than in any other large country except Japan. And this share is growing fast: about six percent a year, compared with 2.6 percent for the world as a whole and 0.6 percent for the United States.\nChina’s electrification did not arise out of a master plan. Instead, it was the product of technocratic responses to discrete issues such as power shortages in industrial zones and the need to free up rail capacity for purposes other than moving coal. Now, however, rapid electrification serves a clear strategic purpose. It is a motor of industrial innovation—“powering the future,” as Damien Ma and Lizzi Lee put it in a July Foreign Affairs article. And the government is keenly aware that abundant, cheap electricity provides the country with a crucial edge in the power-intensive industries of the future, most obviously artificial intelligence. Beijing thus strives to ensure that its electricity system remains the biggest and best in the world.\nChina’s most subtle piece of deep infrastructure is its more than 70-million-person industrial workforce—the largest in the world. Thanks to the country’s intense buildup of complex manufacturing supply chains, Chinese factory managers, engineers, and workers have decades of “process knowledge”—hands-on knowledge, gained from experience—about how to make things and how to make them better. This process knowledge enables iterative innovation, or constantly tweaking products so that they can be made more efficiently, at better quality, and with lower costs. It also enables scaling: Chinese factories can rally a large, experienced workforce behind making almost any new product. Finally, and most important, process knowledge allows China to create entire new industries. A factory worker in Shenzhen might assemble iPhones one year and Huawei Mate phones the next and then move on to build drones for DJI or electric vehicle batteries for CATL.\nProcess knowledge in the Chinese workforce may be Beijing’s greatest economic asset. But it is hard to quantify. That is one reason why the rest of the world has persistently underestimated China’s capabilities. Some analysts believe that China is the country that assembles most of the world’s smartphones and other electronics because its workforce costs are low. In reality, the country remains the world’s leader because its workforce has proved its worth in sophistication, scale, and speed.\nAnalysts also miss the red-hot ambition of China’s entrepreneurs. The country is full of businesspeople with the optimism, the daring, or the foolishness to try disrupting sectors. Xiaomi’s legendary founder, Lei Jun, gambled on EVs in 2021, announcing that his company, then valued at $80 billion, would invest $10 billion in them and that it would be his “last major entrepreneurial project.” On the German racetrack, it paid off. Lei was able to plug into an electronics ecosystem, battery partners, and an experienced workforce to make high-speed EVs in just a few years’ time.\nTo see why American companies often struggle to do the same, compare Xiaomi’s experience with that of Apple. In 2014, the computing giant considered developing electric vehicles. It was hardly a crazy idea. Apple had a market capitalization of $600 billion and a cash hoard of $40 billion, giving it far deeper pockets than Xiaomi. By conventional measures, it also had greater technological sophistication. But the United States does not have the energy system or the manufacturing capacity of China, so there was no easy infrastructure for Apple to tap into. As a result, in 2024, the company’s board pulled the plug on a decade of EV development. That same year, Xiaomi expanded its manufacturing capacity and repeatedly raised its delivery target. Meanwhile, the American EV champion, Tesla, faces declining sales in all of its top markets, including China. Chinese buyers now believe that domestic brands are more innovative than Tesla, and more in tune with fast-changing consumer tastes.\nADVERSE REACTION\nIt is a mistake to underestimate China. But the country does face serious economic challenges, many of which arise at least in part from the very industrial policies that have led to its triumphs. China’s technocrats have steered resources not just into high-productivity infrastructure but also into state-owned enterprises that contribute little to the country’s vibrant tech ecosystem, rack up huge debts, and drag down the economy’s efficiency. The politically driven constraints on some of the country’s most creative entrepreneurs, such as Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, and Zhang Yiming, the co-founder of Byte-Dance—who were humiliated when Beijing expanded its power over the consumer Internet—have chilled private-sector confidence.\nUnregulated subsidies, meanwhile, have led to widespread graft. A prime example is China’s semiconductor industry, which has received over $100 billion in direct state industrial policy support since 2014. Some of the projects funded by this money were outright frauds. Other projects were legitimate, but both businesspeople and government officials stole from them. More than a dozen senior chip industry figures have been jailed for corruption since 2022, including the head of Tsinghua Unigroup (which operates several important chipmakers) and the chief of China’s national integrated circuit fund. Two sitting ministers of industry and information technology were fired for graft.\nChina’s subsidies may also, at times, suppress innovation. Generous manufacturing spending helps promote the tech ecosystem, but it also enables less efficient firms to stay in business far longer than they would in a more market-driven economy. That lowers profits for everyone, as companies continually cut their prices to maintain market share. This, in turn, means that manufacturing companies cannot spend as much on research and development. In fact, they need to be cautious about hiring new staff or raising wages.\nChina nailed Jell-O to the wall.\nThe solar industry is a case in point. Owning the solar supply chain is a strategic triumph for the state, but companies producing solar modules mostly sell undifferentiated products, fighting for minuscule profits while cutting prices to the bone. The same is true for manufacturers of EVs, smartphones, and many other products, with too many companies making similar products at paper-thin margins. China’s tech sectors are global success stories, but the companies in them are often miserable.\nIf China is too generous with tech and manufacturing businesses, then it is not generous enough with those providing services. Beijing chronically overregulates service sectors, cracking down on Internet companies that the government sees as engaging in monopolistic practices or threatening political or social instability. It tightly controls finance, health care, and education. As a result, job growth in these sectors has been weak, which means job growth in China as a whole has greatly suffered. Even in this industry-centric country, services employ about 60 percent of the urban workforce and have accounted for all net job creation in the past decade. With jobs hard to come by, wages rising little or at all, and the price of houses—which are most Chinese people’s main asset—falling, Chinese consumers have become reluctant to spend. Private businesses, seeing weak demand, have in turn become even more reluctant to hire or raise wages.\nChina’s current model, then, virtually guarantees slower economic growth. Thanks to the vicious circle Beijing has created, the economy now routinely struggles to reach its annual growth target of five percent and is constantly battling deflation. Meanwhile, because domestic demand is sluggish, more and more of the output of China’s prodigiously productive manufacturing sector will need to be exported, leading to ever larger trade surpluses. China’s trade surplus is already almost a trillion dollars, more than double the figure of just five years earlier.\nThe risks for Beijing are obvious. Slower growth means that the economy could become less dynamic, and tech firms could lose the ability or drive to keep innovating. Ever-rising trade surpluses could trigger much more severe and coordinated protectionism from the rest of the world, with dozens of countries joining the United States in erecting tariff barriers to Chinese imports.\nBut Beijing is likely to overcome these risks, just as it has overcome many challenges in the past. It has begun to recognize that subsidies are too high and has started withdrawing them. Smaller and less efficient players will exit the market. Consolidation is already visible in the electric vehicle sector, in which the number of companies has fallen from 57 to 49 since 2022. A third of EV producers now sell at least 10,000 cars a month, up from less than a quarter of producers three years ago. As for protectionism, most countries will find that there are simply no cost-effective alternatives to the products China exports. There are also ways to evade tariff barriers, such as by shipping goods through third countries or by setting up assembly plants in other states (as the Chinese car manufacturer BYD is doing in Brazil and Hungary).\nChinese officials, for their part, seem to believe that the costs of lower growth, deflation, and irritated trade partners are worth paying. “We must recognize the fundamental importance of the real economy . . . and never deindustrialize,” said Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 2020, a year in which China’s manufacturers met the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic by surging the production of medical equipment and consumer goods. The message was clear: Beijing’s main goal is not fast growth but self-sufficiency and technological progress.\nCAN’T STOP, WON’T STOP\nWashington has not stood idly by as China’s tech and manufacturing sectors progress. Alarmed by the ambitions of Made in China 2025, the first Trump administration breathed life into some of the most moribund offices inside the Department of Commerce, summoning a powerful bureaucratic apparatus to choke off China’s access to critical materials. U.S. officials realized that China was highly dependent on Western technology inputs, such as leading-edge semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. They thus gambled that a full blockade of these technologies would severely slow China’s technological engine. This was a bipartisan proposition: when U.S. President Joe Biden came into office, in 2021, he maintained his predecessor’s restrictions. In fact, the Biden administration tightened export controls on advanced chips, especially those essential for artificial intelligence, and on semiconductor equipment.\nAnd yet the success of these controls has been mixed at best. In 2018, two big Chinese tech companies, ZTE and Fujian Jinhua, nearly collapsed after being cut off from American technology. But more capable businesses, aided by Washington lawyers and lobbyists, have been able to bounce back. (Trump recently lifted restrictions on leading-edge AI chips made by Nvidia, allowing the company to again sell its products to China.) Huawei was clearly battered after the Commerce Department sanctioned it in 2019. But by 2025, the firm announced that its previous year’s revenues had recovered to 2019 levels. It is still recognizably the same company, one that excels at making 5G equipment and handsets. Except now, it is also one of China’s leading semiconductor innovators, after it invested billions in replacing American chips.\nOther companies have done an even better job of weathering U.S. restrictions. SMIC, one of China’s most important chip foundries, has doubled its revenues since it was sanctioned in 2020. It still lags far behind the industry-leading TSMC in profitability, but it has made certain technological breakthroughs, learning to produce seven-nanometer chips—a technological breakthrough that was considered unlikely after its sanctions. Similarly, restrictions on AI technology did little to prevent the rise of DeepSeek, which has produced an AI reasoning model matched by only a few other firms, all in Silicon Valley.\nBeijing’s main goal is not fast growth but self-sufficiency and technological progress.\nDeepSeek’s success is not hard to understand. Chinese AI firms may not have access to the same leading-edge chips that American ones do, but they do have plentiful access to excellent talent, mature chips, as well as pools of data. They also have a near-unlimited supply of cheap electricity—something their U.S. competitors lack. As a result, according to global technical benchmarks, Chinese large language models are, at most, six months behind American leaders, a gap that is steadily shrinking. Far from blocking China’s progress, U.S. tech restrictions have triggered a Sputnik moment in China. Its companies are bigger, meaner, and significantly less dependent on U.S. companies than they were just a decade earlier.\nSome American officials realize that the United States cannot win just by attacking China’s industries. The Biden administration’s economic planners, for instance, created an industrial policy designed to help the United States advance its own strategic sectors. The country passed the CHIPS Act, which beefed up semiconductor production, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which subsidized clean technologies. But despite earmarking hundreds of billions of dollars, these endeavors have mostly foundered.\nThe reason for these failures is simple. The United States has not built up enough deep infrastructure of its own. Toward the beginning of his term, Biden unveiled an ambitious proposal to deliver Internet service to almost every American. But this “Internet for All” plan had not connected anyone before he left office. There is still no national network of EV charging stations, even though Congress earmarked billions to create one. And Washington has failed to dismantle the bureaucratic and regulatory barriers to building electric transmission systems, which make it hard for energy companies to take advantage of the tax credits the Inflation Reduction Act created for solar and wind projects.\nNow, those credits are poised to disappear. Trump’s July budget reconciliation bill phases out his predecessor’s solar and wind subsidies for most projects that haven’t begun by the end of 2026. The CHIPS Act remains on the books, but the president has derided the law as “horrible” and “ridiculous.” Trump’s tariffs, meanwhile, have caused deep uncertainty among manufacturers, who are pausing investments while scrambling to maintain their supply chains. The White House claims that the tariffs will force manufacturers to make their goods on American soil once the restrictions take full effect. But the administration’s analysis is faulty. Manufacturers depend on imports for many of their inputs, and they have proved reluctant to make big investment decisions based on Trump’s wavering pronouncements. In fact, the country shed over 10,000 manufacturing jobs between April and July alone, just after Trump announced his plan to impose high tariffs on virtually every country.\nTrump, of course, is hardly unique in his failure to deliver. American politicians love to celebrate whenever a new mine or semiconductor facility opens. But the U.S. industrial sector continues to shrink amid product delays, layoffs, and falling production quality. Real manufacturing output, which had risen steadily until the 2008 financial crisis, plunged then and has never recovered. This shriveling is happening even in defense manufacturing. Despite an influx of cash, almost every class of U.S. naval ship under construction is behind schedule, some by as much as three years. Producers of artillery shells are only slowly ramping up manufacturing, even though Washington has depleted its stockpiles to help Ukraine. And U.S. efforts to wean its military off Chinese rare-earth minerals have faltered.\nThe United States does retain its advantage over China in several critical areas: software, biotech, and AI, as well as in its university-driven innovation ecosystem. But these institutions face an uncertain future. Since returning to office, Trump has set about defunding scientific research and depriving the country of skilled labor. Government agencies are now scrutinizing top universities, including Harvard and Columbia, and yanking government grants and threatening to revoke universities’ tax-exempt status over exaggerated charges of anti-Semitism. The White House has slashed funding for the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Meanwhile, Trump’s hostility toward immigrants has driven researchers who would come to the United States to look for positions at companies and universities elsewhere. Aggressive deportations are hurting America’s construction industry. The country simply has not set up its innovation ecosystem well for the years ahead.\nBACK TO BASICS\nThe United States can, and should, reverse Trump’s spending cuts and immigration restrictions as soon as is feasible. But competing effectively against China requires more than just removing self-imposed restraints. Washington’s failings extend across administrations for a reason: American officials, Democrats and Republicans alike, have not taken China’s competence seriously. “China doesn’t innovate—it steals,” wrote Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton on social media in April, epitomizing how Americans trivialize Chinese accomplishments. Too many U.S. leaders continue to believe that a more exquisite export control regime will halt China’s technological momentum. They are sending lawyers into an engineering fight. They need to realize that no matter how hard the United States squeezes, it will not break China’s industrial and technological system.\nWhat Washington should do is strengthen its own capacity. That means starting the hard work of building up the United States’ deep infrastructure. Washington should not try to replicate Beijing’s massive and often wasteful investments in all systems. But it should do better than Biden’s ad-hoc, sector-by-sector approach. And it must abandon Trump’s strategy of hoping that the tariff cudgel will force a reshoring of industry, and his focus on old heavy industries such as steel.\nInstead, policymakers must start to think in ecosystem terms, as China has. The United States has long-standing strengths in entrepreneurship and finance, so state-led investments in modern deep infrastructure are likely to have big payoffs, just as investments in railroads and highways did in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Large-scale infrastructure projects can stimulate demand for different technologies and create the process knowledge needed to build them, which are crucial first steps in rebuilding the manufacturing base. A top priority should be building a bigger and better electricity system that makes use of nuclear power, natural gas, and renewable energy sources. To maximize its use of renewables, the United States should invest in building more battery storage and high-voltage transmission lines.\nWashington is sending lawyers to an engineering fight.\nThe United States will also need to find ways to reduce cost structures throughout its industries. Because it is a rich country with high wages and labor and environmental standards, it will never be able to compete with China or India in terms of availability of low-cost labor, and it should not try. But to be serious about rebuilding industry, Washington must display a commitment to making its markets attractive for capital-intensive sectors. Eliminating Trump’s ruinous tariffs, which will make American manufacturing prohibitively expensive, is essential, as is providing abundant, cheap energy. Yet so is permitting reform that eliminates the excessive regulatory costs of new construction, ample government funding for basic research and development, and liberal immigration policies that enable companies to source the best talent from anywhere in the world. The last is not strictly a cost measure, but it is essential to rebuilding U.S. process knowledge. Much of that knowledge now exists abroad, and the United States must be willing to import it.\nAbove all, Washington should not underestimate what it is up against. Beijing has made achieving technological supremacy a top political priority. The subsidies it used to push technological progress produced plenty of waste, but that was a side-effect of achieving leadership in the industries of the future. To compete, the United States must also make a commitment to leading in these industries, and it must be more willing to accept mistakes and some waste as the price of success.\nChina’s model has worked because its policymakers have gotten a lot of things right and have given Chinese entrepreneurs the conditions for success. The country may have problems, but it will continue to be effective. And the longer it succeeds, the more the United States and its allies will deindustrialize under pressure from Chinese firms in energy, industrial goods, and perhaps even artificial intelligence. If the United States is to compete effectively, its policymakers must spend less time worrying about how to weaken their rival and more time figuring out how to make their country the best and most vigorous version of itself.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "China Is Enjoying Trump 2.0", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/china-enjoying-trump-20", "text": "In the wake of Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election in 2024, Chinese policymakers and intellectual elites feared the worst for relations between China and the United States. The bitterness and trauma of the first Trump administration’s trade war lingered in Beijing. And with an already sluggish economy and glaring vulnerabilities from trade interdependence, China’s leaders braced for what experts privately called an “unprecedented storm” that could doom bilateral relations.\nSix months into Trump’s second term, however, the outlook in Beijing has improved markedly. The storm came and went—and left Chinese policymakers feeling that they have far more power and leverage over the United States on trade than they had previously imagined. And for now, at least, Beijing views the trade-deficit-obsessed Trump as a more pragmatic and adaptable partner to work with than the China hawks that called the shots during Trump’s first term.\nChina’s leaders now believe they can broker a trade deal with Trump to reduce tensions. They are eager to host a summit between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping this fall to establish a more positive tone for the relationship between Washington and Beijing. The newfound optimism does not mean that Beijing thinks it has found a permanent solution to U.S.-Chinese relations, however; the overwhelming feeling in elite circles in China remains that the two countries are entangled in long-term strategic competition. But China’s leaders want to use their trade leverage to craft a deal that will buy them time to mitigate their political and security vulnerabilities. In dealing with a second Trump administration, China’s leaders believe they may have found an opportunity to achieve their goals without a war with the United States.\nTHE TABLES HAVE TURNED\nWhen Trump was inaugurated for a second time on January 20, 2025, Beijing expected that he would resume bilateral relations where he had left them four years earlier. That meant revamped efforts by his administration to address the trade imbalance between the United States and China, likely through aggressive punitive tariffs. Beijing also braced itself for U.S. criticism of China’s political regime, including its treatment of minority groups and dissidents, and worried about enhanced U.S. support for Taiwan.\nEarly signs confirmed these suspicions. In February and March, Trump imposed two rounds of ten percent tariffs on Chinese exports because of concerns about fentanyl coming into the United States from China. When China responded to Trump’s broader “Liberation Day” tariffs in April with countermeasures including reciprocal tariffs and export restrictions, the United States placed an additional 125 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the United States. Combined with existing levies, by mid-April, the U.S. tariff rate for goods from China had reached nearly 150 percent—a major escalation that didn’t seem to offer any way out.\nBut then the situation took an interesting turn. Many observers believed that China had taken a major risk by pushing back on Trump and that China’s economy would not be able to withstand a trade war. But once reciprocal tariffs were in place, Beijing was surprised to see that it was Washington that was more eager to de-escalate trade tensions. The United States and China signed an agreement in Geneva on May 12 to reduce tariff rates, and Trump and Xi had a follow-up phone call on June 5. Although the agreement did not eliminate tariffs, the first round of trade escalation was over. China’s leaders felt, to their surprise, that they were in a very strong position on trade with the United States.\n“SO WHAT?”\nMany policymakers in Beijing concluded from the events in April and May that the United States’ ability to tolerate a trade shock is weaker than China’s, which made Washington desperate to find a solution. As Adam Posen has argued in Foreign Affairs, the “supply shock” that the United States faces from higher tariffs is more difficult to absorb than the “demand shock” on China. This is not only because U.S. consumers immediately feel a supply shortage but also because China’s political system makes it easier for Beijing to manipulate domestic public opinion and limit blowback. Chinese leaders were pleased to discover that Trump changed his tune when tariffs affected the stock market, the bond market, the retail industry, and consumers. The U.S. reaction to Trump’s tariffs revealed to Beijing new pressure points that China could potentially exploit.\nChina’s leaders also learned how dependent the United States is on rare-earth elements and magnets, the supply of which is almost entirely in Beijing’s hands. China halted exports of key rare earths on April 4, which threatened the ability of the United States to procure the metals it needs to manufacture cars, airplanes, and other products. At the May meeting in Geneva, China agreed to remove the restrictions on rare-earth exports it had imposed in response to “Liberation Day”; yet after accusing Washington of violating the agreement by placing new restrictions on Chinese companies, including prohibiting U.S. companies from using AI chips made by the technology company Huawei, China delayed following through with its commitment.\nThe ensuing confrontation further proved to China’s leaders the effectiveness of their leverage over the United States. Beijing’s reluctance to release more rare earths infuriated Washington, which responded with visa restrictions on Chinese students and export restrictions on jet engines. What China’s leaders learned from this response was that rare earths are so important to U.S. industry that Washington will go to extreme lengths to protect their supply. For many Chinese policymakers, rare earths are China’s first effective strategic chokepoint in the history of U.S.-Chinese relations.\nBeijing also realized that its efforts over the past decade to boost economic resilience have paid off. Starting in 2018, China reduced its dependence on U.S. supply chains and diversified the sources of its imports and exports. By the end of 2024, in terms of total value, China traded more with the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations than with the United States. The extensive use of transshipment—funneling Chinese goods through other countries, often emerging economies—also cushions Chinese exports from some shocks of a bilateral trade war because it complicates attempts to impose direct sanctions on China. The Trump administration has been trying to crack down on transshipment in its ongoing trade negotiations, but any transshipment penalties will be nearly impossible to enforce unless Washington fully retreats from the world economy and stops trading with any country that has ties to China.\nIn policy dialogues in Beijing this summer, Chinese scholars and decisionmakers repeated a simple phrase that captured their newfound sense of empowerment: “So what?” “There is a trade war. So what?” “Trump might dial up the pressure on China. So what?” When discussing how China might react to Trump’s unpredictability even if there is a trade deal, Chinese decision-makers appeared fully confident in their ability to weather the storm. There is now a conviction that the United States’ ability to damage China’s economic interests through tariffs has declined, which offers Beijing more latitude in future trade negotiations.\nDEALING WITH THE DON\nChina’s policymakers now believe that the United States is unlikely to launch another round of major tariffs on China if doing so would hurt the United States significantly in the process. As a result, Beijing sees a path forward through regular and piecemeal trade negotiations, which suits its preferences. China’s leaders are happy to negotiate short-term fixes to the trade imbalance, especially if doing so avoids addressing the long-term structural issues in the Chinese economy that are harder to change, such as widespread government subsidies of local industry. Beijing, for instance, is willing to increase Chinese purchases of American products in exchange for the United States’ easing some export controls on high-tech products. Beijing is even willing to discuss voluntary export restrictions to hold back shipments of certain Chinese products, such as batteries, to the United States, which would help reduce the trade imbalance.\nBeijing is also optimistic about a short-term deal because of the differences it perceives between the first and the second Trump administrations. Unlike during Trump’s first term, in which anti-China “new cold warriors” shaped policy, the second Trump administration has made little reference to ideology and mostly avoided criticizing the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. In the past six months, Washington has also been restrained in its support of Taiwan: not only did Trump impose new 20 percent tariffs on Taiwan at the end of July, he also refused to allow Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te to use New York as a stopover during Lai’s scheduled international travel—departing from a long tradition in U.S.-Taiwanese relations. In other words, Trump’s focus on trade and his indifference to sensitive political issues is exactly what Beijing has long sought from U.S. leaders. It’s almost as if Chinese leaders finally got the “businessman” they expected to deal with when Trump was first elected in 2016.\nBeijing feels it can withstand U.S. pressure as long as the main issue is trade, not politics.\nIn Trump’s first term, Beijing tried to manage the president by managing his team, including by setting up a backchannel for negotiations through Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. This approach failed, partly because of conflicting priorities among members of the Trump administration. This time around, Beijing believes its best option is to manage Trump himself. Negotiating directly with the president, rather than working behind the scenes, appears to be the most likely way to shape Trump’s agenda. Trump has also more clearly set the priorities for his current administration than he did for the previous one. Trump’s team has been extremely loyal to his policy agenda: even Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who harshly criticized China’s human rights record and authoritarian political system when he was in the U.S. Senate, has been restrained in his criticisms of China while running the State Department.\nGetting face time with Trump is thus increasingly important for China. This is why Beijing is hoping for a leadership summit in the fall in China. In the view of Chinese leaders, for whom each foreign policy action carries important symbolic weight, it is Trump’s turn to visit China: Xi visited the United States in 2023, so the next presidential visit should be in China to show the equality of the relationship. Chinese leaders hope to use this meeting to appeal directly to Trump and probe his appetite for any kind of grand bargain that might reduce political tensions. For example, China hopes it can get the United States to concede on some of its policies supporting Taiwan, such as reducing U.S. arms sales or more firmly signaling U.S. commitment to oppose any Taiwanese attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. The goal of winning such concessions is not to immediately make it possible for China to take Taiwan by force, but to further shake Taiwanese confidence in the U.S. commitment to the island.\nPROLONGING THE PROCESS\nBeijing’s sense of empowerment on trade, however, has not translated into overall optimism about China’s long-term relationship with the United States. Many Chinese leaders don’t believe a trade deal is Trump’s endgame, despite his focus on trade deficits. Instead, they see reaching a trade deal as the first step in the long process of reshaping U.S.-Chinese relations, with U.S. policymakers then free to focus on whatever the next source of friction might be.\nChina’s community of foreign policy scholars and decisionmakers fears such a shift in U.S. attention. The common anxiety is that positive trade signals from the United States are tactical and ephemeral, and therefore it is only a matter of time before Washington resumes hostility toward China and its political system. The Trump administration could renew its campaign to target Communist Party members and their families, which involved limiting access to visas to travel to the United States, or it could ramp up support for Taiwan through political, economic, military, and diplomatic assistance. Beijing also does not want the United States to increase efforts that, as Chinese foreign policy insiders often put it, attempt to “separate the Chinese Communist Party from the Chinese people,” which the party perceives as a fundamental attack on its rule, nor does it want the United States to reinvigorate a global anti-China coalition that could isolate Beijing. Unlike with trade issues, in which Beijing is approaching the table with confidence and sees room for dealmaking, a focus on politics will only push the bilateral relationship toward free fall. To Beijing, this is what happened in 2020 when Washington blamed China for the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a series of increasingly bitter public recriminations from both sides and drove U.S.-Chinese relations to new lows.\nBeijing’s confidence in trade negotiations combined with its worries about long-term tensions between the two countries may encourage China to deliberately prolong the trade negotiation process to keep the conversation going even after a first agreement to address trade imbalances, fentanyl sales, and the free flow of rare earths. Beijing feels it can withstand U.S. pressure as long as the main issue is trade, not politics. In addition, China is likely to specify rescission clauses in any potential deal to give it flexibility to respond to the Trump administration. If Trump changes his mind about focusing on trade, or if Washington targets China on political issues and takes hostile actions against Beijing on Taiwan, China is ready to flex its muscles by refusing to implement its side of the trade deal and to retaliate with its own economic measures.\nAs Beijing looks toward the next stage of dealmaking, it remains on edge about which version of the Trump administration will emerge. Beijing wants face-to-face negotiations with Trump, focused on economic and trade issues, to tie his hands with a commitment to positive and friendly U.S.-Chinese relations for the next three years at least. But its plan could backfire. China’s inflated sense of empowerment on trade could leave its policymakers too comfortable, which could provoke a harsher U.S. response and send bilateral relations back into a tailspin of mutual distrust and hostility. In many ways, policymakers and analysts in Beijing believe an eventual downturn in relations is inevitable. And given Trump’s unpredictability, an initial trade deal may turn out to be a short-lived reprieve. No matter how strong China’s leaders feel their position is vis-à-vis the United States after six months of Trump’s second term, they feel there is no choice but to prepare for the likely possibility that much worse is yet to come.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "By Land or by Sea", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/land-or-sea-paine", "text": "Great-power competition once again defines international relations. But the exact contours of today’s contest remain the subject of debate. Some observers emphasize ideological precedents from the Cold War. Others focus on changing military balances. Still others highlight leaders and their choices. In truth, modern conflicts over the international system flow from a long-standing, if unrecognized, disagreement over the sources of power and prosperity. The dispute originates from geography, and it has produced two antithetical global outlooks: one continental and the other maritime.\nIn the continental world, the currency of power is land. Most countries, by geography, inhabit a continental world with multiple neighbors. Such neighbors have, historically, been each other’s primary adversaries. Those with enough power to conquer others—continental hegemons such as China and Russia—believe the international system should be divided among them into huge spheres of influence. They funnel resources into their militaries to protect boundaries, conquer and intimidate neighbors in wealth-destroying wars, and entrench authoritarian rule at home to prioritize military over civilian needs. The result is a vicious cycle. To justify their repression and retain the throne, despots require a big enemy and manufacture security threats that lead to more wars.\nBy contrast, states with an oceanic moat have relative security from invasion. They can thus focus on compounding wealth rather than on fighting neighbors. These maritime states see money, not territory, as the source of power. They advance domestic prosperity through international commerce and through industry, minimizing the tradeoff between military and civilian needs. While continental hegemons gravitate toward finite-game, winner-take-all strategies that are ruinous to the defeated, those vested in the maritime order prefer the infinite game of wealth-compounding, mutually beneficial transactions. They view neighbors as trade partners, not enemies.\nThe maritime worldview goes back to the ancient Athenians, whose rimland empire depended on accruing wealth from coastal trade. Such states wish to treat the oceans as commons, so all can share them and safely trade. It is not a coincidence that Hugo Grotius, the founding father of international law, came from the Dutch Republic, a trading empire. And since World War II, commercially minded countries have developed regional and global institutions to facilitate trade, minimize transaction costs, and compound wealth. They have coordinated their coast guards and navies to eliminate piracy so that trade gets through. This has produced an evolving maritime, rules-based order with dozens of members that together enforce the regulations that protect them all.\nToday’s competition is just the latest iteration of the continental-maritime conflict. Since World War II, the United States’ strategy has reflected its position as a maritime power. Because of its economic structure, the country has an interest in maintaining trade and commerce. And thanks to its geography and strength, it can hinder countries from undermining the sovereignty of other states. China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, meanwhile, want to undermine the rules-based order because their leaders consider more liberal societies an existential threat to their rule and national security visions.\nThe United States can prevail in the second cold war, just as in the first, by hewing to the successful strategies of maritime power. But if it reverts to a continental paradigm—by erecting barriers, threatening neighbors, and undermining global institutions—it is likely to fail. It may then be unable to recover.\nTHE TRICKS OF TRADE\nThe United Kingdom developed the modern maritime playbook for countering continental powers during the Napoleonic Wars. London became the world’s dominant power not by deploying its army to obliterate rivals but by growing rich from trade and industry while other European countries ruined each other militarily. All continental states had to maintain large armies either to conquer or to avoid being conquered. Often, they organized their economies around the needs of their army, not their merchants. But the United Kingdom, protected on every side by water and by its dominant navy, was less afraid of an invasion. It therefore did not need a large, expensive, potentially coup-generating ground force. It focused on compounding its wealth through commerce, relying on its navy to defend shipping lanes.\nAlone of all the great powers, the United Kingdom belonged to every successive coalition fighting France. After the Royal Navy defeated Napoleon at Trafalgar, he turned to an economic strategy. He imposed a continent-wide blockade on British commerce, known as the Continental System—a strategy that Napoleon described as la France avant tout (France first). But this blockade hurt the economies of France and its allies far more than it did the United Kingdom, which had maritime access to alternative markets across the planet. The blockade led Napoleon to launch his ruinous invasion of Russia, which continued trading with the British.\nIn the continental world, the currency of power is land.\nRather than fighting Napoleon’s large military directly, the United Kingdom used its growing wealth to fund and arm Austria, Prussia, Russia, and numerous smaller states, which together pinned down the bulk of Napoleon’s forces on the main front in central or eastern Europe. The British then opened a peripheral theater on the Iberian Peninsula, what Napoleon called his “Spanish ulcer,” which had better sea than land access, so that attrition rates favored them. The cumulative casualties from this and the main front ultimately overextended Napoleon, dooming his military when his adversaries simultaneously ganged up. Virtually every European country suffered extensive war damage, but the British economy emerged unscathed. The same was true for the United States in both world wars.\nAfter the Napoleonic Wars, the Industrial Revolution introduced compounded economic growth. This tilted the playing field even more in favor of maritime powers. Suddenly, it was far easier to accrue power from industry, commerce, and trade than from wealth-destroying wars. Doing so depended on the external lines of communication provided by the seas rather than the internal lines that continental powers, such as Napoleonic France, leveraged to defend and expand their empires. As a result, today, the world order is maritime in nature—even though few perceive it that way. Around half the world’s population lives by the sea, coastal areas create roughly two-thirds of global wealth, 90 percent of traded goods (measured by weight) arrive at their final destination via oceans, and submarine cables account for 99 percent of international communications traffic. International bodies and treaties regulate trade. The seas connect everyone with everything. No one state can keep them open, but a coalition of coastal states can make them safe for transit.\nThis system has broadly benefited the world’s people. Trading rules have minimized bottlenecks, reducing costs. Safe, open seas facilitate economic growth, raising living standards. People can travel, work, and invest abroad. Billionaires are the greatest beneficiaries of the maritime order because they have the most to lose to confiscation when the rules disappear, and because their economic interests are global. Countries vested in the maritime order are far richer than those that seek to undermine it. Even those intending to overturn this system have benefited from it. China, for instance, became rich only after it joined the maritime order when the Cold War ended. The Iranian and Russian economies are a fraction of what they could be if they followed international law and built institutions to protect their citizens instead of their dictators.\nCONQUER AND COLLAPSE\nIn the continental world, power is a function of territory. Neighbors are dangerous. Since strong ones may invade, continental hegemons work to destabilize nearby countries. In modern times, they do so by deluging them with fake news to fuel internal resentments and regional disagreements. Weak neighbors also pose a threat, as terrorism and chaos can bleed over shared borders. To protect themselves and increase their power, continental states often invade and ingest their neighbors, eliminating potential threats by wiping them off the map.\nIn their drive to increase in size and power, successful continental hegemons follow two rules: avoid two-front wars and neutralize great-power neighbors. But the continental theory of security provides no counsel for when to stop expanding and yields no permanent alliances. Neighbors understand that the hegemon promises long-term trouble. As a result, continentalists often find themselves overextended, alone, and, eventually, at risk of collapse. Both wars for territory and the destabilization of neighbors swiftly destroy wealth.\nGermany, for example, could have dominated the European continent economically during the twentieth century, given its more rapid economic growth rate relative to its neighbors. Instead, it fought two expansionist world wars. In both, it violated the rules for continental empire by fighting on multiple fronts against multiple great powers. The wars, far from cementing Germany’s dominance, delayed its rise by generations at a massive cost in both lives and wealth across Europe.\nLikewise, Japan prospered under a maritime trading order. Then, in the 1930s, it adopted a continental paradigm and seized a large empire on the Asian mainland. As with Germany, its quest initially yielded territory but produced multiple enemies and military and economic overextension that destroyed both Japan and those it invaded. Postwar Japan then returned to a maritime paradigm of working through international organizations and under international law. This produced the Japanese economic miracle, in which a ruined country quickly became one of the world’s richest. (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan had Cold War economic miracles thanks to the maritime system, as well.)\nOverextension was also central to the fall of the Soviet Union. That empire not only ingested Eastern Europe at the end of World War II; it imposed an economic model conducive to dictatorial rule but not to economic growth. It then expanded this program to as much of the developing world as possible. Ultimately, the lethargic Soviet economy could not sustain Moscow’s imperial adventures and impracticable projects.\nIn World War I, every European power, including the United Kingdom, pursued continental strategies that required using massive armies to establish diverse empires with overlapping territory. Each state had different primary adversaries and primary theaters, even within each alliance system. This produced a series of uncoordinated, parallel wars. The European powers, including the United Kingdom, also struggled because they allowed army officers to oversee the war effort with inadequate input from civilian leaders who had insights into the economic underpinnings of power. Army officers doubled down on stalemated offensives for months, wasting hundreds of thousands of young lives rather than owning up to the profligacy of their strategy.\nArguably, no European country fully recovered from its World War I losses. The war destroyed the continental empires that had insisted on fighting it—Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Russia. Despite their victory, France and the United Kingdom were worse off afterward. The United States emerged disgusted by European entanglements, paving the way for the original America Firsters, who enacted tariffs that deepened the Great Depression and set the stage for a world war rerun. By contrast, during the long peace between the Napoleonic Wars and World War I, Europe’s affluence compounded. Likewise, when the United States followed the maritime paradigm to win World War II, unprecedented prosperity ensued. Unlike after World War I, Washington did not recede into isolationism. Instead, it assumed the mantle of leadership by helping partners rebuild and acting as the guarantor of an international system it created in cooperation with its postwar allies to preserve peace. These institutions succeeded in Europe until Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.\nTHE DOGS OF WAR\nMost countries are geographically continental. They lack an oceanic moat completely insulating them from threats. Only the maritime rules-based order offers such states full protection. Institutions and alliance systems integrate the diverse capabilities of the many to contain the threats from the few. They are the insurance program for the rules-based order. They cannot eliminate dangers altogether, but if members coordinate to maximize their economic growth and constrain the continentalists, they can minimize risks.\nBut the world still has many committed continentalists. Putin has made it clear he intends to expand Russia’s borders. His initial objective is control over Ukraine, the hors d’oeuvre before the main course. “There’s an old rule that wherever a Russian soldier sets foot, that’s ours,” Putin said, laying out his menu. It features, at a minimum, central and eastern Europe, which Soviet troops occupied after World War II. His statement may also portend visions of power over Paris, which Russian troops reached at the end of the Napoleonic Wars.\nAs during the first Cold War, Moscow wants to break apart the West both from without and from within. Ever since the Bolshevik Revolution, Russians have excelled at propaganda. They used it to successfully market communism around the world, costing many countries decades of growth. Now, Russia is using propaganda to spread the fiction that NATO threatens Russia rather than the reverse. (NATO countries do not covet Moscow’s territory; they want Russia to deal with its domestic dystopian mess and become a constructive member of the international system.)\nTrading rules have minimized bottlenecks, reducing costs.\nSocial media has radically increased Russia’s ability to sow discord abroad, which it does by stoking hatred on both sides of divisive issues. Moscow has sought to transform the war in Ukraine into a wedge issue that divides the United States from Europe and different European states from each other, weakening both NATO and the EU. It helped promote Brexit, which has eroded the United Kingdom’s ties with the continent. It helped create massive migrant flows by supporting the dictator Bashar al-Assad’s forces during the Syrian civil war and now by destabilizing Africa, sending refugees pouring into Europe. These inflows have been profoundly destabilizing, facilitating the rise of the continent’s isolationist right.\nOther continental powers also wish to overturn the present global order. North Korea wants control of the entire Korean Peninsula, eliminating South Korea. Iran’s primary theater is the Middle East, where Tehran seeks to extend its influence over Gaza, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria.\nThen there is China. The country’s decision to integrate into the current world order in pursuit of wealth suggested that, despite its authoritarian government, it might be adopting a maritime outlook. It even built a large navy. But Beijing cannot reliably deploy that navy in wartime because of the narrow, shallow, island-cluttered, enclosed seas that surround its coasts. This makes it much like Germany, which built large navies it could not reliably use in either world war. The United Kingdom blockaded the narrow North Sea and Baltic Sea, eliminating Germany’s merchant traffic and reducing its naval traffic mainly to submarines. In World War II, Berlin required the long French and Norwegian coastlines for more reliable egress for its submarines, but that was still insufficient for its navy, let alone its merchant marine. China is even more reliant on trade and imports than Germany was then, particularly energy and food. The economic bottlenecks from a shutdown of its oceanic trade would debilitate its economy.\nAs Ukraine has demonstrated with its sinking of Russian ships, drones can close narrow seas. China has 13 landward neighbors and seven seaward neighbors, and no shortage of disagreements with them. With submarines, shore artillery, drones, and planes, these neighbors can shut down China’s merchant traffic and make its naval passage perilous. Many of its close coastal neighbors, by contrast, do not need to traverse the South China Sea to reach the open ocean—Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand, as well as Taiwan, all have alternative coastlines on the open seas, making them difficult to blockade.\nLike Russia, China retains a continental outlook. In addition to territorial claims on Japan and the Philippines, and its threat to use force to take all of Taiwan, Beijing seeks territory from Bhutan, India, and Nepal. When Chinese citizens list their historic lands, they either name the Mongol Yuan dynasty, which extended all the way to Hungary, or the Manchu Qing empire, which encompassed the lands the Belt and Road Initiative is now peeling away from the Russian sphere of influence. The Chinese still have two names for themselves, either “the central kingdom” or the even more grandiose “all under Heaven”—a complete world order unto itself and all the lands it conquers.\nBeijing, unlike Moscow, has not yet launched outright wars of aggression. But China is waging financial war with its predatory Belt and Road Initiative loans, which leave recipients massively indebted. It is conducting cyberwarfare, hacking into other countries’ critical infrastructure and stealing their secrets. It engages in resource warfare by limiting rare-earth mineral exports, ecological warfare by damming Southeast Asia’s Mekong River and South Asia’s Yarlung Tsangpo River, and drug warfare by flooding the United States with fentanyl. It has even dabbled in irregular warfare, with incursions into Indian territory that killed Indian soldiers. This is a continental recipe for overextension.\nAVERTING CATASTROPHE\nTo confront the continentalists, the United States and its allies do not need to reinvent the wheel. The strategy that won the previous Cold War remains equally serviceable today. It begins with a recognition that this struggle—like the last—will be protracted. Rather than attempting a rapid resolution, which could have triggered nuclear war, the victors in the first Cold War managed the conflict for several generations. The same advice applies today: the maritime powers must be patient and keep the current conflict cold. They should particularly avoid hot wars in theaters lacking adequate maritime access, in states surrounded by hostile countries likely to intervene, and in states where the local population is broadly unwilling to provide assistance. These characteristics applied to Afghanistan and Iraq, and help explain Washington’s unsuccessful conflicts there.\nInstead of fighting hot wars, the United States and its partners should leverage the great strength of the maritime world against the great weakness of the continentalists: their different capacities to generate wealth. They should exclude continentalists from the benefits of the maritime order by sanctioning them until they cease violating international law, put aside warfare, and embrace diplomacy. Unlike tariffs, which are taxes on imports to protect domestic producers, sanctions make targeted transactions illegal to penalize malign actors. Even porous sanctions, which shave growth rates by a percentage point or two, can produce devastating, long-term compounding effects—as a comparison of sanctioned North Korea and unsanctioned South Korea illustrates. Sanctions are a form of economic chemotherapy. They may not eliminate the tumor, but they will, at a minimum, slow its progress. They can be particularly effective at setting back technological development, as the Soviets experienced.\nWashington and its partners should accommodate states that are not revisionists. The victors in the last Cold War understood that alliances are additive. Partners bring new capabilities that can help overwhelm enemies. Institutions then mobilize expertise to provide services and prevent problems that can help member states combat the continentalists. The United States should thus strengthen and expand its network. It should focus on maintaining not just its own prosperity but also that of its partners, so they can gang up on the bullies. Alliance systems should also aid those beset by the continentalists, whose resistance weakens their enemies. Just as the West armed Moscow’s enemies until the Soviet Union withdrew from its war against Afghanistan, the West must now aid Ukraine for as long as it takes. The longer the Ukraine conflict continues, the weaker Moscow will become, opening itself up to possible Chinese predation.\nShould Russia’s current regime fall, the resulting succession struggle will force it to reduce its foreign commitments—as occurred with the Soviet Union during the Korean War, when Joseph Stalin’s death led to that conflict’s rapid conclusion. Should any of the continentalists cease coveting other countries’ territory and instead peacefully contribute to improving international laws and institutions, then the United States and its partners should welcome them into the rules-based order. But if these countries do not change, containment is the answer. Washington prevailed in its earlier showdown with Moscow not with a dramatic military victory but by prospering while the Soviet Union endured an economic decline of its own making. In the 1980s, while Soviets waited in line for basic goods, Americans took family vacations. The present U.S. objective should be to keep other democracies and partners prospering while weakening the continentalists. The latter powers may not go away any time soon, but if they cannot match the economic growth rates of those upholding the maritime order, the relative threat will shrink.\nOWN GOALS\nThe stakes of the clash between the continental order and the maritime, rules-based order have never been so high. There are many nuclear powers, and the United States is increasingly unwilling to act as the ultimate guarantor of the present global system by supporting allies and extending its nuclear umbrella. If the conflicts in Ukraine, across Africa, and between Israel and Iran expand and merge, a catastrophic third world war might ensue. Unlike in the previous ones, everyone would be vulnerable to nuclear strikes and their toxic fallout.\nThe United States has already taken major steps to defeat its continental adversaries. It has imposed strict sanctions and export controls. It has funded and armed the countries facing down shared antagonists. But critics of the rules-based order are gathering strength. They see the system’s many imperfections but not its even more important benefits—including the catastrophes the rules avert. The rules-based order benefits individuals, businesses, and governments not only by facilitating trade flows but also by deterring malign behavior. Unfortunately, people rarely appreciate a disaster averted.\nToday, even top U.S. officials are critical of the present order. Over the last year, Washington has gravitated toward a continental approach. The United States will always have its natural moats—the Atlantic and the Pacific—to protect the mainland. But it also shares long borders with Canada and Mexico, and Washington is picking fights with both. It has berated numerous friendly democracies, levied tariffs on trading partners, and paralyzed international institutions that facilitate global economic growth by setting and enforcing the rules of the road. Musings from Washington about absorbing Canada, seizing Greenland from Denmark, and retaking the Panama Canal will, at a minimum, permanently alter Canadian and European shopping choices and vacation plans. At worst, they will rupture Western alliances.\nOverextension was central to the fall of the Soviet Union.\nBad strategy could transform the United States from the essential power to the irrelevant power, as former partners form new alliances that exclude Washington. Such a shift would take time, but if it happens, the changes will be enduring. Europeans will grow stronger together, leaving the United States weaker and alone. In the worst-case scenario, Washington could become a shared primary adversary for China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, with no allies left to help it. But even short of that, it may have to compete with Beijing on its own. If so, it may struggle to prevail. China has nearly three times as many people as does the United States and a much larger manufacturing base. It has nuclear weapons that can reach the American homeland, and might not have moral qualms about using them. The United States could also become less queasy about deploying its arsenal. If a state is about to lose a great-power conflict, after all, it may be incentivized to go nuclear, transforming a bilateral catastrophe into a global one.\nFor Washington, a scenario that leaves it alone and defeated would be a tragic conclusion to the last 80 years. At the end of World War II, it had earned friends across the globe. But that moral capital, gained at great cost, is being squandered. Like Napoleon’s France avant tout, the recent reversion to America First is antagonizing allies everywhere. Undoubtedly, Washington’s enemies would relish seeing the United States brought low.\nToo many Americans have taken the benefits of the maritime order for granted and harped on its imperfections, frittering away their many geographic and historical advantages in the process. Like the oxygen around them, they will miss the global order should it disappear. As the Athenian leader Pericles lamented long ago on the eve of a succession of Athenian mistakes that permanently ended that city’s preeminence, “I am more afraid of our own blunders than of the enemy’s devices.”\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "China Is Winning the Cyberwar", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/china-winning-cyberwar-artificial-intelligence", "text": "American companies are world leaders in technology—be it innovative software, cloud services, artificial intelligence, or cybersecurity products. Yet beginning as many as three years ago, hackers believed to be backed by the Chinese government did something the United States, the tech powerhouse, could not adequately defend against: they gained and maintained access to major U.S. telecommunications networks, copying conversations and building the ability to track the movements of U.S. intelligence officers and law enforcement agents across the country. The attack, dubbed “Salt Typhoon,” constituted a large part of a global campaign against telecoms, and it penetrated systems at many U.S. carriers so thoroughly that officials will almost certainly never know the full scope of the capabilities China achieved to spy on Americans’ communications.\nSalt Typhoon was more than a one-off intelligence success for China. It reflected a deeper, troubling reality. Mere decades after the widespread adoption of the Internet opened a new realm of geopolitical contestation, China is positioning itself to dominate the digital battle space. The United States has fallen behind, failing to secure a vast digital home front—and the physical assets that depend on it. Because cyberspace has no borders, the U.S. homeland is always in the fight. Every hospital, power grid, pipeline, water treatment plant, and telecommunications system is on the frontlines, and most of the United States’ critical infrastructure is unready for battle.\nChina’s cyber dominance extends well beyond telecommunications espionage. Chinese malware has been discovered embedded in U.S. energy, water, pipeline, and transportation systems. These intrusions show little evidence of traditional intelligence gathering. Instead, they appear to be designed for sabotage, preparing China to disrupt both Americans’ daily lives and U.S. military operations. During a future crisis, China could use these pre-positioned capacities to delay military mobilizations, impede air traffic control systems, or cause cascading power outages. Even barring an outright attack, their existence could deter the United States by raising the specter of disruption at home.\nThe Salt Typhoon attack was able to secure such wide-ranging access in part because of the fundamental asymmetry between the authoritarian approach Beijing takes to its cyberdefense and Washington’s more democratic perspective. American values forbid the kind of comprehensive monitoring that undergirds China’s cyberdefense and frees Beijing to pursue offensive operations with less fear of retaliation. And myriad private actors manage the United States’ critical infrastructure, with minimal government oversight or hands-on assistance. Their levels of investment in cybersecurity are variable, driven by commercial bottom lines. That means that when cyberattackers are found, it is hard to prove that they have been removed from networks or systems. Even when their removal appears certain, it is likely they will return.\nChinese operations now pose the largest challenge to the United States’ cyberdefense, but it isn’t the only one. Vulnerabilities in U.S. infrastructure networks have made them attractive targets to other adversarial countries as well as to criminals. In the past several years, Russia and Iran have disrupted the operations of U.S. water systems in multiple states, and hackers mostly based in Russia have played havoc with the workings of hundreds of American hospitals. Washington can—and must—do much more to protect the United States’ critical infrastructure and deter Chinese attacks. The artificial intelligence revolution will only exacerbate the United States’ disadvantages unless policymakers urgently develop a new approach.\nWashington must establish a new cyber-deterrence policy built on the principle that robust cyberdefense enables credible cyberoffense. Artificial intelligence offers the key to making this new deterrence policy feasible. The United States should leverage its AI expertise by mounting a national effort to use AI to model its sprawling network of critical infrastructure, identify the most important vulnerabilities, and fix them. Washington must also ensure that it has the offensive cyber-capabilities to deter China. And it must make its messaging about cyberattacks more coherent, clarifying that pre-positioning in specific kinds of infrastructure constitutes a redline and carefully signaling its capacity to retaliate.\nBy developing AI-powered defenses and investing more tactically in offensive capabilities, the United States can transform an inadequate cyber strategy into proactive deterrence. The U.S. government must convey the message to China that it remains committed to defending American lives. It can do so only by finding and securing the most sensitive vulnerabilities in the digital infrastructure on which Americans rely.\nSECRET WEAPON\nSalt Typhoon was a sophisticated, multistage operation. To gain administrator access to telecommunications networks, the attackers exploited flaws in U.S. telecom companies’ cybersecurity products—such as firewalls—and used passwords stolen in unrelated hacks. Once inside, the hackers installed malware and hijacked legitimate processes and programs to maintain control. The attackers then used computers, servers, routers, and other devices they had compromised to move across different companies’ networks and find the most rewarding spying positions.\nThe roots of China’s cyber advantages lie in structural differences between authoritarian and democratic forms of governance. When cyberattacks emerged with the advent of the Internet, both China and the United States faced similar vulnerabilities. But China has systematically built up its cyberdefenses while the United States has struggled to balance securing its cyberspace with its attention to civil liberties.\nThe Internet’s explosive growth in the 1990s worried Beijing. The Chinese government feared the Internet’s potential to enable free expression and, as is natural for an authoritarian regime, opted to restrict it. Beginning in the late 1990s, Beijing deployed an array of technologies and laws to censor online speech and block websites and applications developed in the West.\nBeijing has invested heavily in offensive cyber-capabilities.\nOutside observers still often describe this so-called Great Firewall as a domestic censorship project. But having accomplished that task, the Chinese government discovered that its creation had another powerful function. As well as screening for subversive speech, the Great Firewall’s technologies can identify malicious code before it reaches critical systems, providing Beijing with tools to defend against cyberattacks. As a consequence, Chinese water treatment plants, power grids, telecommunications networks, and other critical systems operate with layers of protection that most U.S. systems lack. If foreign hackers attempt to penetrate Chinese infrastructure, they may encounter not only their target’s specific defenses but the Chinese government’s integrated monitoring capabilities.\nThe United States, meanwhile, faced the opposite dynamic. Unlike in China, where critical infrastructure operates under direct state control, American systems are owned by thousands of private companies with varying cybersecurity capabilities and threat awareness. A small-town water treatment plant in Ohio, for example, operates with the cyber-protections it can afford—which often means vulnerable software, default passwords, and outdated systems that are easily hacked.\nAnd the U.S. government is legally prohibited from monitoring many of these companies’ networks for threats without their explicit consent, to avoid transgressing the constitutional ban on governmental “search and seizure” of private communications. So the United States came to rely on a patchwork approach to digitally securing its most crucial infrastructure: companies that own and operate America’s most sensitive systems, such as power grids, are responsible for securing them with limited government oversight.\nLITTLE GREEN BOTS\nThis gap in defense enabled China to develop offensive capabilities with less fear of retaliation. Beijing invested heavily in offensive cyber-capabilities, establishing programs that now rival Washington’s in both sophistication and scale. China has integrated these capabilities into its broader military doctrine of “active defense,” or the principle that the best defense involves striking first to prevent enemy action.\nChina and the United States first engaged diplomatically on cyber-espionage in 2015, when U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping brokered an agreement proscribing the theft of intellectual property by hackers for commercial gain, but China soon breached the agreement. The first Trump administration, which took over in 2017, favored taking enforcement actions over engaging diplomatically: for instance, in March 2018, it released indictments and sanctions against hackers linked to Beijing who had stolen proprietary data from U.S. companies and government agencies.\nAfter President Joe Biden took office in 2021, his administration initiated regular high-level diplomatic engagement with China to manage the strategic competition between the two great powers, including in cyberspace. For instance, Biden extracted a promise from Xi that China would not interfere in the 2024 U.S. elections. But the Biden administration also realized that China’s offensive cyber-campaigns were intensifying.\nIn 2023, for example, Chinese state-sponsored hackers exploited a flaw in Microsoft’s cloud services to breach high-level officials’ email accounts. The Biden administration regularly declassified intelligence and gave escalating public warnings that China’s cyber-activities were expanding from espionage to potential sabotage: in January 2024, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified to a House committee that hackers linked to the Chinese government were targeting critical U.S. infrastructure and preparing to cause “real-world harm” to Americans.\nDefense alone cannot fully address China’s advantages.\nChina’s cyber-operations have become a clear threat to U.S. national security. Consider the scope of China’s pre-positioning. Intrusions have been discovered in water infrastructure, power grids, and other critical systems across the American mainland. These attacks follow a consistent pattern: the intruders gain administrative access to supervisory control systems, establish the capacity to maintain that access over time, and then remain dormant while keeping the ability to activate malicious code on command.\nThe targets reveal strategic thinking. Water treatment plants serve essential civilian needs while also supporting military installations. Power grids enable everything from hospital operations to ammunition production. Telecommunications networks support both civilian communications and military command systems. By pre-positioning cyberattack tools in these dual-use systems, China is readying itself to impose significant civilian costs while degrading the U.S. military’s effectiveness.\nDuring a crisis over Taiwan, for instance, these capabilities could prove decisive. Imagine the dilemma facing American leaders if China could credibly threaten to delay military mobilization by disrupting U.S. rail networks or to trigger power failures across the Eastern Seaboard. Beijing need not actually execute such attacks. The mere possibility could alter U.S. decision-making by raising the domestic political costs of an overseas intervention.\nChina’s pre-positioning also serves tactical military objectives. U.S. military bases depend on surrounding civilian infrastructure for power, water, and communications. By threatening these systems, China could impede U.S. military mobilization without directly attacking military targets—avoiding the clear escalation that bombing American bases would represent. Similarly, disrupting seaports and airports could delay reinforcement deployments to the Pacific while appearing to target civilian infrastructure with nonlethal tactics.\nChinese military theorists explicitly embrace this logic, describing offensive cyber-operations as a form of “strategic deterrence.” More than most conventional forms of deterrence, cyber-operations offer plausible deniability. China can threaten civilian infrastructure while maintaining that any disruptions might result from the targeted country’s own system failures rather than a deliberate attack. Indeed, the Chinese government has consistently denied that it was behind Salt Typhoon or the malware discovered in U.S. infrastructure.\nDOUBLE VISION\nThat deniability has made traditional diplomacy a weak tool to manage cyberwarfare. The United States cannot rely on direct negotiations. It must turn urgently to bolstering its defenses. The Biden administration used emergency authorities to impose new minimum cybersecurity requirements on pipelines, rail systems, airports, and water utilities, overcoming decades of bipartisan resistance to mandating private-sector security standards. These requirements did drive improvements in basic protections. And they allowed government regulators such as the Transportation Security Administration, which regulates pipelines, to periodically inspect infrastructure owners’ cyberdefenses and offer guidance.\nAlthough this represented an important step, even these enhanced requirements cannot match Beijing’s direct monitoring of equivalent networks in China. Biden mandated that U.S. pipelines, water systems, rail networks, and health-care industry firms report cyber-incidents to the government, but only after they occur; Chinese authorities can monitor their systems in real time to prevent incidents from occurring in the first place. New cybersecurity mandates on U.S. water utilities, meanwhile, were paused after several states challenged their legality, leaving this sector exposed.\nCyber-operations do resemble conventional warfare—airstrikes, naval battles, or ground combat—in that they involve both offense and defense. The United States deters conventional threats through superior military power, but it completely lacks that dominance in cyberspace, where defense and offense are inextricably linked. Currently, U.S. presidents face an impossible problem: they cannot make persuasive deterrent threats because they lack enough confidence that U.S. defenses could withstand a potentially escalatory tit-for-tat battle in cyberspace. The United States needs a policy that acknowledges the reality of cyberconflict while aggressively leveraging American technological advantages to restore strategic balance.\nTraditional diplomacy is a weak tool to manage cyberwarfare.\nFirst and foremost, Washington must understand the vulnerabilities in its cyberdefenses. In conventional warfare, force-on-force comparisons guide strategy: for instance, the U.S. military runs regular tests and simulations to see whether its defenses can protect against Russia’s missile-launch capacities. But the government cannot assess how the United States’ critical infrastructure could withstand Chinese cyberattacks because it cannot even see what defenses secure its thousands of privately owned systems.\nArtificial intelligence, with its rapidly growing abilities to synthesize a vast amount of data, offers a new opportunity to take on this sprawling problem. Indeed, it can be the key to a new U.S. cyber-deterrence policy—specifically, so-called AI-generated digital twins. A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical object (such as a wind turbine) or a system (such as a power grid) that uses real-time data and sensors to mirror its real-world counterpart’s behavior and performance. These dynamic digital models allow organizations to monitor, analyze, and optimize their physical assets remotely.\nRecent advances in AI have turbocharged digital twins’ usefulness by dramatically improving their ability to model ever-larger and more complex entities. Industry is rapidly adopting digital twins to advance product safety—Rolls-Royce, for instance, now operates digital twins of its jet engines to monitor safety and performance. Ford and BMW have created digital twins of manufacturing processes to improve efficiency. And governments are exploring their potential: Singapore, for instance, has created a digital twin as well as test beds for its water and power plants. NATO has used these systems in its annual, large-scale cyberdefense exercise, during which security teams simulated attacking and defending Singaporean infrastructure.\nIn the United States, a national effort to create digital twins for several hundred of the most sensitive critical infrastructure systems—done with private-sector owners’ cooperation and consent—would allow these systems’ security teams to safely test dangerous attack scenarios without risking the actual provision of core services. The teams could simulate cyberattacks against various system components within the digital twin to understand which vulnerabilities, if exploited, would cause major disruptions. This information would allow companies to focus their limited resources on fixing the vulnerabilities that pose the greatest threat rather than attempting to address every security flaw equally.\nDigital twins could also establish baseline behavioral patterns that help detect anomalies that could indicate cyberattacks. When a water system’s digital twin, for instance, suddenly shows unusual valve operations or pressure fluctuations, its security team could quickly identify potential intrusions before they cause physical damage. The potential impact goes beyond individual companies. Virtual replicas of regional power grids could be used to simulate cascading failure scenarios, identifying nodes whose protection would prevent widespread outages. Digital twins of urban water systems could model contamination attacks, suggesting potential technical countermeasures and emergency response procedures. And over time, digital twins would enable the kind of force-on-force comparisons that the national security community routinely conducts in conventional domains. A digital twin of the Hoover Dam’s control systems, for example, could simulate attack scenarios, helping its operators develop more precise and sophisticated defenses, as well as ways to recover more quickly if an attack does occur.\nA national effort to create digital twins of critical national infrastructure could be piloted quickly for the U.S. energy grid by the Department of Energy. The department already possesses models of the grid and could draw on classified insights regarding China’s cyberwarfare capabilities, as well as the AI expertise at institutions such as the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Sandia and its close partnerships with U.S. energy firms. The lessons learned while establishing that pilot could then be used to build digital twins for other critical sectors.\nCreating comprehensive digital twins will involve substantial technical challenges. It requires a detailed knowledge of infrastructure systems and network data that owners may consider proprietary. It will take time for government AI and intelligence experts to forge new kinds of partnerships with private owners and operators. But the United States needs a bridge between its physical and digital worlds. It cannot and should not simply mimic China’s cyber-barriers, which rely on an intrusive surveillance state. Digital twins, however, would give U.S. national security officials a continuous picture of American cyberdefenses and provide decision-makers with real-time assessments of the country’s readiness to foil cyberattacks. A future president contemplating a response to Chinese aggression could access complex modeling of how U.S. infrastructure would perform under sustained attack nearly immediately—the kind of tactical intelligence that is sorely lacking today.\nSEND A DM\nEven AI-enhanced defenses cannot entirely overcome the cyberdefense gap that gives China its structural advantage. Current U.S. law gives infrastructure operators full authority to monitor their networks, and federal legislation adopted in 2015 ensures that these operators are able to share information with their peers and with the federal government to facilitate collaborative defense. Still lacking in some key sectors, however, is any requirement that owners and operators actually monitor their networks. In sectors that have these requirements, regulators need to conduct more consistent oversight to ensure that operators are maintaining their cyberdefenses and collaborating with peers and the federal government.\nAnd defense alone, however sophisticated, cannot fully address China’s advantages. True deterrence requires the capacity to continuously undermine an adversary’s capabilities and prepare to impose unacceptable costs. The United States must ensure that it builds and maintains offensive cyber-capabilities that can hold at risk targets that Beijing values—and clearly communicate that it can and will strike if China crosses American redlines. Instead of attempting tit-for-tat intrusions into Chinese civilian infrastructure, the United States could focus on targeting military assets that China depends on during crises, which would conform with international law and may have a greater effect on the Chinese government’s strategy.\nFinally, the United States must strengthen its messaging. It must clarify that targeting specific critical civilian infrastructure whose disruption would cause major societal impact, even with pre-positioning attacks, is unacceptable. This would build on the Biden administration’s message to China that cyberattacks with physical impacts would be treated as an act of war. The United States should communicate three core principles: We will attribute attacks to their perpetrators. We are resilient. We will retaliate. Specificity matters for credibility—vague threats invite probing and miscalculation.\nWashington must communicate that it will strike if China crosses U.S. redlines.\nThe message must be credible and persistent, including enough detail to prove that the United States’ offensive capabilities are real but not enough to let an adversary fix its vulnerabilities. Russia’s decision to use cyberattacks to induce blackouts in Ukraine years before its 2022 full invasion illustrates the danger in signaling cyber-capabilities too explicitly: the demonstration convinced Ukraine to significantly improve its power grid defenses.\nThere are reasons the United States has lagged in bolstering its cyberdefenses—political obstacles as well as technological ones. Congress has shown little appetite for extending the legal authority and sustained investment that comprehensive cyberdefense requires. Private companies resist mandated security requirements that increase costs.\nYet a wait-and-see approach has become unacceptable. If Washington does not move fast, artificial intelligence will only accelerate China’s advantages. The United States possesses the technical capabilities, economic resources, and innovative capacity to reclaim the advantage in the digital battle space. What the United States needs now is the vision and political will to take comprehensive action. Countries all around the world are watching. If the United States succeeds, it can serve as an example of how to achieve the benefits of digitization and a free Internet without compromising its national security. If it fails, the world will also take away a lesson: that democracies are less capable of defending against cyberthreats. And China’s strategy of “active deterrence” will only gain more global power.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "Why Xi Still Doesn’t Have the Military He Wants", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/why-xi-still-doesnt-have-military-he-wants", "text": "For the high command of the People’s Liberation Army, Xi Jinping’s third term as China’s president has been a period of almost operatic tumult. Altogether, at least 21 senior officers have been removed since Xi started his third term in 2022, including three of the seven members of the Central Military Commission, the supreme military body of the Chinese Communist Party. Many of the members of the PLA’s most senior ranks, including the defense minister and the officer who oversaw just about every general officer promotion for over a decade, have been disgraced. By the end of his tenure, Xi could well exceed the mercurial Mao Zedong in his body count of officers who have been purged.\nAlthough Xi oversaw military purges earlier in his career and even imposed a sweeping overhaul of the PLA’s command structure in 2015, this recent shakeup has raised eyebrows since many of the affected men were Xi’s putative allies rather than potential political rivals. The ousting of senior officers who were once considered untouchable has fed a flurry of rumors that Xi is losing his grip over the PLA—and even prompted more extreme claims that Xi’s own political demise might be imminent.\nBut rather than Xi’s diminution, the recent moves more likely reflect Xi’s continued dominance of the military. Much like a Mafia don, Xi has shown that he considers even his associates to be disposable. More important, the staggering political casualties reflect that he is losing patience with his military rather than his control over it. The moves demonstrate his continued dissatisfaction with the PLA’s high command and can be seen as part of an ongoing process of achieving his larger goals of bending the military to his will. Indeed, Xi wants to ensure he can employ violence with confidence, but Xi’s confidence seems to be the rarest and most precious commodity for an otherwise well-resourced military.\nXi sees his military agenda as a centerpiece of his legacy. Whereas Xi’s predecessors focused their political firepower primarily on advancing major economic reforms, some of the most dramatic reforms of the Xi era have occurred in the military. Two goals have driven his unforgiving management of the PLA. His paramount aim is ensuring the military is thoroughly politicized and thus willing to fulfill its role as the ultimate guarantor of the party’s rule should it be challenged by internal unrest. And Xi also wants a military that can fight if he needs it to do so, including against the U.S. military.\nIn other words, Xi’s iron grip on the military not only endures, it is also indicative of his obsession with breaking the PLA’s insularity and endemic corruption and ensuring that, should he need to bet the regime on the military’s prowess, it will not fail.\nFRIENDLY FIRE\nThe recent purges of He Weidong, the vice chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), and Admiral Miao Hua, the director of the Political Work Department, have garnered the most attention in the rumor mill. The two men overlapped with Xi in Fujian Province earlier in their careers and were believed to enjoy a special relationship as a result. But He is now missing (he hasn’t been seen in public since March), and Miao was removed from his post in November 2024.\nAnalysts have gravitated to two hypotheses. The more mundane is that these purges reflect embarrassingly poor judgment by Xi in his choice of subordinates. The more extravagant is that they reflect a burgeoning movement among disaffected party and military leaders who now seek to challenge or even remove Xi.\nNeither of these hypotheses stands up to scrutiny, however. Both share the unlikely premise that these purges have somehow loosened Xi’s grip on the military. If the political turmoil inside the PLA was in fact embarrassing to Xi, it would be covered up rather than publicly acknowledged, as most of these cases have been. If the party excels at nothing else, it is adept at propagandizing and protecting the leadership’s image, particularly Xi’s.\nHistorically, the Chinese military has been loath to wade too deeply into politics.\nMoreover, if Xi were in fact in political trouble with the military, the question would be: Why now? After a decade of seemingly supine obeisance, there is no obvious reason why the military leadership would suddenly rouse itself to oppose Xi. The PLA actively thwarted the efforts of Xi’s predecessors when they tried to reform the high command. But so far, the PLA has not only succumbed to Xi’s sweeping reforms, it also seems to be earnestly preparing for Xi’s order to provide military options for a Taiwan contingency by 2027.\nHistorically, the PLA has been loath to wade too deeply into politics. Even after filling the administrative vacuums left by the Cultural Revolution or the turmoil of the 1989 Tiananmen crisis, the military was content to relinquish its political role and go “back to the barracks.” Indeed, Leninist regimes tend to effectively inoculate themselves against the prospect of military coups that bedevil other authoritarian systems because of their reliance on purges and political commissars to enforce party discipline.\nRather than a split between Xi and the PLA, it seems more likely that the recent purges are the result of an intramural game of thrones within the PLA. Xi still has close ties to key senior officers, after all, especially CMC Vice Chairman General Zhang Youxia, whom Xi has known for decades and whose father was close friends with Xi’s father. Xi has even allowed Zhang to remain CMC vice chairman after he exceeded the party’s informal retirement age—a remarkable and clear sign of Xi’s trust in him. Zhang has also survived Xi’s anticorruption campaign unscathed despite having previously run the PLA’s Equipment Development Department, which has been a focal point of the most recent round of purges.\nThe ousted officers, by contrast, could simply be in the outer orbit of Xi’s political circle. And given that corruption is such a widespread reality of life in the PLA, especially since Xi initiated his pricey military modernization program, the recently purged officers may have miscalculated that their ties to Xi would allow them to line their pockets with impunity.\nRED ARMY, RED FLAGS\nThe scale and drama of these machinations in the high command, however, raise deeper questions about why Xi has been so fixated on the military—and so ruthless in his management of it. His biography offers some clues.\nAs the son of a leader who played a major role in China’s civil war, Xi was more comfortable with military affairs than his two predecessors—both of whom were engineers with little prior exposure to the military. Xi’s immediate predecessor, Hu Jintao, had few if any identifiable allies among senior PLA officers and struggled to exercise full control over the military. Since many of his fellow princelings served in the senior ranks, however, Xi was better attuned to the politics within the military. And he had a greater appreciation for the political importance of the PLA, intuitively understanding that control of the military was indispensable for his ability to dominate Chinese politics.\nYet in 2010 when Xi became a member of the CMC and the Chinese Communist Party’s heir apparent, he was probably alarmed by what he discovered at PLA headquarters. Thanks to the domination of generals loyal to former leader Jiang Zemin, who sustained his influence throughout the Hu era (2002–12), the PLA had become an insular and unwieldy institution that was spending more time protecting its own parochial interests than operating as a joint force globally or even regionally.\nXi was more comfortable with military affairs than his two predecessors.\nIndeed, Xi started his tenure as commander in chief by promulgating the idea that the PLA needed to be prepared “to fight and win battles,” a turn of phrase that rather patronizingly implied that the PLA was not currently prepared to do so. Xi also likely found that behind the wall of PLA insularity, there was extensive corruption. As one of Xi’s princeling allies famously commented, corruption had become so rife in the PLA that “only our own corruption can defeat us.”\nThe insularity of the PLA is hard to fathom from afar. It is a sprawling, opaque, and technologically advanced empire unto itself within the party apparatus, and even civilian Communist Party leaders often can’t understand, penetrate, or control it. Although the Communist Party has a monopoly on the use of force, the PLA has a near monopoly on military expertise. Unlike in the United States, there is no cadre of civilian experts on military affairs either inside or outside the PLA. There is no equivalent to the Pentagon’s Office of the Secretary of Defense, which helps ensure civilian control of the military.\nParadoxically, this has bred an increasing degree of professionalism: senior officers in the PLA are neutral experts focused on warfighting and not on politics. Although an apolitical military appeals to democracies such as the United States, this trend would have startled rather than mollified Xi. In the Chinese political system, the military is supposed to be thoroughly politicized: virtually all officers are required to be members of the Chinese Communist Party and both senior commanders and the rank and file devote considerable time to ideological education and other tasks that are ancillary to military proficiency. In fact, the PLA’s chief periodical regularly publishes diatribes against the notion of an apolitical military. That focus stems in large part from the PLA’s primary mission and its true raison d’être—protecting the CCP and its rule, not defending the Chinese state per se.\nCOURSE CORRECTION\nIn 2011, a mere year into Xi’s tenure on the CMC, the question of whether the PLA would serve as guarantor of the party became acute because of the Arab Spring. In the face of public discontent, security forces across the Middle East melted away and regimes fell. During China’s 1989 pro-democracy movement, the PLA’s support for quashing the protesters in Tiananmen Square rested on a narrow consensus; many senior PLA officers opposed martial law and the military was paralyzed for a month before paramount leader Deng Xiaoping could sway the outcome. After the Arab Spring, one could imagine senior CCP leaders asking, “If Tiananmen happened today, would the PLA again save the party?”\nXi was likely not assured. The command structure of the PLA at the time looked like a joint force at first glance, with each service having a representative on the party’s supreme military body—but in fact, this structure made it even more difficult to control the high command since no officer had the authority to corral the various service chiefs. For any civilian leader, this state of affairs would be troubling. But for a Leninist leader like Xi, it was unacceptable.\nSoon after becoming commander in chief, Xi initiated a risky blitzkrieg against the military chieftains who had turned the PLA into a near state within a state. He arrested and purged two retired but influential vice chairmen of the CMC for accepting bribes before purging several other senior officers across a wide swath of the PLA. He then went on to diminish the role of the PLA’s Ground Force, which had traditionally enjoyed a dominant position in the PLA, through a major overhaul of the PLA’s command structure. (Unlike their brethren in the navy or the air force, the ground forces did not consider themselves a mere service among several in the PLA. Rather, they were the PLA itself because they had conquered China for the Communist Party.)\nXi’s reforms wrested operational control from the services and handed it over to a novel command structure that is streamlined and reflects Xi’s dual emphasis on strict party control and joint operations. Today, the Ground Force, which has been somewhat clumsily renamed the People’s Liberation Army Army, must operate as a peer with its fellow services, which in many ways are at the forefront of the PLA’s dramatic military modernization.\nThis is a marked shift from just 20 years ago, when the ground forces still dominated the PLA’s priorities and institutions. The “Army Army” no longer dominates membership of the CMC, and the Joint Theater command staff and the other services now receive a greater share of the budget, especially for weapons acquisitions. Those services have grown, meanwhile, while the army has been cut by almost 500,000 since 2010.\n“KILL THE MONKEYS”\nThe sheer scope and scale of the institutional reforms that Xi imposed on the PLA a decade ago are not to be underestimated. They are tantamount to the U.S. military experiencing both the 1947 National Security Act, which subjugated the Navy and War Departments to a unified Department of Defense, and the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act, which sought to oust the service chiefs from the operational chain of command, simultaneously. Although the United States has a long tradition of civilian control of the military, both reforms provoked intense public hostility as well as opposition from the high command, including the famous “Revolt of the Admirals” in 1949 when navy officers publicly opposed the Truman administration’s defense policy.\nGiven the audacity of Xi’s purges and reforms, many analysts have expected—or even hoped for—some kind of backlash against Xi for more than a decade. Yet Xi made these extensive renovations to the high command with no visible sign of dissent. By going straight for the metaphorical jugular of the PLA, Xi flipped on its head the oft-used phrase that Chinese leaders “kill the chicken to scare the monkeys.” Instead of purging the protégés of PLA elites to send a message to the top, he decapitated the leadership itself. It was a gamble, but the moves effectively bludgeoned resistance and seemed to enhance Xi’s stature.\nIndeed, power in Chinese politics tends to accrue like compound interest rather than depreciate, and the potential for opposition to Xi has dissipated rather than coalesced over time. This dynamic was most vividly on display at the last party congress, in 2022, when Xi not only evicted the already marginalized allies of his predecessor Hu from the leadership lineup but also had Hu himself physically removed from the proceedings while Xi looked on impassively. Twice in his tenure, Xi has even hauled the entire high command to historic revolutionary sites where Mao institutionalized the party’s control of the military, reinforcing the military’s role as the armed wing of the Communist Party.\nXi’s focus on reforming the PLA is often portrayed in the West as a myopic obsession with unification with Taiwan. But it is more symbolic than that. Throughout his tenure, Xi has demonstrated a keen fondness for centenary celebrations, and 2027 will mark the 100th anniversary of the creation of the PLA. Serendipitously for Xi, 2027 will also coincide with the start of his potential fourth term in office, and Xi and the military will inevitably use the occasion to publicly extol the considerable advances the PLA has made toward his objectives. Behind closed doors, however, Xi is likely to remain relentless in pushing the PLA to do more.\nCOMBAT READY?\nXi’s overbearing approach to the PLA not only ensures Xi’s military objectives, it also serves his political objectives. Keeping senior officers uncertain about their career prospects and reliant on Xi for their promotions and livelihoods allows Xi to cultivate multiple channels of information from within the PLA so that he can puncture that wall of insularity and triangulate what he hears from different sources. This tactic is especially important as the PLA modernizes to conduct twenty-first-century warfare and becomes even more impenetrable for senior party civilian leaders.\nFor many observers, Xi’s approach may seem counterproductive. Stringent management of the PLA and the relentlessness of Xi’s anticorruption campaign is probably both humiliating and demoralizing for senior officers. Yet Xi probably sees such suffering among the high command as having a salutary effect. Xi’s own father was ousted from power and imprisoned multiple times during his long career in the CCP—trials that seem to have deepened his loyalty to the party rather than undermined it.\nFor more than 40 years, the PLA has been a peacetime military unbloodied by actual conflict. Without challenges or tests of loyalty, Xi knows it is at risk of growing complacent. He wants a military that is inured to such trials and ready to take on the most difficult missions, whether that is punishing its purported compatriots in Taiwan and fending off a potential U.S. intervention, or even employing violence to protect the party from its fellow citizens. As Xi noted in his first speech to the PLA after becoming commander in chief, the Soviet Union fell because “nobody was man enough to stand up and resist.” Xi is obsessed with ensuring that the PLA’s men would resist if need be—but he is still not confident they would.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "The First Step in Negotiations With Russia", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russia/first-step-negotiations-russia", "text": "This month, the Ukrainian journalist Victoriia Roshchyna was finally laid to rest in a cemetery in Kyiv. She had disappeared in August 2023 while investigating abuses by Russian forces in occupied areas of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region. After more than a year in Russian custody, she was to be released as part of a prisoner swap between Kyiv and Moscow. But she died before the exchange took place. Russian authorities eventually repatriated her body, which showed signs of torture.\nLast October, when news broke of Roshchyna’s death, Donald Trump was running for U.S. president and repeatedly promising that if elected, he would end Russia’s war against Ukraine “in one day.” But the war grinds on, with Russian forces intensifying attacks across the frontline and ramping up long-range strikes on Ukrainian cities. Expectations are low that Trump’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin today in Alaska will resolve the many important questions that the warring parties must iron out, such as security guarantees for Ukraine and the future of the occupied territories.\nBut the many thousands of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) and captured civilians held in the occupied territories and in Russia proper, as well as the hundreds of Ukrainian children put up for adoption after they were deported to Russia, cannot wait for a negotiated end to the armed conflict that could take years to materialize. Nor can the scores of Russian nationals imprisoned for their antiwar stance or actions. Every day that Ukrainians and Russian political prisoners remain in custody comes with a risk that they will share Roshchyna’s fate.\nReleasing war captives may be the one thing that all parties can quickly agree on. In June, Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, noted the importance of Russian-Ukrainian negotiations from a “humanitarian perspective” and spoke of the hundreds of captured Russian soldiers who were able to “return home” following a prisoner swap that Kyiv and Moscow agreed to during negotiations in Istanbul. Throughout the spring and summer, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky repeatedly declared that “bringing home” Ukrainian captives was “a top priority” for his government. Kyiv’s backers share this concern. The European Union and the Council of Europe have strongly emphasized the need for Moscow to release Ukrainian detainees. So has the United States, which, in a joint statement with Ukraine published in March, demanded that the Kremlin prioritize “the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of deported Ukrainian children.” Qatar, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have all been involved in mediating prisoner swaps and in efforts to secure the repatriation of Ukrainian children.\nThe U.S. administration must now emphasize the need to release and repatriate wartime detainees in its negotiations with Moscow. This is not just an idealistic goal. Because an agreement for both sides to free civilian detainees and exchange POWs is relatively low-hanging fruit in diplomacy with the Kremlin, securing it could help smooth the way for talks over more vexing issues. And in the meantime, a deal could meaningfully reduce the human suffering this war inflicts daily. It is too late to save Roshchyna, who was just 27 years old when she died in Russian detention. But thousands of war captives can still come home.\nTHE DETAINED\nThe exact number of POWs held by Russia and Ukraine and civilian detainees held by Russia is unknown, but according to estimates by both Russian and Ukrainian officials, the number is in the thousands. In the past 12 months, hundreds of POWs have been released in exchanges. In talks in Istanbul in May, Kyiv and Moscow agreed to the first large-scale prisoner swap of the war: 1,000 from each side. (Roughly every eighth prisoner released by Russia as part of that swap turned out to be a civilian, not a combatant; detaining civilians for the purpose of exchanging them as “prisoners of war” could constitute the war crime of hostage taking.) The swap was followed by several substantial exchanges over the course of the summer, including exchanges of gravely wounded or ill POWs and exchanges of the bodies of fallen soldiers.\nIn a recent report, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) referenced interviews with 117 Ukrainian POWs who had returned to Ukraine in exchanges after more than two years in captivity. In most of the cases, the interviews confirmed “patterns of widespread and systematic torture and ill-treatment.” Former POWs spoke of “severe beatings, stress positions, electric shocks, dog attacks, sexual violence, prolonged standing or exhaustive exercising and humiliation.”\nThe report also flagged that between December 2024 and May 2025, Russian courts convicted at least 125 Ukrainian POWs on terrorism-related charges over actions that were, in fact, lawful acts of war. According to the Geneva Conventions, POWs may not be tried for merely participating in hostilities as combatants. They, like any other soldiers, can and should be prosecuted for their actions in war if those actions involve war crimes or crimes against humanity, such as acts of torture or the deliberate killing of civilians. Russian authorities, however, commonly prosecute Ukrainian POWs based on false confessions to war crimes extracted through torture.\nReleasing war captives may be the one thing that all parties can quickly agree on.\nIn addition to POWs, Russia holds thousands of Ukrainian civilian detainees—more than 16,000, according to Ukraine’s human rights commissioner. Most of them were detained by Russian forces and their proxies in occupied areas of Ukraine on suspicion of providing intelligence to Ukrainian authorities, for speaking out against the occupation, or for refusing to collaborate with occupying authorities. These civilians are then either jailed in the occupied territories or deported to Russia and imprisoned there. Most are denied contact with their loved ones and access to lawyers. OHCHR documented hundreds of such cases soon after the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. The Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group, a leading Ukrainian civil society organization, has verified the identities and whereabouts of 1,863 Ukrainian civilians in Russian detention.\nRussian authorities have prosecuted some detained Ukrainian civilians on terrorism, espionage, and other politically motivated charges. For example, Iryna Horobtsova, a civic activist, was detained in May 2022 by Russian authorities in Kherson when that city was under occupation. She was unlawfully transferred to occupied Crimea, given a trial that was closed to the public, convicted of espionage, and sentenced to ten years in prison. Another civilian, Iryna Kulish, a housewife in her 50s, was arrested by Russian security agents in October 2023 in the occupied part of the Zaporizhzhia region. They held her in secret detention for 20 days, and through torture and threats forced her to confess to having planned to plant an explosive device at a polling station before a referendum on the incorporation of the Zaporizhzhia region into Russia. Kulish was then deported to Russia and tried before a military court on terrorism charges. She is now serving an eight-year sentence. Kulish suffers from a medical condition that is rapidly deteriorating without adequate medical assistance. Her lawyer told Human Rights Watch this summer that she has tremors in her hands so severe that she cannot sleep at night.\nRussia invents false charges because it has no legal basis to hold Ukrainian civilians in custody. These civilians should all be released and allowed to return to their homes immediately and without condition. Instead, they are unlawfully used as bargaining chips in POW exchanges and suffer inhumane treatment while in confinement. In October 2024, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, which was established by the United Nations after Russia’s full-scale invasion to investigate alleged human rights abuses and violations of the laws of war, concluded after extensive research that the torture of Ukrainian civilians and POWs in Russian custody is widespread, systematic, and driven by coordinated state policy. It therefore constitutes a crime against humanity.\nTHE MOST VULNERABLE\nAmong the Ukrainian civilians transferred to Russia since February 2022 are thousands of Ukrainian children—a war crime for which the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Putin and Russia’s children’s rights commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova. Russian authorities and their proxies took many of the children from boarding schools and care homes for children with disabilities or children in difficult family circumstances in occupied areas of Ukraine. The children were deported without their families’ consent and placed in Russian orphanages or, in some cases, handed over to foster families. Russian authorities have shared no information with Ukraine about the children’s identities or whereabouts.\nAfter the full-scale invasion, the U.S. State Department under President Joe Biden began funding Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab to track down the deported Ukrainian children. By scouring Russian adoption databases and conducting other open-source research, including satellite imagery analysis, the lab found thousands of children. It identified more than 40 Russian facilities housing deported Ukrainian children and determined the locations of more than 300 children who had been adopted.\nRussian authorities insist that all the Ukrainian children brought to Russian territory were “evacuated” for their own protection from areas with active hostilities. But the laws of war prohibit a warring party from transferring children who are not its own nationals without their parents’ or guardians’ written consent, except as a temporary measure for compelling health or safety reasons. Moscow’s refusal to provide Ukrainian authorities with a list of deported children and their locations, its assignment of Russian citizenship to many deported children, and its decision to put them up for adoption clearly indicate that Russia by no means considers the evacuations temporary. In November 2022, the UN Children’s Fund raised alarms about the last practice in particular, flagging in the guidance it issued for protecting Ukrainian children that adoption “should never occur during or immediately after an emergency.”\nRussia has no legal basis to hold Ukrainian civilians in custody.\nYale researchers also found that Ukrainian children in Russia were being indoctrinated with anti-Ukrainian propaganda in an attempt to erase their national and cultural identities and sever their ties with their home country. Teachers and orphanage workers reprimanded children who spoke Ukrainian or criticized the war. Some children were placed in military training in Russian youth camps or sent to study in Russian military academies.\nIn March, the Trump administration abruptly withdrew the Yale lab’s funding as part of its sweeping budget cuts. The researchers lost access to the data they had collected, as the database belonged to the U.S. government under the terms of the contract with the lab. After a public outcry, the administration restored the lab’s funding through July 1 and allowed the lab to transfer its data to the European Union’s law enforcement agency, Europol. But researchers do not have the resources to update the database since. As the Russian state continues to relocate children and move forward with adoptions, the lab’s data may soon become obsolete—unless the Trump administration or a private institution funds the work needed to resume investigations. In June, during the talks in Istanbul, Ukrainian negotiators presented their Russian counterparts with a list of 339 kidnapped children, seeking their immediate return; accurate information will be crucial to compiling future such lists.\nThe final group of captives is composed of Russians who have spoken up or taken action against the war—and who have paid a high price for doing so. The list of political prisoners maintained by the Russian human rights organization Memorial currently includes 269 cases, with over a thousand additional cases under investigation. A prisoner swap among Germany, Russia, and the United States in August 2024 resulted in the release of the prominent opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza, the human rights defender Oleg Orlov, and a few others who had been imprisoned in Russia over their antiwar stance. But the number of prosecutions of domestic war critics keeps rising.\nRights groups such as Memorial, OVD-Info, and others have documented a pattern of ill treatment of political prisoners in Russia. The authorities arbitrarily place dissidents in solitary confinement and cells with extremely harsh conditions for alleged disciplinary violations, deny them family visits, hinder their access to lawyers, and fail to provide them with adequate medical care.\nBRING THEM HOME\nUkraine’s leaders have made it clear that they are willing to release Russian prisoners in their custody in exchange for Ukrainian POWs and civilian detainees. The return of Russian POWs is important for the Kremlin’s own constituency, especially the families of POWs, active-duty soldiers, and members of the public who could be mobilized to serve in the armed forces. In his speeches and media comments, Putin frequently says that “Russia does not leave our own behind.”\nFor the Kremlin, a limited humanitarian concession would cost little and could improve relations between Moscow and Washington—a major objective for Putin. Washington should use the summit in Alaska and other channels to Moscow to help secure the release of war captives. Some of Kyiv’s European allies, such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, have already stressed the urgency of releasing all war captives; they should encourage Trump to engage directly with Putin on this issue. Other countries that maintain working relations with Russia can bring pressure to bear, too. Qatar and the UAE are already engaged in efforts to secure the repatriation of abducted Ukrainian children, and Turkey and the UAE have acted as mediators for previous POW exchanges. They can now play bigger roles in convincing the Kremlin to release wartime detainees. Turkey in particular has a good deal of leverage with Russia, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said repeatedly, including this week, that Turkey is eager to host a meeting between Putin, Trump, and Zelensky. A call by Erdogan for the Kremlin to release war captives would be a powerful humanitarian gesture and would be well received by the Turkish president’s domestic and international audiences.\nFor the thousands of Ukrainian POWs and civilians in Russian custody, each passing day brings more brutality, torture, and indignity. For the thousands of Ukrainian children deported to Russia, each day in exile erodes their connection to their Ukrainian families and identity. And for imprisoned Russian war critics, each day behind bars compounds the injustice they face. The fate of Russia’s war captives is a humanitarian issue that can be resolved soon. There isn’t a moment to lose.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "The Dawn of Automated Warfare", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russia/dawn-automated-warfare", "text": "When Russia first launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the conflict drew comparisons to wars of the twentieth century. Tanks, armored personnel carriers, and artillery dominated the battlefield, and both sides’ infantry were dug into trenches. We witnessed this old-school style of war when we made our first visit to Ukraine in September 2022. Since then, we have made regular trips to Ukraine, affording us firsthand insight into a monumental transformation: the beginning of a new kind of warfare.\nIn summer 2023, the commander of Ukraine’s Third Assault Brigade’s Drone Unit, whom we’ll call Fil (not his real name), told us that a new weapon had begun to change the conflict: first-person-view drones. These small, cheap, maneuverable quadcopters transmit real-time footage to their operators and detonate kamikaze-style on their targets. That year, Ukraine flooded the field with thousands of them and Russia soon followed suit. Today, hundreds of thousands of these drones fill the Ukrainian skies.\nWhat began as a war with drones has become a war of drones. Indeed, two years ago, a Ukrainian brigade’s strength was judged mostly by its inventory of Western-supplied tanks, armored personnel carriers, and artillery. Since 2023, however, drones have become the most important weapon on the battlefield. Because of their low cost, speed, and precision, drones have now largely supplanted traditional weaponry, including antitank missiles, mortars, tanks, and even artillery and aircraft. Today, a unit’s power and resilience are dictated by its number of skilled drone operators and its ability to deploy drones at scale. (One of us, Schmidt, has been a longtime investor in defense technology companies, and is currently an investor in companies supplying drones to Ukraine.)\nThis represents a profound shift in warfare, largely instigated by Ukraine to compensate for its shortfalls in conventional weapons and manpower. In the world’s first drone war, drones determine how battles are won and how soldiers die: Ukrainian drone strikes now account for 90 percent of destroyed Russian tanks and armored vehicles and 80 percent of Russian casualties. They have also made it possible for each side to attack far past the frontlines without having to gain air superiority over the battlefield. Ukraine, for example, hit Russian airbases 5,000 miles from Kyiv in June by smuggling drones across the border and launching them from the beds of trucks.\nRussia, for its part, was originally slower to field drones in large numbers. But it has dramatically increased its production of first-person-view drones, as well as those used for strategic bombardment, such as the Iranian-designed Shahed. Today, Moscow matches Kyiv’s extraordinary rate of technological adaptation. It has developed equally capable models, such as the Orlan, which is used for surveillance, and the Lancet, which loiters over a target before exploding on impact.\nBecause Russia and Ukraine are constantly iterating on hardware, software, and tactics, the war changes at a breathtaking rate. The saturation of drone surveillance, for example, has made nearly all troop movement visible and therefore vulnerable, creating a transparent battlefield: anything that moves near the frontline is struck within a matter of minutes. Drone pilots have become prime targets, and with many traditional weapons rendered obsolete, drones are increasingly fighting other drones. Amid this cycle of innovation, the two sides are inching toward a new frontier: entirely automated warfare.\nEYES EVERYWHERE\nSurveillance and reconnaissance drones have become so ubiquitous that both Russian and Ukrainian forces scarcely move in the daylight. During a recent visit, we witnessed the motion of a single Russian van, five miles from the frontline, cause a sensation among drone operators, who then destroyed it. To avoid detection, movement near the frontline tends to take place during sunrise and sunset, when neither the daylight video cameras nor night-vision infrared cameras operate properly.\nThe fight for information advantage is always important in war, but even more so in this one, where it means the ability to form and maintain resilient drone-based sensor networks over the battlefield. If a unit is “blinded”—unable to maintain surveillance drones overhead—it becomes exceedingly vulnerable. For that reason, roughly 3,000 Ukrainian troops work around the clock to operate reconnaissance drones, mostly Chinese-made DJI Mavics, along the entire 750-mile frontline. Ukrainian brigade command centers display as many as 60 of these drone feeds around the clock.\nThis transparency means that the military maxim “what can be seen can be hit” is truer on today’s battlefield than at any point in history. It is nearly impossible for either side to mass and maneuver forces along the frontline, as troops are now easily spotted forming up for attack. The Russian army has historically relied on its ability to deliver impressive firepower through concentrated tube and rocket artillery fire, but these tactics are useless when any attempt to amass forces is identified within minutes. Russian guns are now widely dispersed, deeply dug in, and operate primarily at night.\nBoth Russian and Ukrainian forces scarcely move in the daylight.\nFil says his team has expanded from 400 troops in 2023 to over 1,000 now, and he expects it to continue to grow in the coming months. The brigade’s frontline operations are driven by data, of which there is more every day. Fil’s brigade, for example, tracks every engagement, drone mission, and vehicle or piece of equipment hit. That data, in turn, drives decision-making, including over the kinds and quantities of drones to procure. Fil’s team spends nearly $2 million each month on small quadcopters, mostly Mavics, for frontline reconnaissance and more than $500,000 per month for longer-range fixed-wing surveillance drones, such as Sharks or Lelekas, that can be used to see much farther from the frontline.\nThis is expensive, but one new battle tank costs more than $10 million. A tank was long regarded as the best weapon to defeat another tank; now, a first-person-view drone costing less than $800 is, thanks to its ability to strike with precision and move much faster than any ground vehicle. No armored vehicle—no matter its camouflage or anti-drone barriers—can survive for long on the modern, drone-swept battlefield. As a result, Ukrainian soldiers believe tank-led assaults to be suicidal. Russia still launches them occasionally, but most do not make it to the front line.\nIn response, Russia has shifted primarily to infantry assaults. It is no surprise, then, that more than 75 percent of Ukrainian drones now target infantry. Because surveillance drones have a difficult time spotting scattered infantry in urban terrain and forests, the Russians are deploying small assault groups, typically consisting of five or six teams of two to three people, to simultaneously attack a concentrated area. In recent months, the Russians have turned to motorcycles to more rapidly cross no man’s land—a shocking contrast to the line of tanks that rolled toward Kyiv in the earliest days of the conflict. When surviving members of a Russian assault group reach a building, they immediately dig in. Gradually, more soldiers join them. Over days or even weeks, the Russians gather their forces until they judge that they have sufficient strength to make the next bound toward Ukrainian positions. According to an officer from Ukraine’s Azov Brigade, Russia’s “cheap infantry”—its disregard for soldiers’ survival—allows for this kind of constant experimentation.\nDRONE ON DRONE\nBecause drones have become so important to almost all battlefield operations, destroying them has become critical. Drone-on-drone battle is now a central part of the war. Last year, an estimated 1,200 Russian surveillance drones were operating behind Ukrainian lines on a given day, so Ukraine built the first drone-based air defense system to fend them off. Its forces began using first-person-view drones to chase down larger, slower, and much more expensive surveillance drones. Russian surveillance drones now fly higher to avoid Ukrainian interception. Still, roughly 80 percent of all surveillance drones that cross the frontline, be they Russian or Ukrainian, are shot down by either interceptors or traditional air defenses. Because of these changes, Russia has dramatically reduced its use of Lancet drones. Instead, it has developed smaller, faster, and camouflaged surveillance drones, including some with rear-facing cameras, that let operators spot and evade pursuing drones.\nUnsurprisingly, drone pilots and their control stations have become prime targets for both sides. Fil’s unit has found that a successful attack on Russian Mavic operators can pause enemy activity for three days. Because pilots have become such a precious resource, integral to defending the infantry, Ukraine is working to relocate as many of them as possible away from the frontlines to integrated remote operations. In an attempt to further decrease the number of forward-deployed soldiers, Ukraine is now working to establish a so-called drone line along its entire frontline—a layered defense corridor six or seven miles wide, made up of obstacles such as ditches, minefields, and razor wire, and hundreds of drone teams that wait at the ready to destroy any targets before they reach Ukrainian positions. Once this barrier is in place, and more drone functions are automated, far fewer troops will need to defend the frontline. Ukraine hopes that this approach will help alleviate its manpower shortfalls and save lives.\nBehind the frontlines, tactics are evolving just as fast. On a nightly basis, Russia launches hundreds of Shahed long-range drones at Ukraine, particularly its major cities. Russia increasingly uses sequenced launches and circuitous route planning so that multiple drones arrive at their target simultaneously from different directions; these attacks amount to manually coordinated “drone swarms.” Short of air defense systems, Ukraine has prioritized the development and production of interceptor drones to counter these swarms. Russia also sends dozens of cheaper “dummy” drones—drones without real capabilities—into Ukrainian airspace, forcing air defense radars to reveal their locations. Russian ballistic and cruise missiles then route around the defenses to strike their targets.\nITERATION OR OBLITERATION\nThe speed of technological adaptation and iteration—or innovation power—is a new measure of combat strength. The key to adaptation is the lightning-fast feedback loop from operator to engineer. The best Ukrainian drone pilots, therefore, are both tactician and technician, able to make modifications and improvements on the fly.\nConsequently, the most important progress in drone development is happening at the front. Operators are supported by research and development labs and manufacturing and repair facilities located near the frontlines. Drone teams constantly test and deploy new radios, antennas, and circuit boards; software updates are pushed out on a near-daily basis. To create an effective weapon now requires adapting and iterating against an equally adaptive adversary, resulting in a highly dynamic contest of action and reaction.\nOnce a new weapon or technique is introduced to the battlefield, it has a limited window of utility before the opponent develops countermeasures. New kinds of drones appear at a rapid rate: two years ago, the Russian Lancet was the most threatening model. Last year, it was the first-person-view drone. Now, strike drones controlled by fiber-optic cables, first fielded by the Russians, have taken hold of the frontline.\nUnlike drones that run on standard radio frequency, these quadcopters spool up to 25 miles of fiber-optic cable in their wake, leaving them hard-wired to their operator. Although these drones are slow and limited by the length of their wire, they are impervious to jamming, relay clear images, and can operate outside radio line of sight, which means that they are well suited for hilly and urban terrain. Since they do not emit radio signals, their pilot’s location cannot be identified by electronic means, and they strike with shocking precision.\nFiber-optic drones are effective ambush weapons. Russians fly them across the frontline and park these models on roads or rooftops and wait for passing vehicles. Their high-quality control signal and camera resolution allows them to be maneuvered with pinpoint accuracy into tight areas, such as buildings and bunkers, that normal first-person-view drones, which rely on radio, cannot access. Russia now has elite units of drone pilots using fiber-optic drones stationed along heavily contested parts of the frontline in order to target Ukrainian drone operators, attack enemy supply lines, and ultimately isolate forward units.\nDrone innovation is not just about making drones better but also about driving down their cost. Over the course of the past year, both Ukrainian and Russian drone units have replaced the pricey few with the inexpensive plenty. Expensive drones, including the Russian Lancet and the American Switchblade 600, which each cost between $65,000 and $150,000, are being pushed aside in favor of fixed-wing strike drones, such as the Russian Molniya and the Ukrainian Dart, both of which cost less than $3,000. Because Molniya kamikaze drones are so cheap, Russia uses them as a mass strike weapon, sometimes launching 15 at a single target.\nFor the most part, Ukraine still uses first-person-view drones because they are cheap, relatively easy to use, and readily available. Brigades on the most active fronts consume more than 5,000 of them per month. But because their rate of success in striking a target is low, estimated at no more than ten percent for the average unit, many frontline units favor larger bomber-type drones for their versatility, reusability, and modular configurations. A single Ukrainian-made Vampire hexacopter drone, for example, can drop antitank mines or rain down munitions on enemy infantry, achieving the same effect as dozens of artillery rounds, and with greater precision. And because they are both reusable and have a larger payload than first-person-view drones, bomber drones can saturate the ground with high explosives much more rapidly and at much lower cost. They are also better at targeting infantry when repelling assaults and can collapse buildings with a few accurately placed explosives that would otherwise have taken hundreds of artillery rounds.\nBomber drones can also place mines, a tactic that is quickly becoming one of the most effective ways to halt Russian assaults. Russian units on the attack must use largely predictable routes because of terrain, so Ukrainian forces create a dynamic, mobile minefield by dropping mines in their path. Ukrainian forces then use first-person-view drones to herd Russian vehicles toward the mines. One Ukrainian brigade estimates that 50 percent of enemy vehicle kills in recent months have resulted from drone mining. Ukrainians also use bomber drones to run continuous waves of attacks, similar to artillery bombardments, to keep Russian infantry suppressed, underground, and unable to advance.\nUkraine still employs its legacy systems, such as artillery, to support its drone tactics. When Russian infantry are protecting a valuable target, for instance, Ukrainian troops use artillery to suppress the infantry so that Ukrainian bomber drones can destroy the target without being shot down. Ukrainian troops will also use surveillance drones to ascertain where Russian drone pilots are before shelling those locations. These approaches allow Ukraine to minimize its use of expensive legacy systems that can be difficult to acquire; Russia, by contrast, has less need to adapt its use of these systems because it can afford to expend shells in quantities that Ukraine cannot.\nSWARM AND ATTACK\nAutomating drones with artificial intelligence would solve a variety of problems facing the modern warfighter. A large number of drones are lost to pilot error. And the Ukrainian battlefield is saturated with systems that jam and spoof signals across the electromagnetic spectrum, making it difficult to rely on any technology that requires constant radio connection to a human operator. Thousands of Ukrainian troops operate Mavics all day, every day, a function that could certainly be automated. Collecting and processing surveillance data automatically—ideally from multiple layers of sensors across the frontline—would save hundreds of man-hours a week. And current systems require drone pilots to operate close to the frontline, putting them at risk.\nToday, algorithms can augment human control of the battlefield. They reduce error by helping pilots detect, track, approach, and strike targets. AI targeting systems are trained nightly on combat footage to adjust to Russian countermeasures, such as camouflage or decoys. Ukrainian and Western companies are creating software that supports drone pilots even more, by selecting routes, stabilizing flights, navigating to waypoints, recognizing targets, and guiding toward the destination. If these efforts are successful, becoming a drone pilot will require fewer skills and less experience.\nIn particular, defense firms are keen to develop AI tools that make it easier to carry out the final phase of an attack. The Ukrainian battlefield is a challenge for machine learning because enemy tanks and artillery pieces constantly change appearance with added armor and camouflage. Algorithms also perform poorly at identifying scattered infantry, particularly in dense forests or other complex terrain. AI-assisted target acquisition and terminal guidance have already proved effective even in the face of radio signal jamming. Although the future of fully autonomous drones is unclear, a more autonomous drone strike complex—one that combines reconnaissance and strike drones to identify, track, and hit moving targets—would enormously improve Ukraine’s ability to defend against Russian attacks.\nThe next phase of the war will be determined by software.\nDefense companies are also racing to create AI that can coordinate attacks by multiple drones in an automated drone swarm—the holy grail of drone operations. Today, Ukrainian forces can form a carousel of drones over a target to repeatedly strike at it, but doing so requires multiple pilots and operators. With an automated drone swarm, a single pilot could guide many drones, flying independent routes, to overwhelm defenses and saturate a target.\nTo pull off such a feat, defense firms will need to develop AI-powered systems that enable drones to communicate automatically—not just with one another but also with a host of sensors. These networks exist, but not at the required scale. And the task is getting harder each day: as the drone-versus-drone war escalates, the quantity of drones deployed in each operation will grow from hundreds to thousands, making their automated coordination increasingly difficult.\nEventually, Ukraine will need its own version of Israel’s Iron Dome air defense network to protect its cities and factories from Russia’s constant drone and missile raids. Of course, Ukraine’s vast size makes this a daunting challenge, but it can begin by shielding its major cities. Greater automation will be key to fending off Russian attacks. Whereas the first phase of the war was defined by hardware, with each side competing to invent new kinds of drones, payload, and munitions, the next phase of the war will be determined by software.\nWAR OF FACTORIES\nDrones have upended the old ways of war. Military doctrine, tactics, and organization will never be the same. Armies everywhere will need to completely revamp their doctrine and training to reflect the realities of fighting on a drone-swept battlefield. And the best way to prepare for the future of combat is to speak to those fighting this war.\nHistorians often call World War II a “war of factories.” The same is true for the war in Ukraine today. Ukraine produced more than two million drones in 2024 and plans to make over four million by the end of 2025. Its adversary is also getting better at drone production: last year, Russia was building 300 Shahed drones a month. Now, it can produce 5,000 in the same time frame. The side that consistently builds the most drones is the one most likely to prevail. And it is in the interest of the West, and of the United States in particular, to support the Ukrainian people in their dogged determination to win that fight—not only for Ukraine’s sake but also for its own, so it can learn to reckon with this new reality of war.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "The Shocking Rift Between India and the United States", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/india/shocking-rift-between-india-and-united-states", "text": "In the past 25 years, India and the United States have become closer than ever before, building strong economic and strategic ties. Their partnership has rested on shared values and shared interests: they are the two largest democracies in the world, home to vast multicultural populations, and both have been concerned about the rise of India’s northern neighbor, China. But in the past four months, that carefully cultivated relationship has abruptly gone off the rails. The return of U.S. President Donald Trump to the White House threatens to undo the achievements of a quarter century.\nTrump’s actions have disregarded several of India’s core foreign policy concerns, crossing sensitive redlines that previous U.S. administrations tended to respect. The United States once treated India as an important American partner in Asia. Today, India faces the highest current U.S. tariff rate, of 50 percent—an ostensible punishment for India’s purchase of Russian oil after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. India finds itself dealing with a higher tariff rate than even China, the country that, at least until recently, Washington wanted New Delhi to help contain. Indeed, Trump seems far more keen to strike a deal with China than to relent on his tough stance toward India. And to make matters worse, Trump announced a deal in late July with India’s frequent adversary Pakistan, under which the United States will work to develop Pakistan’s oil reserves.\nThese tariff woes follow on the heels of another shock to the Indian system: Trump’s intervention in May in a clash between India and Pakistan. After a few days of escalating strikes precipitated by a terrorist massacre in India, Trump unilaterally announced that he had brokered a cease-fire between the two countries. India vehemently denied that claim—New Delhi has long resisted any external mediation of its disputes with Islamabad, and American officials have been careful not to offend Indian sensitivities in this area—but Trump doubled down. No doubt he was offended by Indian pushback, just as he was pleased by Pakistan’s immediate embrace of his claims and its eventual nomination of him for the Nobel Peace Prize.\nIndian officials are seething, but they understand that anger is unlikely to work where reason has failed. For the moment, New Delhi has decided to wait out the storm, carefully wording its responses to try not to inflame the situation further while signaling to a domestic audience that it is not simply submitting to the White House. The implications of Trump’s bullying for India’s grand strategy are profound: Trump’s foreign policy has upended New Delhi’s key geopolitical assumptions and shaken the foundations of the U.S.-Indian partnership. India’s favored policy of “multialignment”—seeking friends everywhere while refusing to forge clear alliances—has proved to be ineffective. And yet Trump’s actions won’t encourage a great revision in Indian foreign policy. Instead, New Delhi will survey the shifting geopolitical landscape and likely decide that what it needs is more productive relationships, not fewer. To protect itself from the capriciousness of the Trump administration, India will not abandon multialignment but pursue it all the more forcefully.\nTAKING IT FOR GRANTED\nSince its independence, in 1947, India has mostly followed a policy of nonalignment, eschewing formal alliances and resisting being drawn into competing blocs. That posture largely defined its diplomacy during the Cold War but began to change after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when India opened its economy and pursued better relations with the United States. Now its foreign policy community stresses a commitment to multialignment, which consists of the diversification of partnerships, the refusal to join military alliances, the promotion of a multipolar world order in which no single superpower or pair of great powers is predominant, and a willingness to engage in issue-based cooperation with a wide variety of actors across geopolitical fault lines.\nThis policy is driven both by pragmatism and by the hope that India can serve as a pole in the order to come. Indian policymakers believed that the country’s economic, strategic, and military needs could not be fulfilled by a single partner or coalition. They assumed that India could maintain its ties, for instance, with the likes of Iran and Russia while still working closely with Israel and the United States, and while building coalitions in the so-called global South with countries such as Brazil and South Africa. New Delhi imagined that Washington, in particular, would tolerate this behavior because when it came to the competition with China and the geopolitical contest in the Indo-Pacific, India was indispensable.\nIndia sees itself as a central player in Asia. Trump does not.\nTrump’s return to the White House has rocked the foundations of India’s strategy and challenged New Delhi’s closely held assumptions. As American tariffs take effect, the Indian economy will face increasing headwinds, most likely slowing economic growth. American ties with Pakistan in the wake of the May military standoff seem to only be growing stronger. And India now feels increasingly dispensable and marginalized in a geopolitical landscape it can hardly recognize.\nIndia’s strategy presumed a number of structural conditions that Trump has thrown into flux. India assumed, for good reason, that it played a crucial role in the great-power competition between the United States and its allies in one camp and China and Russia in the other. Pakistan seemed peripheral to this larger contest; Islamabad’s global standing had diminished after its security establishment facilitated the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Despite its refusal to condemn Russia for attacking Ukraine, India remained a favored partner for both the United States and Europe. After all, Washington’s perception of New Delhi as a potential regional counterweight to Beijing cemented India’s strategic value.\nRussia’s war on Ukraine then provided India with a unique opportunity to demonstrate its policy of multialignment and raise its profile in global geopolitics. Russia, Ukraine, the United States, and Europe—key parties to the conflict—all courted India. In the process, India was able to maintain ties with both the United States and Europe, even as it bought Russian oil at favorable rates. And if the United States sometimes behaved in South Asia in ways that rankled India (for instance, when it did nothing to stop the ouster of a pro-India leader in Bangladesh in 2024), Indian officials still perceived American involvement in the region as largely beneficial, and confirmation that the United States saw the subcontinent as a key front in its larger competition with China. India much preferred the occasionally irritating involvement in South Asia of a faraway superpower to the aggression and ambition of the aspiring hegemon next door.\nSHAKEN TO THE CORE\nTrump’s return to the White House has complicated each of the assumptions New Delhi held. Instead of girding itself for great-power competition, the White House is scouring the world for short-term gains. Through that lens, Washington has much more to gain from China than it does from India; the war in Ukraine must end because supporting Ukraine is not worth American taxpayers’ money; and Europe’s problems with Russia are Europe’s problems, not those of the United States. In such a worldview, India’s geopolitical profile invariably shrinks.\nTake the issue of the hour: the soaring tariff rate that Trump has imposed on India. Indian governments have traditionally maintained a high tariff structure to protect domestic manufacturing and agriculture, generate revenue, and manage trade balances. India has long justified these tariffs as essential for its developing economy, but the United States is unhappy about the persistent trade deficit in goods with India, agricultural subsidies that limit U.S. access to the Indian market, and India’s omnivorous geopolitical maneuvering, including its membership in the coalition of nonwestern countries known as BRICS and its continued reliance on Russian oil and defense equipment. Previous U.S. governments tended to overlook these infelicities, allowing India to liberalize its economy and decouple from Russia at its own pace. But this Trump administration is not so patient.\nWashington’s revised approach to great-power competition has not only transformed its own policy toward New Delhi but has also influenced the choices and decisions of other major players—with significant implications for India. Russia, for instance, has sensed that Trump is far less committed to supporting Ukraine than was Biden, is less interested in the systemic challenge posed by China to the U.S.-led world order, and is reluctant to provide security commitments to allies in Europe and Asia. As Trump prepares for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, he seeks to punish India for buying Russian oil—a policy that the United States previously encouraged. With Trump in the White House, Russia has more options and needs India less.\nAmerica has much more to gain from China than it does from India.\nIndeed, Moscow feels a diminishing obligation to New Delhi and is unwilling to offer more support than it receives, which explains its lukewarm backing during India’s clash with Pakistan in May. Russia’s public statements at the time were vague: they neither mentioned Pakistan by name nor endorsed India’s military reprisals, but simply called for settling disagreements diplomatically. In a sense, Russia echoed India’s own messaging after the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Nevertheless, the statements alarmed New Delhi’s Russia watchers, who expected the Kremlin to stand by India, condemn Pakistan, and affirm India’s right to retaliate—much as Israel did in its full-throated support for India. Indian analysts suspect that Russia refrained from doing so because it didn’t want to irritate China, which has become a close strategic partner of Pakistan and provided it with a great deal of new weaponry.\nGoing forward, Russia is likely to prioritize closer ties with China over its declining relationship with India. Sensing victory in Ukraine, Moscow has new priorities: it now seeks partners capable and willing to challenge the United States and Europe, not merely offering commercial relationships. China can do that, but India is only interested in trade. Russia may therefore be reluctant to support India in any future Indian-Pakistani conflict, owing to China’s ties with Pakistan. If Russian support for India is doubtful during a conflict with Pakistan, it’s safe to assume that Russia will do little to help India in any future conflict with China.\nTrump’s relative indifference to South Asia will invariably mean a free pass for China, which will attempt to tilt the regional balance of power in its favor through a combination of debt-trap diplomacy, military agreements, and growing political and diplomatic ties with South Asian states. Chinese equipment and know-how strengthened Pakistan’s conventional capabilities in May and helped Pakistani forces probe Indian defenses. China is more directly involved in South Asian matters today than ever before and its defense industry will have a growing role in future military conflicts in the region. And if China can burrow even deeper into South Asia, it will have Trump to thank. The U.S. president is seeking a trade deal with China while trying to bully India into submission; he evinces little interest in the geopolitical fate of the Indo-Pacific, in general, and South Asia, in particular. This peculiar orientation in Trump’s foreign policy will help Beijing consolidate its influence in the region, invariably at India’s expense.\nMORE OF THE SAME\nThe recent months of foreign policy setbacks reveal the inherent limitations of India’s commitment to multialignment. During the May clashes with Pakistan, most of India’s partners were more concerned about a potential nuclear exchange in South Asia—even if that remains extraordinarily unlikely—than interested in helping India diplomatically, politically, or militarily. But beyond the nuclear concerns, the response of India’s friends and partners was one of qualified neutrality. They echoed India’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. India’s position of not siding with either Russia or Ukraine, a stand born out of the policy of multialignment, didn’t satisfy either Russia or Western governments, and so nobody stood with India when it faced a crisis.\nIndia imagined that it would benefit from great-power competition, maneuvering between China, Russia, and the United States to its own advantage. It worked until the dynamics of that competition changed dramatically. New Delhi saw itself as a central player in Asia. Trump has disabused Indian officials of that notion. His imposition of very high tariffs this month blindsided Indian policymakers who thought that the White House, in its own interest, would always treat India with due consideration. Trump seeks deals with China and Russia, browbeats traditional allies and friends, and seems content to speed the emergence of some kind of G-2 condominium in which the United States and China carve up the world between them. In such a world, India’s geopolitical importance declines dramatically.\nThis is not just India’s plight. The story in Europe and among American treaty allies in Asia is similar. In that shared doubt about the United States, however, lies a potential salve for India’s injured foreign policy. India could strengthen partnerships with European countries and major Asian powers, such as Japan and South Korea, who face their own balancing dilemmas because of the unreliability of the Trump administration. It could also seek to cultivate, or at least signal, closer ties to China and Russia; indeed, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi confirmed this month that Putin will visit India later this year.\nTo be sure, New Delhi views Washington’s conciliatory approach to Beijing with deep alarm. It has already begun considering how to better strengthen its defenses, source its weapons platforms, and establish reliable partnerships and supply chains. India will survive this geopolitical whirlwind with some deft diplomacy and patience, but this turbulent period is likely to have several long-term consequences for New Delhi’s foreign policy and strategic outlook. Bilateral relations between India and the United States will suffer acutely. Indeed, the domestic factors in the United States that appeared to guarantee good relations with India have not slowed their precipitous decline: the influential Indian diaspora in the United States seems powerless, the supposed bipartisan consensus in favor of India has not reined in Trump, and India-friendly politicians and industry leaders have remained conspicuously silent. After decades of abating, anti-Americanism is once again on the rise within the Indian foreign policy community. For an Indian foreign policy establishment that is doggedly consistent in its commitment to the status quo, Trump is a constant puzzle.\nAnd yet, paradoxically, India’s response to its current predicament is likely to be, well, more of the same. The very inadequacies of multialignment may in fact push India to become only more multialigned. If Washington is not a viable or reliable partner, New Delhi will seek and cultivate other partnerships. Trump’s outreach to Beijing and Moscow will now prompt New Delhi to follow suit, reversing India’s earlier policy of gradually distancing itself from China and Russia. India’s policy of multialignment has just undergone a geopolitical stress test and emerged rather winded. But Indian policymakers are not concluding that they should abandon it; to the contrary, they will fortify it.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "How to Stop a Humanitarian Catastrophe in Gaza", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/middle-east/how-stop-humanitarian-catastrophe-gaza", "text": "A humanitarian crisis is unfolding in the Gaza Strip. Since the March 2025 breakdown of a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, conditions have worsened dramatically, and the potential for widespread starvation is real. Thousands of containers with food, medical supplies, and shelter materials remain stranded at border crossings on both sides, awaiting Israeli clearance to enter Gaza and conditions for safe passage free from seizure by desperate Gazan civilians, Hamas or gang attacks within the enclave. At least several hundred truckloads of food aid must enter daily to avert a wider catastrophe.\nMany parties bear responsibility for this crisis. First and foremost, Hamas launched a war with the brutal October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel; because Hamas fighters live and fight in civilian areas and in tunnels running underneath them, Hamas invited an Israeli response that would put millions of people at risk. Gazan civilians have suffered hardships and deaths at an unfathomable scale since the start of the war, and outside organizations attempting to meet humanitarian needs are struggling to deliver aid in the midst of intense combat and disorder in a dense urban environment.\nFrom the very beginning, U.S. President Joe Biden was steadfast in his support of Israel’s right to defend itself in Gaza and defeat Hamas as a military threat. But his administration, in which we both served, also made clear that Israel was responsible for exercising care to limit civilian harm and to ensure access to food, medical care, and shelter. As the U.S. ambassador to Israel (Lew) and as the U.S. special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues (Satterfield), we communicated these dual positions in our daily engagements with Israeli leaders at all levels. And we pressed all parties to coordinate so that enough lifesaving supplies reached Gaza, even if inconsistently.\nThere was still too much scarcity and precarity, and for months following the October 2023 attacks on Israel, some commentators labeled the situation in Gaza a famine. But although the results of our work never satisfied us, much less our critics, in reality the efforts we led in the Biden administration to keep Gaza open for humanitarian relief prevented famine. The fact remains that through the first year and a half of relentless war, Gazans did not face mass starvation because humanitarian assistance was reaching them.\nDuring our tenure, the United States deployed officials from multiple agencies that had the tools, leverage, and determination to improve the situation, and we were committed to doing so despite the often adverse circumstances. In March, when the cease-fire broke down, everything changed.\nUnder the terms of the cease-fire, which was struck in the last days of the Biden administration in January 2025, Israel had allowed a surge of supplies into Gaza. But when the cease-fire collapsed, Israel closed all humanitarian access in an effort to pressure Hamas to agree to the terms of a hostage deal. It was the first time it had blocked all aid to Gaza since late October 2023. The total blockade continued for 11 weeks, and during this critical time, the Trump administration stood back as remaining food supplies diminished and suffering increased, until it became clear to the president that the crisis had grown to politically unacceptable levels and was triggering outrage even in the MAGA base.\nThen, when Israel finally did allow a limited amount of aid to enter, it changed the primary food distribution model, mostly bypassing the United Nations and other established humanitarian organizations in favor of a brand-new operation called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Although the UN continued to operate, it experienced significant operational difficulties and restrictions. The nearly 20,000 tons of monthly food aid that got through from March to July was about a third of what the World Food Program deemed necessary. The scenes of acute hunger and potential starvation that have emerged from Gaza in recent weeks reveal a frightening deterioration.\nWhen aid was flowing before the cease-fire, it did not arrive by chance. It came one border crossing and one truck convoy at a time, and it required overcoming political and battlefield challenges every step of the way. As the world watches the crisis unfolding today and demands a solution, it is important to learn from what worked and what did not, and to remember that it falls to all parties to find a solution. The stakes are too high to allow the delivery of critical assistance to be derailed by Israeli political dynamics, obstruction by Hamas or armed Gazan gangs, or infighting among aid providers. And Washington must remember that it uniquely has the tools and leverage to avert an escalating catastrophe.\nUNDER PRESSURE\nAfter the October 7 attacks, the people of Israel were in shock, traumatized both by Hamas’s brutality and by the failure of their government to protect their fellow citizens. Immediately following the attacks, Israel responded forcefully, imposing a complete blockade on Gaza that prevented any humanitarian aid from entering via land routes. The Israeli cabinet decided that, as a matter of policy, there would be no commercial or civilian contact between Israel and Gaza. In those early days, it was common to hear Israelis use the phrase “not a drop of water, not a drop of milk, and not a drop of fuel will go from Israel to Gaza.” In the raw trauma after October 7, this sentiment was understandable but unsustainable with growing needs.\nFrom the beginning, U.S. officials made clear that Israeli leaders needed to find a way for lifesaving supplies to get in. We underscored that doing so was unquestionably a moral obligation. We also argued that it was a strategic necessity, in that it would give Israel the time to plan and accomplish its military mission of eliminating Hamas as a threat while maintaining the support it needed from its allies, in particular the United States.\nOn October 18, 2023, Biden visited Israel to demonstrate U.S. solidarity in the aftermath of the attacks but also to persuade the government to allow trucks to cross into the Gazan city of Rafah from Egypt. He told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his security cabinet privately—and then the Israeli people publicly—that the United States “had Israel’s back” and that Israel had not just a right but also an obligation to ensure that Hamas could never again act as it did on October 7. But Biden also emphasized that the military campaign against Hamas would be complex and warned explicitly that the ability of the United States to support the operation would depend on Israel’s initiating and sustaining an effective “humanitarian campaign.” Without such a campaign, the president stressed, Israel would have neither the time nor the space it needed to accomplish its military goals.\nThe efforts we led in the Biden administration prevented famine in Gaza.\nAt the time, Israel’s wounds were raw, and its focus was on defending against further attacks. Its government needed to work to meet humanitarian needs in Gaza while Hamas kept hostages in captivity and was still showering Israel with rockets. Under any circumstances, it would have taken determined leadership to explain to the public why it was the responsibility of their government to make sure that humanitarian needs were met on the ground in Gaza. But it was even harder given the political dynamics of Israel’s governing coalition. Netanyahu’s coalition includes far-right parties that held what were then fringe views. The goals of the right-wing parties did not stop at defeating Hamas. They believed that Israel should never have disengaged unilaterally from Gaza and removed Israeli civilian settlements in September 2005 and that Israelis should resettle the territory after the war. This was not the position of the government, but far right-wing parties threatened to bring down the coalition if the cabinet made decisions they opposed, including opening routes for humanitarian assistance.\nWhile some on the right opposed humanitarian assistance, others in the Israeli government chafed when we in the administration reminded them that Israel had both a right to defend itself and an obligation and a strategic imperative to ensure that aid could reach Gazans. They took umbrage at the notion that U.S. pressure was needed to persuade them to provide humanitarian assistance. Given the tensions within the government, it took active and consistent U.S. engagement to manage the internal Israeli political dynamics and maintain the adequate flow of assistance. The message to our interlocutors in the Israeli government was in essence, “If the politics are hard, blame the United States.” Allowing Netanyahu to cite a need to satisfy U.S. demands was crucial then—and remains crucial today. Because Biden never wavered in his commitment to Israel’s defense, we had the space to urge its government to meet growing humanitarian needs.\nImmediately after Biden’s visit, Israel agreed to open the Rafah crossing for aid deliveries from Egypt. At first, just 20 trucks a day entered Gaza through Rafah—far from enough to meet humanitarian needs. Part of the challenge was that the Rafah crossing was designed for pedestrians and cars, not large truck convoys, making it inadequate in view of the extent of the demand and the logistical difficulties. But Israel also placed limits on the types of goods and the number of trucks (around 75 per day) permitted to go through Rafah. And to comply with the Israeli government’s decision not to allow any direct movement of assistance into Gaza from Israel, trucks had to be inspected at an Israeli-Egyptian border crossing before proceeding to Rafah—which caused significant delays.\nAN OPENING\nWatching this, we knew we needed to find ways to increase the volume of aid. U.S. cabinet members and other senior officials were making frequent visits to Israel to consult on the unfolding military operations and to repeat the message that more humanitarian aid was necessary. In November 2023, a one-on-one conversation between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Netanyahu scheduled for only a few minutes stretched to over an hour. As Israel’s war cabinet and the rest of the U.S. delegation waited for Blinken and Netanyahu to conclude the meeting, we began informal discussions, including with Yoav Gallant, who was then defense minister and had declared immediately after the October 7 attacks that no aid would move from Israel to Gaza. By this point, however, he understood that Israel had to allow more humanitarian assistance into the enclave—and he had an idea about how to do it.\nGallant walked the two of us through the complex geography of the southern border crossing between Israel and Gaza at Kerem Shalom. He explained that a truck could back up in Israel and be unloaded in Gaza without technically crossing the border, and that observation towers in Israel could provide full visibility to monitor threats against such an operation. Although this plan was a bit nebulous, it offered a road map to increase entry points beyond Rafah—and to chip away at the broad Israeli prohibition against moving aid directly from Israel to Gaza.\nIn early December, with the international support that had swelled for Israel immediately after October 7 beginning to wane, we saw an opening to put the plan into motion. UN Secretary-General António Guterres was prepared to use a very rarely invoked authority, Article 99 of the UN Charter, to force the Security Council to vote on a resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire. Washington needed to show the international community that Israel was taking steps to meet humanitarian needs. The White House and State Department debated whether to have Biden call Netanyahu to demand the opening of Kerem Shalom, but our sense was that the pressure would more likely succeed if it came from within Israel’s own cabinet. We asked Washington to give us a few days to work through the Defense Ministry.\nWe knew we needed to find ways to increase the volume of aid.\nMore than anyone else in government, Defense Ministry officials understood the vital importance of American supply lines and strategic and defensive capabilities to Israel’s war effort. And as he had told us a few weeks earlier, Gallant was prepared to defend the position that opening Kerem Shalom could be reconciled with the official policy of no direct civilian contact between Israel and Gaza. In private, he acknowledged that civilians needed more access to essential items, and he understood the strategic importance of maintaining broad support for Israel, at least in the United States.\nIn a phone call in the middle of the night, one of us (Lew) put it very directly to the defense minister: “You know this is the right thing to do, and in a few days the United States will be the only country in the world prepared to block a UN Security Council resolution that hurts Israel. You need to help us and act now to open Kerem Shalom.” He said he would make that case.\nThe United States vetoed the UN resolution on December 8 on the grounds that it did not condemn the October 7 attack and that an immediate cease-fire would allow Hamas to retain its military power and “only plant the seeds for the next war.” On December 12, the U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, visited Israel with the same message that we had delivered. On December 15, Israel announced it would open the crossing at Kerem Shalom.\nOver the next several months, similar U.S. engagement, typically with Gallant playing a key role, persuaded Israel to open a series of additional crossings into Gaza. Each opening—Gate 96 in March, Erez and Zikim (Erez West) in April and May, and Kissufim in November 2024—required arduous diplomacy, including very blunt messaging to Netanyahu from Biden in April 2024 after an Israeli attack on World Central Kitchen humanitarian workers. Israeli hard-liners resisted every time, among them protesters who blocked aid trucks, which prompted the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to intervene. After each decision to open a crossing, it was a struggle to counter potential violence by far-right groups and overcome logistical snafus and bureaucratic obstacles. And on the other side of each opening were desperate civilians, criminal gangs, and an ever-present Hamas.\nSIDELINING THE SPOILERS\nThroughout this period, it was evident that Hamas wanted to control aid distribution to benefit its own fighters and tighten its grip on Gaza. At first, Israel tolerated this, and for a while it even refrained from attacking Hamas police officers who, in their blue cars, accompanied convoys to prevent violent tribal gangs and criminal elements from interfering with the distribution of aid. Eventually, however, Israel came to see this as allowing Hamas to strengthen its hold on governance, and in January 2024 the IDF began targeting the blue cars. With Hamas sidelined during the delivery process, the criminal gangs and looters came out in full force.\nTo be clear, Hamas did find ways to tax, extort, and to some extent divert aid, including assistance from Egypt handled by the Palestine Red Crescent Society. But until January 20, 2025, neither the IDF nor the UN ever shared evidence with us—or asserted to us privately—that Hamas was physically diverting U.S.-funded goods provided by the World Food Program or international nongovernmental organizations. Furthermore, there was no evidence of substantial Hamas diversion of any major assistance funded by the UN or nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).\nTheft and diversion of UN assistance was primarily the work of criminal gangs, and we engaged with Israel and the UN to take steps to mitigate the risks. Israel’s solution was to turn to private contractors to secure the convoys, until it later concluded that the contractors were assisting the gangs and Hamas. At this point, maintaining orderly movement and distribution inside Gaza became even harder.\nBy February 2024, the situation in northern Gaza prompted Netanyahu to ask Biden to arrange for the U.S. military to build a floating pier to deliver aid directly to Gaza from the sea. The pier would offer quicker access to deliver aid to civilians in and around Gaza City and allow access to both the north and south along more protected routes, in theory avoiding looting and easing the passage of convoys through the IDF-controlled Netzarim Corridor checkpoint. By that point, Biden had been exploring the idea of the pier for weeks, wrestling with both the temporary nature and high cost of a maritime delivery option. He authorized the pier in the conviction that despite these drawbacks, the United States needed to employ all means possible to address the increasingly desperate humanitarian situation. He had another goal as well: Washington agreed to this plan on the condition that the Israelis would also allow the port of Ashdod to receive U.S. wheat deliveries destined for Gaza and that two more land crossings from Israel would open into northern Gaza. (Israel also provided significant construction assistance and perimeter security for the pier and paused some of its military operations to allow the pier to function.)\nRough waters ultimately made it impossible to sustain the pier, which broke apart a number of times and was shut down after less than a month of operation. While it was functioning, however, the pier managed to feed approximately 450,000 people. And even after the pier was removed from service, Israel kept Ashdod and the two northern crossings open. By April 2024, at our urging, it had also opened Ashdod to all humanitarian cargo, not just wheat.\nSuch U.S. efforts saved lives in Gaza. Many of us in the Biden administration asked one essential question every single day: How many trucks got in? This was an imperfect measure, as it did not reveal how the aid got distributed or who received it. But it was a simple, measurable, and important bellwether. Even Biden tracked the number of trucks daily. We knew by December 2023 that if fewer than about 250 trucks entered daily, the distribution system might be overwhelmed once more by desperate Gazans. We believed that Gaza needed closer to 350 or 400. Although not all the trucks were the same—some carried far less food and other aid than others—every truck counted. Every open gate mattered.\nWHAT CHANGED?\nBetween the U.S. presidential election in November 2024 and the transition to a new administration in January 2025, the Biden and Trump teams worked hand in hand to reach a cease-fire and hostage-release agreement. When the deal was done, 33 hostages were freed, and over 600 trucks per day began to enter Gaza. With food reserves building up, the humanitarian situation appeared to improve significantly. And contrary to concerns that Israel might never allow Gazan civilians to return to their homes, hundreds of thousands returned to the northern part of Gaza—a Hamas demand that was key to getting the hostages returned.\nFrom there, the cease-fire agreement was designed to unfold in stages. Further negotiations to release all the hostages in exchange for a permanent cease-fire were meant to begin as the first stage was being implemented. But those end-stage negotiations never came to fruition. And in the meantime, there was a new administration in Washington that was far less involved in the details of aid delivery—and had begun dismantling the architecture of U.S. assistance worldwide.\nIn February, President Donald Trump dropped a rhetorical bomb: he suggested that all of Gaza’s residents be relocated while the United States reconstructed the territory. “The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip,” he declared in a joint press conference with Netanyahu, outlining his vision of a “Riviera of the Middle East.”\nOf course, no one had asked the people of Gaza whether they wanted to leave, or other countries whether they were prepared to absorb two million refugees. At the news conference, Netanyahu seemed startled by Trump’s comments. He avoided embracing or rejecting the goal, instead hailing the president’s “bold vision” on Gaza. Yet it quickly became clear that Trump’s remark had delighted Israelis on the far right and handed them more of a claim of political legitimacy and leverage within the cabinet than they could ever have imagined. In minutes, the fringe idea of forced mass resettlement—pragmatically unattainable, morally unconscionable, and legally unacceptable—had been legitimized by no less an authority than the American president.\nHamas wanted to control aid distribution.\nIsrael halted all entry of humanitarian assistance into Gaza in the first week of March, after the breakdown of cease-fire negotiations. The prime minister declared to the Israeli cabinet and the nation that “no assistance would be allowed to go to Hamas.” This was a pivotal decision. It reflected a genuine concern that aid was being diverted by Hamas—even though the alleged scale of that diversion was not substantiated—but also the premise that depriving Gaza of food would pressure Hamas to release the remaining hostages and surrender its arms. As food reserves diminished, the consequence was a new and unparalleled humanitarian crisis: for the first time, malnutrition showed signs of becoming widespread.\nUnder pressure as photographs started coming out—notably from Trump and the IDF—the Israeli government had to act. In an effort to square the circle within the cabinet between the declaration that “no assistance” would go to Hamas and the demands that humanitarian relief resume, Israel abandoned the system of aid provision that had existed before the cease-fire broke down. Instead, it turned in May to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a new U.S.- and Swiss-based NGO backed by Israel and the United States.\nIn its original conception, which came as part of a negotiation between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, the GHF was meant to operate in a postwar Gaza in which international forces would maintain security, and governance would come from a transitional administration with Palestinian and international participation; aid was to be distributed to civilians directly in secure zones. Instead, the GHF operation started under very different wartime conditions. It established distribution points in a handful of IDF-controlled areas in the south and center of Gaza, giving it, by its own acknowledgment, the ability to distribute just some 20 percent of the total food aid needed by the territory’s population. With growing desperation from civilians and reports of fatalities in crowd control efforts by the surrounding IDF units (as well as private military contractors hired to assist with distribution), the GHF launch has been plagued by problems. Scores of civilians in search of aid have been killed or injured both by stampedes and by live fire from some combination of the IDF, Hamas, and criminal gangs.\nNO SILVER BULLET\nSpeaking last week, Trump acknowledged the inhumanity of the situation and the reality of starvation. But it takes sustained engagement at the highest level, not just a casual remark from the Oval Office or a social media post, to ensure that Israel keeps multiple crossings open so that hundreds of trucks can enter Gaza every day. And as we learned, the massive humanitarian need for assistance can be met only if all parties find a way to work together.\nThe steps needed to right the situation are clear.\nFirst, Israel must not treat humanitarian aid as a coercive means to pressure Hamas. This tactic risks civilian lives in Gaza and subjects Israel to international condemnation and isolation. Israel must keep land crossings open and ensure that its use of force adheres to rules of engagement that protect civilians. This means more training, more accountability for civilian casualties, and better coordination with aid providers.\nSecond, all aid providers and facilitators need to work together. In this fractured, heavily militarized landscape, aid must flow through multiple, imperfect channels. Israel has good reason to want to prevent Hamas from deriving any benefit from international aid. Conversely, UN agencies and most international aid organizations refuse to work with any organization they deem militarized and connected to a party to the conflict, and that includes the GHF. The reality, however, is that the GHF is now the main channel for bringing in food.\nBy its own admission, the GHF cannot be a substitute for the UN and other international agencies or meet the full needs of Gazans. Nor is it designed or staffed to distribute specialized nutrition to the most vulnerable—children, women, and the elderly. At the same time, the established UN model for aid distribution is struggling to reach people, as its convoys are being swarmed and attacked by a combination of desperate civilians, gangs, and Hamas. The UN and the IDF—through sustained operational coordination and deconfliction—must make every possible effort to “flood the zone” in a way that discourages attempts by civilians to “self-distribute” and reduces the incentive for criminal looting. Yet because of the disorder and outright chaos engulfing the convoys, the UN is struggling to reach the most vulnerable in Gaza.\nIsrael must not treat humanitarian aid as a coercive means to pressure Hamas.\nGiven this situation, the UN, the GHF, and other aid providers need to coordinate with one another and with the IDF—even if this requires flexibility on deeply held positions. This means bringing in and distributing assistance to all populations in need throughout Gaza, through all available means. With this as the essential guiding principle, the UN needs to accept security from the IDF, the GHF, or its own contractors. Rather than trying to sideline the GHF, the UN should work with it or at a minimum parallel to it. And the GHF needs to be open to learning from the UN, with its deep knowledge of operating in Gaza and of how professionals structure humanitarian assistance. Fragmentation and institutional bickering will not help the situation. Alleviating the acute suffering of Gazans must come first, even if that means working with or beside actors one does not agree with and in conditions one does not fully control and would not choose.\nThird, Washington needs to lead. In May, Trump played a key role in getting the GHF launched and provided it with some U.S. funding. Israel has in recent days expanded the flow of assistance into Gaza by the GHF and the UN. But without assistance at scale, too little aid is getting to people in need. This cannot be a one-time engagement by the White House. The pressure must be consistent and accompanied by sustained attention from senior U.S. officials. Far too many Gazans have died in this war. Getting aid through, however messily and imperfectly, can help save thousands more who might otherwise perish. But it will take American leadership and coordination to make that happen.\nFinally, and most important, Hamas must free the hostages so this war can end. As recognized by Israel’s military leaders more than a year ago, to have a future free from Hamas after the war ends, there needs to be a plan for non-Hamas governance. Hamas started a war in full knowledge that it was putting its own civilians at risk, and it is now threatening aid providers and recipients. Egypt, Qatar, and other governments with influence must press Hamas and the gangs to free the hostages, lay down their arms, and end their predatory behavior, which is playing a major role in creating mass hunger.\nHumanitarian assistance—not just food but also water, shelter and medical care that meets the needs of all Gazans—can and must get back on track.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "Israel’s Emerging Occupation Consensus", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/israel/israels-emerging-occupation-consensus", "text": "As the Israeli government prepares for the military takeover of Gaza City and, many fear, lay the groundwork for full seizure and occupation of Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stirred anger at home and abroad. Overwhelming evidence that large numbers of Gazans are starving has left Israeli leaders facing worldwide condemnation, the threat of partial arms embargos from allies, as well as growing charges of genocide.\nIn Israel itself, Netanyahu and his cabinet have been under intense criticism for months from former military and intelligence chiefs, opposition leaders, and intellectuals, as well as military reservists and tens of thousands of public protesters. At the heart of the rift between the Israeli people and their government are the 50 hostages still held by Hamas, of which around 20 are believed to be still alive. Yet on August 8, the Israeli cabinet decided to ramp up the war, and the new plans will de facto advance a full occupation of Gaza with the possible objective of long-term military rule of Gaza, as some cabinet members have advocated. The government insists that by expanding military operations, it will save the hostages. But Israelis are not convinced.\nFollowing the announcement, a survey by Kan, the Israeli public broadcaster, found that only 28 percent support the new plan. The family members of hostages believe it will spell the death of their loved ones. In direct contrast to the government’s determination to prolong and expand operations, a consistent and growing majority—more than 70 percent in some recent surveys—supports a hostage deal and an end to the war as soon as possible. “Now!” and “There’s no time!” have been core slogans advocating such a deal ever since the initial weeks following Hamas’s October 7 attack. Since the new Gaza plan was announced, demonstrations have swelled, and the hostage families have called for a general strike.\nAll of which has contributed to the perception that the country has been hijacked by a fanatical religious far-right minority—one that has gained extraordinary leverage and influence by helping Netanyahu cling to power despite his legal predicaments. Seemingly bearing out the image that the country has been captured by extremists, polls have consistently found that, if new elections were held today, Israelis would oust the current leadership. In other words, if only the government were more aligned with public opinion, the country would be taken in a decidedly different direction.\nBut the assumption that a post-Netanyahu Israel can chart a new course misses the extent to which Israelis concur with the government on many deeper, longer-term issues. Based on a number of surveys over the years and throughout the current war, both the anti-Netanyahu public and the main opposition parties differ little from the current leadership on the future status of Palestinians, the inevitability of ongoing Israeli occupation in general, and the acceptability of denying self-determination, or alternately, democracy and civil rights to Palestinians in the territories, among other issues. Polls show that, like their current leaders, the large majority of Israeli Jews do not empathize with the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza, which Israeli television and mainstream newspapers barely cover. Many believe civilian deaths and harms are the fault of Hamas and are exaggerated or even fabricated, as government and Israeli commentators constantly claim.\nThis underlying reality points to some hard truths. Removing Netanyahu from power might well help bring an end to the unfolding disaster in Gaza and could even cause the religious right to relinquish its grip on Israeli politics. But it is unlikely to fundamentally reorient Israeli policies toward the Palestinians or to present a true alternative to the decades-old policies of expanding Israeli control and suppressing Palestinian self-determination. These strategies, together with Palestinian spoilers, have fueled the broader conflict all these years and ruined Israel’s prospects for being a democracy, and they will drive future violent escalations for years to come. No matter how much politicians and commentators in the United States—or the Israeli opposition for that matter—focus on Netanyahu, the fact is that when it comes to Israeli intransigence regarding Palestinians, the prime minister alone is not the problem. The problem is Israeli society, politics, and culture as it has evolved over decades.\nISRAEL AGAINST ITS LEADERS\nFor all his vaunted staying power, Netanyahu’s political future in Israel is uncertain. As of now, the prime minister could well lose the next elections, which are scheduled for late October 2026. Since July, when two ultra-Orthodox religious parties abandoned the ruling coalition, he has presided over a precarious minority government. If it collapses, elections would most likely be held in early 2026.\nOpposition to the prime minister is deeply entrenched. Well before the October 7 attacks, the government came under extraordinary criticism for its judicial overhaul, which many saw as a move to consolidate Netanyahu’s grip on power, weaken his corruption indictments, and undermine Israeli democracy while empowering theocratic forces in society. Through much of the nine months preceding the attacks, hundreds of thousands of Israelis mounted weekly demonstrations against the government, and reservists threatened to refuse to show up for duty. According to the Israel Democracy Institute, in early 2023, when the government first announced the reforms, between 58 and 66 percent of Israelis rejected them, numbers that have held broadly steady ever since, although the pace and type of reforms have changed during the war. Despite these trends, the government has pushed ahead, politicizing judicial appointments and dismissing the attorney general.\nSince October 7, 2023, public grievances have intensified. In contrast to those of most wartime governments, the poll ratings of Netanyahu’s ruling coalition did not rise but plunged to a low point, where they remained for the first six months of the war—numbers that would have given Netanyahu’s Likud Party and its coalition partners just 41 to 46 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, had elections been held then. Surveys have consistently shown that two-thirds or more of the public want Netanyahu to resign, either immediately or when the war ends. According to current polling, if the election were held now, the parties that constituted Netanyahu’s original coalition would still be unable to win a majority in the 120-member Knesset. (With the exception of polls that are affiliated with the far right, for more than a year, nearly all credible Israeli opinion surveys have shown the coalition parties winning at least ten seats fewer than the 64 they won in the 2022 elections.) Not even the heady 12-day war with Iran in June, which was widely supported by the Israeli public, managed to improve the coalition’s popularity.\nThe reasons for widespread disaffection with the government are clear. Above all is the government’s serial refusal to prioritize the hostages Hamas is holding by reaching a deal to bring the remaining hostages home. Many Israelis believed the government would have avoided the first such deal in November 2023 if not for public pressure, and since early 2024, a majority of them have regularly supported a deal to bring home those that remain. From the start of the two-month cease-fire in early 2025, over 70 percent supported the continuation of that cease-fire to allow further hostage returns, according to surveys by the Israel Democracy Institute. By June, more than three-quarters of Israelis said they supported releasing all remaining hostages in return for a full end of the war, according to a survey by Agam Labs, affiliated with Hebrew University.\nFor all his vaunted staying power, Netanyahu’s political future is uncertain.\nLarge majorities of Israelis are also incensed by the government’s evasion of responsibility for October 7. In a survey I conducted in late November 2024 for Zulat, a liberal think tank, 69 percent said that an independent state commission should be established to investigate the security failings surrounding the attack, with another 27 percent supporting a government-appointed commission to do so. These numbers have only grown: In March, a survey for Israel’s found that 75 percent of Israelis supported an independent commission. But after nearly two years of war, the government has not established any commission at all.\nYet another complaint against the government concerns ultra-Orthodox Jews’ exemption from Israel Defense Forces conscription. A sweeping majority of Jewish Israelis want to end this historic practice, yet instead of doing that, the government has mooted a law that would require limited and incremental draft targets for the ultra-Orthodox—which most Israelis view as a “draft-evasion law” designed to establish permanent and widespread exemption for most members of this group. In July, the Institute for National Security Studies found that 73 percent of Jewish Israelis believe that such a law would harm the security of the state. For the moment, the government has not enacted the law, although it has been under intense pressure to do so by the religious erstwhile coalition partners. The delay caused two ultra-Orthodox parties to quit the coalition in July, and they could theoretically vote with the opposition if there is a motion to disband the Knesset in the coming months. As a result, the fate of the country is now in the hands of ultra-Orthodox parties who represent a mere 14 percent of the Israeli population, according to the Israel Democracy Institute.\nFor much of the public, the avoidance of a hostage deal with Hamas, the ultra-Orthodox exemption, and the lack of accountability for failing to prevent the October 7 attacks and the ongoing assault on the Israeli judiciary, are evidence of the coalition’s moral and political decay. Many also see these issues as a continuation of the illiberal, theocratic, and authoritarian or corrupt tendencies that drove the 2023 judicial overhaul, now supercharged by the wartime opportunity to advance a messianic agenda of permanent occupation, de facto annexation in the West Bank, and resettlement of Gaza. Given the level of public grievance, it is tempting to assume that a post-Netanyahu leadership would mark a repudiation of the right-wing fundamentalism that has prolonged the war in Gaza, killing tens of thousands of civilians in Gaza, creating an appalling starvation crisis, and done untold harm to Israel’s global reputation. Yet such assumptions cling to an idealized view of Israeli democracy that misses a larger truth about the Israeli electorate.\nEXTREME GOES MAINSTREAM\nNotwithstanding their growing distaste for the Netanyahu government, mainstream Israelis do not significantly diverge from the prime minister and his far-right cabinet on many underlying and essential longer-term issues. This convergence is no accident: Netanyahu has long been adept at capturing underlying public sentiment, and very often molding and manipulating it. This is particularly the case on issues related to Israel’s self-image as a country under constant existential threats, whether from Palestinian terror, Iran, global anti-Semitism, or its own internal enemies such as the left wing or Arab citizens of Israel.\nConsider the two-state solution. The prime minister is well aware that the majority of Israelis oppose this concept. In June, Tel Aviv University’s Peace Index Survey found that just one-third of all Israelis supported establishing a Palestinian state next to Israel. Among Jewish Israelis, the figure is even smaller, with less than one-quarter supporting the idea. Thus, when Netanyahu insists that he will resist international efforts to advance a Palestinian state, or any real form of Palestinian national self-determination, he is reflecting the attitudes of a firm majority of Jewish voters. Hardly any of Israel’s mainstream opposition leaders risk contradicting him. Israeli security hawks such as Benny Gantz, the Israeli general who was considered a moderate member of Netanyahu’s “war cabinet” during the first eight months of the war, are highly agnostic about Palestinian statehood; leaders of the secular right, such as Avigdor Lieberman, openly oppose it. Former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who polls show as a front-runner among opposition candidates, has in the past been to the right of Netanyahu and has always opposed a two-state solution.\nIsrael’s centrist parties are little different. Even Israel’s consolidated Zionist left-wing party, the Democrats, led by Yair Golan, a major general and a former IDF deputy chief of staff, mostly avoid discussing a Palestinian state or the two-state solution. Yair Lapid, the official head of Israel’s opposition and leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, has similarly mostly avoided the issue since the war started, although he was the last Israeli prime minister to support a two-state solution publicly during his own brief term in late 2022. Only the leaders of Arab parties speak freely in support of Palestinian statehood. One such leader, Ayman Odeh, has already announced he will not run again—but the Knesset still sought to impeach him recently over what right-wingers insisted was a distasteful social media post in which he expressed sympathy for Palestinian prisoners alongside Israeli hostages, which they suggested drew a moral equivalence. Six opposition members voted together with the government, although the impeachment failed to garner enough votes.\nA strong majority of Israeli Jews think Palestinian casualties are justified.\nIn part, the growing Israeli dismissal of a two-state solution reflects the hard-line belligerence toward Palestinians that has emerged since October 7. But this has built on existing mutually hostile, negative attitudes, as demonstrated by joint Israeli-Palestinian surveys I conducted with the Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki well before the war. Undeniably, the war has unleashed further extreme sentiment. Israeli ministers have regularly called for besieging, starving, flattening, and possibly dropping nuclear bombs on Gaza, and Israeli mainstream media have rarely shown or discussed the vast human suffering unfolding there, allowing Israelis to opt out of such images if they choose—although this information is readily available through critical Israeli media, international networks, and social media.\nIn the Peace Index survey of January 2024, by which point more than 25,000 Palestinians in Gaza had been killed, 88 percent of Jewish Israelis said that the Palestinian casualties (without specifying civilians or combatants) were justified to achieve Israel’s war aims. By July 2025, the number killed had risen to 60,000, including many thousands of young children, yet the same Peace Index series found that 72 percent, still a strong majority of Israeli Jews, think the casualties are justified. In the July survey, nearly the same portion, 74 percent of Jewish Israelis, support “voluntary emigration” of Gazans, and a majority of Jewish respondents support “forced evacuation.” (Arab citizens of Israel show such minuscule support for these policies that the total Israeli average is lower but misleading.)\nEven some of the government’s harshest proposals for Palestinians in Gaza have drawn significant public support. In May, for example, the Penn State researcher Tamir Sorek published a poll showing that 82 percent of Israeli Jews would support the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza. Although some questioned the poll’s methodology or findings, shortly afterward, the Israel Democracy Institute found in its monthly survey that 77 percent of Israeli Jews thought Israel should not concern itself with Palestinian civilian suffering in Gaza, and 63 percent opposed humanitarian aid there. Moreover, in the institute’s July survey, 79 percent were not personally troubled by “reports of famine and suffering among the Palestinian population in Gaza.” A survey commissioned at the end of July by the Israeli newspaper Maariv found that 47 percent of Israeli Jews believe starvation in Gaza is a Hamas lie. In the July Peace Index, over 60 percent of the Jewish population supported Defense Minister Israel Katz’s plan to build a camp to concentrate Palestinians near Rafah, where they would be allowed to leave only for another country.\nIsraeli attitudes toward the government’s latest plan for a full military occupation of Gaza have not crystallized yet. Polls have generally shown that a substantial minority—but not a majority—of Jewish Israelis now support full annexation of “the occupied territories.” According to the Peace Index survey in July, 40 percent of Israeli Jews support annexation. The same survey also found that 46 percent of Israeli Jews now supported building Jewish settlements in Gaza.\nTHE AUTOCRATIC FUTURE\nThe hardening of views about Palestinians also reflects longer-term trends in Israeli society. As a matter of political orientation, a decisive majority—60 percent—of Jewish Israelis now identify as right wing, compared with 12 percent who consider themselves left and just over 25 percent who say they are in the center, according to a June survey by the Israel Democracy Institute. But these trends did not begin with October 7. Already in the run-up to the 2022 election, hardly anyone—candidates or most of the Jewish Israeli public—would talk about the Palestinians or about Israel’s nearly six-decade occupation regime. This included Israel’s control of Gaza’s borders, airspace, territorial waters, and (along with Egypt) all traffic in and out of the territory—what the International Committee of the Red Cross classified as an ongoing occupation even before October 7.\nParadoxically, public acceptance of long-term military rule over a large portion of the Palestinian population has coincided with growing concern about Israeli democracy. Thus, for the huge masses of Israelis who shouted “Democracy!” on Saturday nights throughout 2023 to protest Netanyahu’s judicial overhaul, the gravest threat to Israeli democracy—the military rule over a huge disenfranchised Palestinian population—was ignored. At the peak of the protests, in the summer of 2023, a survey I conducted for an umbrella organization of peace groups, the Alliance for Middle East Peace, funded by the U.S. Institute of Peace, found that among Jewish Israelis between the ages of 15 and 21, 88 percent believed Israel “can be a democratic state even though it controls the West Bank and Gaza (de facto), where Palestinians cannot vote in Israeli elections.” In other words, the rising generation of young Jewish Israelis—and this was before October 7—overwhelmingly took it for granted that millions of Palestinians could be deprived of basic rights indefinitely without compromising Israel’s democratic foundations.\nDuring the 2023 protests, Israelis also failed to connect the judicial overhaul with the government’s annexationist aims. Even as the protests were unfolding, extremist, Jewish supremacist political leaders such as Israel’s current minister of national security, Itamar Ben Gvir, were transforming the police and security forces to tolerate or even condone settler violence as a means of expanding Jewish control over occupied territory. The government has also sought to weaken the supreme court or attorney general, which pose potential obstacles to laws designed to facilitate land grabs and seizure of Palestinian property. In August, the Netanyahu government made the unprecedented decision to fire the attorney general, a move that the Israeli Supreme Court has temporarily blocked, leaving the country in a crisis of governing authority.\nEven the harshest proposals for Gaza have drawn significant public support.\nBy ignoring the larger reality of Israel’s occupation, the main opposition parties have abetted the further erosion of the country’s democratic institutions. Consider the multiparty government that was briefly in power between 2021 and late 2022, without Netanyahu or the current coalition parties. It sought to make tiny adjustments designed to ease quality-of-life strains among Palestinians yet made no substantive move toward Palestinian self-determination, save for a prominent speech in September 2022 at the United Nations by Lapid, then prime minister, supporting a two-state solution, just ahead of fresh elections. Golan, the leader of the left-wing Democrats, prefers to advocate for what he refers to as “separation”—meaning some sort of partition between Israelis and Palestinians—but he barely discusses the issue unless asked.\nSince October 7, a growing political consensus has emerged in Israel around the view that military might is the exclusive basis for Israel’s survival. There were no dissenting voices during Israel’s war with Iran in June, only blanket support. Opposition leaders rarely if ever speak against the IDF’s ongoing presence and strikes in Lebanon, or its bombing campaign against the new regime in Syria, either; at best offering slogans about the need for a “diplomatic” component to complement Israel’s significant military achievements against regional enemies such as Iran and Hezbollah. And the latest political figure to excite Israelis opposed to Netanyahu is yet another former IDF chief of staff, Gadi Eisenkot. To the extent that opposition politicians or military experts criticize the government over its Gaza policy, they argue that the government lacks a clear strategy or has failed to cultivate an alternative governing force to Hamas—but not in the context of any long-ranging political solution to the conflict.\nIf Netanyahu loses the next elections, his downfall would bring a wave of relief among many Israelis at home and abroad for removing the uncouth populists and religious fundamentalists who openly broadcast their intentions to destroy and starve the population of Gaza and annex the territory. But a new government is unlikely to make much more progress than its predecessor on a durable, just, or feasible peace with Palestinians—or to address the underlying dynamics of occupation that have led to so much conflict in the first place. Instead, the situation will continue to fuel expansionist dreams in Israel and probably regular, worsening military escalations. If neither the Israeli public nor the world demands a change, the opposition parties seem unlikely to offer either the vision or the leadership to put Israel on a path toward peace, democracy, or even fundamental, long-term security.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "After the Trade War", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/after-trade-war-michael-froman", "text": "The global trading system as we have known it is dead. The World Trade Organization has effectively ceased to function, as it fails to negotiate, monitor, or enforce member commitments. Fundamental principles such as “most favored nation” status, or MFN, which requires WTO members to treat one another equally except when they have negotiated free-trade agreements, are being jettisoned as Washington threatens or imposes tariffs ranging from ten to more than 50 percent on dozens of countries. Both the “America first” trade strategy and China’s analogous “dual circulation” and Made in China 2025 strategies reflect a flagrant disregard for any semblance of a rules-based system and a clear preference for a power-based system to take its place. Even if pieces of the old order manage to survive, the damage is done: there is no going back.\nMany will celebrate the end of an era. Indeed, although U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs and disregard for past agreements have put the final nails in the coffin, the turn against global trade has been embraced by both Democrats and Republicans in Washington over the past several years. But before critics revel in the death of the rules-based trading system, they should consider the costs and tradeoffs that come with its dismantlement—and think carefully about the elements that should be rebuilt, even if in altered forms, to avert considerably worse outcomes for the United States and the global economy.\nIf Washington continues on its current course—defined by unilateralism, transactionalism, and mercantilism—the consequences will be grim, especially as Beijing continues on its own damaging course of subsidized excess capacity, predatory export policies, and economic coercion. The risk of the United States and China playing by their own rules, with power the only real constraint, is contagion: if the two largest economies in the world operate outside the rules-based system, other countries will increasingly do the same, leading to rising uncertainty, drags on productivity, and lower overall growth.\nYet clinging to the old system and pining for its restoration would be deluded and futile. Nostalgia is not a strategy; nor is hope. Looking beyond the existing structures does not mean simply accepting a Hobbesian state of nature. The challenge is to create a system of rules outside the rules-based system of old.\nThat will require starting over. The best option for moving forward is to craft a system made up of coalitions of the like-minded, which together would constitute a network of open plurilateral relationships—smaller and more flexible than the multilateral trading system. Some coalitions would be mechanisms for trade integration and liberalization. Others might serve to secure supply chains or even to restrict trade in the service of national security. Some countries would be members of multiple coalitions with varied purposes, and coalitions would likely have overlapping memberships and variable geometry. From a purely economic point of view, this system would be suboptimal and less efficient than the global trading system was. But it might well be the most politically sustainable outcome that could—crucially—prevent unilateralism from spinning out of control. It would, in short, allow for a global economy shaped by rules even without a global rules-based system.\nPRESENT AT THE DESTRUCTION\nThe global trading system developed as one part of the multilateral economic structure that the United States led in building, starting during World War II and continuing into the early years of this century. Along with institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Washington established first the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade—the GATT, which laid out a set of rules, such as MFN, and created a process by which countries negotiated market-opening commitments—and then, in 1995, the WTO. The 1994 Uruguay Round agreement, which established the WTO, introduced a range of new trade disciplines and a binding dispute-settlement procedure, marking a major step forward in strengthening the multilateral rules-based system. At its founding, the WTO had 76 member countries; today, it has more than 160, which account for 98 percent of global trade.\nIn the wake of the Cold War, U.S. policymakers hoped that the rules-based trading system that had taken shape in much of the noncommunist world in the preceding decades would expand to encompass former U.S. adversaries, such as Russia, and emerging markets, such as China. The rules would enhance stability, promote openness and integration, and facilitate the peaceful resolution of economic disputes, to the United States’ economic and strategic benefit. Yet even before this system was fully in place, opposition to it emerged, beginning in the early 1990s with the fierce debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The first WTO ministerial meeting held in the United States, in Seattle in 1999, was met with massive, headline-grabbing protests.\nTrade policy has gotten both more credit and more blame than it deserves in the economic debates of recent decades. Critics of the system tend to conflate the effects of globalization with those of trade policy. Globalization itself had less to do with trade agreements than with technology—particularly the invention of the shipping container and the spread of broadband. From the 1960s on, containerization drastically reduced the cost of shipping goods by sea and land, and there were improvements in the efficiency of air freight, as well. A 2023 National Bureau of Economic Research working paper by Sharat Ganapati and Woan Foong Wong found that from 1970 to 2014, the cost of transporting goods by weight fell between 33 and 39 percent and the cost of transporting goods by value fell between 48 and 62 percent. All of this made the development of global supply chains for goods increasingly attractive. The same was true for trade in services with the spread of computers and Internet access. Seamless connectivity meant that everything from customer and back-office processing to coding and data analytics could be done almost anywhere on earth.\nThe decline in U.S. manufacturing employment—one of the primary harms in the United States attributed to trade—also flowed mainly from technological change. Researchers at Ball State University have calculated that “almost 88 percent of job losses in manufacturing [between 2000 and 2010] can be attributable to productivity growth, and the long-term changes to manufacturing employment are mostly linked to the productivity of American factories.” Trade, they found, accounted for just 13.4 percent of job loss.\nIndeed, that decline in manufacturing employment, which occurred across advanced industrialized countries, started well before Washington signed any major trade agreements. The percentage of U.S. employment in manufacturing shrank by around two to five points per decade from the 1970s through the first decade of this century, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Germany, broadly considered a manufacturing powerhouse, experienced a similar decline. China’s emergence as the manufacturing floor for the global economy accelerated this trend, but it did not cause it entirely on its own. In developed economies with robust manufacturing sectors, the secular decline of manufacturing employment long predates the era of peak globalization.\nTHE CHINA RECKONING\nStill, a key driver of today’s wariness of trade is that the rules of the rules-based system did not sufficiently anticipate the challenge of China. The emergence of China as an export-driven economic powerhouse resulted in what has become known as the “China shock”—the rapid closure of factories in particular communities in the United States.\nIt is true that the multilateral trading system suffered from design flaws that proved to be particularly salient with the rise of China—and consequently planted the seeds of the system’s demise. These included the weakness of certain restrictions on state subsidization and the nonmarket behavior of state-owned enterprises, as well as the protection of intellectual property rights; the difficulty of graduating members from developing-country status, which allowed them more lenient treatment; and a consensus, one-country-veto decision-making process that made reform all but impossible. At the time of China’s accession to the WTO, in 2001, there was reason to believe that Beijing was on an irreversible path toward market reform and liberalization. Such hopes rested not just on the rhetoric of China’s leaders at the time but also on the painful actions they took to restructure significant portions of the economy. Yet hopes were dashed as reform stalled under President Hu Jintao and then in some ways went into reverse under President Xi Jinping.\nWTO rules on intellectual property, subsidies, and state-owned enterprises proved insufficient in the face of the emergence and integration of a China that reformed its economic approach less than expected. And the challenge was not just that China played by its own set of rules; it was also the problem of scale. China’s surplus of manufactured goods—which approached $1 trillion last year—far exceeds those of earlier manufacturing giants, such as Germany and Japan. By the UN Industrial Development Organization’s estimate, China is well on its way to producing 45 percent of global industrial output by the end of the decade.\nSuch industrial overcapacity, sustained by domestic preferences, state-directed subsidies, and market protections, bears a considerable share of the blame for the current situation. As China’s economic strategy increasingly challenged the integrity of a trading system designed to promote integration and interdependence, Washington grew skeptical of the system itself. In 2015, the Obama administration called it quits on the Doha Round of global trade negotiations, concerned that the resulting agreement would have locked in preferential treatment for China at the expense of the United States and the rest of the world. In his first term, Trump showed broad disregard for the multilateral system, preferring to revert to the pre-WTO period in which the United States, as the largest economy in the world, wielded its power unilaterally. And the Biden administration did nothing meaningful to reform the WTO.\nToday, the three major functions of the WTO have ground to a halt. As a negotiating forum, it has in recent years managed to conclude only marginal multilateral agreements, such as one on trade facilitation that expedites the entry of goods at customs. As a body for monitoring members’ trade practices, it has had no recourse when large economies simply ignore their obligations to report policies. And as a dispute-settlement organization, it has been hobbled by disagreements over the mandate and functioning of its appellate body. In response to such disagreements, Washington, across several administrations, objected first to the reappointment of certain members of the body and ultimately to the appointment of any new members, effectively preventing any meaningful effort to settle disputes.\nLOSSES AND GAINS\nSelf-flagellation about the failures of the trading system has practically become the price of entry to discussions about the global economy’s future. The standard account of those has become the starting point for a supposed “new Washington consensus.” Yet those failures should be weighed against the benefits, for it is all too easy to take the international economic system and the institutions that maintain it for granted.\nFor one thing, the global trading system has played a central role in lifting as many as a billion people out of poverty. The World Bank has concluded that “trade has been a powerful driver of economic development and poverty reduction.” Between 1990 and 2017, global GDP nearly tripled, developing countries’ share of exports increased from 16 to 30 percent, and global poverty plummeted from 36 to nine percent.\nAnother common fallacy in today’s debate about trade is that it has benefited only other countries, not the United States. The clearest benefit has been for American consumers, by giving them access to more, and more varied, goods at lower prices. Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis found that a ten percent reduction in U.S. import costs brings welfare gains to both high- and low-income households. The greatest benefits, however, go to low-income households, with welfare gains of the poorest households 4.5 times as high as those of the richest. The economist Michael Waugh, who wrote the report, noted that “in layman’s terms, a dollar price reduction is of higher value to the poor than the rich.”\nTrade agreements also made it easier to export U.S.-made products and services by eliminating both tariff and nontariff barriers in other markets (which, as Trump himself has noted, have generally been higher than barriers in the U.S. market). They thereby reduced the impetus to move production abroad to serve those markets, where nearly all global consumers live, and supported jobs that on average pay more than nonexport-related jobs in the United States. Since the inception of the WTO, exports of goods have grown more than 150 percent, adjusted for inflation, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. (Imports grew more than 250 percent adjusted for inflation over this period.) A U.S. Census Bureau report found, based on data from 1992 to 2019, that firms engaged in trade “exhibit higher net job creation rates than non-traders controlling for firm size, age, and sector.” In an analysis for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Gary Hufbauer and Megan Hogan calculated that U.S. GDP in 2022 would have been $2.6 trillion lower without gains from post–World War II trade—averaging to gains of $19,500 per American household.\nTrade policy has also worked to level the playing field for American workers by pressing other countries to adopt better environmental, labor, intellectual property, regulatory, and anticorruption practices. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, for example, would have not only opened markets long closed to U.S. products, such as Japan, but also introduced enforceable standards on labor rights, environmental protection, and subsidization of state-owned enterprises in emerging markets, such as Malaysia and Vietnam—key ingredients of “fair trade.” In effect, the TPP dangled a reduction of already low U.S. tariffs as an incentive to get other countries to adopt policies consistent with U.S. interests and values while creating a U.S.-led alternative to Chinese economic power. (Before the first Trump administration, U.S. tariffs were relatively low, with the average applied tariff around three percent and significant restrictions in place in few sectors, such as shoes, clothing, sugar, dairy, and trucks.)\nYet such arguments have always been a tough sell politically, since the benefits of trade liberalization are broadly shared but largely invisible. No one walks out of a Walmart and exclaims, “Thank goodness for the WTO!” Meanwhile, the costs of trade are acutely felt by a small number of workers in specific industries. Globalization could be blamed for introducing competition from other countries with lower labor costs, putting downward pressure on manufacturing wages in the United States and creating incentives to move production abroad.\nThe China shock was an especially dramatic demonstration of this dynamic—less because of its overall scale than because of how concentrated its losses were in particular communities. The economists David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson concluded that between 1999 and 2011, Chinese imports resulted in the loss of some two million jobs, including one million manufacturing jobs. That loss is relatively modest in the context of the overall U.S. economy: every year, some 50 million American workers experience “job separations,” including resignations and layoffs. Yet these losses were geographically concentrated, resulting in the devastation of individual communities heavily reliant on industries that could not withstand a flood of Chinese imports, with the effects of closures spilling over into the rest of the local economy. Although “creative destruction” might have worked in aggregate, it meant little to specific towns or cities that had no way to replace gutted industries with new ones on a relevant timeline. And there was little understanding of the need for domestic policies, such as effective worker transition assistance, lifelong learning and upskilling programs, and place-based economic development strategies, that aggressively addressed the localized effects of globalization—a gap that has yet to be adequately addressed.\nHOW TRADE WARS END\nFor years now, Washington’s response to the shortcomings of the global trading system has been ad hoc at best. The first Trump administration imposed broad tariffs on China and targeted ones on allies and partners. It also negotiated what was essentially a purchase and sale agreement, rather than a trade agreement, with China, requiring it to buy more commodities and other products from the United States (which China did not in the end fulfill).\nThe Biden administration kept most of the Trump tariffs in place and added a few more. Despite questioning both the economic and national security value of tariffs imposed on Chinese products such as footwear and apparel, the administration did not want to “reward” Beijing by reducing them. It also innovated the use of export controls, foreign investment restrictions, and industrial policy. Although such measures were focused on strategic industries such as semiconductors and electric vehicles, administration officials did not fully develop a clear framework, with guardrails and limiting principles, to prevent the list of products and technologies essential to national security from growing indefinitely and evolving over time into a policy of simple protectionism. Initiatives such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity and the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity aimed to draw countries and their supply chains closer to the United States, but without the possibility of market access—deemed too politically sensitive—the impact was marginal.\nStill, the Biden administration called for reform of the WTO, rather than for its destruction, and in most ways acted according to the principles of the rules-based system. The second Trump administration appears to have a different goal in mind: nothing less than the dismantling of the global trading system, rooted in the president’s strong preference for unilateral action and belief that bilateral trade deficits are an existential threat. On April 2, his so-called Liberation Day, Trump declared a national emergency and announced “reciprocal” tariffs of up to 50 percent on scores of countries. Since then, he has repeatedly moved the goalposts for agreements while also threatening tariffs as a cudgel on nontrade issues, such as migration, fentanyl, the war in Ukraine, and even the judicial system in Brazil. And he has sought to impose “deals” unilaterally when negotiations have run aground.\nThe risk of the United States and China playing by their own rules is contagion.\nWherever tariff levels precisely land, the current trade wars are almost certain to end with significantly higher barriers to trade. These will impose both costs on American consumers and challenges to American businesses. More than half of U.S. imports today are intermediate goods—inputs into the production of final goods. Accordingly, more expensive or less accessible inputs will make U.S. products less competitive, as was well documented after Trump’s first term. In 2018, Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel and a ten percent tariff on aluminum. “Tariffs on steel may have led to an increase of roughly 1,000 jobs in steel production,” the economists Kadee Russ and Lydia Cox later concluded. “However, increased costs of inputs facing U.S. firms relative to foreign rivals due to the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum likely have resulted in 75,000 fewer manufacturing jobs in firms where steel or aluminum are an input into production.” The Council on Foreign Relations’ Benn Steil and Elisabeth Harding calculated that productivity, or output per hour, in the U.S. steel industry has dropped by 32 percent since 2017. If the Trump administration’s goal is to create more manufacturing jobs, its approach is likely to have exactly the opposite effect.\nThen there is the cost of retaliation and imitation, as other governments respond and follow the U.S. example by imposing tariffs and restrictions of their own. If countries retaliate, it will harm U.S. exports, including agriculture. Imitation might also involve radically expanding the use of the emergency and national security justifications for weaponizing trade, as the United States has. The U.S. position has long been that no one else could tell the United States what was necessary for its national security. But until recently, Washington rarely invoked the national security justification. Trump has expanded the use of this tool to impose restrictions on steel, aluminum, and automobiles, including from close allies. Other countries have since followed suit. In 2024, a record 95 “Technical Barriers to Trade” regulations at the WTO cited national security concerns, applied to everything from cocoa beans to alcoholic beverages to animal feed.\nExacerbating all these costs is the uncertainty that results from Trump’s approach. Consumers, companies, and investors tend to sit on the sidelines when they are unsure about the general economic outlook and the specific tariffs or other trade measures they might face. The potential impact of tariffs on reducing growth and even triggering a recession could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nThe United States thus finds itself the subject of a grand experiment in which long-standing assumptions about economics and global trade are being questioned, with significant near-term costs and uncertain long-term benefits. The Trump administration has, in effect, turned the political economy of trade on its head. The costs of its policies are likely to be highly visible and felt immediately by most Americans, while the promised benefits, to the extent they come, are likely to be enjoyed by comparably few workers several years in the future. It will soon become clear if the public is willing to accept near-term sacrifice for the sake of Trump’s vision for reindustrializing the U.S. economy. But no matter how fierce the eventual political reaction, there is no going back to the trading system that existed before.\nCENTRIFUGAL FORCES\nGiven the experience of the first half of the twentieth century in trade and beyond, it would seem obvious that international cooperation achieves better outcomes than the raw exercise of unconstrained power. Yet today’s trade policy represents a return to a form of power politics in which might makes right. The United States is acting unilaterally because, as the largest economy and consumer market in the world, it can. And China, lip service to multilateralism notwithstanding, is increasingly doing the same.\nContagion could follow, spurring cycles of unilateralism and transactionalism that could easily spin out of control. Some countries might follow the current U.S. example and explicitly reject the rules-based system. Others might follow China’s example and celebrate the system in word while undermining it in deed. Either way, the proliferating barriers to trade will reduce growth and damage productivity. Gutted rules will create uncertainty and friction, which could lead to instability and conflict.\nOver time, the global economy could come to resemble the pre–World War II system, which was marked by the frequent use of trade as a weapon. For dominant economies, the short-term benefits of this raw use of power and disregard for constraints might appear to balance out the costs, but over the longer term, there are likely to be unintended consequences. Meanwhile, smaller and poorer countries will find themselves with insufficient market power to use tariffs and other trade restrictions in the same way.\nOther governments may at first strive to maintain the old order, no matter what the United States and China do, well aware that an abandonment of the system altogether would mean a return to a beggar-thy-neighbor world. For some countries, this effort reflects an ideological commitment to the multilateral rules-based system. The entire European project, for example, is rooted in the notion of rules and regulatory-based integration, making it difficult for the European Union to pursue an entirely unilateralist strategy. Developing countries, meanwhile, lack the power and leverage to influence major trading partners and so have relied on the WTO and the dispute-resolution system to level the playing field.\nThere is thus likely to be a caucus of countries that continue to extol the virtues of the multilateral rules-based system, hoping that ultimately the United States will return to that system and China will modify its economic strategy to comply with it. This effort would play out in much the same way as the climate change regime has, with some countries coming together around a set of rules while many of the most important players choose their own paths instead. And as in the case of climate change, this caucus of countries will likely be frustrated.\nCOALITIONS OF THE WILLING\nIf an anarchical trade system is undesirable, but a return to the status quo ante is impossible, that leaves one clear task: developing a new system of rules even as the global economy moves away from a fully multilateral rules-based system. The most viable option is to build a new system around open plurilateralism: coalitions of countries that share interests in specific areas and come together to adopt high standards on certain issues, and then remain open to other countries that share similar interests and are prepared to implement those standards.\nFor some countries, these coalitions could focus on trade liberalization, based on a shared willingness to provide market access to one another, in whole or in part, in order to further integration and economic efficiency. For others, coalitions could be avenues for pursuing regulatory harmonization or taking on new issues, such as AI, even if in an informal and nonbinding manner, similar to the role of the Financial Stability Board, an international body formed after the 2008 financial crisis that coordinates recommendations for financial regulation. And with any of these, any individual government could simply opt not to join if it considers the costs of compromise on the relevant issues greater than the benefits.\nIn some cases, a coalition of countries with similar national security interests could coordinate on technology transfer and industrial policy—in other words, around a common approach to restricting trade rather than facilitating it. A coalition could, for example, discourage its members from importing certain products and services, such as telecommunications infrastructure, from countries that pose a national security threat while encouraging the development of secure supply chains among its members. Or it could align export controls and establish common rules for the use of state subsidies. The United States could forge a coalition aimed at building a competitive, collective industrial base to meet the challenge posed by China’s scale, as former Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell and the Council on Foreign Relations’ Rush Doshi recently recommended in these pages.\nHow should the United States incentivize countries to join such coalitions? The negotiation of traditional trade-liberalizing agreements appears to be off the table politically, at least for now. Threatening to impose tariffs—that is, using sticks rather than carrots—might secure agreement in the short run, but to be durable, the other members of the coalition must see it as in their interest to align themselves with the United States rather than hedge their bets with China or remain on the sidelines altogether.\nOne option for the United States is to take advantage of its innovation ecosystem—the unique combination of world-class universities, R & D investment, rule of law, deep capital markets, access to risk capital, and entrepreneurial culture. Many of these assets are currently under threat by Trump administration policies, but over the long run, the value of maintaining U.S. scientific and technological leadership should be self-evident, particularly in the context of great-power rivalry. The U.S. innovation ecosystem might evolve but survive. A club of countries could secure preferential access to these opportunities and to those offered by other members of the club in exchange for alignment on a broader array of economic and national security interests.\nThese coalitions would be open, meaning that countries that are able and willing to live by the standards are eligible to join. Some might be quite small, focused on securing semiconductor supply chains, for example, and include, say, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Taiwan. Others could represent larger groups of countries willing to agree to a broader set of rules to govern trade and investment relations generally, such as the successor to the TPP, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP, which was finalized without U.S. participation. The membership of coalitions could grow over time, and there could be overlapping membership among different coalitions.\nThere is no going back to the trading system that existed before.\nIn the absence of a fundamental change in Beijing’s economic strategy and more, it is hard to imagine China as a candidate for membership in a coalition of this sort that involves the United States any time soon (although there might be room for coalitions cooperating on global public goods, such as pandemic preparedness). It is possible, over time, that Chinese policymakers will change strategy based on their own judgments, driven by demographic, financial, and other pressures. A structure of open plurilateralism, built with allies and partners, might expedite that decision. But after years of trying, U.S. policymakers should by now be quite humble about their ability to directly convince Beijing to change its approach and instead focus on using coalitions to shape China’s external environment.\nIn this world, the WTO might wither entirely, or it might persist in rump form for countries that have no more attractive coalitions to join. It could also be the repository for technical work and a venue for dispute settlement for countries that opt in. The network of free-trade agreements would continue to exist and could become the foundation for broader coalitions, such as the EU potentially following the United Kingdom’s lead in joining the CPTPP.\nA key benefit of open plurilateralism is the flexibility it provides. Not being beholden to holdouts in a system in which each country has a veto, the approach creates opportunities to move forward on issues among those with a common view and a capacity to take on new issues as they arise and new members as they meet the standards. In terms of economic efficiency, this is a second-best solution. By definition, the benefits would be shared only among members. Principles such as MFN would be effectively consigned to the dustbin of history. And the variable geometry of custom-tailored plurilateral agreements could be as messy and inefficient as a spaghetti bowl of bilateral trade agreements. But although such a network would be more complex than the multilateral trading system, it might also prove more politically sustainable. It is a pragmatic response to the current challenge: maintaining at least some rules without the multilateral rules-based system.\nCOMING STORMS\nWhatever the benefits of the postwar global trading system—for growth, poverty alleviation, consumer welfare, and more—there were, at the end of the day, losers as well as winners. Neither the costs nor the benefits were equally shared, and the distributional issues rarely got adequate attention from policymakers. These downsides will remain even in the best-designed system, and it will be essential to find better solutions for the harms. Any new system must come with an accompanying set of domestic policies designed to ensure that American workers and communities can thrive in a rapidly changing economy, whether that change comes from trade, technology, or immigration. Past administrations have made modest attempts at place-based economic development and worker retraining, but never with the seriousness of purpose or degree of prioritization that will be necessary.\nSuch policies may be even more urgently needed in the wake of the Trump trade wars. The costs of the current approach—in terms of growth, inflation, and productivity—are likely to fall most on the people Trump claims to be championing. Low-income Americans spend a disproportionate share of their income on imported goods. Industries that employ blue-collar workers depend on imported inputs. And the incomes of farmers and ranchers are highly sensitive to retaliation by other countries.\nMeanwhile, as the United States grapples with those consequences, the coming impact of artificial intelligence on workers could well dwarf the impact of globalization. The China shock contributed to the elimination of an estimated two million jobs between 1999 and 2011; the widespread application of AI could eliminate tens of millions of jobs over a similar period. So while attention is focused on tariffs, policymakers should be devoting at least as much effort to preparing for the AI-driven restructuring of the American workforce. As with trade, the benefits might be widely shared. But in this case, the costs might be, as well.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "Israel and the New Air Superiority", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/israel/israel-and-new-air-superiority", "text": "For years, military theorists and political scientists have argued that airpower is overrated and, in some ways, outmoded. Some point to the proliferation of small, cheap unmanned drones as evidence that traditional air superiority—the ability to control the skies—has been rendered obsolete. According to this view, technological innovation has made “air denial”—merely restricting an adversary’s ability to operate freely in the air—a sufficient replacement.\nOthers cite a “smart bomb trap,” the idea that leaders have grown overconfident in the ability of precision airstrikes to coerce states into submission. These critics argue that airpower alone cannot achieve political objectives and in fact often leads to endless, pointless bombing campaigns. The political scientist Robert Pape, for example, asserted in 1996 that “no strategic bombing campaign has ever yielded decisive results.” Underneath these critiques is a clear message: airpower is too limited, too expensive, or too reliant on the promises of technological innovations to matter much.\nThen, in June, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, an air campaign against Iran. Over the course of just 12 days, Israel’s air force flew around 1,500 combat sorties, conducted more than 600 aerial refuelings, and struck over 900 Iranian targets, including hardened nuclear facilities, missile batteries, and military command centers. The results were decisive: Iran’s nuclear program was significantly disrupted, key elements of its air defense network were shattered, and Tehran’s military leadership suffered serious blows. All the while, not a single manned Israeli aircraft was lost.\nAlthough Israel did not fully eliminate Iran’s nuclear capabilities, its air campaign delayed, degraded, and deterred Iran’s ambitions, and further transformed the Middle East’s political landscape. Rising Lion was a stunning demonstration of what a modern air force, backed by sound strategy and political resolve, can accomplish. It reaffirmed airpower’s ability to achieve meaningful political outcomes without a drawn-out ground war.\nCLEARING THE AIR\nThe 1991 U.S.-led Desert Storm air campaign established the tenets of modern air warfare: gain air superiority, simultaneously strike key enemy centers of gravity, use stealth and precision, and prioritize desired effects over attrition of forces alone. Israel adapted those lessons. The Israeli air force used stealth F-35I fighter jets to suppress and destroy Iranian surface-to-air missile batteries. These aircraft provided real-time targeting information to nonstealth F-15I and F-16I fighters, which carried out precision strikes on additional targets. Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) collected intelligence, jammed communications, and allowed Israel to deliver additional precision-guided munitions.\nThis devastating combination of stealth, precision, and persistent surveillance allowed Israel to quickly gain and maintain air superiority. By degrading Iranian defenses, Israel also cleared the way for the United States’ Operation Midnight Hammer, in which B-2 stealth bombers struck deeply buried nuclear facilities at Fordow and Natanz, reachable only by U.S. Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs.\nSome critics have pointed out that the campaign failed to destroy all of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. But Israel’s objective in Operation Rising Lion was to disrupt and delay Iran’s nuclear weapons program while retaining the ability to strike again—not to eradicate it. By those standards, Rising Lion was a resounding success. By crippling key enrichment and weapons-support sites, eliminating senior military and scientific personnel, and gaining air superiority over Iran, Israel imposed a strategy of denial by delay—all without committing ground forces to Iran or becoming entangled in a prolonged conflict. Indeed, any Iranian efforts to enrich uranium or rebuild facilities will now occur under the shadow of Israeli precision air attacks.\nInvesting in air superiority is not optional for American security.\nCritically, Israel achieved all its aims efficiently and effectively. It gained air superiority despite the thousands of miles separating it from Iran, in 12 days, and with zero casualties. Such results were possible only via airpower. No ground campaign could have hit these facilities so quickly, with such precision and intensity, and without any casualties.\nTo be sure, Rising Lion was not an air-only campaign. It was a tightly integrated, multidomain operation. Cyber-operations disrupted Iranian command and control. Space-based and airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms provided near-real-time targeting data. Electronic warfare helped disrupt enemy radars. Covert ground teams inside Iran used small drones to suppress defenses and relay coordinates. And an extensive set of military actions waged over several years in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria had already severely degraded Iran’s regional proxies, blunting Tehran’s ability to retaliate.\nTogether, these elements gave Israel an overwhelming advantage. But it was airpower that played the predominant role. It provided the tempo, reach, and the punch that made Rising Lion such an unqualified success.\nNEW TOOLS, SAME LESSON\nLeading-edge airpower capabilities have improved markedly since Desert Storm, when aircraft lacked accurate sensing technology, real-time connectivity, and all-weather munitions. Today’s fifth-generation fighters, such as the F-35, can integrate data from a variety of onboard sensors, fuse it into accurate targeting information, and share it with other aircraft. F-35s function as integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance sensor-shooters, giving users more information and digital connectivity that they can use to precisely strike targets as they are revealed. Their stealth allows them to operate inside contested airspace. As a result of these innovations, fewer fifth-generation aircraft are needed to achieve what would otherwise require dozens of less capable nonstealth aircraft.\nTechnological advances are not restricted to modern combat aircraft, however. Air defenses have become cheaper and more adaptable than ever. Artificial intelligence, autonomous weapons systems, and advanced information integration are changing the character of warfare. In the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, for example, Azerbaijan used a network of Bayraktar TB2 drones, loitering munitions, and real-time targeting data to devastating effect against Armenian forces. But even in the face of evolving modes of warfare, airpower’s inherent advantages endure. Airpower can still be used to change adversary behavior, enforce strategic redlines, and reshape regional military balance—all without bleeding a country’s treasury or excessively risking its sons and daughters. In fact, Russia’s inability to achieve air superiority over Ukraine turned what the Kremlin assumed would be a fast and simple invasion into a grinding war of attrition. Israel, by contrast, used modern airpower to avoid such a trap. It did not involve significant ground forces and has thus avoided falling into an endless war—Washington’s fate in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nAll this doesn’t mean air campaigns alone can do everything: operations from any domain never achieve victory in isolation. Critics of airpower, however, miss that airpower does not simply enable the use of other kinds of operations. Rather, it is a unique instrument of strategic leverage. In the modern era, air superiority is not just a prerequisite for joint success; it can be the decisive factor. In other words, Israel’s air campaign did not just set back Iran’s nuclear program. It reaffirmed that airpower can be the foundation of modern military success. U.S. defense planners should pay attention. Investing in air superiority is not optional for American security. It is essential.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "How to Win on Immigration", "url": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/how-win-immigration", "text": "Growing opposition to immigration is reshaping global politics. A promise to ruthlessly crack down on immigration helped Donald Trump win a return to the White House in 2024. In his first week back in office, Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border. Since then, his administration has ramped up immigration raids on businesses, threatened widespread deportation, and canceled temporary legal status for more than a million people living in the United States. Even as voters have soured somewhat on the administration’s extreme tactics, more Americans approve of Trump’s immigration policies than they do any of his actions in other areas.\nThe United States is not an outlier when it comes to public hostility toward immigration. Anti-immigration parties have gained popularity across the globe. Far-right parties, which often base their appeal on bashing immigrants and calling for tighter border controls, are now the most popular political force in Europe. Even center-left governments, such as that of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, have felt obliged to embrace hard-line immigration measures out of fear of losing further ground to the surging far right.\nDefenders of immigration often argue that they have both the facts and the morals on their side. Immigration is not a zero-sum game: more immigration can boost local and national economies while improving the fortunes of people seeking better lives. Immigration advocates blame racial prejudice or misinformation for opposition to immigration and point to demagoguery that scapegoats vulnerable immigrants for economic and social problems. Although prejudice and ignorance likely play some role in shaping attitudes—and elite politicians are powerful forces in driving public opinion—the fact is that many citizens have genuine concerns about immigration that cannot be ignored. These include practical worries about whether the state can maintain order, promote fair job competition, and ensure that housing and public services do not become overstretched.\nBut these concerns do not mean that the only viable immigration policy is one that is as harsh as it is cruel. Finding a better political solution must start with understanding what drives public backlash to immigration. Many citizens are deeply troubled by mismanaged flows of people into their country. This concern stems from a failure of policy, not of messaging. Until decision-makers craft more targeted immigration policy that straightforwardly focuses on how immigrants can provide economic benefits, anti-immigrant attitudes and parties will continue to gain ground.\nNOT A NUMBERS GAME\nMost observers believe that governments should be more responsive to voters on immigration, but they often fail to understand what the public wants. One popular approach to addressing the anti-immigrant backlash is to set numerical targets, such as the United Kingdom’s goal of reducing “net migration.” This reflects a tendency to think of immigration as a numbers game. If governing parties assume that voters simply want fewer immigrants, they pursue policies to limit overall immigration. But research shows that even when mainstream politicians embrace hard-line positions such as capping the number of new immigrants, they still fail to win over disaffected voters.\nIn fact, few people care about immigration numbers in the abstract. Research shows that there is no correlation between public opposition to immigration and actual immigration levels. Small inflows have sparked intense controversy even in cosmopolitan places—as happened, for example, with the arrival of tens of thousands of asylum seekers in New York City in 2022. By contrast, far larger waves, such as the European Union’s reception of millions of Ukrainians after Russia’s 2022 invasion or Israel’s acceptance of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe after the fall of the Soviet Union, drew less resistance. The lack of direct connection between public attitudes and numbers of immigrants also helps explain why people living in areas with relatively few immigrants can still strongly oppose immigration when the issue is salient nationally.\nThe vast majority of voters in rich democracies don’t have especially fixed views on immigration across the board. Only ten to 20 percent of voters seek to either shut borders completely or open them to all comers. For everyone else, views on immigration depend on whether they believe the new arrivals will benefit the country and the specific details of immigration policies. If voters perceive new immigrants as helpful to their community and the country at large, they are likely to support more immigration and reject strict anti-immigration politics.\nIn other words, voters assess immigration not on whether it affects them personally, but on how it affects society. In my research, I found that citizens in the United Kingdom opposed immigration if they believed it harmed their fellow citizens. But they were willing to countenance new immigrants if they felt the country as a whole would be better off. Data from other countries reveals similar patterns: survey respondents presented with policies designed to benefit the country’s economy, such as attracting immigrants to fill labor shortages, are more likely to support them. A large majority of people in the United States—including Trump supporters who cheer on his harsh immigration crackdowns—favor attracting new high-skilled professionals who can help maintain the United States’ technological edge.\nBut the incoherence of current immigration polices has generated widespread distrust and opposition to immigration in the United States. This is not just a problem of unconvincing rhetoric. Rather, the immigration system is so convoluted and mismanaged that few people believe that immigration can possibly help the country thrive. Congress is stuck in a perpetual cycle of trying to broker a grand bipartisan solution of trading pathways to citizenship for border security, which then fails to satisfy anyone. The immigration system has become so broken—and immigration debates so toxic—that it can be hard for any voter to imagine how immigration could be in the U.S. public interest.\nA TALE OF TWO COUNTRIES\nIn an ideal world, citizens would accurately perceive the exact benefits of an immigration policy on society. Or, with enough rhetorical swagger, a charismatic pro-immigration politician could provide them with facts that would convince them to support immigration policies whose benefits outweigh the costs to society. Unfortunately, politics is never so simple. But better designed policies can help build support for immigration.\nExamples from a variety of wealthy democracies suggest that immigration policies focused on addressing a host country’s economic needs are more likely to win support than immigration policies rooted in humanitarian concerns. Consider Sweden, where far-right anti-immigration parties have swelled in response to recent waves of immigration. In the last few decades, Sweden has welcomed hundreds of thousands of refugees and their relatives without considering income or skills. Policymakers have provided generous support to newcomers as part of the country’s long-standing commitment to asylum and equality. Before 2000, Sweden did not even count immigration for work as a separate category in its immigration statistics.\nThe uncomfortable fact is that foreign-born people in Sweden, many of whom arrived as asylum seekers, on average pay less in taxes than the state spends on benefits to support them. These recent arrivals have stoked social tensions and raised concerns about the growing strain on the welfare state. Widely publicized violent incidents in immigrant neighborhoods became national flashpoints, which the public linked to a failure to integrate new immigrants into Swedish society. The sense that the immigration system is not working has fueled the rise of the Swedish Democrats, a far-right party, since the 2010s.\nBetter designed policies can help build support for immigration.\nTo be sure, economists have argued that accepting even low-skilled immigrants typically has knock-on effects that contribute to economic growth and benefit society. Immigrants can fill essential jobs and push native-born workers into higher-paying positions. They can help revive depressed communities in rural or post-industrial areas. But most voters cannot see these benefits, which, if they occur, are widely spread out and become evident only many years later.\nCanada, by contrast, has built a system that admits large numbers of immigrants but is selective in doing so. To attract needed workers, the Canadian government uses a points-based approach that prioritizes people with rare or sought-after skills. Immigrants are admitted largely based on what they can contribute to society in the near term. The immigration process uses transparent criteria, such as education or regional demand for workers, which most voters can understand.\nThis policy has been remarkably successful. Canada has one of the highest immigration rates per capita in the world. Although some citizens have expressed vocal concerns about housing strain and student visa abuse, the Canadian government has moved swiftly to tighten immigration oversight and recalibrate admissions to maintain the trust of voters who still generally feel that the immigration system works for the country. As a result, anti-immigrant demagogues have gained little traction in national politics.\nTARGETED AND TRANSPARENT\nDetermining who can immigrate based on a points rubric or where workers are needed may seem cold and unfeeling in the face of the deeply human imperatives that drive international migration. But such a policy is the only viable path to a more open immigration system. As my research shows, no democracy has ever managed to ease widespread immigration concerns without being very selective about whom to admit. Cross-national data also reveals that more selective countries such as Canada are admitting more immigrants of all kinds. In other words, Canada’s experience shows that when immigration policies are demonstrably aligned with national needs, they build public goodwill that can later extend to more vulnerable newcomers, including refugees.\nA points-based system to admit “the best and brightest” is just one of many possible policies that can make immigration popular. Any policy that primarily focuses on solving visible national problems while signaling control of population flows is likely to make the public feel good about immigration, while those that explicitly sideline citizens’ interests are more likely to spur backlash, resentment, and populism. Immigration policies that focus on filling labor shortages, revitalizing struggling regions, or supporting family reunification of immediate relatives can all win public support.\nSome politicians will always seek to exploit immigration anxieties, exaggerate problems, and spread misinformation. But it is easier to do in Sweden than in Canada. This isn’t because Canadians are more tolerant, nor is it because their leaders have found the perfect communication strategy to sway the population. Rather, it’s because voters can see that Canadian immigration policies work. The more that democratic governments take public concerns seriously and craft immigration policies that clearly benefit society in ways people can understand, the less space there is for xenophobic populists to claim that only they have the country’s interests at heart.\nResponsible democratic governments serious about making immigration politically viable must also be willing to compromise. Immigration debates are often framed in binary terms—open versus closed, pro-immigration versus anti-immigration, nationalist versus cosmopolitan. But real solutions lie in which types of immigration policies countries pursue. Work-oriented policies, rather than humanitarian-based ones, are more likely to command broad support. Sweden has finally begun moving in this direction by introducing more selective immigration criteria. Inspired by Canada, Germany has also adopted its own version of a points-based immigration system; in 2024, the country issued ten percent more skilled worker visas than the year prior.\nTargeted immigration policies can help voters recognize the benefits to their country.\nImplementing a points-based system will not solve all problems, however. How such a system is designed matters for its success. Many so-called merit-based proposals—such as some of those Republicans have proposed in the U.S. Senate in the past decade—will not help if their primary aim is to find a new way to cut overall admissions. Instead, what builds public support is an immigration policy visibly tied to labor demand, immediate work authorization for new arrivals, and publicly reported benefits of immigration that voters can understand.\nAdvanced democracies could also adopt immigration policies tied to demonstrable regional needs. For instance, U.S. states could issue visas for workers who have the skills to meet a labor shortfall they face, such as licensed nurses for understaffed hospitals in Michigan or eldercare aides in Minnesota. These policies are most effective when visas are designed to be portable across approved local employers and the policies lay out a path to permanent status for workers after a period of sustained employment. Canada’s Provincial Nominee Program and Australia’s Regional Visa program are examples that can serve as models for U.S. policymakers.\nSimilarly, governments can establish bilateral employment partnerships to fast-track visas or permanent residency status for workers from a specific country with relevant skills. These partnerships can apply to fields with national labor shortages, such as eldercare, construction, engineering, or artificial intelligence. Australia and South Korea have established effective regional programs that prepare and train workers from other countries and then match them to verified jobs with wage floors.\nThese types of targeted, narrow immigration policies can help voters recognize immigration’s benefits to their country. The logic is the same as for dedicated taxes: voters often support tax increases when they know exactly how their tax money will be used. Voters do not necessarily want less immigration; they want immigration that they can see working. When citizens see immigration policies that are effective—bringing in doctors at understaffed hospitals, entrepreneurs who create jobs, or caregivers who support aging populations—they also see their own communities benefiting.\nThe fact that targeted, well-managed immigration policies are more popular than purely humanitarian approaches does not preclude helping those in need. But efforts to assist refugees and displaced people must also demonstrate their benefits to society to avoid backlash. Governments are more likely to gain public support when they strictly enforce immigration rules, quickly provide accepted refugees with the right to work, match them to open jobs, and expand the role of communities and private companies in sponsoring new arrivals. When willing citizens and employers share the costs, everyone—including politicians, workers, and even asylum seekers—can also share in the benefits.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

Russia has disrupted flows of energy, food, and other commodities; generated millions of migrants; and heightened insecurity not just in Ukraine but also across the entire Black Sea region. These efforts constitute part of a much longer and larger strategy. Russia does not merely seek to dominate Ukraine. It wants to render each of the other five states that border the Black Sea—as well as Moldova, which borders Romania and Ukraine and whose waters flow into the sea—subservient to its interests so that it can exercise veto power over choices these countries make. Moscow also aspires to use the Black Sea as a platform from which to project power and influence throughout the Middle East, the Mediterranean, and the Caucasus.\nRussia’s quest to become the dominant force in the Black Sea is an essential element in its strategy to reassert itself as a great power. The Kremlin believes that a failure to establish a commanding presence in the region would leave Russia exposed to Western encroachment, render it less able to influence adjoining areas and disrupt commodity exports that are critical to the Russian economy. Turkey poses the greatest obstacle to Russian objectives in the region because it is the only Black Sea state that Russia has not historically dominated and it is a NATO member. But even after the end of the Cold War, the Kremlin retained considerable levers of influence over the former Soviet empire’s Black Sea space in Bulgaria, Georgia, Moldova, Romania, and Ukraine.\nIn recent decades, Russia has sought to further subordinate these states to Moscow through a combination of persuasion and coercion. Increasing Russia’s Black Sea presence is also at the heart of President Vladimir Putin’s decades-long plan to resurrect the country’s maritime power. He prioritized modernizing the Black Sea Fleet, whose interventions proved critical in supporting Russia’s Mediterranean Squadron and its 2015 intervention in Syria. Putin has ignored internationally recognized borders to seize a great expanse of Black Sea coastline, including Georgia’s territory of Abkhazia in 2008, Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, and the Ukrainian part of the Sea of Azov coast in 2022. Although Ukraine has prevented Russia from taking all of its Black Sea coast, Moscow has deployed naval mines as well as blockaded and bombed Ukrainian ports to sever Ukraine’s sea access and minimize the presence of other navies.\nWhile the world has focused on Russia’s battle for Ukraine, Moscow has often advanced these goals under the radar—extending the war, skirting sanctions, disrupting markets, and enhancing its influence in the Middle East and North Africa. Other key leaders should work with Black Sea countries to build a region more resilient to Russian pressure. Failing to do so will likely prolong the war, further enable Russia’s massive human rights violations, exacerbate refugee flows, and provoke turbulence in global energy and commodity markets. Regional insecurities are, in turn, likely to spill over into the Caucasus, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean.\nBlack Swan\nFor centuries, the Black Sea has served as a critical junction for the movement of people and commodities. Russia has long believed that controlling the sea is essential for its security: in 1783, Catherine the Great annexed Crimea from the Ottoman Empire to increase the Russian Empire’s control over the Black Sea. Throughout much of the nineteenth century, Russia competed with the Ottoman Empire and Europe’s major powers for influence in and around the sea. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union became the region’s leading power. Turkey was its main competitor, but Moscow came to dominate all the other Black Sea coastal states.\nAfter the Soviet Union collapsed, in 1991, Russia’s regional role changed dramatically. Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine became independent countries and pursued closer ties to the West. Bulgaria and Romania joined NATO in 2004 and the European Union in 2007. As a result, Russia lost its access to parts of the Black Sea coastline. In March 2014, Putin justified the annexation of Crimea by warning that otherwise, “NATO ships would have ended up in the city of Russian navy glory, Sevastopol.” Between 2014 and 2022, the Kremlin tripled the amount of Black Sea coastline under its de facto control and strengthened its influence by wielding a combination of military, diplomatic, economic, energy, and disinformation tactics.\nToday, the Black Sea is a central hub for Russia’s energy trade: Russian oil and oil products account for most of the cargo flowing out of Novorossiysk, the largest port in Russia and the Black Sea basin and the fifth-largest in Europe. The country’s remaining westward pipeline gas routes run under the Black Sea to Turkey and then on to southeastern Europe. The sea is also vital to Russian agriculture: Russia routes almost all of its grain exports and a significant proportion of its fertilizer and other agricultural goods through its ports there. These flows enable Moscow to increase revenue, create new markets, establish trading systems less reliant on the U.S. dollar, and gain influence in recipient countries.\nRussia now employs a variety of interference tactics to swing Black Sea states toward Moscow. Hard power, of course, remains a crucial element of its strategy, and not only in Ukraine. The 1991–93 civil war in Georgia unsettled that country’s political life and granted Moscow opportunities for influence; in 2008, Russia invaded and defeated Georgia in a brief war and recognized the separatist enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states. About eight percent of Georgians have been internally displaced because of that invasion and other Russian efforts to exploit the country’s ethnic conflicts.\nBut military campaigns are not the only way Russia has sought to bring the Black Sea region to heel. The Kremlin has frequently used disinformation to persuade populations in post-communist countries to align with Russia over what the Kremlin calls pro-Western elites, appealing to people disillusioned with their governments’ failures. Moscow has also supported pro-Russian political parties, interfered in elections, and sought to carry out coups against incumbents.\nAnd historically, Russia has leveraged Bulgaria, Moldova, and Ukraine’s dependence on Russian energy to influence each country’s elites. Moscow cut all gas transit through Ukraine to Europe several times before its initial 2014 incursion and shut off gas supplies to Bulgaria in 2022 and Moldova in early 2025. It has restricted food flows, banning wheat exports to Georgia or limiting Moldovan wine exports to Russia, for instance, to discipline Georgia and Moldova when it believes that either is diverging from Moscow’s priorities. And Russian interference extends to the cultural: the Russian Orthodox Church appeals to its counterparts abroad to battle “satanic” or “woke” Western culture. The Kremlin also deploys espionage and sabotage to destabilize these societies.\nMixed Record\nMoscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine both accelerated its efforts to dominate the Black Sea and revealed the benefits of the groundwork it laid earlier to solidify control. Its ability to disrupt maritime traffic has scrambled regional energy flows: although Russia’s gas exports to Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine have declined significantly since February 2022, its exports to Georgia and Turkey have increased substantially as each of those countries has refused to join sanctions on Russia. Turkey has become the world’s largest buyer of Russian refined oil products. Many of these imports are relabeled in Georgia and Turkey and then reexported to circumvent the European Union’s import ban.\nThe sea has also become a major staging area for Russia’s “shadow fleet” of unregistered ships, which it uses to circumvent Western sanctions. Russia has used its access to the Black Sea to disrupt its agricultural competitors. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev calls food Russia’s “silent weapon.” The Kremlin has stolen Ukrainian agricultural products and bombed Ukraine’s farmlands, agricultural infrastructure, and ports to undercut a primary source of Kyiv’s revenue and gain new markets for Moscow.\nRussia’s efforts to destabilize other Black Sea states are a tale of uneven successes and setbacks. The region’s weakest links are Georgia and Moldova. Russian forces are stationed in each country’s breakaway regions, and broader domestic discontent provides fertile ground for subversive Russian tactics. Georgia’s ruling party, Georgian Dream, has turned toward Russia, suspending accession negotiations with the EU in November 2024 and later introducing legislation that represses freedom of speech and assembly. Although a large segment of Georgian society opposes these moves, the party has managed to win successive elections; many Georgians fear that if the country continues along a pro-EU path, Russia will invade again. Intimidation apparently works. The victory of pro-Western candidates in recent Moldovan and Romanian elections illustrates the limits of Russian interference, but the Kremlin is working hard to manipulate Moldova’s fall 2025 parliamentary elections to boost pro-Russian parties.\nThe fight for Ukraine is also a fight for the future of the Black Sea.\nMoscow has secured access to key grain markets at Ukraine’s expense, but flexing its agricultural power has aggravated tensions with recipient countries. African leaders have told Putin that the war has created food insecurity: in July 2023, for instance, the Kenyan diplomat Korir Sing’Oei called Russia’s withdrawal from a pact that allowed Ukraine to export grain through the Black Sea “a stab on the back.” Although Moscow has managed to leverage the sea to evade sanctions, generate revenue, and access critical technology, that effort has required developing elaborate and inefficient trading and shipping schemes, and some Black Sea countries have also sought alternative energy sources. The war in Ukraine has also forced Moscow to contend with the largest outflow of its own people since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.\nUkraine’s success in denying sea control to Russia and inflicting heavy damage on its Black Sea Fleet has crimped Moscow’s influence over nearby regions. So did Turkey’s decision to close the Turkish straits to Russian military vessels days after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Ankara has complex ties with Moscow: Turkey is a significant trading partner and purchaser of Russian oil, as well as a key transit route for Russian gas. Yet Ankara’s choice to close the Turkish straits not only limited Moscow’s ability to wage naval war against Ukraine; it also stopped Russia from using the sea to project naval power in the Mediterranean and the Middle East.\nMoscow remains a significant player in the South Caucasus but has lost its role as the regional hegemon; Turkey now plays a much more important regional role than it did before 2022. Until 2023, Russia acted as Armenia’s protector in its conflict with Azerbaijan over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, but when Azerbaijan attacked Armenia in 2023, Russia, its military overextended, did not come to Armenia’s assistance. After decades of fighting, in August 2025, Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a peace agreement to end the conflict—but they signed it at the White House, not the Kremlin, highlighting the limits of Russian influence in the region. Strains to its military capabilities also forced Moscow to prioritize its war in Ukraine over its support for the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. After the ouster of Assad’s regime last December, the Kremlin is scrambling to regain influence with Damascus’s new leadership. It needs such influence: the loss of Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus Naval Base in Syria would complicate Moscow’s efforts to expand its operations in the Mediterranean and Africa. And Russia now faces rising competition in the Black Sea and Central Asia from China and the European Union, each of which is building out its economic and political presence.\nSea Change\nPolicymakers seeking to exploit Moscow’s mixed record in the Black Sea must overcome several challenges. The region’s post-communist countries continue to struggle, leaving them vulnerable to Russian influence. The end of U.S. foreign assistance programs in Ukraine and other states in the region geared toward fighting corruption, supporting an independent news media, and promoting economic development, health, and good governance has left a gap that only EU and NATO allies can fill. EU accession negotiations with Moldova and Ukraine are moving slowly and face opposition from some member states.\nThe EU and NATO have each put forth new strategies for the region, but both face obstacles to implementation. Brussels’s plan is full of good intentions but lacks concrete commitments and has no budget. NATO has focused on defending its northeastern flank, even though Russia’s last three invasions have taken place in the Black Sea, not the Baltic. In the past three years, EU and NATO countries have prioritized their own resilience strategies; now they must develop plans to stabilize vulnerable Black Sea partners.\nBrussels must mobilize funding to match the ambitious rhetoric it presented in May 2025 on a so-called connectivity agenda with Black Sea states and the Caucasus, Eurasia, and the Middle East. The EU should forge West-East corridors that link the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas––circumventing Russia and including Turkey, which EU plans have thus far avoided. Additionally, members of the Three Seas Initiative, which seeks to build digital, energy, and transport links between the Adriatic, Black, and Baltic Seas, should invite Ukraine and Moldova to become full members\nBlack Sea states should further develop their own considerable energy resources. Bulgaria, Georgia, and Romania are already constructing an underwater Black Sea energy cable that would bypass Russia and directly connect Azerbaijan’s renewable energy resources to Europe’s energy grid. Romania’s recent offshore gas discoveries, once fully exploited, could lead Bucharest to become the EU’s largest gas producer. Turkey’s Sakarya gas field holds similar promise. The war has limited Ukraine’s ability to exploit its gas resources, but in peacetime, EU and U.S. energy companies and international financial assistance could help the country become a major gas producer.\nBuilding Blocks\nTurkey will be central to any strategy to prevent Russia from controlling the Black Sea. Ankara often diverges from its NATO allies on the nature of regional challenges: it has armed Ukraine and refused to recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea, for instance, but maintains lucrative commercial ties with Moscow. European and U.S. policymakers should recognize this complexity and build on shared interests such as strengthening regional supply chains and infrastructure links as well as upholding freedom of navigation and curbing Russian expansionism in the Black Sea.\nTurkey opposes a formal NATO maritime presence in the sea involving countries outside its immediate coastal region. But Ankara is offering concrete material support for Bulgaria’s and Romania’s defense modernization efforts. By 2030, NATO plans to make its installation near Constanta, Romania, its principal Black Sea site and its largest base in Europe. The alliance could bolster its forward presence by improving air defense capabilities and deploying additional forces to its multinational battle groups in Bulgaria and Romania. NATO could rotate ships and allied maritime groups in the Black Sea complemented by regular air patrols and exercises. Enhanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance could better monitor Russian activities.\nThe United States has an interest in a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace—and thus in enhancing freedom in the Black Sea region. Strengthening U.S. support for NATO and EU initiatives can have an outsize impact at relatively low cost. Following the Trump-Putin Alaska summit, however, it is unclear whether Trump will exert pressure on Russia to end the conflict, which may continue for some time. Yet halting Moscow’s expansionist aims must start with ending that war. Russia’s targeting of civilian infrastructure has already pushed millions from their homes and entrenched Russian domination in occupied Ukrainian lands.\nThe Kremlin is likely to persist in these efforts until international actors understand that the fight for Ukraine is also a fight for the future of the Black Sea. Efforts to end the war must be paired with a robust strategy to prevent Moscow’s dominance in the greater Black Sea region. North American and European policymakers should prioritize initiatives designed to improve the region’s democratic governance and economic development and assure the secure production and transit of commodities. If such steps fail to stabilize the region, Russia’s aggression in Ukraine may well extend to Moldova and Georgia and could even balloon into a direct confrontation with NATO states that border the Black Sea—the consequences of which would ripple across markets worldwide and threaten an even wider variety of U.S. and European interests.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n- Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n- Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n- Unlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

{"title": "Is Trump’s DC Military Deployment the Start of a Slow-Motion Civil War?", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-dc-military-deployment-civil-war/", "text": "Is Trump’s DC Military Deployment the Start of a Slow-Motion Civil War?\nAnything is possible in the coming days and weeks, but it’s difficult not to feel like we are veering toward escalating violence.\nWhat exactly is Donald Trump doing with the 800 National Guard soldiers, plus ICE officers, Drug Enforcement Authority officials, and US Park Police, he deployed to patrol the streets of Washington, DC, almost two weeks ago? Attorney General Pam Bondi boasts that they arrested 68 people on Saturday night, but the Metropolitan Police Department averages 68 arrests a day. In less than two weeks, Bondi claims, they’ve arrested 300 individuals on charges ranging from drug dealing to traffic violations. But based on its daily average, the MPD would have made almost 900 arrests on its own in the same period.\nAlthough Trump justified his moves by citing the District’s allegedly escalating crime rate—crime of every sort is actually down dramatically in Washington—for better or worse, they’re not policing any of the District’s high-crime areas, residents complain. I say it might be better, because if they descended on Anacostia or other overly policed areas, they likely would criminalize and brutalize indiscriminately. Remember, these troops haven’t been trained in urban policing (not that such training always prevents brutal behavior). But it’s also quite bizarre, if Trump’s genuine focus were crime reduction. But it’s not. It’s intimidation.\nTrump’s troops have mostly shown up in touristy places and lively neighborhoods, in what is largely a show of farce. They’re writing people up for public drinking, smoking weed, and broken taillights. They’ve succeeded in reducing business at bars and restaurants by almost a third compared to the same period in August 2024. So much for the pro-business GOP.\nEven though it’s so far been a waste of federal resources, GOP leaders are helping to escalate tensions in DC. Over the weekend, the Republican governors of South Carolina, West Virginia, and Ohio promised to send up to 750 of their own National Guard soldiers to the nation’s capital. Some red state governors briefly deployed National Guard troops, at Trump’s behest, during large-scale but peaceful George Floyd protests in June of 2020, but the news mostly flew under the radar. This time, Trump wants headlines about the red-state invasion. (As I write, Mississippi announced that it would send 200 soldiers. Good Ole Miss.) Military sources also told NBC that some Guard troops, who currently don’t carry weapons, might now be armed.\nMore than one observer on social media noted the somewhat chilling irony that it was South Carolina’s secession and attack on federal forces at Charleston’s Fort Sumter that started the Civil War. We should also remember that it was Ohio National Guard troops who fired on peaceful students at Kent State University in 1970, killing four.\nI think a lot about writer Jeff Sharlet’s conception of a “slow civil war” unraveling the United States, especially since the January 6 insurrection. On Bluesky he wrote: “I’m gonna say armed troops from red states descending on a blue city is just a few inches—or maybe one exchange of gunfire—short of a civil war’s opening stages.”\nAnjali Dayal, an international politics professor at Fordham University, took issue with Sharlet’s post—at least the way she read it: “I respect Jeff’s work but we should be careful about what we forecast & how inevitable we make it seem. We are not close to a civil war, but I worry we are perilously close to a mass casualty event because of the undisciplined nature of irregular security forces & an extremely armed civil society.”\nIn an e-mail to me, Sharlet made clear that he essentially agrees with Dayal. Civil war is not “an inevitability,” he said, adding, “I agree that ‘mass casualty event’ is the next big risk, and that the ‘grey and the blue’ is not a risk, but I’d argue that the simmer that we see, our years of lead, are a 21st century American slow civil war.”\nIt’s clear: The addition of 1,000 red-state National Guard troops to the 800 already in DC, all untrained in urban policing, raises the odds of a “mass casualty event,” at minimum. We used to say people who described Trumpism as “fascism” were exaggerating, though now even mainstream media regularly uses the F-word. Right now, we should be wary of talking blithely about “civil war.” But these moves on the capital by Trump and his red-state cronies seem like an acceleration of danger to democracy, meant to familiarize Americans with the sight of federal forces patrolling blue American cities, as Trump has already said is coming.\nAdd the dangers posed by armed right-wing civilians and militias, along with the nearly 1,600 January 6 felons freed from jail or prison by Trump on Inauguration Day, and it feels like we’ve veered toward escalating violence.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "Trump Won’t Deliver Peace to Ukraine—or Anywhere Else", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/world/trump-putin-alaska-ukraine-russia-foreign-policy/", "text": "Trump Won’t Deliver Peace to Ukraine—or Anywhere Else\nNo one can trust the United States when a fickle man-child controls its foreign policy.\nWhen Donald Trump spoke to an adoring crowd at the Republican National Convention in 2016, he distilled the essence of his autocratic politics into a self-aggrandizing phrase: “I alone can fix it.”\nTrump has an inordinate faith in his abilities as a problem solver and dealmaker. His cult of personality is based on the fantasy of his omni-competence, and this shared delusion has effectively become the governing ideology of the Republican Party. Again and again, the president has claimed that, unlike previous US political leaders whom he dubs “stupid,” he can quickly make good deals with foreign powers.\nIn 2024, Trump repeatedly asserted that he could end the Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours. He now acknowledges that this was an “exaggeration.” But this rare concession to reality hasn’t shaken his confidence. Trump’s bizarre meeting on Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a hastily organized summit in Alaska is the latest example of Trump deploying his dealmaking skills (which are foundational to his personal brand) to solve an intractable problem. Unfortunately, Trump’s own erratic behavior during the Alaska summit made clear why he can’t make peace—and indeed why he’s making the world a much more dangerous place.\nOf course, Trump is not the first president to have an outsize sense of his own personal abilities, especially in the realm of foreign policy. Since the start of the atomic age with the bombing of Hiroshima, the United States has been a “thermonuclear monarchy” (to borrow a useful phrase coined by the scholar Elaine Scarry), one where the president is vested with the godlike power to unleash weapons that could end all human life. Further, the imperial presidency that became entrenched during the Cold War has given the president unusual freedom in foreign policy, including the ability to launch wars by fiat—and in defiance of the Constitution that reserves that power for Congress. But the same national security state that elevated the presidency to dominance also created a complex, sprawling bureaucracy that maintains guardrails, making it difficult for the whims of any individual to determine foreign policy.\nIn his first term, Trump often felt hemmed in by this bureaucracy, which he came to see as a “deep state” conspiracy against his presidency. In his second term, Trump has dismantled much of the national security bureaucracy that advises the president and instead relies on an inner coterie of loyalists. As documented in an important essay in The Atlantic, Trump “has pushed away the help of career experts, and major decisions—the handling of the war in Gaza, for example, and negotiations over Ukraine—are now made by a tiny core group of loyal advisers, including Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Chief of Staff Susie WiIes, and one or two others.”\nThis decision to shunt aside the national security establishment isn’t itself objectionable. After all, the permanent security bureaucracy has often pushed disastrous decisions, such as the Vietnam War; the alliances with Middle Eastern autocracies, which have led to numerous wars; and the post–Cold War expansion of NATO, which is a major cause of the current Russia-Ukraine war. Conversely, some of the major achievements of US foreign policy have come from presidents willing to defy the establishment: John F. Kennedy using backchannel diplomacy to end the Cuban missile crisis, Richard Nixon opening relations with China, and Barack Obama making a nuclear deal with Iran all come to mind.\nUnfortunately, Trump has none of the diplomatic skills of a Kennedy, Nixon, or Obama. Rather, foreign policy is a stage where all the vices of Trump’s malignant personality—his narcissism, his intellectual incuriosity, his fickleness, his indulgence in conspiratorial fantasies, his love of flattery, his pleasure in bullying—display themselves for all the world to see.\nThe tragedy of the current moment desperately requires a skilled US president who can bring wars to an end. The Russia-Ukraine war, in particular, is a catastrophe that demands a quick resolution. A Gallup poll released earlier this month shows that 69 percent of Ukrainians want a negotiated end to the war as soon as possible, while only 24 percent support fighting until victory.\nTo understand the desire of Ukrainians for peace, you just need to look at population statistics. The population of Ukraine peaked in 1992 at roughly 52 million and then went into a decline common in post-Soviet societies. This decline intensified with the 2022 Russian invasion, which led to a massive flight of refugees, the death of countless soldiers, and a decline in fertility. Ukraine now has roughly 32 million people, a population lower than at any point since 1937. In the words of University of Chicago political scientist John Mearsheimer, Ukraine is experiencing a “demographic death spiral.”\nUkraine’s population decline makes it harder to continue its fight, especially since Russia, with its population of 143 million, can draw on a much larger pool of potential soldiers. Not surprisingly, the Ukraine military is facing a conscription crisis and is fielding an army where the average soldier is at least 40 years old. But this military crisis speaks to a larger existential question: What is the point of fighting to save the Ukrainian nation in a war that is rapidly leading to many fewer Ukrainians? This is a classic case where you can save the village only by destroying the village, a futile exercise.\nUnfortunately, the political elites of Europe and Ukraine (along with many of their counterparts in the United States) seem intent on ignoring the wishes of the Ukrainian people. These elites are unwilling to give up the notion that the fortunes of the battlefield will turn against Russia. Given this grim situation, it would be useful to have a US president who bucks the national security establishment and pushes for a negotiated end to the war.\nTrump occasionally sounds like he’s interested in real diplomacy with Russia, and the political establishment sometimes responds with absurd claims that Trump is Putin’s “puppet” or a long-standing Russian asset (a wild notion expounded at great length by Jonathan Chait in New York magazine).\nIn truth, Trump is neither a puppet nor a peacemaker. He’s a vainglorious egotist out of his depth. He loves being praised and having his favorite conspiracy theories vindicated, and so he basked in Putin’s assertion that the 2020 US presidential election was stolen. But Trump also delights in being seen as a tough guy, so he often supports hawkish measures against Russia. The effect is a foreign policy of mixed messages, which creates confusion and distrust. This muddled policy makes more wars likely, since failure to communicate can easily lead to one side overstepping what the other side sees as a red line.\nPopular\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →The Atlantic reports on one example of Trump’s centralized decision-making subverting traditional foreign policy:\nSome current and former officials fear the setup may also mean inadequate vetting of questionable ideas, such as Trump’s announcement earlier this month that he had repositioned two nuclear submarines in response to bellicose remarks by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, a Putin ally. It caught many in the Pentagon by surprise; neither the White House nor the military typically publicly discusses submarine movements. Even after the fact, some Pentagon officials said they weren’t sure whether the submarines had already been scheduled to move or not.\nTo achieve strategic deterrence, the Navy’s ballistic-missile fleet relies on stealth. “That’s the whole fucking point of submarines. You don’t know where they are,” one defense official explained.\nDuring the summit, Trump quickly shifted from being bellicose to being conciliatory. Before the summit, Trump warned that if Putin did not agree to a ceasefire, “There will be very severe consequences.” But as The Wall Street Journal notes, Trump quickly and inexplicably shifted his tone:\nHours after meeting Putin, however, he dropped his demand in a post on his Truth Social platform, in which he argued in favor of going straight to negotiations for a full peace agreement following his discussions with the leaders of Russia, Ukraine and other European nations…. The move echoes Putin’s preferred approach and would allow the fighting to continue until a deal is reached—something Ukraine has argued against.\nIn other words, depending on his mood, Trump is a hawk or a dove. This gives all the other parties—the Russians, the Ukrainians, the Europeans—little reason to trust him. This means his diplomacy will at best be ineffectual and at worst engender even more wars. It’s possible that sheer exhaustion will force Russia and Ukraine to reach a settlement, but if that happens, it will not be due to Trump’s actions. Trump is not the dealmaker that he has spent decades touting himself as being. Rather, he’s a chaos agent who wants to be the center of attention. If the world is a tinderbox, Trump is a foolish child who loves playing with matches.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "Pete Hegseth Is Creating a Patriarchal Pentagon to Fight Domestic Foes", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/pete-hegseth-patriarchy-sexism-pentagon-crec/", "text": "Pete Hegseth Is Creating a Patriarchal Pentagon to Fight Domestic Foes\nThe defense secretary fervently supports a theocratic church that preaches female submission.\nOn August 7, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted on X a clip of a CNN segment featuring Doug Wilson, the pastor who cofounded the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC), the extremist Christian nationalist sect that Hegseth joined in 2018. Hegseth added a catchphrase to the post that he learned from the church, “All of Christ for All of Life.” In the video itself, Wilson and other CREC pastors affirm a theocratic and patriarchal vision of the world. Wilson tells CNN, “I’d like to see the nation be a Christian nation, and I’d like to see the world be a Christian world.” Another CREC pastor calls for the repeal of the 19th Amendment, which enshrines the right of women to vote, and a female parishioner supports the church’s teaching that wives must submit to their husbands.\nWhile Hegseth’s post ignited controversy, Wilson was delighted by to have such a powerful government official give CREC an imprimatur. The pastor told the AP:\n[Hegseth] reposted it, and he himself said “All of Christ for All of Life,” which is a tagline that we use. This is the first time we’ve had connections with as many people in the national government as we do now.… We’re trying to give these people an opportunity to meet with God.… I think the 19th Amendment was a bad idea.\nHegseth’s religious faith is more than a personal matter since the church has such a far-reaching program for remaking the United States and the world. While Hegseth can’t overturn the 19th Amendment, he can reshape the Pentagon along patriarchal lines. Donald Trump, who nominated Hegseth, is himself trying to turn the military into a tool of his partisan agenda, sending troops to Washington, DC, ostensibly to fight crime.\nHegseth joined CREC at one of his frequent moments of personal crisis. In 2017, he paid $50,000 in a settlement with a woman who accused him of sexual assault. The following year, Hegseth’s mother wrote him a letter that read in part, “You are an abuser of women—that is the ugly truth and I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around, and uses women for his own power and ego.” (She later disavowed this letter.) At that time, Hegseth was a twice-divorced alcoholic who had been repeatedly accused of mismanaging the nonprofits he oversaw (on occasion allegedly creating an environment where sexual harassment flourished). Wanting to rebuild his life, Hegseth joined CREC in 2018 and remarried the following year.\nAs Amanda Marcotte noted in Salon, Wilson’s theology is grounded in the idea of female sexual subservience:\nIn one famous passage from his book on marriage, Wilson suggests that sexual violence is women’s fault for not being submissive enough. “[T]he sexual act cannot be made into an egalitarian pleasuring party,” he writes. “A man penetrates, conquers, colonizes, plants. A woman receives, surrenders, accepts.” The alleged failure of women to submit, he continues, leads men to “dream of being rapists,” deprived of the “erotic necessity” found in women’s submission.\nIn running the Pentagon, Hegseth has been a cultural warrior more concentrated on defeating liberalism than in fighting foreign wars. He has been especially focused on purging the military of transgender troops. Hegseth also believes that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have weakened the military’s war-making ability. He has assiduously blocked the promotion of officers he sees as opposed to his vision. Sometimes these officers are white men Hegseth views as hostile, but a strikingly large number are women and/or people of color.\nThe New York Times made a partial list:\nHegseth and President Trump fired Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr.… Hegseth accused General Brown, who is Black, of prioritizing diversity over the combat effectiveness of the force.\nAlso removed during the first months of the new administration were the first woman to command the Navy, Adm. Lisa Franchetti; the first woman to command the Coast Guard, Adm. Linda Fagan; Mr. Hegseth’s senior military assistant, Lt. Gen. Jennifer Short; and the U.S. military representative to the NATO military committee, Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield. All were dismissed as part of a campaign to root out diversity, equity and inclusion from the military and restore what Mr. Hegseth has described as a “warrior ethos.”\nMr. Hegseth also recently withdrew the nomination of Rear Adm. Michael “Buzz” Donnelly to lead the Navy’s Seventh Fleet in Japan—its largest overseas force—amid reports in conservative media that seven years earlier the admiral had allowed a drag performance to take place on the aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan.\nThe message of these firings and failures to nominate is clear: Under Hegseth, the military is an institution for conservative cis white men. You are automatically suspect if you are a woman, trans, or a person of color. Even if you are white man, any sign of tolerance of diversity makes you suspect.\nHegseth grabbed on to Christian nationalist patriarchy as a solution to his personal failures. Now he is trying to impose that Christian nationalist patriarchy on the military. The logical outcome of this program is a military geared not to fighting military threats but to waging internal domestic war against the foes of Christian nationalism. Along with Trump, who is using the military as a personal army, Hegseth is paving the way for an authoritarian United States.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "Anne Lamott and the Power of Hope", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/society/anne-lamott-hope-optimism-activism/", "text": "On the Fourth of July, a friend interrupted my doomscrolling to send me a copy of Anne Lamott’s Washington Post column “Does Trumpland chaos bode better times ahead? I say yes. Happy Fourth!” It was a lifeline. Lamott wrote, “I am calling for us to move into a new phase of resistance: hope and joy. In ghastly times, these are subversive.”\nLamott is the igniter of the raw-truth-mother-writing explosion. With her bestselling book Operating Instructions, she gave mothers permission to admit that—despite your best intentions—you will screw up and you may think unthinkable things about the same child you love beyond reason. She gave us permission to laugh at ourselves. Then she brought that same humor and unvarnished honesty to her famous writing manifesto Bird by Bird, as well as countless books on family, faith, community, and overcoming addiction. Each book includes tiny gems of wisdom on how to climb out of life’s blackest holes. Now, at 70, she has just published her 20th book, Somehow: Thoughts on Love, another antidote for a world that seems to have lost its moral center.\nWe met on Zoom. She was in her Northern California home, sporting red glasses and her signature blonde dreadlocks. Just as I imagined, she was funny, irreverent, wise, charming.\n—Pamela Alma Weymouth\nPamela Alma Weymouth: In your recent column you write about a man who worked with the Dalai Lama. “He said gently that they both believed that when a lot of difficult and chaotic things were going on all at once, it was to protect something fragile and beautiful that was trying to get itself born.” Can you say more about what you see being born?\nAnne Lamott: I have been so lifted and filled by the huge rallies and marches that I’ve gotten to participate in and seen footage of. I’m seeing people pour money into the public radio stations that are so necessary for people, especially in rural areas. I’m just seeing people respond and try to make up what’s been stolen away by the boll weevils. That is always what has saved us, and it will save us again.\nI always end up quoting that thing that Fred Rogers’s mother told him when he was watching a tragedy unfold. She’d say, “Look to the helpers.”\nEvery day, you just see people who don’t need to help raise their hand and ask, How can I help?\nMy church is in a very, very poor part of the world. The outpouring of people just since Trump was elected to help coach, and to mentor, and to teach reading and English as a second language [has inspired me]. We have a food pantry and just the incredible response of getting more and more people food lifts my spirits.\nThere’s a million reasons to be terrified right now. I mean, it feels like the world is coming to an end. So, what do we do? Well, we push back our sleeves, and we pick up litter and take food to the food pantry.\nWe’re powerless in a very big sense of the word, but we’re not helpless. We’ve been powerless before. I mean, during the Bush-Cheney time, the insanity of that, the war on Iraq and the torture. We came through—and we showed up and we rallied and we marched and we donated to the ACLU. We did what we, the people can do. The pendulum swung back, and the pendulum will swing back again. I mean, it’s a law of physics.\nLet me just add, my favorite sign is, “Now you’ve pissed off the grandmas.” Trump and his ilk are systematically destroying the lives of his supporters. I’m sorry for them.\nBut the cruelty of the Big Beautiful Bill and the cruelty of the clawback of the $9 billion—those are getting MAGA’s attention. This is breaking the trance for them. It’s shocking that Medicaid and Medicare are going to be taken away. Everybody, or at least a very healthy majority of people, are on the side of Medicare and Medicaid.\nSo that makes me happy on almost any given day, to watch Trump just destroying the illusions that his base had. Their terrible approval numbers, dropping weekly.\nPAW: In your book Help, Thanks, Wow, you write that your prayer on really tough days is “Help, thanks, wow!” Is that still your recipe for survival?\nAL: I got sober in 1986, and I realized that most of the time, all the sober alcoholics I knew were going around going either, “Help me, help me, help me,” or “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” because someone stepped in, or because they were going to drink and they didn’t, because of a generosity that someone offered them.\nI was just dirt poor. I lived on a 10-by-10 houseboat, and I was just going down the tubes. Then people would step in, and they would help me. I just started knowing that if I asked for help, someone would hear.\nOf course, I’m a very left-wing Christian, so I also would believe that God heard; but somebody with skin on would also hear and help me.\nFor a couple years, people drove me around, and people paid my rent after I got sober. So those prayers, “Help me, help me,” and “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” always seemed like they were enough.\nThen I had a baby without any money and without a husband or a partner. Oh, I just started to reexperience myself as a writer. I felt like the windshield had been cleaned. I started to realize that I was so much stronger than I thought I had been.\nSo, I added the prayer, “Wow.” I’d take my baby outside. I didn’t have stuff to buy him. I lived in the Redwoods, and we’d go, “Wow.” And a white butterfly would go by, and we’d go, “Wow.” And the seasons would change, and it was, “Wow, wow. Holy shit. God, it’s just so beautiful.”\nI’m still doing that daily. I mean, I read the paper and I watch cable news, and I go, “It’s all hopeless.” Then I go outside, and I go, “Wow, the monarchs have come back to California,” you know?\nPAW: You’ve written about struggling with terrible anxiety as a child. Yet still you have this incredible optimism. How do you manage?\nAL: My parents were very hip, very avant-garde intellectuals and progressives. That was a beautiful value to be raised with; we helped the underdogs. But I started getting migraines when I was 5, just from the stress of trying to hold my parents’ marriage together. I started getting teased in a really malicious way by the time I was 5, because I had this crazy hair. So I developed a sense of humor.\nI realized that if I could come up with a retaliatory line, I’d kind of win, or at least I’d even the playing field. Laughter has always been my salvation.\nI could just go under as fast as anybody because of the devastation and corruption and evil and cruelty. But I look around for what’s left.I think optimism can be a choice, a decision. That I am not going to let them defeat me. And I, every single day, no matter what, I’m going to offer myself as bread for the journey to people that are feeling even worse that day.\nThis old, old, old woman, probably the age I am now, but to me she was like [the actress] Jessica Tandy when I was 32, she said, “You take the action and the insight follows.” So the action is: I send money to the ACLU. I send money to our local public radio station. I’ll start writing postcards.\nPAW: In Almost Everything: Notes on Hope, you wrote about how you’ve battled to overcome political hatred. Are you still able to find forgiveness?\nAL: I have to notice that I’m the one that suffers with my lack of forgiveness. My pastor had quoted the great line of Dr. Martin Luther King’s, “Don’t let them get you to hate them.”\nI realized that my hate was making me crazy and toxic. Little by little I could remember and see that Trump is a man who has never been loved, except by his daughter, who he has suggested he would be glad to date. I have seen the utter devastation of that man’s soul and heart. There’s just nothing left but this Eveready bunny of evil and narcissism and cruelty. I can feel moments for him. And that’s kind of a miracle.\nNow, somebody could very easily say, well, what does that get you? Well, it helps me remember I’m not them. I’m the peace and love and compassion and generosity and all the values that he doesn’t have.\nSome days are just too long, and it feels like they get the upper hand. Then I wake up again and I return myself back to this path. I go to the food pantry, not for the people at the food pantry, but for my own soul. I give beyond my sense of comfort. I give because that heals me, which leads naturally to optimism.\nPAW: If you could speak to Trump’s supporters, what would you say?\nAL: The willingness to change comes from the pain. The pain I was in at 31 and 32 for my drinking and using is what helped me change. The pain that Trump is causing MAGA is what is going to get people to change.\nI would be together, really gladly. If I were with MAGA people, an action I can take is to get out Arlie [Russell] Hochschild’s book, Strangers in Their Own Land, and give it to people. In Hochschild’s book, she went there, and she listened. She shared her experience, strength, and hope. She ate with them. Combed their little kids’ hair for them. She showed up. She sat on their porches. She heard their fear.\nThat book has been an action verb for me. I’d say, did you read this book? This book is really beautiful. I would love for you to read it, and then we’ll talk about it. We’ll have a meal together. And if you have a book that captures why you feel, why you hated Obama or why you hated Joe Biden or Hillary, I will read that and then let’s get together and let’s have a little book club of two or three. Bring your friends. Let’s just see where the Venn diagram unites us in our humanity.\nPAW: You have a strong faith in God, that not all of us have. What would you say to readers who might ask how could a God allow such cruelty and injustice as what we are seeing now?\nAL: Well, it seems to be in the natural course of human life here that we’re greedy, and terrified, and Cain is still killing Abel, and always will. Power breeds corruption. Both Trump and Netanyahu are trying to stay out of prison.\nPopular\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →But every single wisdom tradition believes the exact same things: that we are here to do good, to help the poor. When we talk about God, we talk about goodness. We also talk about the great outdoors, G.O.D. It’s the Dalai Lama saying, “Kindness is my only religion.”\nLook at how that family [that lost their child to cancer or a school shooting] was surrounded and lifted up, how they have come through one day at a time, how we sat there and listened while they cried, how we didn’t get them to try to stop crying, how we made food for them, how we donated to organizations that are there for kids with cancer; how we took the action and the insight followed.\nAt some point, life pulls you back to your feet.

How do you take in the news and stay balanced?\nAL: I wish I had a better answer than this, but I’m just a total news junkie. I’m reading everything. The best I can do is I leave for walks without my phone. I do turn off my phone when I meditate. I do as much as I can without my phone every day as a radical act. I turn it off when I’m writing.\nI’m almost equally a proponent of radical self-care. So, all day, every day, I interrupt the toxic flow. We need to stay informed, too. So, where’s the balance there? How can we help?\nPAW: What do you think that the media should do to bridge the divide between the left and the right?\nAL: I just think that the awareness of the devastation Trump is doing to the people of America, to the poor, to the elders, to the middle class, to workers, to labor, to schools; it’s just happening.\nI think that what we do is we report it rather calmly, and we keep people abreast of when the next rally will be.\nWe show up, and we beat our pans, and we gather together. It’s the only thing that has ever changed the political ruin that we find ourselves in. [It] is the gathering of more, and more, and more people to say this is not who we are. You know, it’s we the people believe in common decency and the common good and the commonweal.\nWe bring people to those rallies who have never been to a rally before, because being at that rally, I can always guarantee people it’s going to be the happiest they’ve been in weeks.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "In Trump’s America, Vaccination Rates are Declining and Measles Is Spreading", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-rfkjr-vaccine-policy-measles-outbreak/", "text": "In Trump’s America, Vaccination Rates are Declining and Measles Is Spreading\nTrump and RFK Jr. have made every effort to undermine one of the major civilizing advances of the 20th century—our public health infrastructure\nNew data from the CDC suggests a grim back-to-school tradition emerging: In 2024, kindergarten vaccination rates declined for the fifth consecutive year. Meanwhile, vaccine exemptions reached a record high.\nThese statistics became all the more disturbing last fall when, shortly after 286,000 children began their educations without proof of full immunity against measles, a man who has bragged about never getting a flu shot was reelected to the presidency. Since then, the United States has contended with its largest measles outbreak in three decades, while the leaders who should be stamping out this crisis are instead fanning the flames. In just eight months, Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, have made every effort to undermine one of the major civilizing advances of the 20th century—our public health infrastructure. In doing so, they risk endangering millions of people and kick-starting a doom loop of mistrust from which it could take decades to recover.\nAs usual, the Trump administration’s stance on vaccines is motivated less by sincere populism and more by personal profit. Before Kennedy launched his own presidential campaign on a platform of “making America healthy again,” he earned $20,000 every week helming a nonprofit dedicated to fostering vaccine skepticism. Now in the cabinet, he has fired the entire CDC vaccine advisory panel and replaced it with a ragtag crew, half of whom have never published peer-reviewed research on vaccines. Just last week, Kennedy canceled $500m of federal funding for mRNA vaccines, which prevented 14 million deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic. And he has made these rollbacks while retaining a financial stake in ongoing litigation against a vaccine manufacturer.\nAll the while, the US has seen more than 1,300 measles cases and three deaths this year. In response, Kennedy has alternately endorsed and undermined the most effective method of prevention—widespread immunization.\nThe evisceration of funding has extended across the sciences, with Trump cutting support for research to a 35-year nadir. At the National Institutes of Health, 1,800 grants have been terminated, a move that the Government Accountability Office deemed illegal. The administration also continues to freeze grants to universities over culture-war phantasms like DEI, including $339 million at UCLA and $2.2 billion at Harvard. So it’s not surprising that 75 percent of US scientists polled by the journal Nature are considering leaving the country, which raises the prospect of a lost generation of American talent and lifesaving innovation.\nInternationally, Trump’s heartless and thoughtless budget cuts are causing devastation. The administration has dismantled USAID, one of the most successful preventers of contagious disease in history. In doing so, it defunded programs that vaccinated more than 800 million children against fatal illnesses like malaria. Researchers have found that 300,000 people have already died because of these cuts, which could lead to another 14 million preventable deaths over the next five years—all to gut an agency that managed the equivalent of 4 percent of the annual national defense budget.\nBack in the US, medical associations, local officials and individual doctors are collaborating to buy vaccines directly from manufacturers and lobbying insurance companies to continue covering the costs of those shots. Their efforts reflect a tried-and-true strategy to counter under-immunization. Before the current outbreak, Ronald Reagan–era cuts to public health caused a more widespread measles pandemic, with 27,000 cases in just 1990. But locally led outreach campaigns and grassroots vaccination programs turned back the crisis, as did an eventual restoration of federal funds under Bill Clinton’s administration.\nBudget cuts can be reversed, but trust may be more difficult to recover. Long before RFK Jr.’s ascendancy, disasters like the CDC’s infamous Untreated Syphilis Study at Tuskegee and the Food and Drug Administration’s glacial response to the AIDS crisis cast long shadows over public health institutions. Today, a plurality of Americans are already predicting that they will lose faith in medical guidance under the current administration. That would undermine the very basis of public health, which depends on people choosing to follow guidelines grounded in research they did not personally conduct and whose results they are ill-trained to parse.\nRepairing that breach will require years of effortful relationship-building, but it might also require rallying Americans with the classic tactic of patriotism. For all of Trump’s bellicose rhetoric, he misses that our nation’s most extraordinary scientific and medical advances have drawn bipartisan enthusiasm in part because they reinforced a perceived American exceptionalism. At the height of the cold war, RFK Jr.’s uncle chose to go to the moon, and Richard Nixon brought that dream to fulfillment. After Franklin Delano Roosevelt founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, Americans helped fund it by mailing in more than 2.5 million dimes, hence its christening as the March of Dimes. That money supported Jonas Salk’s development of the polio vaccine. Within two years of its introduction, annual cases of polio had fallen by 90 percent.\nEven Trump, who botched the initial response to Covid-19, managed to oversee the historic Operation Warp Speed. If only he could recognize that this is the kind of achievement which makes America great.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "MAGA Conservatives Are Terrified of the Future", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/society/maga-fear-future/", "text": "MAGA Conservatives Are Terrified of the Future\nTrump and his followers don’t just want to halt progress. They want to turn back the clock.\nAs pundits and political handicappers rallied to size up the impact of Donald Trump’s signature tax-and-spending bill, one of its defining features eluded them: The legislation graced with the taunting moniker “One Big Beautiful Bill” was in almost every respect a retread. Not just in that it rolls out unmerited tax cuts uniquely unsuited to prevailing economic conditions as a snake-oil panacea. In almost all of its provisions, the massive bill codified the disposition summed up in the Trump movement’s slogan “Make America Great Again”: a basic phobia of the future.\nIt bears noting that MAGA is itself a retread—a directive that Trump cribbed from Ronald Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign. The postwar conservative movement has always been a decisive break with America’s past, disowning the familiar image of the country as a frontier-driven agent of progress, dispensing massive outlays of resources to promote ambitious initiatives like the New Deal, the Marshall Plan, and the space program. True to that backward-spooling sentiment, the Trump spending plan eviscerates key federal efforts to confront pressing challenges of the future. Where the noted postwar conservative thinker William F. Buckley Jr. announced his ambition to stand athwart history and yell “Stop!,” the Trump movement has done him one better by pulling a lever and reversing course.\nConsider, for example, the greatest future-facing challenge before the planet: the existential threat of irreversible climate change. Trump’s bill eliminates the critical subsidies to solar and wind power that the Biden administration had won when the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 became the most far-reaching climate measure that any Western country has ever passed. In place of the desperately needed innovations Biden’s bill would have encouraged, the new bill restores the leasing of federal lands for oil, gas, and coal production. A report from Princeton University’s ZERO Lab and Evolved Energy Research calculates that by 2035, this reversion to traditional dirty energy sources will boost US carbon emissions by more than 1 billion tons—an increase of 20 to 25 percent over the totals projected under the Biden-era policies.\nThen there are the bill’s deeply regressive reversals of social spending—$1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid alone, as well as steep reductions in spending for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act and critical income supports such as SNAP. MAGA defenders of this cruel brand of social predation had trouble squaring it with the simultaneous extension of historic giveaways to the highest earners. They were left reviving the hoariest bootstrap exhortations to the non-wealthy, claiming that Medicaid work requirements, for example, will spur Americans to achieve great individual success. (Never mind that the vast majority of Medicaid recipients already work.) Faced with the material consequences of its own shoddy policymaking, the MAGA right has retreated further into the past, reprising a brand of discredited social mythology that crested in the late 19th century.\nMeanwhile, the bill also declares economic war on one of the more reliable channels of social mobility in modern America: an affordable college education. It eliminates the Grad PLUS program, established in 2006, which lets lower-income students in graduate programs and professional schools use federal loans to cover the full cost of tuition. Undergraduate federal loans that parents can take out on behalf of their child are now capped at $20,000 per year, with an aggregate limit of $65,000—a pittance in the face of spiraling college costs, and again a burden that will fall disproportionately on students from lower-income backgrounds.\nThese rollbacks are part of the debilitating horror that right-wing dogmatists experience before the workings of secular and skeptical inquiry—the prospect that the ownership of their children (and hence control of the future) will be wrenched from their grasp.\nThe spending bill’s draconian cuts are but a distilled version of the MAGA movement’s broader future-phobia. The administration’s authoritarian and increasingly unpopular mass deportation campaign seeks to conjure a principally white Anglophone workforce out of the ether, because that’s how ghouls like Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller—along with Trump himself—envision a “real America” restored to its full and natural sovereignty.\nThe same goes for Trump’s bedrock confidence that a restored tariffs regime—an outmoded economic palliative that also peaked in the 19th century—will magically revive American manufacturing when the country’s transformation into a service-based economy is well-nigh complete. The administration’s assaults on diversity programs, campus free speech, and public K-12 education all bespeak the same bid to conjure up an imagined community of uncomplicated, white-dominated institutional life—and to fiercely repudiate any program or initiative that acknowledges the country’s actually existing multiethnic makeup and multicultural future.\nIt was a fitting grace note to the spending bill’s passage that, just a few days later, a leak from the White House confirmed earlier reports that the Trump administration is set to impose brutal cuts to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration—the signature program of New Frontier liberalism. Trump then named Sean Duffy—the hack reality-TV star he’d appointed, to disastrous effect, to head the Department of Transportation—as NASA’s interim director, after realizing that his previous nominee to the post, the tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, was a close confrere of Trump’s excommunicated former “first friend” Elon Musk and an occasional Democratic donor to boot. It was a perfect MAGA set piece: a petty ideological purge that delivered control of publicly funded space exploration to a minor TV celebrity who’s afraid of riding the New York subway.\nWhen Trump’s insurgent 2016 campaign still looked to be a long-shot bid, his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton offered a typically anemic and unpersuasive rejoinder to his pet slogan, contending smugly that “America is already great.” Now that we are living through the implementation of the full MAGA agenda, it’s clear that her campaign would have been better off cribbing its riposte from the country’s first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln: “You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today.”\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "The Dangers and Absurdities of Trump’s DC Occupation", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/washington-dc-trump-occupation/", "text": "The Dangers and Absurdities of Trump’s DC Occupation\nTrump compels his followers to endorse obvious lies. It’s accelerating the country’s descent into authoritarianism.\nIt was 8 pm, humid, and I was by myself, across the street from where my kids went to elementary school, banging a large metal spoon against a pot. I was alone, because I had gotten the address wrong for a pots-and-pans demonstration against Donald Trump’s military occupation of Washington, DC. What I missed was a cacophonous community protest, one of many across parts of the DMV (DC, Maryland, and Virginia). After living in DC, I am now a five-minute walk across the border in Maryland. But my family works in DC, my neighbors (those who haven’t yet been laid off) work in DC, and our lives are wrapped up in a town suffering under another Big Lie.\nAs absurd as I felt doing a pots-and-pans solo performance while families looked at me quizzically, this now feels appropriate. It was no more absurd than proclaiming a crime epidemic in a city where crime has fallen significantly since 2023. It was no more absurd than being lectured about law and order by Justice Department officials covering up a child-sex ring that seems to involve their boss. It was no more absurd than a white, middle-aged Justice Department employee named Sean Dunn becoming a folk hero (no pun intended) for calling one of Trump’s troops a “fascist,” chucking a messy sandwich at close range into his chest, and then outrunning them in boat shoes. It was no more absurd than hearing Attorney General Pam Bondi, with her cross necklace big enough for an impromptu crucifixion, say that the sandwich guy with boat shoes is part of the “deep state” that she’s been tirelessly fighting.\nIt was no more absurd than the fact that the city’s Reichstag Fire was sparked by the alleged assault of an Elon Musk acolyte known as “Big Balls” by kids as young as 12 years old. It was no more absurd than seeing White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt being asked by white-supremacist gadfly, Russian stooge, and plagiarist Benny Johnson in an official White House press briefing if Big Balls would be getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It was no more absurd than hearing these oh-so-manly Republicans line up to say how scared they are to go work in the morning. Oklahoma Senator Markwayne Mullin, a brutish dolt who challenges liberal congressional witnesses to fistfights, said he doesn’t buckle his seatbelt in DC out of fear he’ll be carjacked. Representative Tim Burchett said he sleeps in his office, terrified of the city outside.\nWhether they are making themselves laughingstocks to prove their loyalty to Trump or because they actually live with this fear, I cannot imagine admitting such things publicly. They are fine with their kids thinking that Dad, in the most heavily policed part of the United States, is scared to leave his office. A cornerstone of white conservatism in 2025 is howling about the death of American “manhood” and extolling the virtue of the gun—all while confessing to being a coward.\nTrump says from the safety of the freshly paved-over Rose Garden, where his UFC ring will likely go, that we have “caravans of youth rampaging through city streets at all times of the day.” (Note the use of “caravan,” a descriptor usually saved for immigrants trying to cross the border. It’s Klan Mad Libs.)\nPlease listen to me: I am out here every day, and there are no “caravans of youth” looking to carjack Oklahoma senators with manhood issues. Instead, Trump is trying to nationalize what he did to the Central Park 5 and, just like with the Central Park 5, it’s a divisive lie. This is one more Big Lie, facilitated by Fox News, that Trump’s supporters need to believe. They crave for Trump to be their white knight, which is why he is desperate that they not reckon with his time on Epstein’s island. Trump needs to distract them, and he needs to suppress democratic revolt against a failing, increasingly unpopular agenda—and this move does both.\nThis is not about street crime. This is about the president’s public desire to militarily occupy cities in states with Democratic governors, put a final stake in the heart of democratic norms, and, most critically, do it all on fictitious terms. The key is to make people accept the lies so they become complicit. Crime-rate drops are irrelevant. Murder rates in red states are irrelevant. When you choose to believe the lie, then you find yourself defending it. When you defend it, you become a part of the harm it does. Trump getting people to believe what is untrue is the political version of getting more prints on the handle of a gun.\nDC is the perfect testing ground for this coup, because it doesn’t have statehood and only limited home rule. As longtime DC civil rights leader the Rev. Graylan Hagler told me, “We were already occupied by law enforcement making DC one of the most police-occupied cities in the country, with Capitol police, park police, transportation police, the FBI, the DEA, and the list goes on, and many of those agencies additionally having separate police departments of their own. Only the MPD [The Metropolitan Police Department] was under local control, and that no longer exists. With the National Guard on the streets and all local empowerment gone, we are a city and people living under martial law.”\nThis is why civil rights leaders like Reverend Hagler have long advocated for DC statehood: Because without it, DC residents are GOP prey. From charter schools to mandatory drug laws, a GOP-controlled Congress always treats DC as its own political laboratory. This is the end result: A federal tyrant running the city without any accountability. Banners hang from overpasses now with a tweak on the longtime slogan of both 1776 and the DC statehood movement: “No Occupation Without Representation.”\nThat occupation involves checkpoints, ICE raids, the terrorizing of unhoused people, and Washington Post interactive neighborhood maps so you can watch the seizure of the nation’s capital from the comfort of your couch. National Democrats and centrists have never taken the DC statehood movement seriously. The price for that will be paid well beyond the district’s borders.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "How Seattle’s Katie Wilson Launched Her Mayoral Campaign as a Social Movement", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/seattle-mayoral-election-katie-wilson/", "text": "How Seattle’s Katie Wilson Launched Her Mayoral Campaign as a Social Movement\nThe precariat is rising.\nWalking into Seattle mayoral candidate Katie Wilson’s election night party, I recognized very few people. The mainstream Democratic standard-bearers were all missing. In their place was a crowd of 20-, 30- and 40-year-olds, all excited and inspired by a candidate who spoke their language and lived their life. Throughout the night, it became a greater and greater exercise in power, new progressive pragmatic political power.\nSix months ago, the current mayor of Seattle, Bruce Harrell, was on a glide path to reelection. He had locked up union support, endorsements from Democrats across the board from the governor to Representative Pramila Jayapal, as well as business support. Bruce was and is a transactional, compromised, and “getting along” Democrat—listening to Amazon and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce as much as to actual voters. But two events made him stumble: the inauguration of Donald Trump and a Seattle ballot initiative in February for social housing funded by an excess compensation tax on corporations. Bruce did the bidding of Microsoft and Amazon and campaigned against the social housing initiative, with his face on all the opposition flyers. The result? It seems that the voters were angry with Trump, the oligarchs, and with Harrell for standing with them.\nThat election got Katie Wilson thinking that someone should challenge Bruce Harrell, and why not her? Katie lives in a one-bedroom apartment with her husband and 2-year old daughter. She does not own a car. For several years her wages were so low that she qualified for Medicaid. And in those precarious years of working for economic security for others while she herself had little, Katie was responsible for organizing minimum-wage increases across greater Seattle. She founded the Transit Riders Union and gained free transit for K-12 students and low-income residents of Seattle. She authored the Jump Start tax on corporations calculated as a percentage of total salaries more than $200,000.\nSo Katie launched her campaign as a social movement. She relied on Seattle’s unique Democracy Vouchers, through which every adult resident can contribute up to $100 from a city fund to candidates they support. With Democracy Vouchers, Katie stayed even with the mayor. And even though Harrell enjoyed outside PAC expenditures, Katie garnered over 50 percent of the vote, leaving Harrell behind at 42 percent. Just as in the Big Apple, it is not over yet, with both Katie and Bruce Harrell proceeding to the general election, thanks to Washington’s top-two electoral system, by which the top two primary vote–getters advance, regardless of party.\nThis election sent out more signals for and from the younger, disaffected, and financially stressed-out voters. The lone progressive City Council member, Alexis Mercedes Rinck, a 30-year-old former waitress (sound familiar?), won with 78 percent. The current City Council president, who just last year tried to roll back the minimum wage for gig workers, was losing by 22 percent to a progressive policy leader. The Republican City Attorney also lost by 22 percent to a progressive former federal prosecutor, Erika Evans, who refused to work for the Trump Justice Department. Even a sitting school board member, who is the policy director of the Seattle Chamber Commerce, has been beaten out by a little-known young mom.\nThe precariat showed its clout all around Puget Sound. In the mayoral race in Tacoma, Anders Ibsen, an early proponent of paid sick days and minimum-wage increases, easily outdistanced—by 20 percent—the second-place candidate backed by the realtors and apartment owners. In Bellevue, the progressive Democratic state senator beat a business Democrat two to one. In a battleground district, a newly appointed progressive Democratic state senator is leading a four-term Republican.\nIn greater Seattle, Girmay Zahilay, is the leading candidate for the King County executive, with 44 percent of the vote. Girmay was born in a refugee camp in Sudan and came to Washington state as a 3-year-old. Girmay wants to set up social housing for workers across King County. His general election opponent will be Claudia Balducci, a centrist Democrat, who received 30 percent.\nVoters in Seattle and the surrounding Puget Sound are angry and rebelling against Donald Trump and his allied oligarchs and corporations. These voters stand against crony capitalism. They fear the closing fist of fascism. They also reject the transactional politics of the Democratic establishment and the camouflaged (or not) Trump supporters and those who look the other way. These worker-citizens are not waiting to rise up—they are voting and saving our democracy.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

Sarah Sophie Flicker will explain –\nin a minute.\n[BREAK]\nEverybody who knows about resistance to Hitler knows about Denmark. The Danes rescued\nmore of their Jews than any other country, 99%. And Jews here learned at an early age that when\nHitler ordered the Jews of occupied Denmark to wear the yellow star, the King of Denmark and\nthe Prime Minister rode through Copenhagen on horseback wearing the yellow star themselves.\nAnd then everybody put on the yellow star.\nWe’re joined now by the great granddaughter of that Prime Minister, Sarah Sophie Flicker. She’s\nan organizer who works at the intersection of culture and politics, especially on abortion rights\nand gender justice. She’s a founder of the Women’s March on Washington and co-author of the\nWomen’s March official book, Together We Rise – a New York Times bestseller. In her new\narticle for The Nation, “The Danes Resisted Fascism, and So Can We” was number one on the\n‘most read’ list at thenation.com all weekend. Sarah Sophie Flicker, welcome to the program.\nSarah Sophie Flicker: Hi, Jon. Thanks for having me.\nJW: Like the rest of us, you learned that story about your great-grandfather and the King riding\non horseback through Copenhagen, defying Hitler by wearing the yellow star. It’s really an\nunforgettable story.\nSSF: It is an unforgettable story and was some sort of lighthouse for me and the work that I do\nnow. And I held fast to it my whole childhood, my whole young adulthood, and I really resisted\nresearching it because I loved it so much and, in my household, the sorry was true. And the few\ntimes I was like, well, why aren’t there any pictures? Or it was always like, it doesn’t matter. It’s\ntrue. I think we all knew it wasn’t entirely true and the truth as it turns out as I began researching\nit is in many ways far more powerful than the myth because nobody wore the yellow star. Not a\nsingle person, not the king, not my great grandfather who was a prime minister for the beginning\nof the war, not a single Jew. I’m half Danish, half New Jersey Jew all the way through and\nthrough. My parents now live in Denmark. My mom never became a citizen, so being Danish\nwas as animated to me in my youth as being American.\nJW: Over the years, you’ve heard a lot of other stories about your Danish family in World War\nII. Tell us about your aunts and uncles.\nSSF: Yeah, and these stories are all true. A majority of just regular people joined the resistance,\nand they joined the resistance without training, without prior knowledge of how to resist. They\njust did it and they did it – they sort of got in where they fit in. My grandfather, he was part of\nthe resistance, and what I was told was that he would sleep with his boots on so he could spring\ninto action immediately. Then I had an aunt who worked in a hospital, and it turns out hospitals\nwere a major point of resistance in Denmark. They did everything from fabricating medical\nrecords of Jewish people to say that they were too ill to travel, they hid people there, they\nsmuggled information. It was a hub of resistance. And my uncle Mogens was a pretty well-\nknown journalist in Denmark. And during the war, he smuggled information at a great risk and\nthen he went on to join one of the underground illegal papers.\nJW: The only part of the story of Danish resistance that I know is about the escape to Sweden.\nHow on Rosh Hashanah night in 1943, the Nazis ordered the roundup of all Danish Jews to\ntransport them to concentration camps. But a sympathetic German embassy official warned\nDanish leaders. They told Jewish leaders, and the Danes somehow got almost all the Danish\nJews, thousands of them passed SS patrols onto small fishing boats that ferried them to Sweden\n10 miles away, thousands of people. That story is true, but it was only one chapter in a longer\nhistory of resistance that you’ve been learning about and a history that you think has some good\nexamples for us facing Trump’s fascist moves. One of my favorite parts of the story that you tell\nthat I didn’t know anything about was the 10 Commandments for Danes.\nSSF: Yeah. When I finally was brave enough to release the fabricated story, and as Trump took\nhis second term and as an organizer, I thought, okay, I’m going to go against the Danish grain.\nThere’s a law in Denmark called the Jante law, which is the people’s law, which is you don’t\ncenter yourself. It really frowns upon ego, things that are very commonplace in the US, and that\nwas a big hurdle for me to get over because I was very much raised with that. And I think in\norganizing, we tend to believe collectively that it’s a group of people that do the best work. And\nso often it’s not a charismatic leader or one special, unique person. In researching all this, I\nstumbled on, it’s very hard to find this story of a 17-year-old resistance member named Arne\nSejr, let’s say, I’m probably mispronouncing it, and he wrote down with a pen and paper, I think\nit’s called the 10 Commandments for Danes, and they were just simple, straightforward, basically\njust don’t comply,\nJW: Don’t work for the Nazis, don’t shop in their stores, don’t believe the propaganda, protect the\npeople they persecute.\nSSF: And he made, I think he wrote down 25 copies, and he handed them to the notable\nmembers of his little village, and somehow these commandments went viral. Other people wrote\nthem down, eventually printing presses, printed them. And I think there were probably posters. I\nhave not been able to find an image of them, but we do have them written down. I think the one\nthat stands out to me the most is to protect whoever is being targeted. That just is a baseline. I\nthink that is always important to hear, but also, it’s clear from those commandments, this\nteenager is suggesting little things like if you are asked to do something that benefits the Nazis or\nhere it would be this administration, do bad work, work slowly, gum up the works, be a grain of\nsand, grind the whole thing to a halt. And people did that. And we don’t have to fix everything\nthat’s broken, but we can do one small thing a day. We can do a couple small things a week. We\ncan do one big thing. We can work up our courage after doing lots of little things to do a big\nthing. I mean, that’s how these things work. And so, the commandments feel so powerful because\nthey give us permission to do the right thing.\nJW: One of the great things about the Danish resistance is not just that its size, but the variety of\ninstitutions that were part of it. When the order came to deport all the Jews from Denmark, the\nstate Lutheran Church had a sermon read in every church supporting the Jews. A hundred\npercent of the ministers helped rescue the Jews, along with we’re told 90% of university faculty,\nmost of the doctors, you talked about the role of the hospitals and hiding Jews and helping them\nflee. So different institutions with completely different histories all did a different thing as a part\nof this resistance. And what about humor? Did the Danes tell jokes about Hitler?\nSSF: Of course, because fascists hate laughter more than bombs – that’s a paraphrase. But I was\nreally also inspired a few years ago by a book called Pranksters vs. Autocrats, which is written\nabout the Eastern European method of creating dilemma actions, which are basically just making\nwild fun in all the ways that you can of those people threatening to do these harms because they\ncan’t handle it. I mean, that’s the funny thing about all of this stuff is basically these are just\npeople with really fragile egos who are trying to assert their power because they don’t know how\nelse to feel important. Hannah Arendt wrote about that in Eichmann in Jerusalem, and I had read\nthat in college. I do not remember this whole chapter on Denmark, or at least a whole huge\nchunk of it about Denmark. And the phenomenal thing, I mean it fills my heart every time I even\nspeak about it that Hannah Rent wrote about was that beyond the things we’ve talked about so\nfar, there’s also this phenomena that, I don’t know a word for it, but her sort of idea was that the\nGerman soldiers, the SS soldiers who were stationed in Denmark over time, their belief system\nwas run down by this wall of morality that they were faced with every day, be it being made fun\nof every day because certainly people were making fun of all the soldiers stationed there every\nsingle day, whether it was people asking them, how do you live with yourself?\nHow are you doing this? And our rents thesis was that over time they started questioning their\nown morals and their own belief systems and big number of German soldiers stopped complying\nwith Hitler at that point.\nJW: And you think it’s possible that we could do something similar with ICE agents and with\nlocal police, that instead of throwing stuff at them, you say, talk to them, ask them some\nquestions, and what do you suggest this attempted conversation should be like?\nSSF: There’s so many beautiful videos out there right now of people filming ICE agents, of\nphysically getting in the way of them taking people of all these various ways that people are\ninterfering with this machine and trying to grind it to a halt. But the thing that you hear in almost\nevery video is there will be some voice in the background saying’, do you have a family?’ ‘How\ndo you live with yourself?’ ‘Why are you wearing that mask? What are you ashamed of?’ ‘If\nyou’re so proud of this, show your face,’ whatever it is. I think it is part of a bigger tactic, and I\npersonally am a huge fan of the people that are throwing glitter, glitter at the ICE agents because\nglitter doesn’t come off and it’s a pretty good marker of someone who’s up to some serious evil.\nJW: So right now, ICE has this huge budget to recruit tens of thousands of new members.\nThey’re having a hard time. They’ve had to increase the sign-up bonus to $50,000. They’ve\nlowered the admissions criteria. I asked AI, how can you discourage people from applying for\nthe new ice jobs? And I want to tell you the AI answer: “counter the recruiting message\ncampaigns: expose the realities, share firsthand accounts from former ICE employees to\nhighlight the psychological toll, the moral conflicts and public backlash associated with the job.\nChallenge ICE’s recruitment slogan, ‘defend the homeland.’ with facts about deportation rates,\nfamily separations and civil rights concerns. Undermine the appeal by highlighting career risk,\nstress, the long-term reputational damage of working for a controversial agency. Emphasize the\npotential for legal scrutiny; expose internal issues: point to the high burnout rates, internal\ndissent and whistleblower cases. Share reports of toxic workplace culture.”\nSSF: Wow, AI! I mean, that’s its own set of commandments right there. I have to believe that\nthere’s a way to touch people caught up in this stuff. It’s so heartening to see this movement\nbuilding. When I stood on the stage of the Women’s March in 2017 in DC, that was beautiful, but\nI remember thinking, where were you all three months ago? And where will you all be a year\nfrom now? And I think we’re finally moving in a direction that’s building, which is the correct\nway. And I think we can see the tides are shifting. We can see that it is not simple, and it\ncertainly takes courage, but like people in Denmark, and I would say people here, it’s like, be\nscared, but do it anyway, and do a little bit. Download Five Calls, have that be your first thing\nthat you do, and just that’s a great app that tells you exactly who to call, what to say on what day.\nI think that courage is contagious, and inertia is sort of what allows these things to happen. While\nDenmark is so different from the us, it’s a tiny little country. There is this history. My great\ngrandfather came up with a term called samfundssind, which I’m saying totally wrong, but it\nmeans “community-mindedness” and it’s a through line in Denmark, and certainly they don’t do\neverything perfectly. And there’s many things that I’m disappointed in with my homeland right\nnow, but there is this undercurrent of ‘we protect each other, we take care of each other, and that\neverybody deserves equality and dignity.’ And I would say the thing that scares me a little about\nthe US is we have such an individual, of course, like American exceptionalism and individualism\nand all this. And I think it’s time for us to pass that aside for now. We can revisit it and talk about\nit later, but we don’t all have to agree on everything right now. But we do have to agree that\nevery life is a universe. And that is something that I was taught as a Jewish kid, a Jewish socialist\nkid. Every life is a universe, and the onus is on us to protect that. And so when I think about the\ncommandments, the Danish commandments, and should there be US commandments, I think\nthat has to be the through line. And there’s so many ways that we can take action.\nJW: And I understand you’re working on Ten Commandments for us right now.\nSSF: Yeah, it just seemed sort of obvious when I stumbled on the commandments and I\nimmediately brought them to all these organizers that I work with who I respect so much, and\neach with their own area of expertise. And we realized, oh, these commandments are so\napplicable to the US if we just play around with the language a little bit. And then because we\nhave the benefit of technology, which doesn’t always feel like a benefit, but for these purposes it\ncan be. There’s plenty of good things we can do with technology. We are thinking that there\ncould be a QR code that takes you to a resource page with a menu of options where people can,\nwhen we think about resistance, it sounds like something you need to know something about, or\nyou need to have studied. You don’t. I think about this all the time. I have three kids. If you’re a\nmom and you’ve organized a birthday party, you know how to organize.\nJW: One last thing: the Danes resisted Hitler almost unanimously. And since then, scientists tell\nus that Danes are just about the happiest people in the world. Lately they’ve ranked number two\non the World Happiness Index, according to the scientists of world happiness. This year, the\nUnited States is number 24. And by the way, Mexico is number 10, far ahead of the United\nStates. So the Danes are together, they take care of each other, and it makes them happy.\nSSF: Yeah, I mean, it’s not perfect, again, and I don’t want everyone coming and screaming at me\nabout all the ways that Denmark is imperfect, I’m well aware. But they have a very robust social\nsafety network. And my great grandfather, Prime Minister Stauning, was the first working class\nprime minister of Denmark. And he was the person that kind of brought democratic socialism to\nDenmark. And when you have a child, the father takes paternity leave, the mother gets robust\nmaternity leave, a nurse comes to your house with supplies and checks in on you. My dad is\nchoosing to live the last decades of his life there with my mom, and he has some health issues.\nThere are people begging to come to their house, to clean, to do physical therapy, to drive him to\nnature, whatever it is. These are things that we deserve, nice things, and we deserve to live with\ndignity and joy and equality.\nAnd I’ve been working on the Mamdani campaign in New York, and the night of the primary\nwas just such a joyful night, like joy I haven’t felt in a while politically. And I just remember\nrepeating to people like, ‘look, we can have nice things. We can have nice things!’ And I just\nhope that people who are socialism dubious maybe take a little time to do some research because\nit’s actually a really beautiful way to live and makes people feel happy and seen, and they want to\ntake care of each other because that’s sort of implicit to the whole system.\nJW: Sarah Sophie Flicker – you can read her wonderful article. “The Danes Resisted Fascism,\nand So Can We,” at thenation.com, where it was number one on the most popular list all\nweekend. Sarah, thanks for all your work – and thanks for talking with us today.\nSSF: Jon, thank you so much. This has been really wonderful.\n[BREAK]\nJon Wiener: Donald Trump is demanding that UCLA pay a $1 billion fine as a penalty for\nantisemitism on campus. That’s on top of a $584 million cut in grants his administration ordered,\nmostly for medical research. For comment, we turn to David Myers. He’s a distinguished\nprofessor at UCLA where he teaches Jewish history. He’s written for The LA Times op-ed page,\nThe Forward, and The Atlantic, and he’s been an activist working for Mid-East Peace for\ndecades. David Myers, welcome back.\nDavid Myers: Good to be with you Jon.\nJW: A $1 billion fine for not doing enough to protect Jews on campus – why not $1 trillion? If\nTrump really cared about antisemitism, why let UCLA off the hook for a billion?\nDM: [Laughter] You’re right by that logic. Why settle for a billion?\nTo ask a billion dollars of a public university is really an act of really breathtaking audacity, but I\nthink it reflects a strategy to dismantle the remarkable edifice of higher education that has been\nbuilt up so fastidiously and successfully over the course of centuries. So as to further the political\nagenda of the Trump regime.\nJW: I want to go back to the beginning at UCLA, the Gaza encampment on campus. It was in the\nplaza outside Powell Library. That’s what all this really is about. It was up for about a week at\nthe end of April last year, and there was that terrible night of violence. You and I talked about it\nhere right afterwards.\nDM: April 30 th .\nJW: April 30th, 2024, a mob of Zionist militants came from off campus and attacked the\nencampment. Remind us what happened.\nDM: April 28th, which was a Sunday, there was a counter demonstration, pro-Israel counter\ndemonstration directly across from the pro-Palestine Gaza encampment, and already there saw\non the fringes of the two encampments tensions beginning to boil over. I was present for hours,\nreally trying to separate the two groups. The far greater part of hostility came from the pro-Israel\nside in terms of what I experienced, and in some sense, this was maybe for some, kind of a\ntesting of the capacity to harass — and in the next two days, to actually undertake significant acts\nof violence against the pro-Palestine encampment — because that’s what we saw two days later.\nIn any event, what did happen on the 30th is that a group of violent pro-Israel thugs set\nthemselves upon the encampment, tearing down some of its walls, throwing in smoke bombs,\nbeating people with wooden planks as well as their fists.\nAnd really remarkably, they were permitted to do so for almost four hours without any police\nintervention, even though there was a contingent of University of California police observing\nfrom a distance. It’s ironic that what has emerged out of all that we have been talking about so\nfar, and we will talk about, is the allegation of antisemitism. I believe that there were acts of\nantisemitism on our campus in the aftermath of October 7th, 2023, and I also believe that there\nwere acts of anti-Palestinian discrimination on our campus after October 7th. What happened on\nApril 30th, 2024, was by far the most egregious act of harassment and intimidation that I’ve\nwitnessed in my career at UCLA, in my 34 years at UCLA, and certainly in that terrible period\nthat began with10/7.\nJW: After the encampment was taken down by the police, a small group of Jewish students and\none Jewish professor sued the school, and the Trump Justice Department investigated, and\nconcluded that “Jewish and Israeli students at UCLA were subjected to severe, pervasive and\nobjectively offensive harassment that created a hostile environment by members of the\nencampment.” I’m sure you know this by heart by now. And this was a violation of the\nConstitution’s Equal Protection Clause and also a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1965 Title\nVI. I wonder if you agree with that and with the Department of Justice statement that, even after\nJewish students complained of a ‘hostile environment,’ UCLA acted with “deliberate\nindifference” towards Jewish students. and that the result is that UCLA is guilty of “putting\nJewish Americans at risk.”\nDM: That wasn’t what I observed on campus, and that’s not what I understood to be the case. As\nI took a step back and tried to analyze what had gone on, I believe that there were acts of\nantisemitism. The most memorable one that comes to mind is a papier-mâché pig holding a bag\nof money and a figurine in a kaffiyeh in cage with a Star of David at the bottom of the papier-\nmâché statue, placed out in front of the meeting of the Board of Regents.\nSo I think there were indeed episodes like that and other instances in which pro-Israel students\nwere subjected to harassment or required to divert their path to a class by going around the\nRoyce Quad. I think those things did occur, and I’m not in agreement with the strategies that\nwere reflected in them, but between that and the claim that they’re ‘serious and pervasive\nantisemitism,’ there’s a considerable distance and that I did not see.\nI did not see the pervasiveness of it. I saw what I would consider egregious acts of antisemitism,\nalbeit very isolated, and the whole narrative of the ongoing continuous, pervasive, unrelenting\nnature of anti-Jewish harassment and intimidation is not something that I saw, or heard of from\nthe students with whom I spoke. And so, I was surprised by the nature of the claims made by the\nthree students and professor in the lawsuit.\nI was also surprised that there was a kind of conflation between their commitment to Zionism\nand what they described as their religious faith, as if the two were identical, something which\nreally stood at the center of that lawsuit. And I was surprised, frankly, at some level that UCLA\nagreed to settle, at another level, not. Insofar as the question of whether there was merit to these\nclaims of serious pervasive discrimination, I am quite skeptical about that. Insofar as UCLA\nwanted to put an end to the lawsuit and demonstrate its bona fides in combating antisemitism. I\ncompletely understand it.\nThe great irony is that, hours after the settlement was announced, the Department of Justice\nissued letter telling UCLA that it had planned to cut $584 million of research funds enormously\nsignificant to the wellbeing of the university — and for that matter, the wellbeing of our city and\ncountry, because much of that money was going to medical research. So that sequencing of the\nsettlement announcement and then the DOJ proceeding with this massive punitive act against\nUCLA leads one to ponder what could the possible motivation be, if not something other than\ncombating antisemitism.\nJW: One other thing about the DOJ finding: they concluded that UCLA allowed pro-Palestinian\nactivists to “enforce” what it termed a “Jew exclusion zone,” namely the encampment outside the\nlibrary. Now, my understanding is that Jews were not excluded from the encampment. Lots of\nJews joined the encampment, because they support Palestinian rights, and they opposed what the\nNetanyahu government was doing in Gaza. So what about this DOJ finding of a ‘Jew exclusion\nzone’ at UCLA?\nDM: Well, I think you’ve hit the nail on the head by calling the fact that there are many Jews in\nthe encampment — and many Jews who were encampment-adjacent, who felt considerable\nsympathy with the pro-Palestine movement but may not have been in the encampment. And that\nI think bespeaks the diversity of opinion within the Jewish community around Israel-Palestine\nand the post 10/7 world. And so often in this discourse that has emerged, the focus is exclusively\non those who represent the pro-Israel position. Were people who were identifiably pro-Israel\nprevented from gaining access to the encampment? I believe they were. Were people subject to\nquestioning about their political beliefs in order to get into the encampment or the ways in which\nthey might or might not behave well in the encampment? I believe they were. Was it a significant\ninconvenience? Yeah, it depends how you understand significant. But yeah, people had to go\naround the Royce quad if they didn’t pass, if they weren’t willing to pass through the entry point\nof the encampment, that was an inconvenience.\nJW: Now, I understand that this is not the only time that students have been forced to walk\naround something in order to get to their destination. There are movie shoots at UCLA often that\nrequire—\nDM: Construction – there are movie sites all the time. So was it an inconvenience? Yes, I think it\nwas. Did it amount to ‘pervasive and severe antisemitism’? My own sense is no, it didn’t. Were\nthere acts of antisemitism on our campus in this period? There were. Was it pervasive and\nserious? I don’t think that case can be made.\nJW: So as you said, UCLA agreed to settle this case. They paid three Jewish students and a\nmedical school professor six and a half million dollars, although the money went to all kinds of\nJewish organizations, not just to them.\nAnd then as you say, Trump cut federal funding to UCLA research by $584 million as a\npunishment–he says for the harassment around the encampment that some Jewish students\nreported. The medical researchers of course, who have had their funding suspended, didn’t have\nanything to do with the Gaza encampment, and many of them in fact are Jewish themselves.\nAmong those whose grants were cut, according to The L.A. Times, was Judea Pearl, a UCLA\ncomputer scientist, the principal investigator of a $1.2 million suspended grant to apply genetics\nto large scale electronic health records. He said, “I’ve been a principal investigator for NSF for\nmaybe 50 years.” Who is Judea Pearl?\nDM: Judea Pearl is a distinguished computer scientist, longstanding member of the faculty, and\nfather of the murdered Wall Street Journal journalist Daniel Pearl, who was brutally killed in\nPakistan by terrorists. And Professor Pearl has been a very strong advocate for Israel, for\nZionism and for the position that antisemitism is a very serious problem on our campus and he\nhimself — I had some exchange with him — believes that this attempt to shake down the\nuniversity has no merit. He certainly would like the university to do more to combat what he sees\nas antisemitism, but even someone from his perspective, as far as I understand it, believes that\nthere’s no connection between the attempt to fine the university a billion dollars or cut $584\nmillion in research grants and the attempt to combat antisemitism.\nIt’s what I think of as a conceptual non-sequitur. It doesn’t make any sense. There’s no evident\nconnection between the two propositions. It seems, as I said at the outset, to be a case of trying to\nbring the university to heel in order to advance a political agenda, which is to remove a very\nsignificant bastion of liberal democratic values at a time of what seems to be a kind of takeover\nof the American democratic way. Imperfect as it is. But at this point we should fight for it — to\nthe last.\nJW: So the governor said the state will fight the one billion fine and the $584 million cuts in\nresearch funding with lawsuits. But there’s also some talk from the office of the president of the\nuniversity about negotiating with Trump’s people in search of a settlement. Of course, Columbia\nagreed to pay the Trump administration $220 million. Harvard is in court and also in negotiations\nover a settlement. And The New York Times reported on Tuesday they were considering paying\nTrump $500 million. But of course, those are private universities with endowments in the\nbillions. UCLA is a public, taxpayer supported school. UCLA argued in federal court in San\nFrancisco just on Tuesday, that what Trump is doing is illegal and unconstitutional. And it’s the\nsame argument has been made by dozens of lawyers and found to have merit by dozens of\nfederal judges — that it’s against the law for the president to refuse to spend funds appropriated\nby Congress, namely the research funds that he has cut – that’s clearly illegal. The president just\nlacks this authority, and the courts agree with that interpretation of the law, but that’s going to\ntake a while: The government will then appeal this, and it’ll get to the Supreme Court, I dunno, in\n2026 or something like that. And in the meantime, 1800 NIH grants are suspended. Can UCLA\nwait until 2026 or 2027 for this to be resolved?\nDM: Not without paying an enormous cost and not without enormous cost to the public, which\nwill be the principal victim of this criminal operation. It’s really hard to see how we go on with\nthat massive loss. We will find a way. I will say that UCLA is an aggregation of some of the\ngreatest scholarly talent that I’ve ever witnessed in my life, at every corner of the university. And\npeople I think are feeling at once deeply dismayed by this assault upon such an important pillar\nof higher education in the United States, and at the same time quite resilient. We’re not going to\nsubmit to the attempt to tear down our university.\nJW: The LA Times report on the litigation had a subhead, “negotiation still possible.” The\nalternative, of course, is a deal. You referred to the deal that Harvard is about to make. We are\ntold Harvard would agree this deal: Harvard would agree to pay $500 million, not to the\ngovernment directly, the way Columbia’s deal works, but that Harvard would agree to spend\n$500 million on vocational programs and research. And in addition, Harvard would see its\nresearch funding restored and avoid the appointment of a Trump monitor. Important goals. Of\ncourse, Harvard has a what? 60-something billion-dollar endowment. UCLA is a public\ninstitution supported by taxpayers through the legislature and the governor. Can you imagine\nUCLA making a deal like the one Harvard is working on? What would this be? UCLA would\ngive millions of dollars to LA Trade Tech College, or something like that?\nDM: Well, supporting vocational education is a worthy cause and I encourage the federal\ngovernment to do that with the resources that it collects from us in the normal ways, not by\nshaking down institutions and really attempting to cripple them in the name of this very patently\ntransparent political agenda.\nI suspect given the way things have gone with other institutions, that there will be some\nsettlement. My fervent hope is that it is not at the level of what has been discussed in Harvard’s\ncase — a half a billion dollars – because, while Harvard has a 53 or 54 billion endowment, we\nhave nowhere near that.\nI also have to say that it’s just patently wrong that we are compelled to accede to these absolutely\noutlandish, audacious and baseless claims.\nAnd yet in the way things have been unfolding, he has tremendous leverage. He’s an enormously\npowerful president, perhaps the most powerful in all of American history. He’s arrogated to\nhimself all sorts of rights that don’t belong to the executive. I fear that in this environment, a\nsettlement will be reached, and it will be very large. California is a big target. UCLA is a top rate\nof public university in the United States. It’s a win. These are not just moneymaking propositions\nfor Trump. These are enormously significant symbolically. If you take down Harvard and you\ntake down UCLA, you have significantly disabled higher education in the United States. It’d be\nvery hard for any institutions after that to resist.\nJW: And there’s one other problem with making a deal with Trump. We know that negotiating\nwith Trump doesn’t end with making a deal. Even in his real estate days, banks stopped wanting\nto deal with him because deals with Trump are just one more step in the negotiation. And the\nidea that this is a normal agreement where both sides fulfill their responsibilities, this has not\napplied to Trump in the past. So I don’t quite see where the confidence comes at Columbia or\nHarvard or Brown or any of these other places that they’re actually going to get their money. OR\nmaybe Trump will come up with new findings of new offenses. What do you think?\nDM: I have no confidence that he won’t continue to litigate it over and over again and claim\nviolations and therefore withhold funds. He may be a master of the art of the deal as he\nunderstands it, but he is not someone who respects the ethics of a deal making at all. Meaning\nyou engage in difficult, often brutal negotiations, you shake hands, and it’s over. And as you said,\nthat’s just not the way he operates. And there’s something enormously unethical in his version of\ndeal making.\nAnd I would say I’m not only fearful of the fact that there won’t be continued demands made on\ninstitutions that have already agreed to settlements, but there’ll be continuous demands that there\nbe monitors over the operation of research and scholarship at our institutions. Some institutions\nhave made deals to stall the possibility of having monitors imposed on this or that domain of\ntheir scholarly operation. I’m not at all convinced that that demand will be surrendered. I think\nbehind Trump there is someone who has a vision which is more than just moneymaking. It’s\nreally about the opposite of viewpoint diversity as they so often claim, it’s viewpoint uniformity,\nwhat the left is always accused of. I think that’s really what they’re after. And if monitors are an\neffective way to achieve that, I’m quite convinced that we’ll see that in our time.\nSo I have no confidence that the deals that are made, either on financial terms or in terms of the\ndegree of scholarly supervision, intellectual supervision will be upheld on their end.\nJW: You’re part of a group called Jewish Bruins in defense of UCLA that has just been\norganized. Tell us about this group and about your open letter.\nDM: Yeah, so really just a small number of people with whom I spoke just this past weekend felt\nit was important in symbolic terms to demonstrate to the wider public that, as Jews, as proud\nJewish members of the UCLA community, we do not accept the terms that have been imposed\nupon UCLA — that in exchange for repairing some broken system that permits antisemitism, we\nshould pay a billion dollars in fines. We don’t accept that paying the United States government at\nthis point in time will do anything to diminish antisemitism on our campus or in society. And at\nthe same time, we don’t accept that antisemitism is raging and rampant on our campuses. So we\nput together a letter. And here I have to say that our intention was to appeal to people from my\nperspective to Judea Pearl’s perspective. So we didn’t talk about whether we think antisemitism is\nor is not a serious and pervasive problem. We just said we find the association made between this\nrequest for a billion dollars and claims of antisemitism on campus to be specious. And we just\nput the letter out yesterday and we have several hundred signatories. And if people are interested\nin signing on, if you have a connection to UCLA, you can go to my Facebook page and find that\nletter and I encourage you to sign it.\nJW: The website is called ‘Jewish Bruins in defense of UCLA.’ It’s a Google doc. Here’s the\nlink: http://www.sites.google.com/view/jewishbruins – one word.\nDM: I think it is important that we stand up. We as Jews stand up in defense of UCLA.\nJW: David Myers – he’s a distinguished professor at UCLA who teaches Jewish history.

{"title": "“Unbelievably Disrepectful”: Trump Sends Troops to Newsom’s Big Beautiful Press Conference", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/disrepectful-trump-troops-california/", "text": "“Unbelievably Disrepectful”: Trump Sends Troops to Newsom’s Big Beautiful Press Conference\nThe symbolism of the Border Patrol’s gratuitous display wasn’t lost on the leadership of the Japanese American National Museum, where the event was held.\nWe’ve seen flashes of Trump administration fascism all over the country recently, from his takeover of the Washington, DC, police department and his National Guard deployment there to the ongoing arrests and removal of law-abiding immigrants with court dates at New York’s Federal Plaza, to raids at Home Depots and car washes in Los Angeles. On Thursday, though, there was a gratuitous display of federal muscle at a Los Angeles event that had nothing to do with crime or immigration: a press conference by California Governor Gavin Newsom and other state officials announcing plans to redistrict his state, and create more Democratic congressional seats, if the Texas GOP goes ahead with its plans to do the opposite.\nDozens of masked and armed Border Patrol agents turned up at the press conference, held at the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo. Regional Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino declared that his crew was making “Los Angeles a safer place, since we don’t have politicians who can do that. We do that ourselves.” Some of his men brandished rifles.\n“They decided they were going to come and thumb their nose in front of the governor’s face,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters. “That’s unbelievably disrespectful. It’s a provocative act.”\nNewsom, who’s been trolling Trump on social media, imitating his ludicrous, all-caps braggadocio, immediately posted via his press office on X: “BORDER PATROL HAS SHOWED UP AT OUR BIG BEAUTIFUL PRESS CONFERENCE! WE WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED!”\nFlanked by Senators Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff, Newsom also mocked Trump during his remarks on redistricting. “Who else sends ICE [at the] same time we’re having a conversation like this?“ Newsom said. ”Someone who’s weak. Someone who’s broken. Someone whose weakness is masquerading as strength.”\nThe symbolism of the Border Patrol’s harassment wasn’t lost on the chair of the museum, William Fujioka. The museum sits on the site where Japanese Americans who lived in Los Angeles “were told to come here and put on buses and sent to camps,” he said, calling the show of force “a parallel of what happened in 1942.”\nWhile Democrats nationally appreciate Newsom’s bold maneuver—New York’s Kathy Hochul, Illinois’s J.B. Pritzker, and Maryland’s Wes Moore have all expressed interest in similar moves—his redistricting initiative, which he’s labeled the “Election Rigging Defense Act,” isn’t a given to pass when Democrats put it on the ballot this November. It’s underwater with all voters, especially independents, after Newsom and other Democrats have spent years pushing for an independent bipartisan commission to draw congressional boundaries, a system imposed in 2010. The governor insists that he has to fight “fire with fire,” and if GOP states stand down on their plans to gerrymander more seats, California will retain the current system.\nOn Tuesday, hundreds of Angelenos, many wearing union T-shirts, protested ICE abuse at MacArthur Park. Protesters told of even legal immigrants being afraid to leave their houses, and of dwindling business for local shopkeepers. “This is a hunting of people,” said a local resident of 40 years, who lost his garment industry job due to ICE raids. He describes “panic” at “the thought of being detained and being separated from my family.” Still, he came out to protest anyway.\nOn Thursday, only one man was detained by the Border Patrol near the press conference: a worker named Angel delivering strawberries to a Little Tokyo courthouse. (Dozens of Border Patrol agents, one detainee. Great work, chief Bovino!) Coworker Carlos Franco came to check on Angel and found him taken away, his delivery van still parked outside the museum.

{"title": "“This Is a Hunting of People”: LA Protesters Turn Out to Resist ICE", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/los-angeles-resist-immigration-raids/", "text": "“This Is a Hunting of People”: LA Protesters Turn Out to Resist ICE\nHundreds of Angelenos took to the streets Tuesday to show support for their neighbors and coworkers who are being targeted during ICE’s raids.\nSince June 7, when Donald Trump deployed thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of marines to Los Angeles to back up ICE’s increasingly confrontational strategies against the immigrant community, local residents have taken to the streets in protest of the administration’s immigration raids and vast infringement on their rights.\nWhen mainstream media isn’t ignoring the protests, the coverage has all too often echoed the narrative of violence pushed by the administration, or, alternatively, one of passivity, of a populace either too cowed or too disinterested to react. But, on the ground, in the neighborhoods that have borne the brunt of this assault, immigrant rights organizers, trade unions, and community groups have been feeling their way toward building a resistance movement against the sweeps.\nThese protesters, who refuse to go silently into the night of American reaction, are the heroes of our age. They are the US equivalent of the Central and South American women who, for decades, took to the streets to draw attention to the disappearance of their loved ones. One day, if there is any arc of justice, they will be recognized as such.\nOn Tuesday, hundreds of people headed to MacArthur Park, where last month federal authorities carried out an extraordinary cavalry and armored vehicle show of force, to reclaim the space. Many of the demonstrators wore Unite Here Local 11 red T-shirts. Others, who had walked out of their jobs in local fast food restaurants to protest the escalating immigration crackdown, wore purple SEIU shirts. And still others wore shirts bearing the logo of the Garment Worker Center, an organization representing low-wage garment workers, with or without legal status, around the metropolis. There were representatives from immigrant rights groups such as CHIRLA, and from know-your-rights legal networks.\nTwenty-seven-year-old Amalinalli, a US citizen, stayed away from her McDonald’s shift that morning in solidarity with her neighbors and coworkers who were targeted during the raids. “A lot of people are too afraid to go to work,” she said, “so work is slow. They cut your hours back or have less people per shift; it’s a mental and emotional safety issue.” Even though Amalinalli is a citizen, she fears that she will be detained because of the color of her skin and the sound of her name. “There was an ICE raid on Wednesday or Thursday just a few blocks from this park, near Home Depot,” she said. “They took a few people just walking down the street. Just grabbed them, you know, like you pick up a water bottle to go.”\nAnother McDonald’s worker, Candi, originally from El Salvador, talked about seeing one of her coworkers cry about the prospect of being arrested and deported. “I had never seen a man cry, but I did at work. And that really impacted me. My coworker who was crying actually quit his job. He said he would rather sell all of his belongings than be arrested by ICE.” Candi talked about how quiet and empty her neighborhood streets had become. “The community is now avoiding going outside. They’re avoiding going to do errands. They ask their neighbors who are able to go outside to help them.”\nCandi has seen military vehicles on the streets; she has seen masked men, not wearing official uniforms, arresting people in the streets. “Everyone’s choosing not to go out,” says a woman from Mexico who works for an airline-catering company. “It’s very quiet. The stores, everything’s quiet.” The lady she used to see selling tamales outside of the local grocery store has vanished. Other mom-and-pop businesses are closing their doors, either driven out of business by the lack of clientele or hunkering down and hoping that more tolerant times return.\nThis is the ancillary consequence of the ICE raids: As customers and entrepreneurs avoid going out in public, the masked agents are rending the fabric of LA’s immigrant neighborhoods, leaving economic devastation in their wake. MacArthur Park, the surrounding streets of which used to be filled with the hustle-bustle of street vendors and peddlers, is eerily denuded these days, the park and the streets adjacent to it populated now mainly by the homeless and the mentally ill. Immigrants still live in the buildings surrounding the park, but those immigrants are lying as low as possible.\nTuesday’s protest helped to expose the heartbreak that is too often left invisible when people are forced to go into hiding in an effort to avoid being detained and deported.\nFifty-six-year-old Javier Garcia (a pseudonym) told me the government’s assault “spiked a panic in me.” Garcia has been in Los Angeles for the past four decades, since leaving his home in Mexico’s Guerrero State as a teenager. For many years, he bounced from one insecure job to the next, in an array of different industries. Then he settled into garment work. For more than 20 years, now, he has earned his income in the city’s garment factories, rarely earning more than $15,000 a year.\nSince June, Garcia has been unable to work, both because some of the factories where he was accustomed to picking up piece work have shuttered to avoid ICE raids, and also because he is increasingly concerned about being detained and deported. Like so many of the people I talked to, he has largely vanished from public spaces, spending almost all of his time inside his family’s apartment, where he lives with his wife, their daughter and their grandson, and relying on occasional financial assistance from the Garment Worker Center’s Immigrant Defense Fund. He’s fallen behind on the rent and doesn’t know how he’ll make ends meet over the coming months.\nIt is clear that it took an extraordinary act of personal courage for Garcia to participate in the public protest. After all, despite recent court rulings mandating that ICE and other agencies stop their roving snatch-squad operations, numerous accounts indicate that it’s business as usual for the masked secret police.\nThe agents have been terrorizing California for months, with operatives violently seizing people, including elderly men, in Home Depot parking lots, car washes, and numerous other locations. These stories, and the video footage shot by byestanders, show how Trump’s secret police are operating in broad daylight; craven cowards who hide their faces as they do their dirty work, all while armed to the teeth as they terrorize the poor, the vulnerable, the marginalized. They are images that should shock the conscience of every American.\nGarcia knew just where he was on their pecking order; he arrived at the protest with an emergency contact number penned onto his forearm in case ICE agents grabbed him.\nPopular\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →“I would say there’s a psychological impact and an economic impact to my family. It was like an unexpected bomb of emotion,” Garcia explains. “This is a hunting of people. I live close to where some of these raids have happened, a block away.” He’s not scared, he clarifies. “What I feel is more panic. It’s a different level. The panic is the thought of being detained and being separated from my family. It is this feeling that no matter where you are, something bad could happen. In one minute, I could never see my family again. In one minute, I could be taken who knows where.”\nThis is America in 2025. A land of masked men operating with impunity as they terrorize communities and kidnap workers. A land of terrified workers desperately trying to reassert their dignity and reclaim their neighborhoods in the face of a relentless federal onslaught.\nI asked the garment worker what he would say to Trump if he met him. He appealed for empathy. “Trump hasn’t suffered what I’ve suffered. Like having to cross a border and risk your own life. He doesn’t know how to build something from the ground up. He only knows how to sit at a fully constructed table. He hasn’t suffered as others have.”\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "“The Nation” Interviews Zohran Mamdani", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/zohran-mamdani-new-york-democratic-politics/", "text": "The Nation Interviews Zohran Mamdani\n“The Nation” Interviews Zohran Mamdani\nNew York’s Democratic mayoral nominee shares his views on the city’s affordability crisis, the new media landscape—and how Democrats need to stand up for what they believe.\nZohran Mamdani’s victory in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary in June made the 33-year-old state legislator from Queens more than just the party’s nominee to lead the nation’s largest city. For a Democratic Party desperate to reclaim political momentum, Mamdani’s laser-like focus on affordability issues offered a clear path forward. The Ugandan-born immigrant who would be the city’s first Muslim mayor also managed to overcome many of the wrenching, personality-based pitfalls of New York politics by projecting an accessible, enthusiastic, and joyful determination to open up conversations and heal past electoral divisions—an approach that starkly contrasts with Donald Trump’s dark vision of an America at odds with the world and with itself. Mamdani still faces a tough November race, with his chief opponent in the primary, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, reentering the contest as a third-party contender alongside the scandal-plagued incumbent, Mayor Eric Adams. Perennial Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa and independent Jim Walden round out the field.\nOn the day that Mamdani sat down with Nation editor Katrina vanden Heuvel and executive editor John Nichols for one of his first extended post-primary interviews, he had just secured the endorsement of 1199SEIU, the largest healthcare union in the country and a historic force in New York politics. At the same time, he’s still looking to win the support of national Democratic figures—notably heavy hitters from his home state like Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries—who suggest that the proud democratic socialist is too progressive on both domestic and foreign-policy issues.\nSeated at a small table in the Little Flower Cafe, an Afghan eatery that he frequents in the Queens neighborhood of Astoria, Mamdani sipped a pink sheer chai and spoke about the inspiration he takes from past New York progressives such as Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Fiorello La Guardia. He also discussed how he came to highlight affordability as the essential political issue of the moment, the future direction of the Democratic Party, and the legacy of “sewer socialism”—the breakthroughs achieved by socialist municipal governments in the past. Along the way, Mamdani highlighted key challenges for New York governance, such as protecting the city from the depredations of ICE and the vendettas of the Trump White House and navigating relations with the city’s billionaire class. He also spoke about the punishing media landscape and his efforts to address “a caricature of myself that is a responsibility for me to correct,” as well as his earnest hope—in a time of so much cynicism and despair—that democracy might finally deliver for working people. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nThe Nation: In your victory speech on primary night, you quoted Franklin Delano Roosevelt, telling the crowd: “As FDR said, ‘Democracy has disappeared in several other great nations, not because the people dislike democracy but because they have grown tired of unemployment and insecurity, of seeing their children hungry while they sat helpless in the face of government confusion and weakness…. In desperation, they chose to sacrifice liberty in the hope of getting something to eat.’ New York, if we have made one thing clear over these past months, it is that we need not choose between the two.” How did you come to adopt that quote and to link it to your governing vision?\nMamdani: I was taken by this quote because it so eloquently speaks to the fact that for democracy to survive, it cannot be treated as simply an ideal or a value. It has to be something that has a resonance to the needs of working people’s lives. And in this moment especially, there’s a temptation to say that democracy is under attack from authoritarianism in Washington, DC, which it is. And it is also under attack from the inside, [because of] the withering of the belief in its ability to deliver on any of the needs of working people.\nIt’s not that we must convince people to believe in democracy as a notion or as a political aspiration; it’s that we have to convince them of its resonance in their lives. And it’s a joy to be here with you at Little Flower, because that’s the nickname of the greatest mayor in our history, Fiorello La Guardia, who took on these twin crises of anti-immigrant animus and the denial of dignity to working people, and did so with an understanding of what the fruition of democracy looked like—and even what the fulfillment of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness looked like—understanding it in the language of the urban sphere: of more parks, more beauty, more light. You cannot defeat this attack on democracy unless you also prove its worth.\nThe Nation: FDR and La Guardia campaigned in difficult times—during the Great Depression, with fascism rising in Europe. They each captured the imagination of the people and used it to build electoral and governing coalitions. Is that something you were thinking about when you picked that quote?\nMamdani: It is part of the inspiration for this campaign.\nThe Nation: Roosevelt had a huge agenda, and he was a masterful politician. Yet he couldn’t achieve all of it. The same with La Guardia. Today, as you seek to implement an equally bold agenda, there are people who say you’re too inexperienced, that you won’t be effective. That will, undoubtedly, be a theme of the fall election, in which your leading opponent is a former governor whose father, another former governor, famously said, “You campaign in poetry; you govern in prose.” Tell us how you see governing, and how you intend to deliver on your campaign’s promises.\nMamdani: I only promise that which I intend to deliver. I will be judged at the end of my tenure as mayor—after I win this general election—by my ability to deliver on this platform. Most especially, I’ll be held to account on the central planks of this platform: commitments to freeze the rent, to make the slowest buses in the country fast and free, to deliver universal childcare in a city where it costs $25,000 a year to provide that for a child. The challenge of politics is to meet each moment. What we’ve shown in this campaign is our ability to do so from the beginning, when I was managing two people, to this point where we now have more than 52,000 people [as campaign volunteers].\nThis is not to say that campaigning and governing are the same challenge, but it is to say that they both present you with an ever-developing landscape—one in which you can only succeed if you hire a team of the best, the brightest, and also the hungriest. What we did in this campaign was showcase our ability to do that, and what we’ll do in governing is the same: hire on the basis of expertise, and trust our convictions, our commitments, to also hire those who are not characterized by the speed with which they say yes to an idea I come up with, but rather by the track record they can show in fulfilling a mandate such as this.\nThe Nation: Might your administration include City Comptroller Brad Lander, one of your closest primary rivals, as deputy mayor or in some other key position?\nMamdani: I have yet to make any personnel commitments. But I would say that it has been a joy to run alongside Brad and to work alongside him, and to see his leadership as both a colleague for years prior but also amidst this race, in showcasing what a new kind of politics can be. I know that many others felt the same. At a moment when the language of politics is so dour and so dark, it’s important to understand that the tonic to the darkness is not imitating it, but rather to marshal the same lightness and joy that also characterizes our lives.\nThe Nation: In your victory speech, you seemed to be trying not merely to claim an election win but to give people a deeper sense of your governing philosophy and focus. It didn’t sound like you wrote it that night.\nMamdani: No, the foundation of the speech was written before that evening. But we wrote the conclusion on election night. There was a sense of “Things look good—but it’s too early.” And then once I got the phone call from Andrew Cuomo, we realized that this was actually a victory speech. It was not too early to declare. And so we had to bring that clarity to what we had written.\nThe Nation: You promised to “govern our city as a model for the Democratic Party, where we fight for working people with no apology.” That spoke to the circumstances of the Democratic Party, not just in New York City but nationally. Today there’s this debate over how the party should reconnect with working-class voters. If you’re elected mayor, your success or failure is primarily going to be measured by what you do for people in New York. But do you also see the potential for a model of a new politics in America?\nMamdani: It has often felt as if we in the Democratic Party are embarrassed by some of our convictions—that at the first sign of resistance, we may back away. And what I have found as a New Yorker is that the thing New Yorkers hate more than a politician they disagree with is one that they can’t trust. And so I have run a campaign that is unabashed about its commitments, its principles, its values—while always ensuring that that lack of apology never translates into a condescension, but rather a sincerity. It allows for an honest debate with New Yorkers, where even when I go and speak to hundreds of CEOs, we have a conversation all in the knowledge that my fiscal policy, as I state it in that room, is the same as I state it on the street: a desire to match the top corporate tax rate of New York to that of the top corporate tax rate of New Jersey, a desire to increase personal income taxes on the top 1 percent of New Yorkers by 2 percent. It’s an honest desire, and it is also one that doesn’t preclude me from sharing it with those who may be taxed by it.\nThere is a temptation, when you see how successful Republicans have been with their style of politics, to believe that we have to mimic it in order to compete with them. In fact, it is a challenge for us to showcase our alternate vision. It’s not just a vision with regard to commitments, it’s not just a vision with regard to ideals, but it comes across even with regard to the manner in which we share our politics with others. And I think sincerity is at the heart of that.\nThe Nation: There’s been a pressure—a good bit before the primary, more since—to get you to back off from things you’ve said on issues like the Israel-Palestine conflict and taxing the rich. You’ve responded by meeting with critics, explaining that these are the things you believe in and engaging in discussions of where you are coming from. That’s different from how many candidates operate.\nMamdani: If I’ve made policy commitments, I’ve made them because I intend to keep them. I want to be honest about them. That doesn’t stop me from continuing to learn how to be a leader for this entire city. But that learning is not something that can come at the expense of the core of what this campaign is, which is a commitment to the very same policies we began with on October 23, the very same values we ran with for eight months prior to the primary. That marriage of consistency and growth is what I hope to show as the leader of this city.\nThe Nation: If you are elected mayor, you will have to deal with political leaders in Albany and Washington. You’ve said that you want to use your power “to reject Donald Trump’s fascism.” How do you Trump-proof New York City? And how do you do that when the administration is directly attacking you? Just this morning, the White House spokesperson denounced you as “Zamdami.”\nMamdani: I hope they find that guy. [Laughs.]\nThe Nation: So how do you Trump-proof the city?\nMamdani: There are a number of ways: You raise revenue, such that you not only are able to protect the city against the worst of the federal cuts that are to come, but also that you are able to pursue an affirmative agenda at the same time. It is not enough to fight Trump’s vision in purely a defensive posture. We must also have our own vision that we are fighting for—and that we deliver on.\nAnd New York City [can also push back against Trump’s White House] by enforcing and strengthening our city’s existing sanctuary-city policies. This is a contest, also, of values that concern the fabric of our city and our country. And when I was saying that too often it feels as if we Democrats are embarrassed, just think about these policies, which have been spoken of by Eric Adams as if they are an attack on what makes us New Yorkers, when in fact they’ve been in existence for decades and have been defended prior to him by Republicans and Democrats alike. We know that these are the very policies that can prevent so much of the horrors that we are seeing in our own city.\nPopular\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →Finally, we can fight by instilling hope in New Yorkers who are living through despair in this moment—be it a despair over how expensive the city that they call home has become, or despair watching in anguish as their tax dollars are used to kill civilians in Gaza, as was recently reported by NBC News, where the Israeli military killed 10 children waiting in line for a health clinic, one of whom was a 1-year-old child who had just spoken his first words. It is incumbent upon us, as Democrats, to fight back against that, and to also lift New Yorkers out of that despair with an affirmative vision.\nI am running to be the mayor of this city, and my focus will be on the welfare of New Yorkers across these five boroughs. I will lead with a vision of protecting these New Yorkers and ensuring that we do more than simply survive in this city—that there is also a language and a reality of aspiration in our city once again.\nThe Nation: The president recently questioned your citizenship and threatened to arrest you. Were you surprised by that? Do you have any capacity to be surprised by Donald Trump?\nMamdani: Very little. He has spoken about how I look, how I sound, where I’m from, what I believe in, my naturalization status. I think much of it is to distract from who I fight for, because for all of the many differences between Donald Trump and me, we both ran campaigns on the cost of living, campaigns that spoke about the need for cheaper groceries. While he’s betrayed those same commitments—most obviously through this recent legislation that will throw millions of Americans off their healthcare, steal food from the hungry, continue in his now well-known tradition of wealth transfers of trillions of dollars from the working class to the 1 percent—we will actually deliver on those commitments. And our delivery on them will throw his betrayal into stark relief. That is a threat to his politics, and it motivates so much of this language and this focus that he has.\nThe Nation: Instead of referring to you as a democratic socialist, Trump has claimed that you are a communist. So let’s talk about what you are—a democratic socialist. How do you define the term?\nMamdani: I think of it often in the terms that Dr. King shared decades ago: “Call it democracy, or call it democratic socialism. But there must be a better distribution of wealth within this country for all of God’s children.”\nIn a moment when income inequality is declining nationwide, it is increasing in New York City. And within the context of city government, I understand [democratic socialism as a way to honor] the responsibility to ensure that every New Yorker lives a dignified life. I often speak of Fiorello La Guardia—a Republican who once ran on the Socialist Party line and worked closely with the left—because he delivered that dignity through so much of what he did as the mayor of this city. This was a mayor who created the Parks Department, a mayor who built housing for 20,000 New Yorkers at a scale and pace which is considered unfeasible today, a mayor who understood what it meant to fight for working-class New Yorkers.\nI am well aware of the immense responsibility that comes with this position, and I am also excited by the opportunity that it represents to deliver for those same New Yorkers for whom politics has seemed less and less relevant to the struggles of their lives.\nThe Nation: When you talk about democratic socialism, you put it in an American context, which a lot of our media never even imagines. But there is a long democratic socialist tradition in this country, and one of the best examples of it is the “sewer socialists” of Milwaukee. One of the interesting things about the sewer socialists was that they championed small business. They fought to protect small businesses, often against chain stores and big business. You’ve done something similar.\nMamdani: Yeah! And the extreme concentration of wealth and power hurts small businesses as well.\nThe example of sewer socialism is one that I think of often. What we have seen in recent years is that the language that should be identified with the left has become associated with the right: language of efficiency, of waste, of quality of life. To fight for working people must also mean to fight for their quality of life. Sewer socialism, to me, represents a belief that the worth of an ideology can only be judged by its delivery. That means improving the services and social goods that working people experience each and every day: the sewers, the clean drinking water, the parks. You win someone’s trust through an outcome, and that is what I am working backward from: an outcome of an affordable city and a desire to show that government can in fact live up to its responsibilities to working residents.\nThe Nation: So you’re not the candidate of the billionaires?\nMamdani: No. [Laughs.]\nThe Nation: Yet you met recently with leaders of the business community—some of whom are billionaires. As mayor, how are you going to navigate relations with the business community?\nMamdani: First, by showing that I see them as a part of this city, and that my vision for the city includes even the same corporations that I’m looking to increase taxes on. I know no matter what our disagreements are, there’s a shared interest in the success of this city.\nThere are points of disagreement, no doubt. But also, I enter into those rooms [for meetings with business leaders] having been preceded by a caricature of myself that it is a responsibility for me to correct. I do not blame many New Yorkers for having that caricature, for they were subject to more than $30 million in television commercials, mailers, and radio hits with those very examples of smear and slander. I, too, would have questions if that was the only way I understood someone. I also go into those meetings making clear that, though we may—and likely, for many, will—leave with the same disagreements about fiscal policy and the tools we must use to deliver that affordability, agreement on those issues is not the basis by which I will determine who I’m willing to speak to about other issues. There are many conversations I’ve had that begin and end with disagreement about that fiscal policy, but also include shared areas of interest with regard to our parks or our streetscape, or thoughts of what this city could be. That is why I speak so often of partnership. Politics, to me, must be an act of making the principle into the possible. And you do so by extending your hand to all who are interested, not all who agree on every single idea that you have.\nThe Nation: Do you think you’re opening up imaginations that have been shut down? There are people living here in New York who are surprised when they learn that city universities were once free. So there’s a tradition that has been lost in the past 40 or 50 years that you may be retrieving.\nMamdani: I leave it to you to make the judgment. I will say that we have been very inspired by the tradition, in this city especially, of the campaigns that came before us. One of the many reasons that I was so excited by the idea of walking the length of Manhattan when it was proposed by a team member of ours was that it reminded me of the video I had seen a few weeks earlier of David Dinkins walking through the streets of Harlem. It reminded me of the photo I had seen of John Lindsay being lifted into the air by a crowd, and of an understanding among New Yorkers of the necessity of politics to take place in public. Much of our sense of politics is grounded solely in the now—when in fact we have to continue to connect to that which has existed before, because even in the mere act of knowing our own history, we are reminded of our own possibilities.\nWhile it’s tempting to think of the passage of time as innately meaning the arrival of progress, we know that in many ways we have had a fairer New York City in the past. That does not mean that we should engage purely in nostalgia, but that we are reminded of what we can accomplish and that, in doing so, we are honoring what this city has been.\nThe Nation: Your campaign has focused on the fact that the city has become harder and harder to afford—perhaps more so than at any time in its history. How did you come to that as the focal-point issue for your campaign?\nMamdani: If you speak to enough New Yorkers, you’ll come to this conclusion. It’s the difference in whether or not people can keep living in the city. People feel it in rent; people feel it in the job market; people feel it in groceries; they feel it in their MetroCard. One in five New Yorkers cannot afford a $2.90 subway fare in the wealthiest city in the wealthiest country in the history of the world. And it’s offensive that we have allowed this to continue and that we consider ourselves witnesses or bystanders to it, as opposed to those with the choice of exacerbating it or bringing it to an end. We’ve seen exacerbation under Adams, and now it’s time for a city government that actually uses the tools at its disposal to deliver a different kind of city.\nThe Nation: Since the primary, you’ve met with a lot of people who did not back you. There are still some Democratic Party leaders who remain resistant to your candidacy, and you’ve been meeting with them. You’ve also put a lot of effort into meetings and direct campaigning that seeks to expand your coalition: seeking to win over older Black voters, union members, and others who were with Cuomo in the primary. You’ve gone to the neighborhoods, to Little Haiti and elsewhere, talked with people—and won endorsements. You’ve met with and won over unions that backed Cuomo in the primary. Isn’t this what mayors need to do: to say to people who didn’t back you, “Let’s find our places to work together. Let’s find our common ground”?\nMamdani: You have a choice of what you want to do with your hand. Do you want to pat yourself on the back, or do you want to extend it to someone else? Your decision has to come from the question of “What is your goal?” My goal is to be the mayor of this entire city. It is not to settle scores and look to the past; it’s to look to the future. Looking to the future means continuing to welcome people into a coalition, and not asking them why or when they joined, but knowing that they have just as much of a place in this fight for an affordable city as those who helped come up with the idea of the campaign in the first place. It’s that same ethos that we practice as New Yorkers when we look to defend those who have been here for generations and those who got here the same day. It’s the way that this city has raised me.\nThe Nation: There’s a huge media story to this campaign. Some of New York City’s legacy media has not exactly rolled out the red carpet. The New York Times editorialized that “We do not believe that Mr. Mamdani deserves a spot on New Yorkers’ ballots.” At the same time, you’ve created your own media. How do you think about media and communications in New York City?\nMamdani: Oftentimes, the left is forced into a choice between the conventional and the creative, forced in part by financial realities when running a campaign. Thanks to the matching-funds system [which allows qualified candidates in New York mayoral races to get public funding], we were able to build a campaign that could do both. And we sought to do both throughout the entirety of the campaign, whether it meant our advertising strategy, our field strategy, but also as it pertained to our comms strategy. We wanted to engage and respect the longstanding institutions—newspapers and radio and television stations—and sought out opportunities to speak to them at every occasion, [while] knowing full well that more than 50 percent of Americans get their news from social media. So we wanted to both speak to those who tell the stories of this city each and every day and to tell our own story at the same time.\nThe Nation: Was it frustrating when, for instance, The New York Times editorialized so aggressively against you in the primary?\nMamdani: I took that editorial as the opinions of about a dozen New Yorkers—ones that they have a right to, and that I disagreed with, and ones that will not be a reason that I do not engage with them in the future. That’s how I’ll approach much of this, in telling the story of this campaign and in continuing to do so—and in ensuring that my disagreement with any piece of analysis will never extend into what too many politicians do today, which is seeking to clamp down on both the access they extend to the media and the media’s ability to continue to do their jobs.\nThe Nation: Will your focus on producing social media—which has gotten a lot of national notice—continue if you are elected mayor?\nMamdani: Yes. There is much of this campaign that will, and must, continue into governing, and the way in which we communicate is one of those things. It is a critical part of ensuring that New Yorkers see themselves in their own democracy: that they actually hear from those whom they have elected through a medium that they actually use.\nThe Nation: You could become mayor at a time when the president is openly attacking you and when politicians in Albany are saying there’s no money for you. As you struggle to deliver on the things you want to deliver on, is it important that you keep lines of communication open so that people can see how the process works—and what you are trying to accomplish?\nMamdani: The caricature of me will only grow, which means that our ability to reach New Yorkers must grow in the same manner. I take inspiration from many leaders who have sought to speak to their constituents directly, be it the examples I’ve seen of Senator [Bernie] Sanders and Congresswoman [Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez through the use of digital media at a national scale, or [President] Claudia Sheinbaum in Mexico.\nThe use of digital tends to be described as if it is an optional part of our politics today. It is a necessity. [Mamdani campaign communications director Andrew Epstein’s] idea was to place our donation link under Andrew Cuomo’s relaunch video, and that raised more than $100,000. That is not an optional part of a campaign or of our politics. It is just as important and as necessary as so much of what we consider to be the building blocks of how we run a campaign and how we govern the city.\nThe Nation: You just mentioned Claudia Sheinbaum. The mayor of New York is a global figure. If you’re elected, how will you address national and international issues? How will you build those relationships?\nMamdani: You have to keep your focus on the city. This city is its own gateway to the world. Almost 40 percent of the people who live in this city were born outside this country, myself included. I will be the first immigrant mayor of this city in generations, and I take that both as an honor and as a responsibility. Yet my focus is on the five boroughs, and if there are lessons and models for what we achieve here elsewhere, so be it.\nThe Nation: You’ve acknowledged that people may have serious differences with you on particular issues, Middle East issues—Gaza, for instance. But you’ve made a point of talking about a commitment to make sure that everyone who lives in the city is safe.\nMamdani: Yes. This is a city that each and every New Yorker belongs to. They belong to it not on the basis of their political beliefs, or their religion, or their race, but because of the fact that they are a New Yorker. And I will be each of those New Yorkers’ mayor. Even amid a disagreement, there will always be an understanding of a shared sense of humanity and that shared sense of belonging.\nThe Nation: Do you ever get mad?\nMamdani: I do. I do get mad! You know, I was quite mad when I met [Trump border czar] Tom Homan in Albany. I am mad when I see the horrific consequences of this right-wing federal administration. It’s an anger that I know many feel, and yet it is not one that we can let corrode our spirit and our soul.\nThe Nation: Do you have a favorite film that captures the New York City ethos?\nMamdani: I’ve often said [Spike Lee’s] Do the Right Thing.\nThe Nation: You seem like a guy who reads a lot.\nMamdani: [Laughs.]\nThe Nation: As a candidate, do you still read books?\nMamdani: Not much.\nThe Nation: Do you listen to music?\nMamdani: I listen to music because it’s something that I can do as I do something else. I listen to music as I get ready in the morning; I listen to music as I take the train, as I’m walking. Some mornings I listen to a song called “O Sanam” by Lucky Ali; some mornings I listen to soca music to wake myself up and get ready for the day. And I don’t know that I could do this without that music. It either gives you that which you hoped you had already awakened with—the energy, the hope, the belief—or it takes you out of that which is consuming you.\nThe Nation: Do you have a book that shaped you?\nMamdani: You know, I read American War by Omar El Akkad many years ago, and there was a phrase within it: “What was safety, anyway, but the sound of a bomb falling on someone else’s home?” And it has stayed with me for a long time and informed the way in which I not only see the world, but the world that I’m also trying to win.\nThe Nation: Do you think much these days about not just making this a great city for working people to live in, but maybe even about how a mayor might make the world better?\nMamdani: I try to keep my sights squarely focused. You know the New Yorker cartoon of a View of the World from 9th Avenue? That’s how I try and wake up every morning.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "Why We Must Release the Epstein Files", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/society/epstein-files-trump-transparency-corruption/", "text": "Why We Must Release the Epstein Files\nWe need justice for the survivors of his predations, and we need to restore public trust in our institutions.\nOn his podcast, Joe Rogan recently asked Senator Bernie Sanders a question that reflects a concern many Americans have today: Why should people pay more in taxes to “an incompetent, corrupt government” that lacks accountability? The truth is, we should be investing more in government programs for education, healthcare, and the creation of well-paid jobs. But decades of corruption and the unchecked influence of money in politics have fueled a deep distrust in our institutions.\nOvercoming this distrust is one of our greatest challenges as a country. If we want to enact initiatives like a 21st-century Marshall Plan for America or Medicare for All, we need people to believe that government works for them—not just for the rich and powerful.\nTo rebuild trust, we need transparency, accountability, and a bold anti-corruption agenda. Progressives must lead the way and show Americans that our government can be good and effective.\nOne place to start is calling for the release of the Epstein files. The administration’s refusal to release them is just the latest example of how a lack of transparency fuels distrust.\nFor at least a decade, Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell trafficked and abused young women and children. There are more than 1,000 victims, according to the Justice Department. Lawsuits allege Epstein’s criminal abuse of minors spanned over 30 years. These victims deserve justice, and the public deserves to know who was involved and who is still being shielded today.\nAmericans on both the left and the right are outraged by the government’s failure to fully release this information; 79 percent of the public wants the files to be released, and a majority thinks the government is covering up evidence.\nReleasing the full Epstein files—while protecting the privacy and safety of victims—must be a top priority. It is a simple question of whether our leaders stand with America’s children and victims of abuse or with the wealthy and powerful who are being protected.\nThat is why I have spoken out since 2019 about this issue and supported then–House Oversight Committee chairman Elijah Cummings’s investigation into Epstein’s death. It’s also why I am leading the current effort in Congress to release the files, first with an amendment that was blocked in the House Rules Committee and now with a bipartisan bill being co-led by Representative Thomas Massie.\nOur bill, the Epstein Files Transparency Act, requires the attorney general to release the files within 30 days while ensuring that the victims are protected. Releasing the files should include information about individuals connected to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s criminal activities, to hold them accountable.\nCongress should seek other evidence that could help shed light on who was enabling these crimes. I recently sent a letter requesting a copy of the “birthday book” from Epstein’s estate—a collection of letters from Epstein’s and Maxwell’s friends and associates that could contain evidence about other individuals who were involved in their crimes.\nOur first priority must be justice for the victims and their families. When Congress returns in September, I plan to convene survivors of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse on Capitol Hill to share their stories and urge 218 members of Congress to sign the discharge petition that will force a vote on our bipartisan bill. Every American will see where their member of Congress stands.\nAgain, this fight is also about restoring public trust in our institutions. Today, only 22 percent of Americans have faith that our leaders will do what is right. The public is tired of leaders who put wealthy donors and special interests over ordinary people.\nReleasing the Epstein files is just the start of rebuilding public trust. We need a sweeping political reform agenda to clean up Washington. That means reining in the influence of money in politics and tackling corruption head-on by passing my bill with Representative Summer Lee to abolish super PACs. That also means fighting for working-class people, including furthering Medicare for All, a free public college education, and an increase in the minimum wage.\nWe must also resist the Beltway voices that are trying to make this a partisan fight. This isn’t about winning elections or scoring political points. We are building a coalition of Americans from across the political spectrum who are united behind protecting America’s children, rooting out corruption, and ensuring that no one is above the law.\nThe survivors of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse have waited too long. The first day back in session, Congress must come together to sign the discharge petition and force the vote on our bill to show the American people we stand on the side of justice and transparency.\nPopular\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →Our party and political system as a whole needs a rebirth.

{"title": "Democrats Keep Misreading the Working Class", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/working-class-democrats-mamdani-jeffries-schumer/", "text": "Democrats Keep Misreading the Working Class\nMany in the party see workers as drifting rightward. But new data show they’re more progressive than ever on economic issues—if Democrats are willing to meet them there.\nZohran Mamdani won New York’s Democratic mayoral nomination with the most votes ever for a primary winner in the city. The democratic socialist did so with an agenda that spoke to the kitchen-table economic issues that, following the debacle of the 2024 election, Democrats generally acknowledge they have to get better at discussing. So what was the reaction of party leaders and the media echo chamber? A meltdown so severe that it has sparked widespread talk of a “civil war” within the party. On one side, the line goes, are younger, highly educated, pro-Palestinian progressives who embrace economic populism; on the other, older Democratic stalwarts who are pro-Israel, economically moderate, in tune with the working class, and cautious about rocking the boat. But that’s not what the numbers say.\nAdvisers to House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries—who, like his counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, resisted endorsing Mamdani after the primary—referred to the city’s rising wave of democratic-socialist-backed candidates as “Team Gentrification.” Yet exit polls reveal a different reality: Mamdani attracted support from a broad swath of New Yorkers by running a campaign relentlessly focused on working-class cost-of-living concerns.\nUnfortunately, top Democrats refuse to accept the notion that Mamdani’s economic populism is the key to his success. Or that the appeal of a boisterous tax-the-rich message might extend beyond urban progressive enclaves. Some go as far as Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin, who says that Democrats need to stop demonizing rich people. But a recent report by the Center for Working-Class Politics (CWCP) upends Slotkin’s assertion. Analyzing data from three long-running national surveys, the report shows that working-class Americans have grown more progressive over the past two decades—not just on economic justice but also on immigration and civil rights. Today’s working class stands farther to the left than when it helped elect Barack Obama in 2008.\nWhy, then, do so many high-ranking Democrats imagine that workers are reactionary? Because the middle and upper classes are moving leftward at a faster pace, creating a perception gap. As higher-income, college-educated voters embrace progressive positions on climate change, LGBTQ rights, and other issues, working-class voters—despite their own leftward shift—appear comparatively conservative. This distorted narrative misleads Democratic strategists and journalists alike.\nFar from being unreachable, working-class voters remain ideal Democratic targets, provided the party emphasizes the bread-and-butter economic issues that most resonate with them. The CWCP report confirms that working-class Americans strongly support economically progressive policies like increasing the minimum wage, protecting jobs from outsourcing, boosting Social Security, and taxing the wealthy. There are nuances: Middle- and upper-class voters now surpass working-class voters in enthusiasm for progressive priorities like taxing the rich and national healthcare. And while workers favor redistributive policies, their support diminishes somewhat when the proposals involve tax hikes or expanded federal bureaucracy.\nNevertheless, working-class voters remain notably left-wing on economic issues. Even if they hold moderate views on cultural issues, they would likely support Democrats if presented with a compelling economic agenda—in 2026 and beyond.\nTo illustrate this point, the CWCP examined Trump’s 2020 working-class supporters, finding an electorally meaningful segment with moderate to progressive social views and progressive economic positions. Over 20 percent of those voters backed increased spending on public schools and Social Security, higher taxes on the rich, and a higher minimum wage; roughly half of them also held moderate or progressive social views. In tightly contested elections, winning even a small portion of these voters could tip the balance.\nDemocrats ignore these voters at their peril. Kamala Harris struggled to engage working-class voters despite economic proposals that would have improved millions of lives. A key reason was her campaign’s reluctance to turn up the volume on economic populism.\nTo rebuild a durable majority, Democrats need candidates who consistently prioritize egalitarian economics. This doesn’t mean abandoning other social causes. But it does mean clearly emphasizing jobs, wages, housing, healthcare, and public services—making these the centerpiece of Democratic campaigns. It also means doing what Mamdani did: genuinely meeting working-class voters where they are, as economically progressive, skeptical of elites, and impatient for tangible results.\nSurveying democracies worldwide in 1960, the sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset observed that “in virtually every economically developed country the lower-income groups vote mainly for parties of the left, while the higher-income groups vote mainly for parties of the right.” This described the post–New Deal–era voting patterns that persisted until a decade ago in the US. But since Trump’s 2016 victory, class has become largely dealigned from voting.\nDemocrats still have time to renew their fortunes by doing battle with economic elites both inside and outside their coalition. Mamdani proved that with his June victory, and he’s working hard to expand the appeal to affordability in the general election—winning endorsements from unions that had backed former governor Andrew Cuomo in the primary. But it would be easier if Jeffries and Schumer looked around and recognized that voters get excited about Democratic nominees who embrace real economic populism, not the priorities of the donor class.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "Letitia James, New York’s Badass AG", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/new-york-attorney-general-letitia-james/", "text": "Letitia James, New York’s Badass AG\nThe state’s attorney general, Letitia James, has emerged as a North Star in the chaos of the second Trump administration.\nOn a rainy spring night, about 30 miles north of Manhattan, New York Attorney General Letitia James marched onto the stage at Westchester Community College. Standing nearly six feet tall and dressed in a drapey black suit (not unlike a judicial robe), she smiled broadly. Four of her comrades in legal arms—Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, California’s Rob Bonta, Illinois’s Kwame Raoul, and New Jersey’s Matt Platkin—followed closely behind, as a multiracial crowd of hundreds rose and cheered raucously.\nSince January, these AGs have challenged the Trump administration 30 times (and counting). But James has stood out, not only from the other AGs but also among top Democrats in the Empire State. This crowd was here for her.\nNew York City is home to the most powerful Democrats in Congress: Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries. But the most effective and popular Democrat representing New York is the Brooklyn woman known as Tish—a former Legal Aid attorney, legislative aide, City Council member, and New York City public advocate—who was elected attorney general in 2018. She’s a savvy politician, endorsing Zohran Mamdani, who won the June Democratic mayoral primary, when other party leaders kept their distance.\nBut James’s biggest claim to fame is as a fierce fighter against Trumpism.\nNo attorney general in the country is battling President Donald Trump more proficiently—and drawing more of his fire—than James. When Trump was out of office, she brought the successful civil case charging him and his company with business fraud for alternately inflating and deflating the value of his assets in order to reduce property taxes and obtain favorable rates from banks and insurance companies. The case resulted in a $454 million fine, which Trump is appealing.\nSince Trump’s reelection, James has emerged as a North Star in the chaos, inspiring progressives in New York and nationally. “Tish James and the other state AGs on the front lines of this fight are not only defending a Constitution and federal laws against a Supreme Leader and lawless autocrats,” says Representative Jamie Raskin (D-MD). “They are also showing the country what real attorneys general do by acting for the people and the rule of law instead of a right-wing political putsch.”\nJames and her partner AGs have hit the president with a barrage of lawsuits that have temporarily halted some of his worst orders in the past seven months. Their cases blocked efforts to freeze federal funding; stopped the termination of federal workers fired illegally; blocked Elon Musk’s DOGE from access to sensitive US Treasury material; halted Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s efforts to decimate Health and Human Services staffing; and temporarily restored $11 billion in health grants to states and cities. In early June, a court blocked the Trump administration’s move to shutter the AmeriCorps program after New York and 24 other states joined a lawsuit to protect the popular federal community-service initiative.\nBut while James is proud of the work of the AGs, she is honest about the fact that it isn’t nearly enough given Trump’s all-out assault on democracy. Congressional Republicans, James says, “have just handed over their authority to the executive. They, too, are afraid of MAGA. And they’ve just conceded their constitutional authority…. And so our job [as attorneys general] is obviously trying to make change with these lawsuits, but also to organize and to have events like we had in Westchester.”\nWhether their legal actions will help to permanently blunt the worst of Trump’s agenda remains to be seen, given that major cases remain pending in the Supreme Court. But they are certainly getting people’s attention. Eileen O’Connor, a nurse practitioner and leader of the NYCD16/15-Indivisible group, attended the town hall and thanked James for her work protecting the Trump-threatened funding for Medicaid, Medicare, public safety, and public education. “In terms of the pro-democracy movement, it’s important that she’s continuing to stand up to Trump. People are really heartened by that: ‘Oh, yeah, Tish, she’s doing it!’” Too many people are discouraged and unsure how to fight back during this second Trump regime, O’Connor says. “But Tish breaks through a lot of the noise, and that’s important.”\nThat ability to break through the noise has earned James praise—and a hefty boost—among much of her state’s otherwise disgruntled Democratic base. “It’s my great pleasure to introduce… our badass attorney general, Tish James!” Westchester County Executive Ken Jenkins said to the excited town hall crowd.\nThe evening was billed as a “hearing” to gather information on Trump’s assault on the entire public sector, but James likened it to a “road show” that she and her AG colleagues were taking around the country. They’re not just gathering evidence; they’re also trying to buoy the resistance to the second coming of Trump.\n“This isn’t a community meeting, this is a damn rally,” Tom Hart, the president of Local 94 Operating Engineers in New York City, told the crowd as he praised James and others for at least temporarily restoring healthcare for disabled 9/11 survivors and first responders. Nine-year-old Kory Skipper-Miller wowed the crowd by explaining to “Ms. Tish” and the others the importance of maintaining the social and veterans’ benefits that his mother, grandmother, and brother rely on. In addition to Kory, others talked about their worries over veterans’ services that have already been declining and are slated for more cuts, while other speakers lamented the coming educational cuts.\nWhile it may seem as though James and her fellow AGs emerged as legal freedom fighters overnight, in reality their efforts were months in the making. As James told me, the AGs—often working collectively under the umbrella of the Progressive State Leaders Committee—began meeting to discuss fighting a second Trump administration before the 2024 election.\n“It was not the outcome that we expected, but it was something that we had to prepare for nonetheless,” James told me three weeks after the Westchester town hall. We had met for coffee at a café in Brooklyn’s Fort Greene neighborhood, where waitstaff and constituents warmly interrupted us. “And so we analyzed Project 2025 based on subject matter,” she continued. “We looked at jurisdiction, we looked at standing, we looked at past practices, we looked at who had been active in certain areas, and we decided to assign our staffs different responsibilities based on possible cases. And we started preparing complaints and briefs.” California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who sued Trump more than 120 times in his first term, told The Hill that the group even wrote briefs in advance of Trump’s orders, so officials “just need to cross the Ts, dot the Is, and press print and file it.”\nThey gathered mainly on Zoom, with as many as 23 Democratic AG offices participating in the calls, Ellison told me. New York and California “are significantly bigger than the rest of us,” he noted, and that made collaboration essential. “They have more resources at their command and are in a position to do things that nobody else is really able to do. [James has] chosen to be maximally generous and work with all the rest of us who are much smaller, sharing resources, sharing herself.”\nJames laughed at that. “When I was elected,” she said, “I discovered after attending a National Association of Attorneys General meeting that the previous attorneys general of New York, who I will not mention, had not cooperated.”\n“It was shocking when I walked into a conference and someone yelled, ‘New York is here!’” James continued. “I’m like, ‘So?’ But New York had never been there, and that’s sad. My approach is to share the vast resources of the New York State Office of the Attorney General with smaller states, particularly at a time when we’re all under attack and when it’s going to take all of us to stand up.”\nThe New York attorney general’s office employs 2,200 people, 800 of them lawyers; California’s has 5,400 workers, including 1,100 attorneys. By contrast, Ellison employs 440 staffers, 193 of whom are attorneys or attorney managers, and Rhode Island’s office—run by Peter Neronha, one of the Democratic AGs in this alliance of 23—employs 257 people and 103 attorneys.\n“So Tish could devote three or four staffers on an issue, whereas I might be able to spare one or two and some states, none,” Ellison said. Their efforts have been a lifeline to other state leaders. “Many of us in state governments, not just New York, literally get up every morning saying, ‘Our only hope is the court system,’” said New York state Senator Liz Krueger, a longtime ally of James. “We need an attorney general to stand up and say, ‘This isn’t legal—we’re going to go to court.’ And that’s exactly what Tish James is attempting to do on many critical issues.”\nIn their quest to hold Trump accountable, James and her fellow Democratic AGs have become arguably even more important today than they were during Trump’s first term, when they boasted an 83 percent win rate in cases challenging the administration’s agenda. Since January, they have become the main actors holding the line against the administration’s unprecedented lawlessness.\nThe Democratic AGs don’t always win. But they often delay and complicate Trump’s agenda, and they are establishing a legal record for eventually upending it. Just as important, they are taking the fight to Trump and the administration with a boldness that is often missing on Capitol Hill.\nFor instance, James and her partner AGs were ready for Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship the day he announced it. “Of 23 Democratic AGs, two are birthright babies,” James said with a chuckle. (They are Illinois’s Kwame Raoul and William Tong of Connecticut.) Several federal judges immediately blocked Trump’s order, but the Supreme Court ruled in June that district courts have far less power to impose national injunctions, though the court didn’t rule on the constitutionality of birthright citizenship itself. As of publication time, a third court has blocked the birthright citizenship order from going into effect.\nLikewise, when anti-deportation protests escalated in Los Angeles, and Trump sent in the National Guard against the wishes of the state’s governor, California AG Rob Bonta sued him and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in federal court. James quickly filed an amicus brief, but a federal district court panel ruled against Bonta, allowing the administration to continue controlling the National Guard troops.\nEven when there are setbacks, James says she isn’t discouraged, citing the AGs’ consistent victories in the lower courts. “The courts have held up,” James told me. “They’ve been one institution that has held up against fascism, against this consolidation of executive power, this reorganization of government. They’ve held up despite the threats and the harassment to the courts—to the point where judges have to get private security.”\nJudges aren’t the only ones facing threats. since challenging Trump, James has received death threats and has had to strengthen her security detail, telling Pod Save America in 2023 that she fears a “lone wolf.” But she does her job anyway. In April 2024, 26-year-old Tyler Vogel of upstate New York pleaded guilty to charges that he sent text messages threatening James with “death and physical harm” if she did not “cease action” against Trump in the courts. “Listen, my security folks, they worry about me all the time, but I still walk the streets of Brooklyn,” she told me.\nTrump himself regularly vilifies James, calling her a “low IQ individual.” The president has a habit of demeaning women of color with that slur, from James to Vice President Kamala Harris to Representatives Maxine Waters, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Jasmine Crockett, a rising Democratic star. In May, Trump moved from insults to threats, unleashing his Justice Department on James over issues related to her cosigning of mortgage documents to help a niece buy a home in Virginia in 2023, four years after she became New York attorney general. One of many documents stated, incorrectly, that James would use the home as a primary residence.\n“They’re accusing me of engaging in all types of badassery around these mortgage docs,” James said. “They found a power of attorney that was prepared by someone else that I signed, which basically said that I was a resident of Virginia. But prior to that, I had indicated that I was not going to be a resident of Virginia. I put it in all-caps in the mortgage documents! But nonetheless, they’re making this out to be something it is not.”\nJames’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, told the Justice Department that the administration had “cherry-picked an August 17, 2023 power of attorney that mistakenly stated the property to be Ms. James’ principal residence…. The broker understood this, and that Ms. James was not a Virginia resident.”\nThe Justice Department is also investigating charges that James understated the number of units in her Brooklyn home, again for mortgage advantages.\nTrump revoked James’s security clearance and also denied her other “federal privileges”—but she says she doesn’t even know what that means: “I go into federal buildings all the time.”\nTrump insists that James is “a total crook” and promises that his Justice Department will pursue the charges against her to the fullest. James doesn’t want to minimize the threats. “I’m more afraid for my family members in Virginia,” she told me. “Individuals have driven by the house in these big eight-wheel trucks with Trump flags. On some of these right-wing websites, they post their addresses and their pictures. And these are women and children, and absolutely private citizens.”\nLiz Krueger laughs at the charges against James, but not at the potential danger to her. “Do I actually think the attorney general of the state of New York signed documents saying ‘my primary residency is going to be in another state?’” she said. “No, I do not. I do not. But he really is going after her.”\nAnother sideshow James has had to deal with this year was the reemergence of disgraced former governor Andrew Cuomo, who was the front-runner to be New York City’s mayor until his lifeless, cynical campaign was upended by the landslide primary win of the democratic socialist state Assembly member Zohran Mamdani. Cuomo has since announced plans to run as an independent in the November general election.\nJames and Cuomo had once been allies. When he was governor, Cuomo appointed James—who had run alongside him as the attorney general candidate in 2018, to the disappointment of her admirers and the progressive Working Families Party, which had been her political home—to investigate the sexual harassment accusations against him by current and former staffers. For a while, it seemed that Cuomo was hiding behind James. “Let the attorney general do her job,” he told reporters at a March 2021 press conference. “She’s very good, she’s very competent, and that will be due process and then we’ll have the facts.”\nPopular\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →Many of James’s supporters worried about her independence from the governor. “I was very concerned,” said Lindsey Boylan, a former employee of the governor’s office who made an early claim of harassment. “I was concerned because of the power he still seems to exert over other powerful people. Obviously, my fears were unfounded.”\nUltimately, James released a 165-page investigative report in August 2021 finding that Cuomo had sexually harassed 11 women. (In the years since, the number of accusers has risen to 13.) Cuomo was livid, filing an ethics complaint against James that has so far gone nowhere, and running up close to $20 million in taxpayer-funded legal fees going after his accusers. He has since characterized James as practicing “a brand of ugly politics I had never seen before” and says that she was driven by political ambition.\nJames dropped her own bid for governor in late 2021. “There was no way that I could manage the office, stay on top of investigations and litigation, and at the same time run for governor,” she told a reporter at the time. “I decided to withdraw and also recognize that my heart really wasn’t in it.”\nThese days, it’s clear where her heart is—and her energy.\nIn the weeks since I began writing about James and her fellow AGs’ crusade, the Trump administration’s abuses of power have only escalated. In July, Trump managed to secure congressional support, along strict party lines, for his “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which features the largest cuts to social-safety- net programs in history, as well as a budget-busting tax cut for the wealthy. These cuts—some of which will be enacted immediately, and others that won’t be enacted for years—are being imposed by Congress, not through presidential executive orders, and it is unclear whether there is anything that James and her team of AGs can do to stop them, let alone the mass deportations that the legislation supercharges.\n“American democracy will not be saved in a court of law,” Keith Ellison told the Westchester crowd. “It will be in a court of American opinion. We need you to keep coming to meetings like this. Go to those [upcoming] rallies.”\nEllison knows that mass protest, and massive anti-Trump voting, will ultimately do more to dislodge the autocrat from power than attorneys general can. On the day we learned about the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses—Ellison was also on the alleged assassin’s hit list—an estimated 5 million Americans turned out for the No Kings rallies nonetheless.\nJames shares the view that protests are going to be a crucial part of pushing back against Trump. I asked her if she thinks the nation’s top two Democratic leaders, Schumer and Jeffries, are doing enough to meet the moment. James chose her words carefully: “I love them both,” she said. “They’re close friends of mine, but they’re not into performative politics. They’re very cerebral. And they’re very deliberate. They always have been, they always will be.”\nJames believes that the Democratic leadership “needs to bring in more young people. They need to take their cues from AOC and from Jasmine Crockett and Maxwell Frost and Greg Cesar. They need to be on the ground. They need to do things that are different. Republicans are just outperforming us each and every time. We have to stop believing or following the rules. Break the rules. Stop coloring inside the lines.”\nThough her preferred candidate in the New York mayoral primary, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, didn’t win, James quickly embraced Mamdani after his victory. She went to his party on election night and praised the youthful, multiracial movement that propelled his campaign. “Tonight represents a resounding win,” James told the crowd.\nBy endorsing Mamdani even as Schumer and Jeffries kept quiet, and by marching joyfully with him in June’s New York Pride parade, James solidified her standing with the city’s progressive movement.\nThe unifying role she’s playing is stirring speculation that James, who is 66, could yet be a 2028 US Senate prospect or a 2030 gubernatorial contender. People approached her to run for mayor this year, James admits. But she wasn’t about to step away from the fight against Trump and Trumpism. “I was focused on protecting our democracy, and I didn’t want to get distracted,” she told me. “Once that job is done…?” That was classic Tish James: focused on the job at hand, ready to sacrifice in order to complete her tasks, and certain that, once she has prevailed, there will be more opportunities for New York’s badass attorney general.\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the number of staffers at the New York Attorney General’s office. It also misidentified the umbrella group the Democratic attorneys general worked under.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "How Trump’s Tariffs Shocked Wisconsin Farmers", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-tariffs-wisconsin-farm-soybeans/", "text": "How Trump’s Tariffs Shocked Wisconsin Farmers\nThe administration’s tariff policies have thrust soybean farmers into economic chaos as they navigate higher input costs and shifts in global trade.\nFarming today looks a lot different from the pitchforks and red barns that many Americans might imagine.\nOn Doug Rebout’s 4,000-acre farm of soybean and corn in Janesville, Wisconsin, a $650,000 tractor—guided by GPS—plants 3,500 acres in just over a week. “When it’s time, it’s go time,” Doug told The Nation. From 5 am to 10 pm, seven days a week, he and his family are ready to endure the uncertainty of farming whether it concerns time, weather, or tariffs.\nSince 2018, Rebout, a second-generation family farmer and president of the Wisconsin Soybean Association, has dealt with declines in soybean prices due to President Donald Trump’s tariff policy. And he isn’t alone. Across the state in Barron County, Tanner Johnson, a first-generation grower of soybean and member of the American Soybean Association’s executive committee, has watched soybean prices drop 50 percent, forcing him to turn to smaller markets.\nIn April, US soybean exports to China were subject to a total tariff of 135 percent after Trump imposed a 10 percent tariff of certain agricultural products in March on top of a 125 percent levy. In May, both countries reached an agreement and Trump cut overall tariffs from 145 percent on Chinese imports to 30 percent. China brought down their 125 percent tariff to 10 percent, underscoring the market’s volatility and how farmers are uncertain of what policy could be imposed next.\nIn 2023, Johnson could sell a bushel of soybeans for around $13 to $15. Now he gets $9. Rebout said for his farm, which harvests 80,000 bushels a year, that small drop amounts to $400,000 in lost revenue. Meanwhile, maintaining a farm is costly, Rebout said, pointing out that one tractor costs over $600,000.\nDr. Thomas Kemp, chair and professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire, said Wisconsinites and Americans should care about artificially adjusting prices through tariffs because it disturbs supply chains, leading to overproduction of some goods and underproduction of others. “As our exports leave our country, and then they become tariffed abroad, it brings demand down, which brings prices down,” Kemp explained.\nWisconsin’s soybean farmers produce about $1.3 billion of revenue each year. Most of the state’s crop is sent to markets in China, Canada, and Mexico, according to the Wisconsin Soybean Association. Now, Kemp said, Wisconsin could see more than $100 million lost annually due to tariffs. During the previous Trump administration’s trade war in 2018 and ’19, US agriculture experienced more than $27 billion in losses, according to the WSA, with soybeans accounting for 71 percent of that.\nAs farmers lose this revenue, they spend less money, hurting other businesses that sell them seeds, fertilizers, tractors, and more. On the other hand, buyers of soybeans benefit from lower prices, saving money that they can spend elsewhere in the economy. But Johnson said tariffs have likewise affected the input costs, such as fertilizer, which have doubled in price; thus he is paying more to cultivate a farm and getting half the value of what he did two years ago. “In any business, apparently, other than farming, we would look at that and say, ‘We need to stop doing that.’ But obviously, we can’t stop farming and feeding the world, [we have] a responsibility to do so, and there’s only so few of us left,” he told The Nation.\nThese sudden changes in prices can lead to significant economic disruption. In the case of soybean farmers, many have invested millions in specialized equipment and infrastructure tailored to soybeans. When prices fall, Kemp explained, they may be forced to switch to other crops and their equipment becomes useless or even worthless.\nFarmers don’t sell directly to other countries. They sell to local elevators, or a business that buys grain from farmers and stores it with the intention to sell it, who negotiate with foreign markets to import or export soybeans on their behalf. Johnson said Brazil is the United States’ number-one competitor; second is Argentina. “We used to have really, really good relationships with a lot of these foreign markets, and Brazil has since moved in and kind of took our spot on top of the hill,” he said. “It’s really impacting their relationships and soybean farmers [who] have worked for 50-plus years to develop.”\nRecently, representatives from Chile, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Austria, Mexico, and the United Kingdom visited Rebout to discuss trade exchanges and build a relationship. Wisconsin recently built a port in Milwaukee, allowing direct exports to Europe and North Africa through the St. Lawrence Seaway, which will help diversify market access, he said. But they don’t fully make up for lost trade with China, Mexico, and Canada.\n“I doubt it’ll make up for all of it, but it’ll make up for some of it,” Kemp said. “The farmers probably would have been already trying to market there prior to these tariffs. In other words, what we’re seeing them do is, we’re seeing them look for second best alternatives.”\nThe US Soybean Export Council recently afforded Johnson the opportunity to visit Tunisia to interact with stakeholders across the soy supply chain in the Maghreb region. He explained firsthand what he does on his farm that sets him apart from global competitors through environmental care and superior quality of soy through storing the commodity in cold conditions.\n“I held US soy in my right hand and Brazilian soy in my left hand. The quality was incomparable. US soy was clearly the superior product, and customers prefer it. Just now they’re able to buy Brazilian soy so much cheaper, that despite the higher quality of US soy, they’re economically being driven to buy more Brazilian soy,” Johnson said.\nBoth Johnson and Rebout advocate for their work through the WSA, which is made up of 14,000 farmers and is supported by the policy program manager in Washington, DC, who works with the American Soybean Association (ASA) as a national lobbying team. They have attended soy issue forums through the ASA, meeting industry speakers or leaders from other agencies such as the EPA. They also visit DC yearly on the behalf of the WSA to meet with legislators on both sides of the aisle to talk about key issues they face.\nPopular\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →Johnson said Wisconsin is nearing a point where some family farms, which make up 94 percent of all farms in Wisconsin, could close down because of the lack of cash flow. He said it may not happen this year, but it could be only one year away.\n“We’re definitely all feeling the pressure, and when you begin to lose family farms and local economies, you lose a lot of local participation in small economies, and that’s how you end up with downtowns that are empty.… A lot of the color and shine to these small towns goes away when you see the family farms close up,” Johnson said. “We are closer to big problems than we are to the blue sky if things don’t change soon.”\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "What History Tells Us About the Rise of Fiorello La Guardia", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/mayor-la-guardia-election-mamdani/", "text": "What History Tells Us About the Rise of Fiorello La Guardia\nZohran Mamdani’s favorite mayor was nobody’s idea of a shoo-in—until he became inevitable.\nWhen Fiorello La Guardia was first nominated for mayor, “most of the wise political prophets predicted his defeat by the all-powerful Tammany machine,” the lawyer, humanist, and longtime Nation correspondent Paul Blanshard wrote in these pages in October 1933. But as the election approached, “it became evident that New York was facing political upheaval.”\nThe first sign came in the primaries, which warned of “not a revolt but a whirlwind.” Weeks later, that Depression-era whirlwind would send La Guardia to Gracie Mansion—just as a different kind of upheaval may do the same for Zohran Mamdani this fall.\nThen as now, The Nation was excited about the insurgent candidate, while fully aware of the obstacles he faced: There was “still great prejudice in New York against Italian leadership,” Blanshard warned while noting that newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst regularly attacked La Guardia as “the little red flower of communism.” And if elected? Blanshard cautioned that La Guardia would have to find a way to unify “the many diverse elements that are now working for his success,” Blanshard warned—not least those “Socialists” likely to look askance at any compromises that La Guardia might have to make with the city’s powerful business elite.\nBlanshard thought both sides had it wrong. “What is more important than any associations of LaGuardia’s,” he wrote, “is the forthright manner in which he has spoken in this campaign…. [I]t seems to be as certain as anything can be in politics that if he is sent to the City Hall he will exercise the vast powers of the Mayor of New York with economic insight and political independence.”\nBlanshard admitted that there were limits to what La Guardia might be able to achieve. A “social revolution” would not be forthcoming: “Within the framework of our State and federal governments what could a good Mayor accomplish? He could not, even if he were a Socialist…go very far in the direction of public ownership without running afoul of the State constitution and the conservative legislature at Albany. New York does not have the power to build its own houses, operate its own buses, or own its own banks; and none of these powers can be obtained without the consent of Albany.”\nEven so, La Guardia’s election would advance political and economic democracy. “From the long-range point of view,” Blanshard concluded, La Guardia’s election could not only foster “new faith in the capacity of a city to use democracy intelligently,” but even turn it into “a gigantic laboratory for civic reconstruction…. [H]is elevation to New York’s City Hall might mean a genuine new deal for a long-suffering metropolis.”\nIt’s a prediction that would prove astonishingly prescient. Working closely with President Franklin Roosevelt, La Guardia helped usher in an era of expansive public works and political reform that fundamentally reshaped New York. (Blanshard himself would go on to head the city’s Department of Investigations and Accounts under La Guardia, a position he used to help root out corruption.)\nOf course, unlike La Guardia, a Mayor Mamdani would find no ally in the White House, at least not anytime soon. But that hasn’t dulled his appreciation for the Little Flower. When asked to name the best mayor of New York, he chose La Guardia.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "Narendra Modi Learns That Not Even Trump Respects a Bootlicker", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/world/narendra-modi-india-trump-tariffs-sycophancy/", "text": "Narendra Modi Learns That Not Even Trump Respects a Bootlicker\nThe Indian prime minister discovers that the world’s biggest bully sees fawning as weakness.\nDonald Trump has created a new golden age of sycophancy. The White House now resembles Versailles under the absolutist monarchs or Beijing’s Forbidden City under the emperors. CEOs and foreign leaders are lining up to butter up the US president. On Thursday, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, presented Trump with exactly the sort of shiny object that tickles his fancy: a glass plaque on a 24-karat gold stand, which Cook described as “a unique unit of one.” While the plaque was no doubt an expensive gift, it was a small price to pay for keeping the special tariff exemptions that Trump has been giving to Apple. Thanks to Congress’s abdicating its constitutional duty, Trump essentially has unilateral power to set tariffs, and he uses this authority to threaten companies and nations. To stave off the president’s ire, they offer simpering compliments and baubles.\nFew world leaders have played the game of toadying to Trump as assiduously as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In 2019, Trump and the Indian leader met in Houston for the massive “Howdy Modi” rally, which attracted more than 50,000 attendees. The meeting was both a campaign event (designed to help Trump win the fast-rising Indian American vote) and a chance to cement the ties between the two countries. At that rally, Modi called Trump his “true friend in the White House.” The following year, Trump visited India for an even larger event called “Namaste Trump,” which drew at least 100,000 people. These events were designed to forge ties that were both personal and ideological. Modi is often described as India’s counterpart to Trump. Both men are authoritarian populists who have built their coalitions by attacking migrants and minority groups. In governing style, both men are wheeler-dealers, with a strong faith in their ability to make personal connections that can overcome diplomatic disputes. In February, Modi was one of the first foreign leaders to visit the White House and spoke passionately about his “great friendship” with Trump. At that meeting, Trump and Modi promised to double trade between the two countries.\nOn Wednesday, Modi and the Indian government learned how little friendship with Trump is worth when the president took to social media to announce his intention to impose steep tariffs of 50 percent on India. Time points out that these are “among the steepest U.S. levies of any nation.” This injury was combined with an insult that is especially likely to sting in India, an emerging power with an elite that is self-conscious about how they are perceived by the larger world. The immediate pretext for the tariffs was that India was buying Russian oil. With passive-aggressive spite, Trump wrote on Truth Social, “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”\nThe Indian government responded that this criticism is selectively and capriciously applied. It’s true that the country buys Russian oil, but that’s something it was encouraged to do by the United States as recently as last year because it would help stabilize the global energy market. Further, the European Union continues to do more trade with Russia than India does.\nThe Indian government is on solid ground in arguing that it is being picked on by Trump administration as an easy target. Trump has been under pressure from NATO allies to do more to help Ukraine, and India, as a midlevel power, makes a convenient punching bag.\nIn going after India, Trump is subverting decades of efforts to build closer ties between the world’s two largest democracies. During the Cold War, India and the United States had chilly relationships because the US supported Pakistan as a bulwark against communism while the subcontinent pursued a policy of independency and neutrality. But starting in the 1990s, the United States adopted a bipartisan policy of moving closer to India, now seen as a potential Asian counterpart to a rising China.\nTrump’s turn against India has less to do with Russia than with the personal pique of a president who is easy to take offense when he feels his insatiable amour propre has been insulted. India and Pakistan had a brief military clash in May. After the two countries reached a ceasefire, Trump tried to claim credit as the broker of the peace. This is in keeping with his habit of wanting to be seen as an indispensable global leader, but India viewed it as an insult to its national sovereignty. Modi and Trump had a lengthy phone conversation on the matter on June 17, which Bloomberg describes as “tense.”\nBloomberg further reports:\nAlthough the US never made a direct request for Modi to acknowledge Trump’s role in the ceasefire, India saw a shift in tone from the White House after that phone call, according to the officials in New Delhi. Once Trump began publicly attacking India, they added, it was clear the episode marked a turning point in the broader relationship.\nTrump’s mercurial, personality-based diplomacy is likely to lead to a long-term chilling of the relationship with India. Some in India are contrasting Trump’s instability with the much calmer relationship India has enjoyed with Russia over many years. The New York Times notes that Modi domestically has “faced a storm of criticism over the Trump administration’s treatment of India.” Navdeep Suri, who had served as India’s high commissioner to Australia, told Bloomberg, “The Russia relationship is old, time-tested. All those days when the US was letting New Delhi down, including at the United Nations, Moscow stood behind India like a rock. Oil is a small part of the current story. India won’t like to be seen as capitulating under pressure.”\nOne consequence of Trump’s slap in the face is that the Indian government is stepping up its efforts to improve ties with China, despite having fought a border clash with this neighboring country as recently as 2020. Significantly, Xu Feihong, China’s ambassador to India, used Trump’s latest tariff hike to draw a lesson by tweeting, “Give the bully an inch, he will take a mile.”\nXu’s comments get to the heart of the matter. Trump is a bully. His tariff policy, although dressed in rhetoric about reshoring and national security, has little or no strategic basis. It is designed only to feed Trump’s never-satisfied ego. While flattering Trump has become a preferred strategy of many nations, there is little evidence that it works. In fact, like many bullies, Trump is more respectful of those who fight back. China, which has taken a firm line in defense of its national interests, is doing better at trade negotiations with the United States than India is.\nFor a middle power like India, the best way to deal with Trump is not flattery or fake bonhomie. Trump has no real friends, only abject cronies. A better path is to work out trade deals with other large economies such as China, Brazil, or South Africa. Such a policy would hark back to India’s Cold War strategy of building a nonaligned bloc.

{"title": "A Free Speech Shakedown—Trump’s Approach to American Civil Society", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-civil-society-extortion/", "text": "A Free Speech Shakedown—Trump’s Approach to American Civil Society\nEnding his extortion racket will demand not only courageous institutions—it will take the political opposition of us all.\n“I’m gonna make him an offer he can’t refuse.” So says Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, in The Godfather. But it might also serve as the motto for Donald Trump’s approach to American civil society. The self-proclaimed artist of the deal has exploited the power of the federal government like never before to shake down his critics. And in doing so, he has revealed a critical vulnerability in some of the most important institutions in our democratic polity. Federal support has been critical to the growth of American civil society, but in Trump’s hands, that support has become a lever to exercise extralegal control.\nCivil society—the nongovernmental institutions through which individuals come together to advance mutual interests—is essential to a vibrant democracy. When one looks around the world, virtually every country has a constitution that looks as good on paper as ours. But in many instances, those constitutions exist only on paper. One key difference is the strength of civil society. Where it is robust, as it has traditionally been in the United States, civil society plays an important part in safeguarding rights and checking abuses of power. Understanding that, the framers designed the First Amendment to protect civil society from government control. It guarantees the right to dissent from the federal government’s views, to associate with like-minded others to advance one’s own views, to report on government misconduct, to protest in the streets, and to file legal actions seeking redress of grievances. And thanks in no small part to federal support of civil society, through grants, subsidies, tax breaks, and the like, the United States almost certainly has as powerful a civil society sector as any nation. It should be a source of national pride; it is a central element of America’s strength.\nBut the very federal support that has been instrumental in the growth of civil society can be exploited to further unconstitutional ends. The signs are all around us. In recent days, Columbia and Brown universities have agreed to pay millions of dollars to settle disputes with the Trump administration. Columbia is paying $221 million, and Brown $50 million—despite the absence of any credible evidence that either institution engaged in any legal wrongdoing, much less any violations that would warrant even a fraction of those amounts. The Trump administration loosely charges them (and many other colleges) with inadequate responses to antisemitism on their campuses, but most of what it points to is merely impassioned criticism of Israel’s slaughter and starvation of tens of thousands of Gazans. Even if some of those protests veered into antisemitism, the universities would be legally responsible only if they were “deliberately indifferent” to specific acts of discrimination, an extremely difficult standard to prove—and one that is not even arguably supported in either case. Both universities also agreed to bar transgender women from women’s sports, a rule that no law requires. What drove these agreements was not law but coercion. Both universities get billions of dollars in federal funding, much of it for scientific research, and they worried that if they didn’t “pay up,” they would stand to lose those funds. And now Trump has reportedly demanded one billion dollars from UCLA, again for its alleged failure to respond adequately to antisemitism, but almost certainly driven more by Trump’s animus toward California’s Democratic politicians than any actual violations of law.”\nTrump’s targeting of law firms was equally baseless and unconstitutional—as every judge has ruled in the four instances in which firms challenged his actions in court. Trump’s executive orders made plain that he acted against the firms because he disapproved of some of the lawsuits they filed and some of the lawyers they hired. He ordered the federal government not to do business with the firms, to deny their lawyers security clearances, and to deny them access to federal buildings, all forms of official support. But whom firms hire and what they sue about are not only none of Trump’s business; they constitute the exercise of constitutionally protected rights to petition for redress of grievances and to associate with others. Yet nine corporate law firms struck deals with Trump, collectively promising almost $1 billion in pro bono support for causes Trump supports; again, a “remedy” Trump had no legal authority to demand. The firms settled not because Trump had the law on his side but because access to federal buildings and clearances is essential for their work, and they feared the loss of private clients if they fought. Many of their business clients need approval from the federal government’s regulatory agencies for their ventures, from drug approval to authorization of mergers. Here, again, Trump was able to extort hundreds of millions of dollars from major civil society institutions, not because the law provided for it but because of fear that he would engage in further retribution if the targets did not pay.\nThe same is true of CBS, which took multiple steps to placate Trump in recent months, again not because it was legally obligated to do so but because it feared illegal retribution by the Trump administration in connection with a request by its parent company, Paramount, to merge with Skydance. It paid $16 million to settle an entirely baseless lawsuit filed by Trump against 60 Minutes for its editing of a 2020 interview with then vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris. It fired Stephen Colbert, an outspoken Trump critic. And Skydance promised to provide “unbiased news,” appoint an ombudsperson to oversee that pledge, and end its DEI initiatives. Here, again, the law not only did not authorize the Trump administration to demand any of this. Yet CBS, Paramount, and Skydance caved to the president’s will out of concern that he would abuse his federal regulatory authority and deny the merger.\nThese actions reveal a critical vulnerability in civil society’s constitutional armor. When institutions are heavily dependent on federal support—whether federal dollars for scientific research or federal approval of business transactions—an unethical president can threaten to withhold support if he doesn’t get his way. Trump has done just that, time and again. And it’s working. He has compromised the independence of civil society—or perhaps more accurately, exploited its dependence.\nAs a constitutional matter, Trump could not legally punish universities for being too liberal, law firms for filing lawsuits challenging the government, or press outlets for criticizing the president. Under well-established First Amendment doctrine, he also cannot use government funding, or government benefits of any kind, including access to government buildings or federal approval of business initiatives, to condition a recipient’s speech, as he has done with the universities, law firms, and CBS. But like the leader of an organized crime ring, Trump has exploited the dependence of others to get what the law does not authorize and indeed forbids. Where institutions are willing to risk challenging his actions in court, they can win—as four law firms and Harvard have already shown, and California Governor Gavin Newsom has vowed. But it can be difficult to prove the full scope of retaliation, and the costs of fighting can be astronomical. Preserving civil society, and ending Trump’s extortion racket, will require not only courageous institutions, and courts willing to block the unconstitutional use of federal support to achieve unlawful ends. It will take the political opposition of us all.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "Mamdani’s Victory Over Fear", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/society/zohran-mamdani-9-11-new-york-politics/", "text": "Mamdani’s Victory Over Fear\nNew York’s political establishment threw the whole post-9/11 playbook against the Democratic nominee for mayor, and came up empty.\nIt’s been a summer of fear like no other in New York. This time, the fearful include the city’s richest residents, who see their dominance threatened by mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. Fueling their panic is the mounting realization that the War on Terror politics they sought to use against him—in a city reshaped by 9/11—didn’t work.\nThe city’s power elite now have few viable options to defeat Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assemblyman and member of the Democratic Socialists of America, as he campaigns against the vastly unequal living conditions they’ve created. Mamdani’s 12-point victory over former New York governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary, the biggest political upset in the city’s history, marked the first warning sign for the collapse of Islamophobic politics as usual. Megadonors seeking to exploit post–October 7 anxieties among the city’s sizable Jewish community spent $20 million on nonstop attack ads and came up empty.\nBut the oligarchs are hardly the only New Yorkers experiencing fear. The city’s immigrant communities fear for themselves and their loved ones as Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents grab law-abiding people appearing at the city’s immigration courts for their mandated check-ins. Muslim New Yorkers fear masked ICE agents snatching them in their apartment lobbies or off the streets for their nonviolent activism on behalf of Palestinians. And beyond the warrens of the wealthiest, there is a radiating fear that New York will forever be too expensive for a dignified life.\nSince Mamdani’s campaign began to gain momentum, the oligarchs and their allies in both parties have responded with more of the same 9/11 politics. Kirsten Gillibrand claimed that New Yorkers were “alarmed by [Mamdani’s] past positions, particularly references to global jihad”—a pure fabrication for which the Democratic senator had to apologize. Donald Trump openly muses about denaturalizing and deporting Mamdani. With New York’s one percent in disarray after Mamdani’s primary win, November’s mayoral election may herald a moment when the fearful politics of 9/11 is dealt its biggest blow yet. But if that proves to be the case, the president may turn his native city into the next domestic battleground of the War on Terror.\nCapital’s big problem in the race is that it lacks a single, viable champion. The hedge fund magnate, Trump ally, and anti-Mamdani fundraiser Bill Ackman posted a screed on X in which he offered “hundreds of millions of dollars of capital” to an imaginary “charismatic” and “centrist” Mamdani competitor—who at this stage of the election would have to run as a write-in. Former Bloomberg adviser Ester Fuchs lamented to The Wall Street Journal that the ballot box was “the only place in which people without money actually have the same influence in the outcome.”\nFormer governor Andrew Cuomo, undeterred by the shellacking Mamdani gave him in June, wants to be that champion, having procured a ballot line to offset his potential primary loss. So does Curtis Sliwa, the Guardian Angels vigilante and GOP nominee, but the Ackmans of New York won’t throw money at a beret-wearing weirdo. With Cuomo now seen as a loser, Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker reported that “fundraisers are being held in the Hamptons and uptown” for Eric Adams, the once-indicted mayor whose popularity hit an almost 30-year mayoral low in March. Sure, Adams has done plenty of self-dealing, but, Parker smirked, “What’s a little corruption in New York politics?”\nAdams, whom federal prosecutors indicted last year, is the source of much more than “a little” corruption. In July, five former cops filed separate lawsuits against Adams for running a “coordinated criminal conspiracy” with the New York Police Department at its center. But more damning is how Hizzoner escaped prosecution. As soon as Trump was reelected, Adams rushed to curry favor so that his charges, which relate to illegal campaign donations from Turkish interests, would disappear. His overtures yielded a quid pro quo in which the mayor of the largest sanctuary city in the country agreed to cooperate with Trump’s mass deportation agenda. Tom Homan, the White House “border czar,” gleefully humiliated Adams on live television in February, saying that he would be “up his butt” if Adams obstructed ICE. Adams tried to laugh it off.\nThat corrupt bargain unleashed state terror against New York’s immigrant communities. With Adams’s explicit blessing, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, armored in a plate carrier, launched Trump’s mass deportation initiative by accompanying ICE on raids in upper Manhattan and the Bronx in late January. “Nobody’s in the streets,” Brooklyn cab driver Pierre Jean told The Haitian Times. “They’re afraid ICE will check their papers. And even with legal papers, they’re afraid ICE will deport them.”\nThese fears spread further after officers seized the Palestinian student activist Mahmoud Khalil in his Columbia University apartment vestibule. They gained renewed traction when Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, herself a billionaire heiress, defended the department’s collaboration with ICE in the detention of Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian student at Columbia who had attended the protests for Gaza there. And they reached a fever pitch once ICE, shedding the fiction of targeting violent criminals, began grabbing immigrants at their court check-ins, sending immigration arrests skyrocketing. In July, a baseball coach in Manhattan’s Riverside Park had to fend off ICE agents asking if his middle and high school students were here legally. All of this suffering is invisible or acceptable to the real estate giants and financiers who are giving Adams a second look.\nFrom its inception, Mamdani’s campaign has focused on New York’s affordability crisis. But the crisis created by mass deportation has prompted him to adopt a more militant anti-ICE posture than that of almost any other US politician. After Homan testified in Albany on Khalil’s abduction, Mamdani yelled at him, “How many more New Yorkers will you detain?” and indicted the “cowardice” of city officials who “collaborate” with ICE. “ICE has no interest in the law,” Mamdani said in June after ICE detained New York City Comptroller Brad Lander for escorting a migrant away from his check-in. “It only has an interest in terrorizing people.”\nMamdani’s confrontational stance is a departure not only from Adams’s policy of accommodating Trump but from nearly 25 years of post-9/11 demagoguery in New York politics. It’s been standard practice for the city’s political leaders to embrace or acquiesce to law enforcement repression, first in the name of fighting terrorism and now in the name of fighting “illegal” immigration. Mamdani grew up in the New York they shaped.\nDuring that reign of terror, the bureaucratic forebears of ICE slipped business cards under Pakistani immigrants’ doors directing them to come in for interviews about what they might have known about 9/11—or about some unspecified future terror attack. The NYPD joined forces with a CIA officer to spy on entire Muslim neighborhoods. That sort of unfounded surveillance was so normalized that the NYPD sent an undercover agent on a whitewater rafting trip taken by Muslim City College students. The mayor who presided over all of this, Mike Bloomberg (now an anti-Mamdani megadonor), aggressively promoted gentrifying the city, touting the transformation of New York into what he called “a luxury product.”\nPopular\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →That luxury product, engineered to be so unfree and so unaffordable for so many, has now produced a Muslim socialist political leader determined to upend Bloomberg’s legacy. A key element of Mamdani’s success is his refusal to pay the typical Democratic fealty to the predatory political and economic order that grooms and vets New York’s leadership caste. Because so few in power confronted the War on Terror as it preyed on Muslims, the mechanisms it created now prey on all immigrants. In practice, that has led to the detentions and renditions of restaurant cooks, delivery drivers, day laborers, and other members of New York’s working class. Mamdani, without necessarily meaning to, has illuminated the way that the tools of the War on Terror are the tools of class war. And his victory in the primary illuminates the way to both end the War on Terror and triumph in a class war: organize.\nIt was inevitable that capital would go all out to portray Mamdani as an antisemitic apologist for jihad. Smears like that usually work, and the anti-Mamdani forces were confident they would succeed in the heavily Jewish city after October 7. Yet the accusations came off as panicky and desperate. Accurate numbers are hard to come by, but the Israeli site Ynet estimates that Mamdani won 20 percent of New York’s Jewish voters.\nWhat’s happened since in the traditional sanctums of New York power is a case study in cognitive dissonance. Addressing a synagogue in late July, Cuomo simultaneously accused Mamdani of “fueling antisemitism” and lamented that “more than 50 percent of the Jewish people voted for Mamdani…. They are pro-Palestinian, and they don’t consider it being anti-Israel.” Cuomo’s baseline confusion here, no less than his defeat, reveals how brittle the politics of 9/11 fearmongering has become.\nThe institutions of the War on Terror are stronger. In June, Trump—manufacturing a threat from anti-ICE “insurrectionists” in southern California—federalized units of the California National Guard. Then he deployed US Marines to backstop ICE raids in Los Angeles and further militarize the repression of dissent. Gleefully ignoring the objections of city and state elected leadership, he treated LA as an occupied territory.\nTrump has already signaled that he’s eager to apply that precedent to New York City. “If a communist gets elected,” he said, “we have tremendous power…to run places when we have to.” Making good on that threat, Trump has sued New York City for “interfering with enforcing this country’s immigration laws.” Homan has dared Mamdani to defy ICE raids, and when the New York City Council blocked ICE’s access to local jails in late July, he threatened to “flood the zone” with ICE agents. And since Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” triples ICE’s budget, that flood could be biblical.\nIf Trump stages more brutal raids in New York in response to a Mamdani victory in November, he’ll be ratcheting up the fear-driven politics of the city’s anti-Mamdani power brokers. Suddenly, the lords of capital in New York are seeing that 9/11 politics are no longer enough to stop the multi-ethnic working class from winning power. They may find common cause with Trump to endorse new crackdowns using the tools of the War on Terror. But even such a violent show of force would likely do little to deter a newly galvanized coalition of working New Yorkers who are sick and tired of living in fear.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "Washington, DC, Is Under a State of Siege", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/washington-dc-trump-federal-occupation/", "text": "Washington, DC, Is Under a State of Siege\nTrump has put the nation’s capital under federal occupation.\nWashington, DC, already lacks representation in Congress, has no control over its own budget, and cannot pass laws free from congressional interference. Now, under the Trump administration, the city is moving toward bantustan status. By invoking bogus emergency powers under the DC Home Rule Act, President Donald Trump has effectively federalized law enforcement within the district, delegating supervision of DC Metro police to Attorney General Pam Bondi and authorizing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to mobilize National Guard troops in Washington. Drug Enforcement Agency head Terry Cole will have operational control over Washington’s Metro Police Department as its interim federal commissioner.\nThe shock-and-awe show of force is clearly modeled on the administration’s brownshirt raids on churches, schools, and workplaces in Los Angeles to detain and rendition undocumented immigrants. “This is liberation day in Washington, DC,” Trump declared in a rambling Monday morning press conference. In laying out his rationale, Trump conducted a Fox News–style tour through a hellscape of criminal mayhem. “It’s become a city of complete and total lawlessness,” Trump insisted, even as DC experiences a 30-year low in violent crime and a 26 percent reduction over rates reported midway last year. Trump and his supporting cast of administration, legal, and security officials sharing the podium all doted on the image of Washington as a place where families and tourists are lucky to leave alive.\nTrump has long been in thrall to the fable of a capital under siege by immigrant gangs and violent homegrown criminals, and punishment-driven social myths like this have fueled his public career. In 1989, he took out full-page ads in New York’s major newspapers to restore the death penalty in the state in order to execute the since-exonerated members of the Central Park Five.”Mayor Koch has stated that hate and rancor should be removed from our hearts,” that MAGA magna carta document read in part. “I don’t think so. I want to hate those muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer, and when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes.”\nNever mind that, even by Trump’s own reasoning, his dictum made no sense: In addition to demanding the state killing of innocent and unfairly apprehended citizens, Trump was calling for their execution in a case where the victim, while horrifically assaulted, had not in fact been murdered. The point of Trump’s outbursts, then and now, is to create a spectacle of impunity under which state agents are empowered to act under an agitprop hate campaign.\nThat was instantly clear as Trump sought to describe the plight of Metro DC cops under a “woke” and “radical left” city government. Criminals “will fight back until you knock the hell out of them,” Trump said. “It’s the only language they understand.” Repurposing a myth from the heyday of anti–Vietnam War protests, Trump said that lawbreakers—whom he appeared to be conflating here with demonstrators during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests—“love to spit in the face of the police, and they’re screaming at them an inch away from their face, spitting in their face.” Some police reported being spat at then—and protesters in turn reported that police were spitting at them—but this set piece served chiefly to drive home the point that federalized agents would be patrolling DC under conditions of maximum impunity. “You spit, and we hit,” Trump proclaimed, asserting that in past cop-protest confrontations, “You could see [the police] wanted to get at it. Now they’re allowed to do whatever the hell they want.”\nThere was, of course, a glaring omission in Trump’s depiction of criminal life in DC. Trump and his underlings sidestepped the largest direct assault on DC police in the city’s recent history—the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, when pro-MAGA rioters, brandishing far heavier weaponry than their own saliva, injured 140 members of both the DC Metro police and the US Capitol Police. Five police officers died as a result of the attack. Apparently untroubled by this, Trump pardoned more than 1,500 convicted January 6 rioters.\nThis split-screen effect underlined the blatant subtext of most MAGA doomster rhetoric about violent crime: It’s invisible when heroic Trumpist allies are the perpetrators and a dire public emergency demanding unprecedented mobilizations of federal power when allegedly carried out by non-white city dwellers. Again, Trump wasn’t remotely subtle. “The murder rate in Washington is higher than that of Bogotá, Colombia and Mexico City—places you hear about as being the worst places on earth,” he said. He later added a grab bag of other scary-sounding centers of alleged Third World mayhem to the roll call, seemingly at random: “Baghdad, Panama City, San Jose, Costa Rica, Lima, Peru.” “Do you want to live in places like that?” he asked the assembled journalists in horror. If this didn’t make the racial animus behind his power play clear enough, Trump added, “We’ll be getting rid of the slums where [criminals] live,” and congratulated himself yet again for saying something that wasn’t “politically correct.”\nMonday’s announcement also extended the Trump White House’s record of ginning up federal emergencies out of thin air to consolidate strongman powers. The border crackdowns relied on the fabricated specter of an “invasion” of the country carried out by undocumented immigrants perpetrating more criminal terror. Trump’s tariff offensive—the last “Liberation Day” announced from the White House—likewise invoked powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Neither of these claims had any plausible empirical grounding—immigrants commit violent crime at lower rates than America’s native-born population does, and the US economy was in nothing remotely resembling a crisis when Trump debuted his erratic set of tariffs. At a minimum, a less prostrate national political press could profitably raise the question of why, if all these facets of public life are so grievously cataclysmic, they didn’t provoke the same militant crackdowns during Trump’s first administration.\nAs with the legacy of January 6, the specter of a national emergency is something conjured—or dismissed—purely for political gain. That’s why you no longer hear anything about the pet-eating moral panic that engulfed the Haitian community in Springfield, Ohio, at the height of the 2024 presidential campaign; it’s also why the “immigrant caravan” that consumed acres of right-wing news coverage during the 2018 midterm cycle vanished from public attention the day after the election. The only difference now is that the second Trump White House feels empowered to transform two-minute hates into long-term policy directives.\nYet daily life in Washington may well be an emergency of permanent federal occupation. Trump has already instructed the federalized forces under Bondi’s command to dismantle homeless encampments and to cut a wide swath through the city in search of occasions to flex their muscle. Over the weekend, Trump unleashed 5,000 federal officers in DC, including 120 FBI agents, as a preview of things to come. Reports of their handiwork suggest the same abuse of power that’s now become routine under ICE’s extended siege of Los Angeles. As NPR reports, a small traffic scrape on Sunday produced an overwhelming show of force all the more terrifying for the pointlessness of its summons: “At one intersection, a minor traffic accident between a car and a moped brought at least two dozen agents running, some wearing masks and one carrying a rifle.”\nIn a separate incident, a member of the DC Metro police taking part in a “federal task force operation” opened fire on a pair of armed suspects near a Metro facility Saturday—a dramatic show of force from officers usually seen striding through Metro cars in anything-but-menacing fashion. Per a Washington Post report, “Officers with Homeland Security Investigations and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were at the scene, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the incident. The D.C. police department, which is tasked with detaining and pursuing armed people throughout the streets of D.C., was not present, a police spokesperson said.”\nThis incipient state of siege is poised to be the new normal in Washington—and Trump and his goon squads won’t stop there. When one reporter asked him what other cities might fall under the authority of this roving police state, Trump, of course, pointed to cities harboring large blue-voting populations. “I’m going to look at New York in a little while, to see if we need to do this,” Trump replied, adding that similar appraisals would determine “if we’re going to do this in Chicago.” In other words, this administration is going to whatever the hell it wants.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "Trump Wants to Make the Confederacy Great Again", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/albert-pike-statue-national-park-trump/", "text": "Trump Wants to Make the Confederacy Great Again\nThe president is making a big push to rewrite the past in favor of some of America’s top historical traitors, racists, and scumbags.\nWith the expansive program laid out in Project 2025 roughly half-complete just six months into the second Trump administration, the Trumpified GOP is setting its sights on completing its conquest of the American past. It’s the logical next move for a movement dedicated to making the country “great again,” and it offers many prime opportunities to keep MAGA followers supplied with fresh red meat while President Trump is reduced to trying to distract people from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal by taking weird constitutionals on the White House roof.\nOn Tuesday, the administration announced that the National Park Service will be restoring a statue of Confederate Gen. Albert Pike that was toppled and removed during the 2020 George Floyd protests in Washington, DC. The service is presently cleaning the statue, which protesters had defaced, and plans to return it to its former home near Judiciary Square, a few blocks from the National Mall, in October.\nThe move, which comes two months after Trump announced he was restoring Confederate names to US military bases that had replaced them, carries a personal meaning for the grudge-prone president. At the height of the Floyd protests in Washington, Trump dispatched troops to break up a demonstration at Lafayette Square near the White House; he proceeded to use the occasion to stage a supremely awkward, and decidedly counter-Christian, image of himself brandishing a Bible as federal officers menaced peaceful protesters. Three weeks later, on the night of Juneteenth, demonstrators brought down the Pike statue. Trump—who reportedly asked then–Secretary of Defense Mark Esper whether officers could open fire on the protesters at Lafayette Square—called for the DC police to come down hard on the Pike statue’s assailants. “These people should be arrested immediately,” he tweeted then. “A disgrace to our country.”\nPike was far from deserving of such righteous ire on his behalf. Indeed, activists and advocacy groups had been trying to get his statue removed long before the advent of the Floyd protests. In addition to being a traitor and a racist, he was forced to resign his military commission after less than two years, after the Native American soldiers under his command were accused of scalping Union troops. Three years before the Civil War began, Pike endorsed a circular in his home state of Arkansas urging that free Black citizens be expelled from the state, deploring the “evil” of “the existence among us of a class of free colored persons.”\nPike was a prominent Mason, and his statue bears a plaque citing “his 32 years as Sovereign Grand Commander of the Ancient Rite of Scottish Freemasonry.” (His fascination with the recondite ceremonies of Masonry fueled speculation that he was also involved in the organization of the similarly secretive Ku Klux Klan, though no evidence supports a formal Klan affiliation; one scholar does contend that he was the author of the Klan poem “The Wolf Is on the Desert.”) Pike’s statue was installed at the Judiciary Square site in 1901, during a nationwide agitprop campaign to place Confederate monuments in public venues to mark the triumph of apartheid rule in the South after the abandonment of Reconstruction.\nThe ideological brief behind the Confederate monument complex is a central historical detail that never gets mentioned in MAGA’s restorationist crusade. That’s because it completely undermines appeals to a mythic Lost Cause “heritage” on behalf of the former Confederacy—in reality, the mass distribution of Confederate memorials served the anything-but-antiquarian aim of shoring up the spread of white supremacist Constitutions in the South. As George Orwell famously observed of similar projects undertaken by the ruling party in 1984, “Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.”\nThis is also why the MAGA assault on actually existing history is only getting started. As he visited Israel during Congress’s summer recess, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced his intention to retire the term “West Bank” in reference to the Occupied Territories in favor of the biblical names Judea and Samaria—reaching back millennia into another ideologically charged version of the region’s past for the sake of buttressing the legitimacy of another contemporary apartheid regime. (Johnson cribbed this idea from legislation directing schools and universities in Arkansas to use the same nomenclature, which was signed into law this spring by Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was tagging along with him on the same junket.)\nNor is the revisionist drive of today’s GOP confined to the remoter stretches of the past. Trump’s bid to whitewash and memory-hole the failed coup of January 6 has been an act of historical erasure worthy of Josef Stalin—and was crowned last week by the Senate confirmation of Emil Bove, a former Department of Justice official who fired a group of prosecutors who brought charges against the insurrectionists, as a federal appellate judge. And Trump’s director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, has jump-started a parallel bid to replace the tangled chronicle of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election with a just-so fable of outraged Trumpian innocence, not long after a Senate web page chronicling congressional inquiries into the Russia campaign was purged. Trump’s quisling attorney general, Pam Bondi, has followed suit with an announcement that she’s impaneling a grand jury to pursue potential criminal charges against… well, history, so far as I can tell.\nAll this frantic rewriting of history probably won’t achieve the prime directive of creating mass amnesia when it comes to Trump’s decade-and-a-half-long friendship with Epstein; indeed, Bloomberg News’ Jason Leopold reports that Trump’s name has been redacted from some of the more than 100,000 documents in the FBI’s file on the pedophile and sex trafficker. The past has a funny way of overtaking you even as you are furiously trying to recast it in your own image.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "New Yorkers Aren’t About to Elect a Mayor Who Makes Common Cause With Donald Trump", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/cuomo-trump-new-york-mayor-race/", "text": "New Yorkers Aren’t About to Elect a Mayor Who Makes Common Cause With Donald Trump\nAmid reports that Cuomo is consulting with Trump and telling business leaders he doesn’t want a fight with the president, Zohran Mamdani sees a “betrayal of the city.”\nWhen John Lindsay ran for reelection as mayor of New York in 1969, he recognized the mood of both the city and the nation. He linked his outspoken opposition to the increasingly unpopular Vietnam War to his campaign’s critique of federal policies that diverted money from municipal needs into the coffers of the Pentagon. “The military-industrial complex,” Lindsay declared, was “opposed to the needs of the people.”\nThat did not sit well with his fellow Republicans, who just a year earlier had rated him highly enough to consider putting the young and dynamic New Yorker on their presidential ticket. The mayor narrowly lost 1969’s GOP primary to right-wing state Senator John Marchi, on the same day that Democrats nominated a reactionary of their own, City Comptroller Mario Procaccino.\nSome prominent New York Republicans, such as US Senator Jacob Javits and Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz, stuck with Lindsay. Javits went so far as to warn that the defeat of the liberal incumbent would cause the city to “go downhill in terms of race relations” and create an opening for “the forces of oppression and repression.” But Republican President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew backed Marchi. Nixon did so out of party loyalty (and a measure of envious disdain for Lindsay’s charisma and national stature), while the increasingly bombastic Agnew relished the chance to attack a high-profile member of the party’s liberal wing. Positioning himself as a right-wing populist, the vice president was embarking on a crusade against war critics such as Lindsay and the urbane partisans of both parties Agnew dismissed as an “effete corps of intellectual snobs.”\nMarchi welcomed the support of Nixon and Agnew—but not as much as Lindsay.\nThe opposition of his party’s warmongering president and reactionary vice president proved to be a perfect selling point for Lindsay, as he set out to build a multiracial progressive coalition for his fall bid on the ballot line of the city’s small but influential Liberal Party. After all, the Nixon-Agnew ticket had won just 34 percent of New York City’s vote in the 1968 presidential election. The rejection by Nixon allowed Lindsay, a longtime Republican, to maintain the support of progressive Republicans while appealing to Democrats and independents. And it worked. Lindsay beat his closest rival (Procaccino) by 180,000 votes and trounced Nixon’s candidate by almost 500,000 votes.\nFar from helping him, Marchi’s White House ties undoubtedly did damage—four in five New Yorkers rejected the GOP nominee in 1969.\nFast-forward 56 years to 2025. Another Republican White House has taken an interest in another New York City mayoral race. This year’s contest pits Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani against a number of rivals, including the man he beat in the June Democratic primary, former governor Andrew Cuomo; sitting Mayor Eric Adams; Republican Curtis Sliwa; and attorney Jim Walden.\nThis week, The New York Times reported that Republican President Donald Trump is weighing some kind of intervention in the New York contest to try to stop Mamdani, a democratic socialist and critic of the president. That wasn’t exactly a shocker, as Trump has made no secret of his disdain for Mamdani, whom the president has falsely called “a communist” and threatened to arrest and potentially deport (despite the fact that Mamdani is a US citizen). What was notable was the Times’ report that “in a previously undisclosed call in recent weeks, Mr. Trump spoke about the race directly with Mr. Cuomo, an old associate and foil, according to three people briefed on the call, who were not authorized to discuss it.” On Thursday, the Times reported that Cuomo told a group of business leaders, “I know, personally, he doesn’t want to fight with me. Personally, I don’t want to fight with him, right? So I don’t think he’s going to be eager to create a conflict.”\nThe reports sparked an immediate outcry in New York City. The Trump and Cuomo teams entered denial mode. Despite the three sources, and a Times statement to the effect that “we’re confident in the accuracy of our reporting,” the Cuomo camp endeavored to cast shade on the reports—with the candidate dismissing the news as “gossip.” No surprise there. Being tied to Trump in today’s New York City is even more politically disadvantageous than being associated with Nixon in 1969. Where Nixon won 34 percent in 1968, Trump pulled barely 30 percent in 2024—and his approval rating has tanked since he retook office.\nIndeed, Mamdani’s primary win was seen by many as a rejection of Democratic caution and compromising in a moment of mounting concern with the Republican administration’s authoritarian excesses.\n“Today we learned Andrew Cuomo is directly coordinating with Donald Trump, even as this President sends masked agents to rip our neighbors off the streets and guts the social services so many New Yorkers rely on. It’s disqualifying and a betrayal of our city,” declared Mamdani on Wednesday.\nFormer New York City mayor Bill de Blasio said, “When Donald Trump wants you to be Mayor of NYC, you definitely shouldn’t get the job. Sorry, Andrew Cuomo.” Maintaining his withering critique of the former governor, de Blasio added, “The white flag of surrender has become the norm for Andrew Cuomo. He’s already conceding the fight for NYC’s future to Donald Trump. Not what New Yorkers are looking for, Andrew.”\nUS Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York Democrat who was a key backer of Mamdani in the primary race against Cuomo and remains an enthusiastic Mamdani supporter even as several other top New York Democrats continue to resist his candidacy, said, “New Yorkers knew Andrew Cuomo was backed by Trump’s orbit. That’s why he lost the primary. Now we have confirmation. It’s time for Democratic leaders to unite behind Zohran K. Mamdani.”\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "The Trump Economy? Some Reagan Parallels", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/trump-economy-reagan-jobs/", "text": "The Trump Economy? Some Reagan Parallels\nIn contrast with the now sober-seeming Reaganites, Trump has taken credit for the economy from day one.\nIn the winter and spring of 1981, Ronald Reagan took office and pushed through a massive tax cut, domestic spending cuts and military spending increases—a supply-side revolution, while Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker jacked up interest rates. By summer, the economy was heading toward recession, and my boss, chairman Henry Reuss of the Joint Economic Committee, began demanding to know whether the new administration took responsibility. “Oh no!” they replied, “Our program hasn’t taken effect!”\nThe parallels with 2025 are more apparent than real. The CBO projects that Trump’s tax cut will add $4.1 trillion to the national debt—but that’s only based on the absurd premise that the 2017 tax cuts would otherwise expire. In reality, the tax bill was a relatively small change to the status quo. Spending cuts are a serious blow to Medicaid and SNAP, but small in relation to the economy. Likewise military increases. Deregulation is more serious, but the effects—for instance, on the environment—will take time to show up. Interest rates are high, but 5 percent isn’t 20.\nAnd there are tariffs. Reagan’s administration was free trade in principle, protectionist when convenient. Trump’s is highly protectionist in principle, but open to pressure from the real world, which is why final diktats on China and on Mexico keep being delayed. His tariffs will permit some American producers to raise prices and profits (good for jobs, bad for consumers) except where they disrupt critical supply chains. That these are now ubiquitous—think gallium, germanium, rare-earth magnets—is something Trump’s people and the Pentagon are finding out.\nIn contrast with the now sober-seeming Reaganites, Trump has taken credit for the economy from day one. This is in line with his general worldview, but also with the trend toward magical thinking in economics since the 1980s. The hyperpersonalization of economic policy (Clintonomics, Bidenomics) has deepened greatly since then, imbuing each president with mysterious powers rooted in the force of personality and supposedly distinctive ideas. But it is a two-edged sword, as Trump discovered when the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) abruptly revised three months of job growth downward. Trump reacted by firing the messenger, something that never happened under Reagan because we at the Joint Economic Committee defended the BLS, holding hearings on unemployment every month.\nReagan’s people knew (and told me!) that they expected Volcker to engineer a deep recession. Monetarists favored this; supply-siders were opposed; Reagan’s chief economist, Murray Weidenbaum, made private jokes about the clash. Similar splits bedevil the Trump team—did Scott Bessent (bless his heart) really take a swing at Elon Musk?—and some of Trump’s tariff people are as loopy as the supply-siders. The element of good humor appears absent, as also the underlying grim realism. Trump appears to need good news all the time, but not to enjoy it; Roosevelt and Reagan he is not.\nThen there is the interest rate, then as now a critical question. With public debt greater than GDP, high interest rates flood cash-holders with money, while locking up the housing market and concentrating stock capitalization on the most speculative (and potentially unstable) firms. Trump is right (so help me) that interest rates should come down. But his public demands and threats back Fed chair Jerome Powell into a corner: Powell can’t comply without appearing to cede “independence.” Only Congress can order the Fed to change course, and so far, Congress is on the sidelines, with the Democrats on the wrong side of the issue. Here the contrast with 1982 is sharp: That year, Congress did agitate for lower interest rates and eventually got them. (The May 18, 1982, Federal Open Market Committee minutes document discussion of a six-page Reuss-to-Volcker letter; modesty precludes my mentioning who drafted it.)\nFinally, there is foreign policy—a critical predicate for the success or failure of economic policy, since without life on Earth, economies do poorly. In this matter, Reagan (in his second term) really did redeem himself—in my eyes—by reaching out to the leadership of the Soviet Union and ending the Cold War. Trump has a similar ambition—but so far, the results are not impressive. The clock is ticking on that, with the Democrats again on the wrong side of the issue, and one can only hope for the best.\nWell, as Marx famously noted in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, Hegel remarked somewhere that great personalities reappear, but “he forgot to add, on the first occasion as tragedy; on the second as farce.” Reagan’s revolution was the bright dawn of a mystical age, the beginning of rule by neoliberal economists. Trump’s seems more a desperate foray through the rubble.\nEventually, by the way, Reagan’s people agreed to take credit for the economy as of the new fiscal year, October 1, 1982. On that day, at my urging, Reuss read a poem by Archibald MacLeish into the Congressional Record. It is called “The End of the World”:\nQuite unexpectedly, as Vasserot\nThe armless ambidextrian was lighting\nA match between his great and second toe,\nAnd Ralph the lion was engaged in biting\nThe neck of Madame Sossman while the drum\nPointed, and Teeny was about to cough\nIn waltz-time swinging Jocko by the thumb\nQuite unexpectedly to top blew off:\nAnd there, there overhead, there, there hung over\nThose thousands of white faces, those dazed eyes,\nThere in the starless dark, the poise, the hover,\nThere with vast wings across the cancelled skies,\nThere in the sudden blackness the black pall\nOf nothing, nothing, nothing—nothing at all.\nMacLeish, then near the end of his life, saw it and sent a letter; he was delighted.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "Trump Can’t Stop Blabbing About Jeffrey Epstein", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell/", "text": "Trump Can’t Stop Blabbing About Jeffrey Epstein\nThere’s no way for Republicans to tamp down the Epstein-Maxwell scandal if the president keeps telling on himself.\nVice President JD Vance was expected to hold a lovely summer dinner Wednesday night at his Naval Observatory residence with colleagues like White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. Multiple media outlets reported that the group was planning to discuss the Trump administration’s failing strategy to get the Jeffrey Epstein–Ghislaine Maxwell sex-trafficking scandal, and Trump’s long friendship with the pair, out of the news. In an Oval Office meeting about renewing US manufacturing on Wednesday afternoon, Vance denied the reporting, Trump called the entire issue “bullshit,’ and in the end, the Naval Observatory soiree didn’t take place.\nMid-afternoon Thursday, NBC reported that the meeting occurred at the White House instead.\nWhatever the administration’s strategy is for pushing aside the Epstein-Maxwell scandal, it isn’t working. The reason is Trump himself. He just keeps giving reporters more to work with and the MAGA base more to worry about. Last week, he said he parted ways with Epstein because the late sex trafficker “stole” employees from Mar-a-Lago. When reporters asked if that included the late Virginia Giuffre—a high schooler whom Maxwell recruited from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago spa and who was reportedly sex trafficked by the pair for years—he rather shockingly told the truth. “I think she worked at the spa,” he told reporters. “He stole her.”\nA few days later, asked why Blanche met with Maxwell for nine hours over two days, Trump answered, also truthfully: to make sure that further disclosures don’t damage people who could “be hurt by something that would be very, very unfortunate, very unfair to a lot of people.”\nThat might well include Trump himself, although we know Bondi already directed underlings (roughly 1,000, according to news reports) to redact all mentions of Trump in the case files. Bondi briefed Trump about his name appearing in the files last May. Conveniently, a White House sources told ABC News that Maxwell informed Blanche in their tête-à-tête last week “that Trump had never done anything in her presence that would have caused concern.” ABC News didn’t attribute the “scoop” to “White House sources”; I did, because who else would leak (or have access to) such Trump-serving news?\nDays after talking to Blanche, Maxwell got a transfer to one of the cushiest, least restrictive federal prisons in the country—a so-called “country club” prison camp—in Byron, Texas, near relatives. “I didn’t know about it at all. No, I read about it just like you did,” Trump told reporters Tuesday, adding, “It’s not a very uncommon thing.”\nIn fact, it’s a very uncommon thing, prohibited by the Bureau of Prisons. Sex offenders like Maxwell must be confined in at least minimum-security prisons, and Maxwell’s transfer required a rules waiver. A former Bureau of Prisons official told The Washington Post the transfer was “enormously preferential treatment.” Who requested it, and who granted it? The White House isn’t leaking that information.\nThe only good to come out of Trump’s botching the Epstein-Maxwell story is that the pair’s victims are speaking out, and with increasing volume. The family of Virginia Giuffre, spoke out against both Maxwell’s prison transfer and the reported Vance-hosted meeting to plot strategy around the scandal.\n“Missing from this group is, of course, any survivor of the vicious crimes of convicted perjurer and sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein,” her siblings wrote in a statement. “Their voices must be heard, above all.” The family offered to come to the meeting to provide that perspective, an offer that doesn’t seem to have been accepted.\nAnnie Farmer, an Epstein employee who, with her sister Maria, made some of the earliest criminal complaints about sex abuse, has blasted the administration for refusing to release more of the Epstein-Maxwell files, saying the last few months of wrangling have been “an emotional roller coaster” for victims, who by some reports number more than 1,000.\nThere’s no reason to think the administration came up with a winning strategy to contain the scandal at its White House meeting Wednesday night. Trump can’t stop talking, and he won’t rule out pardoning Maxwell. Such a brazen move might force even Republicans to stand up and demand the truth.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "It’s Our Turn to Build a New System of Care", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/medicaid-60-future-care/", "text": "It’s been 60 years since President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Medicaid and Medicare Act into law, and those programs have built a safety net of care for American families. Sixty years since advocates, organizers, and families came together and refused to let our country abandon adults as they aged into poverty and low-income workers as they struggled to afford healthcare. But in the wake of the largest cut to Medicaid in history, this is no ordinary anniversary.\nToday, nearly 80 million people rely on Medicaid for care. From covering 40 percent of all childbirths to nearly 70 percent of home care for older and disabled people, Medicaid is more than a line item. It has represented a promise that no matter the ups and downs of life, our ability to care for one another, from generation to generation, will be protected.\nThe $1 trillion in cuts included in the massive budget bill signed into law in July, however, put care for 17 million people at risk. The caregivers, the direct care workers, the disabled and chronically ill, and the families juggling it all will bear the brunt of the pain. This big, ugly bill tells us that our care, and our lives, are disposable.\nThe promise of Medicaid is being shattered. But in the wake of this devastation, the dream of something better is coming into view. We have the chance to shape the future by building a system of care that leaves no one behind. From healthcare to paid family and medical leave, from affordable, quality childcare to aging and disability care—a new system of care that reflects the true realities and pressures on our families is long overdue.\nEven before these cuts, these programs were insufficient, underfunded, and inaccessible to far too many. Millions of us were already struggling to access the care we need and deserve. Family caregivers, sandwiched between raising a young child and supporting aging parents, are buckling under the weight of the financial and emotional cost. Care workers are taking second and third jobs, because they can’t afford to support their own families on the poverty wages they earn. More than 700,000 eligible families are stuck on waiting lists for home care, and rural nursing homes are shuttering, without the workforce necessary to meet the demand.\nWith our existing care system on the brink and care for millions hanging in the balance, the question of what comes next is up to us to answer. Now is the time to build toward a future where no one is left to navigate illness, disability, aging, or parenthood alone. A future where families have the time and support they need to care for one another without sacrificing income or stability. A future where care workers are supported and recognized as essential, with good wages, strong protections, and dignity on the job. In this future, care is not expendable; it is prioritized as the foundation of a thriving society.\nBut this future doesn’t come to us—we build it, together.\nJust as generations before us fought for a guarantee of healthcare and economic security, delivering us Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, and the Americans With Disabilities Act, now it’s our turn. These programs didn’t just happen; they were built by people who dared to demand more and organized to make it real. We must follow their lead and fight for more than just saving the bare minimum.\nIn late July, Caring Across Generations and our partners hosted hundreds of families on the National Mall for 60 hours, holding a vigil to mark the 60 years since Medicaid was created. We came together in our shared fear about what it means to lose Medicaid. We raised our voices to let our elected representatives know that we will not let their cruelty go unanswered. And we let our rage spark our commitment to ensure that the next 60 years of care are not like this.\nWe deserve policies that let us thrive. To get there, we have to keep coming together—not only in moments of crisis, but in our everyday lives. Each of us must commit to showing up and organizing others to demand change.\nOnly we can plant the seeds for what comes next: a future of care worth fighting for.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on. Every day, we make the case for a more democratic and equal world by championing progressive leaders, lifting up movements fighting for justice, and exposing the oligarchs and corporations profiting at the expense of us all. Our independent journalism informs and empowers progressives across the country and helps bring this politics to new readers ready to join the fight.\nWe need your help to continue this work. Will you donate to support The Nation’s independent journalism?

{"title": "Why the Right Is So Giddy About Sydney Sweeney’s Blue Jeans Campaign", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/the-right-sydney-sweeney-blue-jeans/", "text": "Why the Right Is So Giddy About Sydney Sweeney’s Blue Jeans Campaign\nAt first, they wanted to claim progressives were delusional for seeing a slide back into white supremacy in the American Eagle ad. Now they’re boasting about it.\nThe first thing you notice in actor Sydney Sweeney’s controversial ad campaign for American Eagle blue jeans probably won’t be her jeans but her cleavage as she reclines shirtless under a tight jean jacket. The tagline is, “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.” I mention this not to boob-shame but to say this ad is operating on so many levels, from sexuality to race to politics, it shouldn’t be surprising that it’s become the latest culture-war battleground. Well played, American Eagle.\nLest you think otherwise, Sweeney’s cleavage isn’t what’s made the ad campaign controversial. It’s the play on jeans/genes. There’s a magazine photo, which prominently features her breasts, as well as a video ad, in which the actor intones, sounding kind of bored: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality, and even eye color.” The camera pans to her blue eyes, and she says: “My jeans are blue.”\nProgressives pounced, provoked by the apparent introduction of genetics into clothing ads. A TikTok influencer called it “literally…Nazi propaganda.” That may be an overstatement, but there is something sketchy about an ad that references “genes” while featuring the white supremacist ideal of womanhood—blonde, blue-eyed, and busty. An MSNBC columnist called it evidence of “an unbridled cultural shift toward whiteness.”\nPerhaps surprisingly, many on the right agree. While at first some mocked progressive outrage as “hysteria,” now they are proud to embrace the ad campaign’s celebration of whiteness, throwing off the yoke of woke. Right-wingers Megyn Kelly and Fox’s Laura Ingraham are declaring the ad part of a long-overdue backlash against definitions of beauty that don’t center whiteness. On social media, on her podcast, and on her own site, Kelly is giddy about the Sweeney ad:\nWe have been suffering with the elevation of homely people in our fashion ads and our fitness ads for years now, and we are over it. We miss attractive people. We are sick of trying to pretend that these objectively unattractive people are the new beauty standard. They are not.\nBut here is the piece no one is saying that I think needs to be said because it is real and there is nothing wrong with it: We are sick and tired of the nonsense where you are not allowed to ever celebrate someone who is white, blonde, and blue eyed; that we have to walk into a room apologetic for those things. In a way, this ad is the final declaration that we are done doing that sh-t.\nKelly might be best known for insisting that Santa Claus, a fictional character, is undeniably white, pushing back on the proliferation of Black Santas in department stores and in the media.\nFox’s Laura Ingraham has focused two segments on the Sweeney ad. On X, she circulated a guest’s comment, echoing Kelly: “They don’t actually believe this is the resurrection of the Third Reich. They hate what Sydney Sweeney represents: the fall of wokeness, fat pride, gender androgyny, and DEI. They failed to reprogram the population into thinking ugly is beautiful.”\nBari Weiss’s Free Press, which specializes in making woke backlash stories seem reasonable, also pushed the Kelly/Ingraham line.\nLately the American public has grown used to a very different kind of ad, which tried to convince us beauty is whatever they say it is this week. You know the ones: the sagging swimsuit campaigns, the big-and-proud lingerie shoots, the breathless press releases declaring that representation is the new hotness. For roughly a decade, brands insisted on telling us what we should find sexy—stretch marks, back rolls, visible panic disorders—whether we liked it or not.\nThe body positivity movement told us, loudly and constantly, that everyone is beautiful, that all bodies are worthy of the spotlight, that a triple chin was not only normal, but empowering. Obesity wasn’t a health crisis, it was an identity. That era wasn’t really about celebrating women. It was about neutralizing beauty. Sanding down the sharp edges of desirability until no one felt left out, and no one stood out.…\nWhether she meant to be or not, [Sweeney is] a kind of a walking middle finger to the movement that tried to blow up all of our old-fashioned ideas about beauty.\nSinking in the polls, even Donald Trump got into the action, posting on Truth Social: “Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the ‘HOTTEST’ ad out there. It’s for American Eagle, and the jeans are ‘flying off the shelves.’ Go get ’em Sydney!” He contrasted her with his Democratic nemesis Taylor Swift, who he insisted is “NO LONGER HOT.” You’d think, given the ongoing news about his ties to the late child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, he might be more cautious about weighing in on the “hotness” of young women, but you would be wrong.\nOf course, people of a certain age will be reminded of the uproar over model and actor Brooke Shields’s 1980 Calvin Klein jeans ad, featuring the tagline “You want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing,” a not too subtle suggestion that the 15-year-old was not wearing panties. Given that Shields had starred as a child prostitute in the film Pretty Baby at age 11, the ad outraged people concerned about the sexualization of young women—and no doubt delighted Epstein and Trump.\nBut now race and genetics have been added to the mix. Trump is famously a proponent of the “good genes” explanation of racism and inequality. Meanwhile, Megyn Kelly can’t help herself: She slammed Beyoncé’s ad campaign for Levi’s on X today: “This is the opposite of the Sydney Sweeney ad. Quite clearly there is nothing natural about Beyonce. Everything—from her image to her fame to her success to her look below—is bought and paid for. Screams artificial, fake, enhanced, trying too hard.”\nMegyn, your post screams “racism.”\nAt first, the right wanted to claim progressives were delusional for seeing a slide back into white supremacy in the Sweeney ad campaign. Now they’re boasting about it. They’re only convincing me that some of the ad’s critics are right.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

But first, how do we face how bad things are now, while also understanding the reasons for hope – and the opportunities for action? Katrina Vanden Heuvel, editor and publiser of The Nation, will comment – in a minute.\n[BREAK]\nKatrina vanden Heuvel, longtime editorial director and publisher of The Nation, has returned to work this week as editor of the magazine. She’s also been a columnist for the Washington Post. She’s written for the New York Times, the LA Times, and The Guardian, where she’s now a regular contributor. Katrina, welcome back\nKatrina vanden Heuvel: Thank you, Jon. You know, if I might preempt you, which I’ve done too often on talk TV — These are extreme times, and I felt that, while there will be a successor to me, someone younger, I felt at this moment a trust in The Nation, both as a trust of history, a trusted independent publication, at a time when independent media is under terrible stress. And I’m not fetishizing history, I’m not tethered to history, but I do draw from history to understand what is happening today. I believe that it is an unparalleled, dangerous, perilous time. At the same time, I feel a resilience, having studied and lived through terrible times, and I think that allows me to find the writers and thinkers.\nAnd also my sister used to say her friends loved ‘Yes!’, exclamation point, and she said they love The Nation, but they thought of it as “No!” exclamation point, maybe. But I do think this is a time to lift up what’s happening around this country and the world that offer alternative affirmative projects, because we can’t all live on doom and gloom, and doom scrolling all day. We need, I hate to say, the vision, but to have an alternative sense of what is working and lessons to be drawn, but in ways that are alive and vibrant. And I really feel dedicated to that.\nAnd the executive editor, who will become John Nichols, is also someone I’ve worked with. We’ve devised the honor roll over the years, people doing good things in bad times, good times, not so good times, and drawing that from the thirties, 1930s, from the magazine. There’s a new politics that The Nation in some ways has found a tie to, and we are going to really test that in these coming months and years.\nJW: Of course, the publishing landscape, as you’ve suggested, is a lot darker now than when you left day-to-day editing in 2019. Just to remind everybody, the publisher of the Washington Post stood next to Trump at his inauguration. Another of his companies paid $40 million to license a Melania Trump documentary. That’s the Washington Post’s owner. Several of their most important writers left in protest.\nMore recently, CBS fired its top late night host, Stephen Colbert, whose nightly ridicule of Trump has been relentless and hilarious. And the parent company of CBS, Paramount, paid Trump $16 million for, in quotes, his ‘presidential library’ after he sued them for a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris.\nAnd before that, ABC news paid Trump 15 million, again for his presidential library, to settle a defamation lawsuit over a report by George Stephanopoulos. That’s the Washington Post, CBS and ABC.\nAnd some ways much worse is the Republicans in Congress have defunded NPR and PBS. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is closing. And that means many dozens of public radio and TV stations, especially in the less populous red states, will go dark. That is a totalitarian move that’s a lot bigger than networks paying cash to Trump. And that makes independent media, including The Nation, more important than ever. It deepens our responsibilities.\nAnd as you’ve said, the hardest part is facing how bad things are, while we are also seeing the reasons for hope and for action. Doing both of those things simultaneously is hard, but as you say, you’ve had some experience with this.\nKVH: Our longtime contributor, you knew him well, Jon, Gore Vidal used to describe The Nation as ‘an early alert warning system’ to what’s coming over the transom, over the fortifications. I think of my colleague, Mark Hartsgaard, whose book ‘On Bended Knee’ was about the media during the Reagan era. This is worse, but I would suggest that we revisit the 1996 National Entertainment Series. The Nation did the first centerfold, which showed GE, ABC, News Corp — It showed that news was a cog in a corporate structure, which had regulatory business in Washington DC. We’re seeing that revealed painfully crystal clear in the Trump years.\nThe independence of a publication is marked not just by its financial state, but it is in these times largely defined by those who want to be close to a president who thrives on corruption and spectacle and input into his own piggybank. But I do think that the corporate media has shown how craven it is in these last months, and it’s up to The Nation and independent media, not to speak truth to power, Jon, because I believe those in power know the truth, but to expose the truth — so that ordinary people, good people, can seize that news and mobilize. Because if you don’t know, you don’t know what you’re mobilizing for. I do think The Nation does play a critical role in these times. Just briefly, we did a lot of reporting on how Rupert Murdoch bought his way to end the serious cross-ownership rules. Those are going to be obliterated in the next few weeks. And we have his move to LA: the LA Pest is going to open soon.\nJW: You’re talking here about Rupert Murdoch’s announcement that he’s launching a California edition of the New York Post right wing tabloid, and this is supposed to happen in early 202,6 based in Los Angeles, called the California Post.\nKVH: I think there is very high quality journalism being done at The Nation at other publications that are independent. I’m on the Hillman Media Judging Committee and we see that every year. It’s the business model, Jon, that is still very perilous and dangerous, as we see how the corporate media has capitulated, anticipatorily capitulated, and opened the sluice gates for more peril to the media remaining.\nJW: We need to remember that what Trump is doing is not popular, even among his own supporters, right now. His tariffs are the main thing that’s been driving down his approval ratings and causing his 2024 coalition to unravel. Let me just summarize some of the recent data from the Economist-YouGov poll. His overall approval rating just in the six months since he took office: down 21 points. Down 44 points with 18 to 29 year olds. Approval down 30 points with Hispanics since he took office. 29 points down with Independents. Down 20 points with people making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year. And it’s not just the economy, inflation, the high prices for food and rent. He’s underwater on virtually all the issues. Many more people disapprove than approve of what he’s done on immigration, deportations, education, social programs. On healthcare, his approval rating is 35%. So we have big opportunities here — and also big responsibilities.\nKVH: I agree. We have opportunity. We have responsibility. Those numbers are exhilarating. It doesn’t mean that those numbers move in a straight line direction. I think the town hall meetings, which we’re going to cover this August, will expose lawmakers to anger and despair, and may open things up. But it demands an opposition party which speaks directly to people’s lives and offers an alternative so that it’s not one and a half parties. I do think the media plays a role here. There are independent media showing the despair and the disillusion, but Trump dominates the news. He still dominates the arena and that needs to change. I think we’re seeing alternative leaders speak in ways that do touch people.\nJW: I want to talk about that – because, while the news is terrible, it’s not all bad. Probably the brightest light in the current dark landscape is Mamdani, the Social Democrat who beat former governor Andrew Cuomo to win the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York City. What has The Nation had to say about his campaign?\nKVH: Well, you’ll see more next week when the interview John Nichols and I did – the hour interview at the Little Flower Cafe in Astoria, ‘Little Flower’ being the nickname for Zorhan Mamdani’s favorite mayor, Fiorella LaGuardia. What Mamani has done, and I saw him on Sunday with Elizabeth Warren, who came to campaign for him, is make affordability a central premise of a progressive landscape. It’s not the banks, but affordability of groceries, of transportation, of housing. And he’s done it with a smile and an elegance and a use of social media that is truly unparalleled. It shows, it reminds us that The Nation needs, yes, sincerity, but also levity, I mean with a purpose. And I’m impressed.\nHe came back from Uganda where he went to see his parents and grandparents to introduce them to his new wife. But he came back and he met with a family of the private security cop who had been killed in the terrible shootings a few days before, when he’d been in Uganda. And he did it with a humanity that crossed the politicization and weaponization of such incidents.\nI think he has a real chance and he’s brought together a great coalition. Your viewers may know of ranked choice voting. It didn’t work well in 2021 in New York City. We endorsed 1, 2, 3, but one was Zorhan and two was Brad Lander, who’s been a long time progressive advocate on the city council, now controller. The Working Families Party the next day did the same lineup of Zorhan and Brad Lander. What Brad Lander did though in coalition with Zorhan is very important to understanding the success of ranked choice voting.\nJW: And it’s not just deep blue New York City where we’ve had some striking progressive victories, just in the last month. Let’s talk about Seattle. Seattle, the home of Microsoft and Amazon, where a woman named Katie Wilson is showing that Mamdani is not alone. I didn’t know about her until I read The Nation.\nKVH: That’s part of the role of The Nation in a way. But Katie Wilson, that is a tough city, but she has taken it on through taxation issues, the referendum, the big tech, high tech corporations, and she is a transportation expert. The mayor of Boston who’s 36 is going to be reelected. So there are those around the country, and I do think with gridlock and worse in Washington DC it’s important to have champions at the city and state level.\nJW: Much more amazing than Seattle or Boston: let’s talk about Omaha, a city in one of the reddest states that has had a Republican mayor who’s held office since 2013; won her last race by 30 points. Nevertheless, a Democrat, John Ewing Jr., beat her in May by nearly 13 points. If you do the arithmetic there, that’s a shift of 43 points. In Omaha, a red city. Again, I learned about this from The Nation. What can Democrats learn from John Ewing Jr’s victory in Omaha?\nKVH: Well, first of all, Nebraska has a very good Democratic chair who’s written for us, Jane Kleb. You are a historian. I am not. But that region of the country had farmer-labor alliances. It was a populist part of the country, and he’s retrieving those traditions in a modern way. So I think he’s running a populist multiracial campaign in the big cities, in Omaha a populist campaign, which leads with the bread and butter issues. And I think that there’s an opening for that and he’s showing it.\nSo when people say it can’t be done — I think next is Idaho. I’m going to take back Frank Church’s seat. The famous story: Eric Foner emailed –great historian — emailed me one night and said,’ can someone get something to Bernie Sanders? Can he stop talking about Denmark?’ Eric Foner in the middle of the night wrote an open letter, which we published, it was to Bernie, about retrieving your own country’s radical traditions, which exist — and are not so odd and fringy. They’re part of the tradition, and I think that part of The Nation’s mission is to highlight what is new but has roots in a history.\nJW: I think Trump knows he’s in deep trouble in the midterms next fall. He knows how unpopular he is. He knows how tiny his the Republican margin is in the House, and how likely that the Democrats can win the House. I think that explains this authoritarian scheme of his in Texas to eliminate five Democratic congressional seats through an unprecedented reapportionment move. John Nichols has a piece up at The Nation right now at the website that says,’Representative democracy will live or die in Texas.’\nKVH: It’s a sign of how authoritarian, not only Trump is, but some of the governors, who were ramming through legislation to rig the system. That is not a democratic system that Abbott is trying to create, and it’s happened before. And you are looking at people who rigged the rules. And by the way, it’s also the anniversary, I think the 60th of the Voting Rights Act. Making that more difficult to do? That’s called democracy, and that’s how they run. That’s how they rule, and it’s something we have to expose and rally people to understand how dangerous it is because it’s a slippery slope. You begin in Texas, you’re going to see it around the country, and we’re asking one of the legislators, a good lawyer who fled, to write for The Nation about the experience.\nJW: In conclusion here, you’ve just returned to the editor’s desk at The Nation this week. What do you see the schedule for the next weeks and months and year for what we used to call ‘America’s oldest weekly’?\nKVH: Well, we’re doing events to mark the 160th anniversary – from an event at Ethical Culture honoring the intern program, which Victor Navasky started more than 40 years ago. Someone wrote to me today that they value The Nation, not just because of the words we publish, but because of the people we’ve kind of brought through the media and journalistic system. So that will be interesting.\nAnd then we have Kaveh Akbar, our poetry editor, with Judy Collins.\nAnd then we’re heading to San Francisco where I hope to be in conversation with Jerry Brown, and we’ll have Elie Mystal, our great justice correspondent, and Rebecca Solnit and others in conversation about this moment.\nBut I also turn back to my desk and I’m going to edit Jamie Galbraith on parallels between Reagan and Trump on the economy, which is something to think about. And a piece about the New York City political scene, which has changed really in interesting ways. The Working Families Party, which The Nation helped create in 1998, is now considered sort of the senior guy on the street. And DSA, which you’ve seen over time, Democratic Socialists for America has had a lot of energy and input.\nI do think that I’m a deviation at The Nation because we do have a younger generation of democratic socialists. I remain a Rooseveltian 2.0. Lina Kahn, the great anti-monopolist professor, former head of the FTC, had an op-ed the other day, I wish we’d published it — about Zorhan and small business. We should not cede small business to the right. And his work on halal trucks and bodegas have redefined in some measure what small businesses do.\nOne of our contributors, I’ve said this before, Norman Thomas, a socialist we endorsed in 1932, said, ‘there are no lost causes. There are only causes waiting to be won.’ But I do think that realism is important, but also resilience. I think it’s a very tough time for a lot of people and we have to be understanding of that — so that we give people, not the week of Trump, we do that, but we also give them the week of Resistance 2.0.\nJW: Katrina Vanden Heuvel, she’s Publisher of The Nation — And now, once again, editor of The Nation Magazine. Katrina, thanks for all your work, and thanks for talking with us today.\nKVH: Thank you.\n[BREAK]\nJon Wiener: Now it’s time to talk with Robert Reich about how we got here and what we can do now. He’s done a lot in his life: He’s a legendary teacher at Berkeley. He was Secretary of Labor under Bill Clinton. He’s written 18 books, which have been translated into 22 languages. His articles have appeared in The New Yorker, The Atlantic, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal. He’s a columnist now for The Guardian. And a lot of us read his daily newsletter at Substack or follow him on Instagram or TikTok or YouTube, where he is a star. And he has a new book out: It’s called Coming Up Short: A Memoir of My America. We reached him today in Berkeley. Robert Reich, welcome back.\nRobert Reich: Well, good to talk to you, Jon.\nJW: You call your memoir ‘a story of the failure of my generation.’ It’s mine too. You say it was our mistake, starting with the sixties’ movements. We had a civil rights movement and an anti-war movement, and then in the seventies, a women’s movement, then a gay rights movement, then an environmental movement. But you say one movement was missing — and that created what you call ‘a giant political void that would eventually be filled by Donald Trump’s angry, bigoted, cultural populism.’ What was missing?\nRR: Well, in a word, it was the labor movement – actually, two words, Jon. The labor movement had been around obviously in fits and starts over a hundred years, but I didn’t really, and here’s my confessional, I didn’t really think about it in those days as a movement. Labor was there. It was big labor, there were big companies, big corporations, and there was big government, and it didn’t seem necessary in a way to consider or to talk about the labor movement or to talk even about the working class. And I think that that was my error. It was an error that a lot of people made because all of these other movements did take a life of their own, they accomplished a great deal, but by forgetting about workers and the labor movement, I think we laid the groundwork for something quite ugly.\nJW: The Democrats’ great turn away from the working class and the labor movement of course came in the Bill Clinton years when you were Secretary of Labor. The whole thing was pretty clear from the start of the Clinton campaign in 1992, at least if you listened to third party candidate, Ross Perot. You quote him in your book on the subject of NAFTA, which George HW Bush had just negotiated with Mexico, also Canada, in one of the presidential debates in ‘92, watched by 60 million people. That’s about the same number that watched the debates this year. Perot explained why he was against NAFTA. “If you’re paying $13 or $14 an hour for factory workers and you can move your factory south of the border and pay $1 an hour, have no healthcare, no environment or pollution controls, no retirement, and you don’t care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound coming from the south.” Today, that seems obvious. How did it seem to you in 1992?\nRR: In 1992, Jon? I was worried about that. I thought that, and I put it in slightly in different terms. I worried that American workers would lose bargaining leverage. They were already losing bargaining power. I talked about it inside the, in coed incipient Clinton administration, but I lost those internal debates. It was very clear, Bill Clinton and other people around him wanted to embrace NAFTA, and I did what I was told to do, and I think in retrospect, I don’t know whether that was the right thing to do. I argued as much as I could, and I also argued against Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization. In fact, I was worried that that would have an even bigger, essentially a sucking sound. I lost a lot of the arguments internally, Jon, I’ve written about that. You and I have talked about that, and I guess from where we are right now, I see that all of this contributed to, it didn’t lead in inevitably to Donald Trump, but it contributed to the emergence of Donald Trump.\nJW: The big debate in American politics really for the last 50 years has been framed by the Republicans. They say more government is bad. Freedom from big government is good, freedom for the market. You’ve been arguing with this position for a long time now. Remind us what your reply has been.\nRR: I’ve said it so often. It just, it’s sort of automatic and I don’t think people even listen because I’m so predictable. The question is not more or less government. The question is, who is government for? Is it working for average working people and the poor, or is it working for the people who have a lot of money and a lot of resources and big corporations? And certainly, over the last decades, government has done more and more on behalf of the latter, that is big corporations and the wealthy because that’s where the money has come from for campaigns. That’s where the legalized bribery that I talk about in the book has really occurred. And if we want to, and we have to, and this is not if we want to, we have to disabuse ourselves from that kind of addiction. And the Democratic Party has got to give up the corporate and financial Democrats that have been so important to the party in terms of money but have eroded the party’s moral authority.\nJW: When you were Secretary of Labor, you did get Congress to raise the minimum wage just before the ‘96 elections. What had it been and what did they do?\nRR: Well, they raised the minimum wage to, I believe it was $5 and—\nJW: 15.\nRR: 15 cents, which I mean, it doesn’t, from today’s standpoint, it doesn’t look like anything, but it had been $4 and 25 cents. It was a Republican Senate and a Republican House. They didn’t want to raise the minimum wage. And basically, it wasn’t me, I mean, I did try to lead that charge on the hill, but what really did it was that most Americans and the Republicans saw the polls, the same polls that everybody else saw. And it was not just one poll. It was poll after poll after poll. Most Americans wanted the minimum wage raised, not because they would benefit. They knew that they were not on a minimum wage, but they felt that it was the fair thing to do. And that’s a very important part of the story because Americans have this very deep-seated sense of what’s fair and what’s not fair. I saw it firsthand when I was labor secretary and before and after and since. And we can’t simply assume that everybody is cynical like Donald Trump, or everybody is negative and mean spirited like Donald Trump. No, I think Americans really are fundamentally good and fair.\nJW: It’s been 16 years since Congress raised the federal minimum wage. It’s been $7 and 25 cents. You said the Republicans supported it in 1996, and that was because so many Americans supported raising the minimum wage. Don’t so many Americans still support raising the minimum wage? 83% say the current $7 and 25 cents rate is not enough to live on. How much should it be in 2023? 65% of voters said $15 an hour. Younger people favor a lot more.\nRR: Today, you’re absolutely right. I mean the same percentage, if not more, want the minimum wage raised. It hasn’t been raised since 2009. This is crazy. We can’t expect. Most people cannot possibly live on today’s minimum wage. It should be at least $15. And if you actually controlled for both inflation and productivity improvements, it would be closer to 20 or $25 an hour.\nJW: So after Clinton, of course, then came Obama, there was that speech in 2004 that he gave at the Democratic National Convention that made him an instant hero. He said, “there’s not a liberal America and a conservative America. There’s a United States of America.” Now today, that seems totally wrong, doesn’t it?\nRR: It does. It seems quaint, if not wrong. I mean, how can there be not a liberal and not a conservative America? And I think what Obama was trying to do, and he did it with such grace, and he did, he continued to try to do it. And that is to tell us that we are part of one society, one experiment in democracy, and we shouldn’t allow people to try to divide us. I mean, look, let’s be clear here, the divide and conquer strategy has been very effective. And it’s been used by, I’m sure Vladimir Putin has been using it. And I’m sure also the oligarchy of America has used it because you see, if you can divide Americans and make them think that they’re real enemies are the people on the other side of the political divide, then they don’t look up and see where all the money and power really has gone in our society.\nJW: Obama didn’t really help with this problem at all. Despite the economic crash of 2008. He stuck with Wall Street and the big banks and divide in America, deepened and after America, the 2016 elections. Bernie Sanders ran in the Democratic primaries even though he wasn’t a Democrat. And even though, as you say, he was a 74-year-old Jew from Vermont. You say, if the DNC had not tipped the scales against him by rigging campaign financing in favor of Hillary, Bernie would’ve been the party’s nominee in 2016. How do you feel about Bernie?\nRR: I love Bernie. He’s one of my heroes. I don’t know where he gets his energy, his stamina, his tenacity. But he’s been there and he’s out there, even as we speak, he’s out there. He’s talking to people. He’s telling the truth, and God bless Bernie.\nJW: I want to change the subject to your teaching. You taught at Harvard and then you taught at Berkeley. You’ve just retired. Harvard, of course, the elite private school, Berkeley, the flagship public university. What differences did you see, and which did you like better?\nRR: Oh, Berkeley. I mean, Harvard is a wonderful institution, obviously, but I love University of California, Berkeley. Berkeley, in fact, the entire University of California system is the largest and most powerful system of upward mobility in America. My students, most of them were first generation, first generation in terms of getting a college diploma. A third of them came directly. They transferred from community colleges. It’s an engine of upward mobility.\nJW: One thing I want to ask you about that I’ve learned only recently, not everybody is interested in politics the way we are. In fact, most people aren’t very interested in politics. They don’t follow the news that much, especially working class and poor people. They’re preoccupied with their own lives, their own problems, their own pleasures, politics for them, is sort of like the Olympics. You watch it every four years for a couple of days, maybe you hope your team wins. And all the effort and all the money that our side puts into getting the right message out, a message that’s been tested, they don’t pay attention. They’re not very interested. They vote on vague feelings: ‘I like him,’ or ‘he seems like a good guy to me’ =- or they don’t vote at all. 89 million people did not vote in 2024. That’s a lot more than the number of people who voted for Trump, 77 million.\nSo better messaging, which so much of our work goes into figuring out, better messaging may not be the best way to reach all these people. We need to find other modes of communication, other ways to reach them than the kind of politics we’ve been doing all our lives. And now you are a star on TikTok and YouTube where you have 1.3 million subscribers. And on Instagram you have 2 million followers – and Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, these are the places where now where millions of people who don’t read the daily newspaper or watch TV news get their information. How did you become so good at this?\nRR: I don’t know. I don’t know. I really don’t know. I have two sons, one of whom named Sam has been doing a lot of social media. Sam runs a company called Dropout Television. Have you seen any of that?\nJW: Nope.\nRR: Well, you’re not alone. I mean, nobody our age has seen it. But young people, my students, they all know Sam. In fact, somebody came up to me on the sidewalk just a couple of days ago and said, I mean, “Are you Sam Reich’s father?”\nBut a few years ago, it was about 10 years ago, Sam said to me, “Dad, I know you write books. You like to write books. And I know you get a lot of satisfaction out of it, but my generation is – they’re not big readers, particularly of your kind of book. And if you want to reach my generations generation, you’ve got to do social media.”\nAnd at that point, I barely knew what social media was, but he tutored me, he helped me. And I have a little group of young people who are in their twenties and thirties who helped me do it. I couldn’t do it without them. They’re very talented and they keep me young to the extent that anybody can do that. So yes, I mean, I still write books, hence the book we are talking about, Coming Up Short, but I do a lot of social media because it is a way of teaching. It is a way of connecting.\nJW: I want to talk about one other thing: tall people. Your memoir, you called Coming Up Short. It’s the thesis of your book that our generation failed to strengthen democracy. But that’s also a pun about your height. You are not a tall person. I am not a tall person. And you make the point that the taller candidate usually wins the election. Our tallest presidents, I look them up, there’s a Wikipedia page, ‘Presidents by height.’ Lincoln is our tallest president, six feet, four inches. LBJ number 2, 6’3” and a half, Clinton 6’3”, FDR 6’2”, Obama 6’2”, George HW Bush 6’2”, JFK 6’1”, Reagan 6’1”, Joe Biden, 6 feet even. What about Trump? Of course, Trump lies about his height. He claims to be 6’3”. There’s also a Wikipedia page about this, but photos show him standing right next to Obama, and they’re exactly the same height, more or less. Trump has more hair on top of his head, so maybe he’s, and Obama is 6’2”. I had a professor who blamed all the troubles of the world on what he called the six-footers. Why should the six-footers always win?\nRR: Well, that’s a very good question. I think there’s a lot of prejudice in our society that we don’t talk about against short men or in favor of tall men, and women it’s slightly different. But I think that the studies that I’ve read, and I’ve been kind of interested in this subject, obviously I have a personal interest, but I’ve been interested sociologically. It turns out that, and there are many evolutionary biologists and others who think that we are kind of genetically wired to choose big people, tall men, to be our leaders because they are, again, in terms of kind of Darwinian survival of the fittest, they are the ones who can protect us. Even our language, when we talk about ‘looking up to somebody’ or ‘somebody has stature’ or I mean, there are all kinds of ways we unconsciously are prejudicial. And then in dating, I don’t know whether you had this experience, Jon. I’m very short and there were a number of girls who just didn’t want to look at me. They didn’t want to go out with a boy who is shorter than they were. And that was the cruelest, the cruelest of all prejudices.\nJW: Last thing: the long game. Going back to Bernie just for a minute here. One of the things you say you love about Bernie is that he exemplifies the long game his whole life. He’s been saying the same thing. He doesn’t have a problem staying on message. We have midterms coming up in a year and a half. Then we have an election after that. What is the long game for us right now?\nRR: I think the long game has got to protect our democracy, and to actually get it back, to revive and rebuild democratic institutions. In the book, I talk about Donald Trump as not being the cause of our present problems, but the consequence, the culmination of decades of neglect. We took many of these institutions for granted. We deregulated. I was part of an administration that deregulated Wall Street, that embraced free trade, that didn’t pay much attention as corporations got bigger and bigger and monopolized industries that didn’t really pay much attention to unions. And I think that all of this added up to a, I don’t want to be reductionist here and say it automatically led to Trump, but it led to a large and disaffected and angry working class that felt looked down upon, felt forgotten. And when somebody like Trump came along, and even though he lied through his teeth and even though he was a Trojan horse for the wealthy and the billionaires, he sounded like, he acted like he cared about, and he recognized working class people.\nJW: Robert Reich – his new book is Coming Up Short, A Memoir of My America. Bob, thank you for all your work, and thanks for talking with us today.\nRR: Well, Jon, thank you.\nSubscribe to The Nation to Support all of our podcasts\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "With Alligator Alcatraz, Empire’s Tyranny Has Come Home", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/alligator-alcatraz-us-empire-history/", "text": "With Alligator Alcatraz, Empire’s Tyranny Has Come Home\nThe Florida migrant gulag is what happens when the depravities of colonialist foreign policy are turned inward.\nThey’re calling it “Alligator Alcatraz”—a sprawling migrant detention center deep in the Florida wetlands, surrounded by flood zones, razor wire, and a sense of menace. Crawling with both literal and governmental predators, it was built not just to process but to intimidate. ICE buses arrive daily. Surveillance cameras and National Guard patrols make clear: This is a prison, not a sanctuary. Those deemed “unwelcome” in this country will be caged here and forgotten.\nOfficials claim the facility will redefine the deportation pipeline. They’re right—just not how they think. That’s because Alligator Alcatraz isn’t a new invention. It’s the latest incarnation of a system designed not to welcome the displaced but to contain, punish, and erase them. It’s the logical endpoint of decades of militarized US policy at home and abroad.\nIn June, President Trump bypassed California’s governor and deployed Marines and National Guard troops to Los Angeles to assist ICE raids in residential neighborhoods. Military personnel patrolled school drop-offs and hospitals. Cameras rolled as families were separated on sidewalks. Days later, Trump publicly suggested that Zohran Mamdani—a US citizen and New York mayoral candidate of South Asian descent—should be arrested and deported.\nThis isn’t a glitch in the system. It is the system—warnings embedded in spectacle.\nWe are not witnessing a sudden surge in xenophobia. We are witnessing the convergence of histories—immigration enforcement, racial control, and foreign policy merging into one carceral project. The result is a domestic counterinsurgency machine, refined over decades, now turned inward.\nStart in Guatemala, 1954. The CIA overthrew Jacobo Árbenz after he threatened to redistribute land and cut into US business interests. The coup plunged the country into a civil war that lasted 36 years, killed more than 200,000 people, and sent refugees fleeing north. Many of those refugees or their descendants could now face detention or deportation.\nThe pattern repeated across the region. The US-backed ousting of Salvador Allende in Chile. The civil war in El Salvador, where American funded armed death squads and displaced nearly a quarter of the population. In Honduras, the 2009 US-backed coup sparked a political collapse that is still driving tens of thousands north to the border each year.\nThese migrations trace the scars of US foreign policy. As historian Greg Grandin writes, Latin America became “empire’s workshop”—a testing ground for counterinsurgency tactics that would eventually return home.\nWhen migrants arrive at the southern border, they’re crossing fault lines created by the US through military aid, economic coercion, and covert operations. The so-called border crisis isn’t the product of random chaos. It’s the empire’s return flow.\nIn the 1980s, Cold War logic fused with the War on Drugs. Surveillance expanded. Local police were militarized. Poor and immigrant neighborhoods were redefined as threat zones. After 9/11, things intensified again. Techniques refined in Iraq and Afghanistan— biometric tracking, drone surveillance, predictive policing—were imported wholesale into immigration enforcement. ICE, DHS, and CBP absorbed a wartime logic.\nAnd with them came the architects of war itself.\nBehind the biometric gates of Alligator Alcatraz lie the fingerprints of America’s most powerful defense contractors. Raytheon, Palantir, and Lockheed Martin— firms once known for cruise missiles and drone strikes—now supply the surveillance, facial recognition software, and digital tracking tools used to police the immigrants.\nPopular\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →These surveillance technologies don’t originate in a vacuum. Many are tested and refined in occupied Palestine, where Israel has developed and exported a model of control built on biometric tracking, predictive policing, and permanent militarization. US agencies like ICE and DHS have engaged in joint training with Israeli security forces, importing not only tactics but an ideology of total control over racialized populations. Companies like Elbit Systems, which built surveillance technology in and around Israel’s separation wall, now provide surveillance towers and sensors for the US-Mexico border. The occupation of Palestine functions as a laboratory—where techniques of domination are sharpened before being deployed at home.\nThese engines of containment operate with bipartisan blessing.\nFrom Reagan to Clinton, Bush to Biden, the approach has remained largely the same: treat migration as a threat to contain, not a consequence to understand. Criminalization becomes the default. Enforcement becomes policy. And budgets balloon accordingly.\nPresident Obama—despite his reformist rhetoric—deported more immigrants than any president in US history, earning the nickname “Deporter in Chief” from immigrant rights advocates. His administration expanded detention quotas, surveillance programs, and legal frameworks that future presidents would inherit and escalate. Though he later narrowed priorities to focus on serious offenders and recent arrivals, the shift came too late—and without dismantling the underlying machinery.\nThat fortified system was handed to Trump, who wasted no time weaponizing it—turning immigration into theater, threatening naturalized citizens, and staging mass raids for cable news consumption. But the logic of punishment over protection, of surveillance over sanctuary, didn’t start with Trump—and it didn’t end with him.\nNow, under his second term, the infrastructure is metastasizing. In July, the administration offered $608 million to states willing to replicate Florida’s detention model—an incentive for governors to build their own Alligator Alcatrazes using fast-track emergency powers. Texas, Arizona, and Louisiana have all expressed interest. Florida’s prototype—built in just eight days with $245 million in federal contracts—is a deterrence model packaged for national rollout.\nToday, over 56,000 people are held in ICE detention on any given night—a record high and a 40 percent increase over last year. Nearly 72 percent have no criminal history. With overcrowding mounting, reports of physical and emotional abuse proliferate: migrants forced to stand in the blazing sun for hours, held in disgusting and unsafe conditions, denied legal counsel, and separated from children without clear reunification plans. These are recurring features of a system optimized for disorientation. And still, the budgets swell. Hundreds of millions materialize for rapid construction and mass detention, while calls for livable wages, healthcare, or functioning schools are met with shrugs and spreadsheets.\nThe question is never how we afford care—only why we keep choosing cages.\nLast month, Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a sweeping spending measure that slashes funding for Medicaid and SNAP while allocating nearly $170 billion to immigration enforcement—making ICE the largest federal law enforcement agency. A massive share of that funding will flow to private prison operators and defense contractors behind detention sites like Alligator Alcatraz. This is intentional. Caging the displaced is now a bipartisan budget priority.\nThis isn’t about security. It’s about investment—in fear, in punishment, in profit.\nAs historian Kelly Lytle Hernández reminds us, ICE’s ancestry traces back to slave patrols and colonial policing. What once pursued the enslaved now targets the displaced. The tools have evolved—drones instead of dogs, algorithms instead of chains—but the purpose remains the same: capture and control.\nAnd increasingly, even dissent becomes a deportable offense. Legal observers have documented ICE raids at churches, schools, and hospitals. Families torn apart not by accident, but by strategy. The goal isn’t just removal. It’s fear.\nI’ve spoken with migrant workers who say today’s fear mirrors the violence they once fled. The helicopters were American then, too—just flown by others. Now they hover over US cities with the same intent: detain, divide, disappear.\nYet, even under these conditions, resistance endures. Detainees stage hunger strikes. Legal advocates sue. Communities build rapid-response networks and mutual aid systems. But the machine grinds on.\nPhilosopher Aimé Césaire warned that colonial violence always boomerangs back home. Hannah Arendt cautioned that totalitarianism begins when imperial methods turn inward—when entire populations are cast as internal enemies.\nWe’ve reached that moment. A nation that once exported counterinsurgency now enacts it on domestic soil.\nAlligator Alcatraz is not an outlier. It is a signal flare.\nThe surveillance state that once patrolled Fallujah now monitors Fresno. The defense contractors that once armed foreign insurgencies now manage migrant detention contracts. The legal architecture that once interned Japanese Americans now justifies raids on schools and mosques.\nImmigration enforcement is not broken. It is working exactly as it was designed to—to discipline labor, suppress dissent, and reinforce a racial and economic order.\nWe must stop asking how to fix a system built to punish. We must ask why we keep paying for it—in Congress, in budgets, in silence, and in complicity.\nBecause when empire turns inward, it doesn’t just target migrants. It targets the nation’s soul.\n“Empire abroad entails tyranny at home,” Arendt warned us. The tyranny has landed.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "We’ve Officially Entered Kafka’s America", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/north-carolina-immigration-dragnet/", "text": "We’ve Officially Entered Kafka’s America\nStephen Miller’s dystopian immigrant-hunting system is picking up pace, and asylum seekers like Mohamed Naser are increasingly vulnerable.\nThree weeks ago, Helen Parsonage, a North Carolina immigration attorney, received a call from a Greensboro community member informing her that unidentified government agents were trying to grab an immigrant father of five from out of his home.\nThe man the agents wanted to arrest was a 50-year-old Libyan asylum seeker named Mohamed Naser. Fifteen years ago, Naser entered the country legally and applied for asylum. He has been going through the court process ever since and has a work permit. On the day in question, he was working for a contractor who fixed kitchen appliances for the Wendy’s fast-food chain.\nNaser’s only previous involvement with the law came nearly a decade ago, when he was pulled over on a traffic stop and issued three tickets, for expired registration and insurance, and for not wearing a seatbelt. The tickets were ultimately dismissed, Parsonage says. But in an era in which ICE and CBP agents are operating under Stephen Miller’s orders (which the DOJ denies are actually orders) to meet arrest quotas of upwards of 3,000 immigrants per day nationwide, it is presumably those dismissed tickets that were enough to bring the father to their attention.\nThe agents, in plainclothes and with no identification, first approached Naser’s house at 9 am on July 15. He was out at work, so the men reportedly told his wife that they would return with reinforcements. When Naser came back for his lunch break, agents wearing camo outfits adorned with the block letters “Police” lunged toward him. Naser, who had read multiple reports of criminals impersonating ICE teams in the months since Trump’s inauguration, was terrified and made a dash for the safety of his house. He made it inside, but when he and his wife tried to slam the door, an agent secured a foothold, keeping his boot in the opening to stop them from being able to fully close it. For more than an hour, as neighbors poured into the street to film the standoff, the agents attempted to force their way into the house, even though they apparently had no warrant that would allow them to enter the property legally in pursuit of Naser. Finally, they gave up and left.\nTwo days later, however, the snatch-and-grab crew had more luck, finding Naser on one of his work routes, as he headed toward a Wendy’s. They arrested and detained him.\nAn ICE agent contacted Parsonage and told her that his superiors had ordered him to ask Naser a series of questions about his knowledge of, and involvement with, Iranian government covert operations in the United States and overseas, and about plans the Iranian leadership might have to shut the Straits of Hormuz in the aftermath of the recent US and Israeli bombings of Iran.\nTime and again, Parsonage, who was present for the interrogation, explained that her client was Libyan, not Iranian, that he had never been to Iran, and that he didn’t know anything about the country. Each time, the agent reportedly responded to her that he understood this but that he and his colleagues were under orders to ask detainees these questions. At the end of the interview, the attorney told the presiding ICE officer that since they clearly had the wrong man, her client should now be released.\nThe officer’s answer shocked Parsonage. In a truly Kafkaesque turn of phrase, she says that he informed her that once ICE or the CBP had an immigrant in their possession, they would not let him or her go, even if they had been arrested on a misunderstanding, as was apparently the case here. Instead, once the interrogation was over, they would transfer Naser to a detention facility.\nThe next thing his family knew, Naser was detained in a privately run immigrant detention facility in Lumpkin, Georgia, an eight-hour drive from his home. “They’ve got a zero-release policy,” Parsonage told me.\nThe Kafkaesque journey through America’s increasingly dystopian immigrant-hunting system picked up pace. At a bond hearing on July 29, about 100 community members attended the WebX streaming session to show their support for Naser. Those men and women had already contributed to a GoFundMe to raise bond money to get their neighbor out of the detention site and back home with his family. The government argued against Naser’s release on bond, claiming that he was a flight risk because he had fled into his own home in the face of an assault against him by unidentified agents, and that he was a danger to society because he had—in what, given the circumstances, seems classic understatement—called the agents trying to arrest him “very bad men.”\nThe judge didn’t buy the government’s flimsy arguments and ordered Naser released on $20,000 bond—money that had already been raised by his neighbors and friends. And so, Naser’s family readied to pick him up and bring him home. But instead of letting him go, ICE filed for an automatic stay on his release, a filing that was shrouded in secrecy, Parsonage explained. The agency provided no information about why it wanted to circumvent the court ruling.\nLast Friday, backed by a growing chorus of outrage from Democratic state political representatives, Parsonage and her colleagues filed a habeas petition, and the next morning, as suddenly as they had filed the automatic stay paperwork, the government withdrew that claim. Instead, it filed for a “discretionary” stay on Naser’s release, essentially asking the judge to side with them in denying Naser his freedom. Over the weekend, Parsonage’s team of attorneys filed another application for their client to be released on bond. Naser told the attorneys that during this time government agents repeatedly tried to pressure him into agreeing to “self-deport.”\nFinally, on Tuesday night, after days of protests, rallies, and letter-writing campaigns by hundreds of neighbors, local politicians, and clergy, Naser was released. Yet his celebrations may be short-lived. Naser still faces removal proceedings that could result in his deportation to war-torn Libya, the country he fled 15 years ago.\nKafka would have understood this moment all too well: this America where masked men can grab residents off the street, almost regardless of their legal status; can interrogate them about things they have no knowledge of; can detain them not because their answers rendered them suspicious but because their arrest needs to somehow be justified after the fact; and can then deny their release for no reason other than that the government is now operating on an arrest-and-deport quota system. He would recognize the vindictive impulses of a government defeated in the courts that still pursues deportation for the sake of deportation against a hard-working family man.\nPopular\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →Around the country, snatch squads are roaming the streets with impunity, with new ICE recruits reportedly paid a $50,000 signing-on bonus. The government has also reportedly flirted with—and then apparently withdrawn—a “pilot program” offering cash incentives to agents for each migrants they swiftly deport through circumventing due process protections. A recent CNN analysis suggested that Democratic-run cities and states are bearing the brunt of these arrests as the Trump administration seeks to punish so-called sanctuary jurisdictions. And Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino boasted on Fox News that his agents “will go anywhere, anytime we want in Los Angeles.” The administration has made clear that if states won’t let ICE into their jails, they will conduct increased numbers of raids out in the community.\nAnd in places like North Carolina, with a Republican legislature and full law enforcement cooperation with ICE, law-abiding immigrants like Naser are increasingly vulnerable.\nThere is no rhyme or reason to who gets caught in the sweeping anti-immigrant dragnet that the administration has cast. It doesn’t matter if you are not the person ICE thought you were when they swept you up. What matters is that your arrest contributes to the required daily quota dreamt up by the sadistic zealots who now rule the roost in Washington.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "Those Constant Texts Asking You to Donate to Democrats Are Scams", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/mothership-strategies-democratic-consultants-fundraising-pleas/", "text": "Those Constant Texts Asking You to Donate to Democrats Are Scams\nA new analysis shows that if you give $100 to an appeal run by a leading Democratic Party vendor, only $1.60 will actually go to the campaign.\nThe signs of the Democratic Party’s receding viability are legion, from its dismal approval numbers in opinion polls to its serial capitulations to the GOP on Capitol Hill. Yet one arm of the Democrats’ political operation is humming along: its nonstop fundraising appeals in e-mail inboxes and text-messaging accounts. These frenetic pitches are no doubt familiar to many Nation readers: They invoke some pending MAGA outrage, suggest the imminent collapse of the republic is nigh, and hit you up for a small donation. Many of them are couched in the voice of a prominent Democratic leader or candidate, introducing themselves by their first names and addressing the recipient in the same fashion, as though from a neighboring barstool.\nThese ubiquitous pleas—known as “churn and burn” come-ons—are more than just a reflection of a panicking opposition party trying to stoke voter enthusiasm; they are, increasingly, the reigning business model of a Democratic establishment otherwise unable to effectively oppose the MAGA movement. And as a revealing investigation by political-spending sleuth Adam Bonica shows, these appeals are scams.\nBonica has combed through FEC filings to document the money flows generated by the Democrats’ largest private vendor for churn-and-burn appeals, Mothership Strategies, and found that most of the small donations kicked up in this fashion stay firmly in the orbit of the Democrats’ privately contracted fundraising complex. Of the $676 million that Mothership has raised since 2018, Bonica writes, $159 million went to Mothership’s own coffers as consulting fees. Other money streams are likewise far afield from campaign work: $70 million for Mothership’s payroll and $150 million for more consulting outlays. Most of these expanses, Bonica writes, “appear to be administrative costs or media buys that feed back into the fundraising machine itself.” Meanwhile, Mothership has its own hefty outlays for vendor support—one firm specializing in these pseudo-personalized text come-ons, Message Digital LLC, pulled in $22.5 million over the same period.\nWith all this dosh swirling around the Mothership’s orbit, the percentage of cash going into actual campaigns and Democratic electioneering organizations is vanishingly small. “My analysis of the network’s FEC disbursements reveals that, at most, $11 million of the $678 million raised from individuals has made its way to candidates, campaigns, or the national party committees,” Bonica writes. “This represents a fundraising efficiency rate of just 1.6 percent.”\nThat’s a stunning number—but as Bonica also notes, it arises from a classic set of self-dealing Beltway arrangements. Mothership was founded in 2014 by two veterans of the digital arm of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Greg Berlin and Charles Starnes, who simply took the churn-and-burn strategies they’d honed at the DCCC and converted them into proprietary assets as private contractors. And to keep the cash flowing in their direction, they also founded a host of plausibly goo-goo sounding satellite groups to authorize and circulate fresh torrents of fundraising asks. The partners thus “became the operational heart of a sprawling nexus of interconnected political action committees, many of which they helped create and which now serve as their primary clients,” Bonica notes:\nThese are not a diverse collection of grassroots groups; they are a tightly integrated network that functions primarily to funnel funds to Mothership. . . . The relationship between the firm and this network is cemented by blatant self-dealing.\nA spokesperson for the firm disputes Bonica’s analysis, saying “This Substack is completely inaccurate and contains numerous false and misleading claims about Mothership and our clients. The truth is that Mothership supports Democratic campaigns, PACs, issue advocacy organizations, and more in raising critical funds. We have directly raised over $400 million for dozens of campaigns and member-connected PAC clients. Further, a majority of the funds that are reported by the FEC as going to Mothership are pass through funds the company actually pays to our clients’ other vendors, including advertising partners, to support their programmatic work.”\nDisputes over forensic accounting aside, this far-reaching grift is not something Democrats can afford, either financially or politically. The party’s fundraising efforts are already lagging behind the incumbent GOP heading into a midterm cycle. There’s a grim perversity in setting up money fronts with names like Stop Republicans when their actual effect is to leach desperately needed cash out of Democratic campaign operations; the financial logic here serves to achieve the opposite of those worthy goals.\nAnd this is where the damage wrought by the Mothership empire goes beyond the financial hemorrhaging, as appalling as the scale of those losses are. To keep working, the churn-and-burn come-ons depend on Democrats’ having some trust in the party—and a fundraising complex that diverts donor cash away from the campaigns it professes to serve will only compound the party’s credibility crisis. After running in the last election cycle on the true and urgent case that Trump and the MAGA movement represent an existential threat to American democracy—and that Project 2025 aims to permanently enshrine the authoritarian agenda of the MAGA right in the most basic operations of government—Democrats have largely failed to counter these threats as they’ve come to gruesome life in Trump’s second term.\nThat’s been a devastating blow to the party’s image as it needs to persuade voters it can foreclose on another MAGA putsch next November. A new AP poll found that a third of Democrats queried about the state of the party responded negatively: “About 15 percent described it using words like ‘weak,’ or ‘apathetic,’” the survey found, “while an additional 10 percent believe it is broadly ‘ineffective’ or ‘disorganized.’” Meanwhile, “Republicans were about twice as likely to describe their own party positively.”\nThis enthusiasm gap broadly tracks the fundraising gap between the two parties—and the cynical donor shakedowns perpetrated by Mothership and its satellite groups feed the perception that Democrats fundraise off crises rather than respond to them. As Bonica writes, the political impact of the Mothership grift is that “for every dollar a grandmother in Iowa donates believing she’s saving democracy, 98 cents goes to consultants and operational costs.” And the party’s recent congressional record—from Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer’s disastrous capitulation to the GOP in last winter’s budget showdown to the Democrats’ dismal support for the brutal immigration crackdowns in the Laken Riley Act and the crypto-bribery provisions of the GENIUS Act—reflects an approach to the party’s base that’s at least as cynical as a churn-and-burn fundraising pitch.\nIf the Democratic Party wants to be taken seriously as the answer to an unhinged and increasingly unpopular MAGA governing agenda, it needs to nuke the Mothership and start acting like an actual opposition party.\nThis post has been updated with a comment from Mothership spokesperson.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "Representative Democracy Will Live or Die In Texas", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/texas-gerrymandering-fight-trump/", "text": "Representative Democracy Will Live or Die In Texas\nA gerrymandering fight reveals how far Trump will go to avoid electoral accountability.\nThe small-d democratic logic of an argument made by Texas state Representative Ann Johnson—who, with her Democratic colleagues in the state legislature, has left Texas in order to prevent Republican legislators from carrying out President Trump’s order to radically gerrymander its congressional maps—is beyond debate.\n“If Republicans are scared of Texas voters, they should adjust their policies—not rig our maps,” says Johnson, a top Texas lawyer and three-term legislator, who flew out of the Lone Star State on Sunday as part of a tactical move intended to prevent Republican Governor Greg Abbott and Republican legislators from implementing a plan to redraw district maps in order to flip five of the 12 seats Democrats currently hold to the GOP.\nSpecifically, Texas Democratic legislators are breaking quorum—a tactic that effectively denies Republican legislative leaders the ability to proceed with Trump’s gerrymandering scheme. “I am asking everybody to remember that Quorum Break is a tool that the founding fathers of Texas put in place for when a minority party knows that the majority party has gone off the rails and is doing something against the interests and will of the voters,” explains Johnson. “Thousands of you have come out to say that you do want your seats stolen by Trump. The Big Ugly Bill passed by one vote—one vote—and he is afraid of you going to the polls in November of 2026. He has asked Governor Abbott to break the rules and get him five new Republican seats. You all spoke up [in opposition]. They pushed it. They put it on the floor. And, so, please know that this extraordinary step of a Quorum Break is so that your voices can be heard. If they are not going to be heard here in Texas, then we are breaking quorum to go to the nation and say: ‘This is it! You must stop Trump’s takeover!’”\nAbbott is apoplectic. He has threatened to charge the Democrats with felonies and remove them from their elected positions. Savvy legal experts say he lacks the standing to do so. And the Democratic governors of several blue states have signaled that, if Abbott finds a way to override the Texas Democrats and go ahead with the new gerrymander, they may look to counter his moves by redrawing maps in their own states.\nThe increasingly chaotic wrangling over congressional district maps illustrates just how high the stakes are for Texas, and the whole of the United States.\nThe suddenly nationalized fight over gerrymandering in Texas goes to the basic premises of representative democracy, which the best of the founders of the American project understood as an experiment in giving power to the people. The experiment has never worked perfectly. But, at its best, it has provided a check and a balance on executive overreach and authoritarian abuses by DC elites.\nIn the past, when American presidents and their parties experienced the sort of collapse in poll numbers that Trump and the GOP have been hit with since they decided to gut Medicaid and anti-hunger programs in order to fund tax cuts for billionaires, and at the same time sent the economy reeling with ill-conceived tariff policies, those leaders adjusted their policies.\nOr they lost their positions, and their congressional majorities, at the next election.\nThis principle of electoral accountability has tended to be a powerful corrective in American politics. In its mildest form, it requires presidents and members of Congress to explain their choices and to try to win the American people over to their points of view. In more extreme circumstances, it has led to epic political shifts, as occurred in 1932, when Americans rejected the Wall Street–aligned Republicans whose policies had accelerated the Great Depression, and replaced them with Franklin Roosevelt and the coalition of Democrats and left-wing allies who would usher in the New Deal.\nNow Trump wants to upend the accountability calculus by having his allies rework the already highly skewed maps of Texas in a way that could give Republicans a chance to hold on to the House, where they currently occupy 219 seats, just one more than is needed to claim a clear majority in the 435-seat chamber. But, as always, he also wants to test how much authoritarianism he can get away with. If the Texas gambit goes forward, other Republican-controlled states will surely follow the Lone Star GOP —and if the US Supreme Court allows them to do so, by gutting what remains of the Voting Rights Act—Trump and the GOP could retain full control of the federal government in 2026, even if voters in Texas and nationwide give a majority of their votes to Democrats.\nThat’s what makes what’s been happening in Austin more than just a Lone Star struggle. “Their fight is our fight!” explained Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, when he welcomed many of the Texas legislators to Chicago on Sunday. And it is not merely a fight over warped congressional district lines and rigged elections.\nThis is a life-and-death struggle for the future of representative democracy as Americans have understood it—and for the people-centered policies that, in the best of circumstances, have historically extended from at least reasonably free and fair elections. “People need to pay attention to what’s happening in Texas right now because Donald Trump wants to spread this kind of ploy across America,” says US Representative Greg Casar, the Texas Democrat who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “Trump knows he can’t win the upcoming midterm elections, so he is trying to rig them. And the way he is trying to do it [Trump] is trying to do it is to dismantle the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as we know it. He is trying, for example to try and dismantle Hispanic and African-American opportunity districts. I represent a district overwhelmingly of Latinos here in the Austin area. If Donald Trump is able to suppress the votes of Latinos here in Austin, soon enough he wants to do that across America. And he could do that and, ultimately, try to get more complicit and corrupt Trump Republicans to defend his agenda even as it becomes less popular.”\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "Countering Authoritarian Takeover With the Labor Movement", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/labor-alex-han-tarso-ramos-interview/", "text": "The United States is changing in ways that are leaving many people afraid. What could improve the chances of rebalancing power among the branches of government and advancing that to multiracial democracy? The answer is worker organizing, say Alex Han and Tarso Luís Ramos. When we look at the history of U-turns from democratic backsliding to democratic revival, the success rate generally is about 50 percent, says Ramos. Where there is active, vibrant union participation, the odds go up to over 80 percent. So what is holding labor back?\nI sat down with Ramos and Han at a conference on working-class politics in an age of authoritarianism that was held at the City University of New York School of Labor and Urban Studies in New York City. Ramos is a leading expert on the US right and longtime former executive director of Political Research Associates. He now serves as senior adviser to Future Currents, a strategic planning group of social and economic justice leaders. Han has spent decades in the labor movement as an organizer and elected president of a large Chicago local. In 2023, he became executive director of In These Times, the long-running, Chicago-based progressive magazine.\n—Laura Flanders\nLaura Flanders: How would you describe the situation in which we find ourselves right now?\nTarso Luís Ramos: Drawing on the work of a Hungarian sociologist who’s been popularized by M. Gessen [Balint Magyar], if we think of three stages of authoritarian acceleration—authoritarian attempt, breakthrough, and consolidation—we’ve experienced multiple attempts in the United States, most famously or notoriously on January 6. We are past attempt now; we’re in breakthrough. And my assessment is we probably have between 12 and 18 months at the most to try to stop and forestall authoritarian consolidations, the conditions under which any honest person would say that we are functioning under an authoritarian regime. We’re in the middle of two coups. The authoritarian block represented by MAGA with Christian nationalists and libertarians and sectors of the business community and the Christian right being its largest player, who galvanized around Project 2025. I think the coup that we did not prepare for was the force accelerator that most people experience as DOGE. It’s the Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen set of actors, who are not only lending their support to that but who have a different end game. They’re not so much interested in a strong state through which to advance authoritarian and pro-business policies or merely to enrich themselves, although they are enriching themselves. They are not interested in the nation-state system. They’re interested in wringing the profits out of the public sector, and they’re interested in accelerating the demise of civilian governance altogether.\nLF: We’re talking about authoritarian consolidation, but I would also like the two of you to respond to the election results, which some at least interpreted as showing that there was a growing working-class base of multiracial people for the Trump agenda. Were they just wrong?\nAlex Han: We do have a divided country where partisanship reflects a set of different cultural questions. There is no magic bullet that is going to shift it. It’s also that the changes in political coalition, electoral coalition, these things are not gigantic shifts. These are gradual changes that can be pushed back in different ways. As people who are very engaged in politics day to day, we are not normal everyday people. The kind of changes and shifts of mindset that regular everyday voters, especially those who show up every four years in a presidential election, are not deeply felt beliefs. There is this contestation for a chunk of the electorate. There’s contestation for a chunk of people who have dropped out of the electorate. There’s a contestation for people who have not come into the electorate yet. That’s what we have to think about.\nTLR: Trump certainly benefits from the mass base. It’s probably a consolidated 40-million-person block in the United States that is pro authoritarian, believes that the exercise of political violence is totally legitimate to accomplish their goals. He benefited from a global phenomenon of the crisis of legitimacy of the economic and political order. Far right parties like the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], the Hindu fascist party that governs India, to neoliberal parties like Macron in France sending that country into political crisis in terms of a governing coalition. There was a certain level of “throw the bums out” that really helped Trump in that period of time.\nTo Alex’s earlier point, a 40 percent approval rate and falling is nothing to build a lasting regime around. Those numbers are going to fall, because of the economic destabilization that the Trump regime is causing. We’re only beginning to really feel the ripple effects of the supply-chain issues and the mass firings and dislocations. Those are going to create tremendous organizing opportunities for us. They’re also going to create incredible incentives for repression. Both of those things are true. There are examples, like the United Democratic Front in South Africa. There were parts of the business community that joined that, not because they were interested in racial equality, because it came to the conclusion that apartheid was bad for business. You had the Freedom Charter in which 50,000 organizers fanned out across the country. They collected people’s ideas, and they produced a vision statement about how they were going to improve the lives of everybody in that country if apartheid was defeated. You had a positive vision, but then you had a mass coalition that brought together people who, in many cases, were antagonists.\nLF: Is that why you’re here at a labor conference, looking for that kind of thinking and organizing?\nTLR: I’ll tell you one of the reasons I’m at a labor conference is when we look at the history of U-turns from democratic backsliding to democratic revival, the success rate is about 50 percent. Now, that’s not terrible. That means there’s hope. But that’s a coin toss. Where there’s active, vibrant union participation, the odds go up to about 80. Without active central participation by working people in the organizations that represent them, we don’t win. Or it’s a coin toss whether we do. And so, I’m interested in winning.\nLF: In These Times focuses heavily on labor. Is this why?\nAH: I don’t think you can have democratic socialism without organized workers demanding more and creating democracy. Labor unions—with all of their faults—are the largest democratic organizations that almost anybody in this country has any experience with. Organizations where you elect your leaders, where you decide on those policies, where you have to work with, you don’t self-select who’s in the union. It’s whoever works in a given place. I’ve thought about the centrality of Kilmar Ábrego García’s union membership in kind of lifting up that story.\nLF: A steel worker. The steel worker who was—\nAH: Yeah, a sheet metal worker—\nLF: Abducted.\nAH: Right, who was abducted to El Salvador. I don’t think the kind of response would be that sustained were he not a union member. And so that tradition of mutual aid and solidarity, as much as in some places, those traditions have been a bit worn out, I think those are things that can be reenergized. It was so inspiring to me when I saw a video from the National Association of Building Trades Unions, saw the president say, “We have to bring our brother back,” and you saw everybody in the room stand up and cheer.\nLF: Perhaps we’re thinking about where those moments might be in front of us or even visible today. I think of Grace Paley’s book, [Enormous] Changes at the Last Minute. When the explosion of organizing by Chicago teachers hit the national consciousness, it was like a surprise from no place. But obviously, for people who were in Chicago, this work had been going on for many years. So one of the questions I have for you, Alex, is what are you looking out for?\nAH: You have all of these different union members who are bargaining contracts over the next several years. Some of the interesting places are going to be where workers are in motion and organizing, and where that can kind of sync up with some of the existing contract and potential strike activity over the next several years. You mentioned the Chicago Teachers Union. That’s a project that doesn’t happen without a democratic bottom-up movement inside that union, creating change, changing the leadership, and putting them on a fighting footing. We’ve seen over the last several years new leadership in the UAW really revitalize that union.\nLF: How do each of you stop from getting numb?\nAH: I think when it comes to Trumpism, it’s been with us for so long now, that one almost begins to just feel, “This again. This again.”\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on. Every day, we make the case for a more democratic and equal world by championing progressive leaders, lifting up movements fighting for justice, and exposing the oligarchs and corporations profiting at the expense of us all.

And they want to give protection. They feel very strongly about it, and we’ll help them out with that.”\nTrump also said that US support for Ukraine would continue regardless of the outcome of the talks.\n“It’s never the end of the road. People are being killed, and we want to stop that. So, I would not say it was the end of the road. I think we have a good chance of doing it,” he said.\nZelenskyy hailed the pledge as “a major step forward”.\nHe later told reporters that Ukraine had offered to buy about $90bn worth of US weapons.\nZelenskyy says he’s open to elections in Ukraine, if safe\nZelenskyy backed elections, provided they are held under safe circumstances.\n“Yes, of course. We are open, yes… We need to work in the parliament because during the war, you can’t have elections, but we can, we can do security,” Zelenskyy said.\n“We need a truce… to make it possible for people to do democratic, open, legal, legal elections,” he added.\nTrump says ceasefire not needed\nWhen asked if he would carry out his promise from last week to impose “severe consequences” on Russia if it does not end the war, Trump replied that a ceasefire may not be needed.\n“I don’t think you need a ceasefire,” Trump said.\n“You know, if you look at the six deals that I settled this year, they were all at war. I didn’t do any ceasefires. And I know that it might be good to have, but I can also understand strategically why one country or the other wouldn’t want it,” he said.\n“But we can work a deal where we’re working on a peace deal while they’re fighting,” Trump added.\n“They have to fight. I wish they could stop.”\nTrump has claimed credit for helping to end six wars, including conflicts between India and Pakistan and Cambodia and Thailand.\nUkraine needs ‘everything’ related to security guarantees: Zelenskyy\nAsked what guarantees Zelenskyy would need from Trump to agree to a deal, the Ukrainian leader responded: “everything”.\n“It includes two parts. First, a strong Ukrainian army that I began to discuss with your colleagues, and it’s a lot about weapons and people and training issues and intelligence,” Zelenskyy said.\nToday, important negotiations took place in Washington.

war\nUS president says security guarantees for Kyiv could be provided by European countries with ‘coordination’ by Washington.\nUnited States President Donald Trump has announced plans to convene a face-to-face summit between Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his latest bid to end Moscow’s war in Ukraine.\nTrump’s proposal on Monday came as he hosted Zelenskyy and top European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, at the White House for high-stakes talks on ending the conflict, which has raged since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 4 itemsMSNBC reveals new name as part of corporate divorce from NBC\nHamas agrees terms for Gaza ceasefire, source tells Al Jazeera\nISIL-backed rebels killed at least 52 people in eastern DR Congo, UN says\nTrump said he had “begun arrangements” for the summit after speaking with Putin by phone, and that he would hold a trilateral meeting with his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts following their two-way meeting.\n“Again, this was a very good, early step for a War that has been going on for almost four years,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.\n“Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, are coordinating with Russia and Ukraine.”\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte separately confirmed that Putin had agreed to the bilateral meeting, but did not specify a date or location.\nZelenskyy, who described his meeting with Trump as a “very good conversation,” told reporters that he was “ready” to meet the Russian leader one-on-one.\nMoscow did not immediately confirm that it had agreed to a summit, but Russia’s state-run TASS news agency cited presidential aide Yuri Ushakov as saying that Putin and Trump “spoke in favour of continuing direct talks” between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations.\nThe proposals for a summit, which would be the first meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy since Moscow’s invasion, came as the fraught issue of security guarantees for Ukraine took centre stage during the talks at the White House.\nThe specifics of what those guarantees would look like remained unclear on Monday.\nAsked if the US could send peacekeepers to Ukraine, Trump said that European countries would be the “first line of defence”, but that Washington would provide “a lot of help”.\n“We’re going to help them out also, we’re going to be involved,” Trump said.\nTrump said on Truth Social later that discussions had focused on which security guarantees would be provided by European countries with “coordination” by the US.\nZelenskyy said that the guarantees would be “unpacked” by Kyiv’s partners and formalised within the next week to 10 days.\nWhile Trump has ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine, his special envoy, Witkoff, said on Sunday that Putin was open to a security guarantee resembling the 32-member alliance’s collective defence mandate.\nUnder Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, an armed attack against any one NATO member nation is considered an attack on all members of the alliance.\nSpeaking on Fox News after Monday’s talks, Rutte called Washington’s commitment to be involved in guaranteeing Ukraine’s security a “breakthrough”, but said the exact nature of that involvement would be discussed over the coming days.\nRutte said the discussions had not touched on the possibility of deploying US or European troops.\n“What we all agree on is that if this war does come to end… it has to be definitive,” Rutte said.\nKonstantin Sonin, a Russian exile and Putin critic who is a professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, said that meaningful security guarantees for Kyiv would need to include European troops on the ground.\n“This is all ‘unacceptable’ to Putin, so for European leaders, it is the question how to persuade President Trump that without such guarantees, the war, even if it stops now, will start again in the near future,” Sonin told Al Jazeera.\nSonin said that Ukraine had been failed by “written” guarantees for decades, including during Moscow’s 2014 invasion and occupation of Crimea.\n“Russia has signed many international treaties recognising Ukraine’s sovereignty and borders – including Putin himself signing one such treaty in 2004 – and still violated all of these treaties, both in 2014 and 2022,” Sonin said.\n“This is all to say that the sticking point is not the language in some documents,” he added.\nThe issue of what territory Kyiv might be asked to give up in a peace deal also remained unclear after the talks at the White House.\nAhead of the meeting, Trump warned that the return to Ukraine of Russian-occupied Crimea would be off the table in any negotiated settlement.\nTrump has indicated that a deal to end the war would involve “some swapping, changes in land” between Russia and Ukraine.\nRussia controls about one-fifth of Ukraine, according to open-source estimates. Ukraine, which took control of a large swath of Russia’s Kursk region during a surprise counteroffensive last year, is not believed to hold any Russian territory at present.\nSpeaking on Fox News, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that both Moscow and Kyiv would have to make concessions for a deal.\n“Obviously, land or where you draw those lines – where the war stops – is going to be part of that conversation,” Rubio said.\n“And it’s not easy, and maybe it’s not even fair, but it’s what it takes in order to bring about an end to a war. And that’s been true in every war.”\nZelenskyy, who has repeatedly ruled out handing over Ukrainian territory to Moscow, said on Monday that land would be an issue for him and Putin to work out between them.\n“We will leave the issue of territories between me and Putin,” Zelenskyy told reporters.\nYurii Poita, an analyst at the Kyiv-based Center for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies, said the meeting could be cautiously described as a success for Ukraine, given its positive atmosphere and Trump’s apparent desire to resolve the conflict on terms acceptable to Kyiv.\n“While ‘security guarantees’ previously demanded by Kyiv caused irritation in the US, we now see that the parties are beginning to work on the outlines of these security guarantees, and the broader security architecture that would ensure long-term peace and prevent a renewed Russian attack on Ukraine,” Poita told Al Jazeera.\nStill, Poita said, the talks left “complex issues” outstanding.\n“If the Russian leadership does not feel significant pressure – primarily economic and sanctions-related – Russia will ignore calls for peace or will set unacceptable conditions for Ukraine,” he said.\n“Second, the specific elements of security guarantees for Ukraine: will they be provided, and will there be something akin to NATO’s Article 5 for Ukraine from Western countries? Will Western military contingents be deployed in Ukraine to strengthen security?”", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 02:51:17 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml"}

{"title": "Forced Starvation Is a Grotesque Inversion of Jewish Traditions", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/forced-starvation-grotesque/", "text": "Forced Starvation Is a Grotesque Inversion of Jewish Traditions\nI learned from a young age that you shouldn’t let your neighbor go hungry. Benjamin Netanyahu would do well to revisit this tradition.\nFor much of the past 21 months, I have sparred with friends and colleagues who labeled Israel’s response to the October 7 attack as “genocidal.” I have written, at The Nation and elsewhere, about my concerns with some of the analysis on the left. In my inner monologue as much as in conversation with others, I have argued that while what Israel was doing militarily was brutal, and that while in many instances it was committing crimes against humanity, ultimately it wasn’t a genocide.\nOver the past weeks, however, as images of mass starvation have emerged out of Gaza, as hundreds of desperate Gazans have been mown down at food distribution centers—always accompanied by a cacophony of disingenuous disclaimers from the far-right thugs running the Israeli government—it has become ever harder to reach any other conclusion but that Israel’s leaders have embraced a policy of total annihilation. Having destroyed the physical infrastructure of Gaza, Benjamin Netanyahu and his government seem now intent on making life entirely untenable for the remaining residents. At this point, it would be reckless to believe otherwise.\nIf, in fact, Israel had any sort of exit strategy or plan for permanently ending its war on Gaza, it would need to acknowledge the humanity of its opponents and recognize their need to survive. At a most basic level, it would need to see the world from their perspective, with all that that acknowledgement entails. For empathy involves, in such circumstances, understanding that even those we fight in war love their children as we love ours, that they mourn as we mourn, that they suffer as we suffer, that their stomachs growl when hungry just as ours do.\nInstead, nearly two years after Hamas’s vile attacks of October 7, Israeli public opinion, manipulated by Netanyahu and his entirely unscrupulous cabinet, seems ever-less capable of making those imaginative leaps. True, a majority of Jewish Israelis distrust Netanyahu and think he should be doing more to bring home the hostages. But that doesn’t translate to a desire to find a genuine path to long-term peace with their neighbors. Indeed, a Pew Research Center poll from earlier this year found that only 16 percent of adult Jews in Israel believe peaceful coexistence with a Palestinian state to be possible. A more recent poll found that more than four in five Jewish Israelis supported the forcible expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza, and upwards of half favored Palestinian expulsion from Israel.\nThat goes a long way to explaining why there haven’t been massive protests or acts of civil resistance in Israel as its leaders have, in the past couple of months, embraced the abominable strategy of wholesale starvation and the herding of Palestinians into ever smaller, more vulnerable enclaves within the decimated Gaza Strip. It’s why most Israelis have stayed silent in the face of Defense Minister Israel Katz floating the idea of forcing Gaza’s 2 million residents into an Orwellian-named “humanitarian city” atop the ruins of Rafah. And it’s why, when Israel’s ex–prime minister Ehud Olmert warned that such a city would be a “concentration camp,” the assertion didn’t serve to force a day of moral reckoning inside Israel—a country founded, after all, in the wake of the industrial slaughter, inside death camps, of Europe’s Jews. It’s why there weren’t massive protests after Heritage Minister Amichay Eliyahu publicly stated that the government’s intent is to “wipe out” Gaza and replace the population with Jewish settlers. And it’s why, over the past six months, Israelis have been broadly supportive of Trump’s criminal idea to expel all Palestinians from Gaza and create instead a “Riviera” resort for wealthy Western and Gulf-state tourists.\nSure, a growing number of scholars and Israeli human rights groups are warning that Israel is committing a genocide in Gaza. But to date their assertions have been broadly brushed aside by an Israeli public so traumatized by the horrors of October 7 that it seems willing to give its leaders carte blanche to pursue their forever war with Hamas by any means necessary, no matter the scale of the “collateral damage.”\nThat silence is becoming increasingly untenable. Especially considering Jewish history and beliefs, there is something uniquely appalling about a policy of deliberate starvation on millions of civilians. Yes, the deprivation is both dehumanizing and inhumane all on its own. But it also goes against Jewish traditions, like the mandate to feed the stranger. It is unfathomable to me that this tradition is being so egregiously breached by Israel’s leaders—and that those leaders dare to claim that those who oppose the cruelty of mass starvation are somehow shoring up an antisemitic project.\nAmong the many Jewish beliefs and traditions that should make this weaponization of food in Gaza unthinkable, the idea of tikkun olam is that one has a duty to repair, or to heal, the world. I witnessed this concept in practice, watching my grandparents open their house to friends, relatives, strangers—and always demonstrate their hospitality by providing their guests with plates of home-cooked food. For my grandmother Mimi, food was not just her love language; it was core to her being. If someone was hungry—or even if they weren’t—you fed them. If someone was worn down with the cares of the world, you lifted some of those worries by feeding them. If someone was looking for good company and good conversation, you provided both… and you fed them.\nYou fed them even if you, yourself, didn’t have much to spare.\nMy grandparents welcomed people into their home in north London during the dark days of the Second World War and the austere years of rationing that followed the war. Always, somehow, they found enough to go around. That basic understanding of the importance of food, not just for survival but for culture and for community, continued throughout their long lives.\nWhen I was growing up, in the 1980s, I could bring an entire group of friends over after school, and, at short notice, my grandmother would rustle up food for us all. As I wrote in my book on my grandparents, The House of Twenty Thousand Books—a book about the people, the ideas, and the conversation that filled my grandparents’ home over more than half a century—there are literally thousands of people dotted around the globe who at one point or another stayed at my grandparents’ house or, at the very least, were fed and entertained by them.\nIt should go without saying that one does not heal the world by allowing children to die because you have denied them food. One does not heal the world by indiscriminately firing into crowds of desperate people trying to secure a few calories of donated food to take back to their families. One does not heal the world by the mass killing of doctors and nurses, of educators, of humanitarian workers, of journalists, of farmers, or, above all, of new mothers and their babies just starting out on their life journeys.\nIsrael’s attempt to wipe out Gaza isn’t war; at this point it is collective punishment on a truly hideous scale. It is as violative of collective moral norms as any of the other myriad great atrocities of the past century. And, while Netanyahu and his colleagues promote this murder spree as being necessary for the defense of world Jewry, in reality it is a simply grotesque inversion of Jewish traditions of hospitality, of generosity, of empathy, and of the moral imperative that one doesn’t let one’s neighbor, one’s fellow human being, go hungry.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

Something has to give.\nIsrael’s slaughter and engineered famine in Gaza is producing wrenching images of starving children so horrifying that even members of the American political elite, traditionally a group with a high tolerance for the mass murder of ordinary people, feel compelled to make pro forma objections.\nNew York Times reporters are now lamenting that the starvation is harming Israel’s “standing in the world.” Times columnist Michelle Cottle acknowledges that the images of starvation have caused a “tipping point both globally and here in the U.S., and now politicians who had been mostly quiet when it came to criticizing Israel are starting to speak out.” Former Times reporter Bari Weiss, now an influential conservative maven at The Free Press, went from publishing articles decrying the “Gaza Famine Myth” to admitting that, yes, there is a “hunger crisis.” The blogger Matthew Yglesias, always a reliable barometer of establishment conventional wisdom, used the Free Press shift to indicate that he himself was ready for a new stance: Though he once believed that pro-Palestinian protesters had “poisoned the waters to an extent” by crying wolf, he could concede that “the wolves are now in fact here.”\nIt’s natural and forgivable to be annoyed by this belated and partial acknowledgement of reality, which seems to be mainly an exercise in reputational damage control rather than motivated by any genuine revulsion against atrocities. Yglesias himself is well-practiced at this game, since, like much of the mainstream media, he went from being an ardent cheerleader of George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq to being a critic as soon as the high tide of public support for the war started receding.\nThe Gaza movement was never crying wolf. Rather, activists were drawing the logical conclusions from the words and actions of Israeli leaders, which always pointed to the horrifying endgame of ethnic cleansing and genocide. Israel’s policy of using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza dates back to at least 2006. Contra Yglesias, the wolves have always been real and have feasted for many years.\nYet the glib cynicism of pundits is less important than the actual policy changes that might result from shifting public opinion. It’s undoubtedly the case that for the first time, pro-Palestinian politics are establishing a beachhead in American politics. This is admittedly happening belatedly and far too slowly, but change is in the air.\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders has taken the lead in pushing for an end to “offensive” arms sales to Israel. This is an inadequate remedy—the sale of all arms, whatever their intended use, should be halted—but it remains one of the first serious legislative pushes against America’s long-standing policy of uncompromising support for Israel. When Sanders brought the arms sales issue to a vote in April, only 15 senators voted for it. When he again pushed for arms limitations on Thursday, he got 27 votes (all Democrats or allied, as Sanders is, with the party).\nThis falls far short of the mark, but represents a historical pivot point: For the first time, a majority of Democratic senators have backed limits on weapons sales to Israel. However, as my Nation colleague John Nichols pointed out last week, the Senate (and by extension the larger political elite) still lags behind popular opinion. Matt Duss of the Center for International Policy noted, “While a majority of Democrats voting to block military aid to Israel is real progress, it’s still shameful that a majority of the Senate voted against. If the body accurately represented Americans’ views on Gaza the resolutions should’ve passed easily.”\nIt’s worth underscoring the radical disconnect between public opinion and the political elite (and its media allies). While Israel enjoyed a brief and slight level of popular support in the immediate aftermath of the October 7 attack, its criminal conduct in Gaza has never been popular. Gallup’s polls on this are instructive. Even in November 2023, when memories of October 7 were fresh, Israel enjoyed only a small level of support: 50 percent approval versus 45 disapproval. Net approval ended the following month. By March of 2024, it was down to 36 percent approval versus 55 percent disapproval. Currently, it stands at 60 percent disapproval and 32 percent approval.\nIn other words, unlike their elected representatives, the American public did not need to wait for the recent soul-crushing photographs of starving children to decide they were against this abomination. They figured that out nearly 18 months ago.\nThe turn against Israel has been particularly strong among Democrats. There is a reason the relentless attacks on Zohran Mamdani for being pro-Palestinian didn’t work in the New York Democratic mayoral primary: Most voters broadly shared his outlook. According to a recent Quinnipiac poll, 60 percent of Democrats now describe themselves as more sympathetic to Palestinians than to Israelis, as against 12 percent who are more pro-Israel. According to a Data for Progress poll, 63 percent of primary voters support arresting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for war crimes. According to CNN polling guru Harry Enten, “All of a sudden, it’s the pro-Palestinian position that actually reigns supreme in Democratic politics, not the Israeli position. I rarely ever see shifts like this.”\nOn Saturday, Bernie Sanders tweeted:\n60% of Americans oppose Netanyahu’s barbaric war against the Palestinian people. We’re making progress in moving Democrats to vote against funding this war. Now it’s time to move Republicans. Does the average Republican want to spend billions starving children? I don’t think so.\nSanders raises a good question. While polling shows a strong shift against Israel among Democrats and independents, Republican support for Israel remains relatively unchanged. Yet even among Republicans, cracks in the pro-Israel position are showing. As Politico reports, “the GOP’s right flank is growing increasingly frustrated with the war in Gaza, arguing the war is politically noxious for the president and a moral stain on the country’s reputation.” Prominent MAGA voices, including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (who describes the situation as a “genocide”), are creating a space for a bipartisan shift in policy.\nPopular\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →The real question isn’t why the political elite is turning against the war but why they have been so slow to do so in the face of a massive shift in public opinion. Writing in Vox, Abdallah Fayyad quite reasonably cites the continued outsize power of the Israel lobby, which regularly spends tens of millions every election cycle to uphold the bipartisan pro-Israel consensus. Equally important is the role Israel plays as a bulwark of American power in the Middle East, which means the policymakers who take a pro-Israel line (notably former Joe Biden advisers such as Jake Sullivan and Brett McGurk) are always amply rewarded with corporate jobs and academic sinecures.\nThe pro-Palestinian position might have the numbers, but the pro-Israel stance controls the commanding heights of establishment power. Given this dynamic, Israel/Palestine becomes a litmus test for American democracy itself. How long can an elite continue with a policy that outrages the majority? This dynamic also reinforces the continued need for organizing and agitation: Progress has been made in an uphill battle, but only continued pressure will force the elite to finally listen to public opinion. The upcoming primaries, both in the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential race, now loom as the battleground for the essential battle between the people and the ruling class.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "How the GOP Hopes to Gerrymander Its Way to a Midterms Victory", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/gerrymanders-2026-midterms-republicans/", "text": "How the GOP Hopes to Gerrymander Its Way to a Midterms Victory\nIn a series of mid-decade redistricting gambits, state legislatures are looking to rig next year’s congressional balloting in advance.\nOhio’s Ninth and 13th Congressional Districts are two of the most evenly divided districts in the nation. In 2024, Democrats narrowly won both. Veteran Toledo lawmaker Representative Marcy Kaptur held the competitive Ninth, a slender, snaking district that runs along Ohio’s northwest coast, by less than 1 percentage point. In the 13th, which includes Akron, just over 8,500 votes provided the margin in a 51.1 to 48.9 percent victory for Representative Emilia Sykes.\nIt’s hard to imagine a path for Democrats to erase the GOP’s three-seat majority (which has ballooned to seven after four lawmakers sworn into the 119th Congress have died) and retake the House in 2026 without holding onto these seats, and scores of others like them throughout the country. Yet winning them next year is going to be more difficult—not because of shifting political winds but because Ohio Republicans will begin redrawing the state’s congressional map this fall ahead of the midterms—and plans are afoot in several other Republican-led states to create more safe GOP seats out of districts that now lean purple-to-blue.\nThe Ohio gerrymander will come on the heels of the bid in Texas’s Republican-controlled state legislature to redraw congressional maps there to the party’s advantage. In that still-pending GOP power play, the party stands to steal three to five congressional seats.\nRepublicans, fearful of losing the House next November, have embarked on an audacious and antidemocratic campaign to hold on to their narrow House majority by rigging the midterms in advance. Under this state-level initiative, the goal is for Republicans to recast already heavily gerrymandered congressional delegations so as to ensure even greater structural advantages that Democrats may not be able to counter. In a recursive set of rulings on voting rights and districting cases, John Roberts and the US Supreme Court have essentially given them free rein.\nTexas is getting all the attention right now. But there is no indication that Republicans will stop there. Ohio will remap next. Florida, Indiana, Missouri, and North Carolina could follow. Kentucky and New Hampshire are also vulnerable to right-wing takeovers of their congressional delegations. Redistricting will give Republicans a massive, unearned boost heading into the midterms—especially since frustrated Democrats again find themselves with limited options to retaliate.\nIf Democrats thought the path to erasing the GOP’s narrow majority in 2026 is a simple question of capitalizing on an unpopular presidency and the historical midterm bounce for the party out of power—well, think again. These mid-decade gerrymanders could more than triple the number of wins needed to make Representative Hakeem Jeffries speaker. And there aren’t many ways to counter them.\nLet’s say Republicans have swung the minimal three-seat gain in Texas. That would just be the opening salvo in the redistricting wars. A new map is a sure thing in Ohio, where Republicans in 2021 and 2022 both strong-armed a bipartisan commission and defied repeated rulings by the state Supreme Court. Because the state’s commission didn’t agree on that 10–5 GOP map, it expired after four years instead of the usual 10. That’s turned into a perfect opening for the Republicans.\nOhio Democrats and voting rights groups have some options, including trying to force a statewide vote on the new map, but if Republicans battle back with similar determination, there’s little to be done. The Ohio GOP ignored multiple rulings from the state Supreme Court finding that their maps violated the state’s Constitution during the last go-round. Then, during the 2022 midterms, hard-line conservatives captured the court, winning the seat of a courageous GOP chief justice who ruled against the gerrymanders just before she retired. (Maureen O’Connor’s independence brought calls for her impeachment, and her portrait has been banished to the court’s basement.)\nAfter Ohio, the GOP might then move one state west to Indiana, where the party already holds seven of nine seats. A mid-decade gerrymander could make that into an even more lopsided 8–1 advantage. In 2024, Democrats won the First district, in the state’s northwest corner, with 57 percent—but Republicans could carve up the blue stronghold in Gary into a series of narrow slices, scattered among the solidly red Second, Third, Fourth or Eighth districts.\nMoving south, Trump aides have already reached out to Missouri lawmakers about turning a 6–2 GOP edge into a 7–1 map that disassembles the Democratic district in Kansas City currently held by Emanuel Cleaver. There’s also potential to expand the Republican’s gerrymandered 10–4 map in North Carolina, where the GOP-controlled state Supreme Court has already unraveled state constitutional protections against tilted, partisan maps. (The three additional seats won as a result provided the GOP with its House majority in the 2024 cycle.) If Republicans wanted to get extremely aggressive, they might also attempt to target the single Democratic seats in Kansas and Kentucky, or carve out a more favorable map in New Hampshire.\nDemocrats have threatened to meet these threatened gerrymanders with ones of their own, but in practical terms, they just have fewer options. After being caught flat-footed by the audacious GOP gerrymanders of the 2010s, which created red bastions in purple Wisconsin, Ohio, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, Democrats pressed their advantages wherever they could after the 2021 Census. They drew an aggressive 14–3 map in Illinois. A map that could have created an 8–0 delegation in Maryland was blocked by the courts, leading to a 7–1 map instead. Democrats also drew advantageous lines in Oregon and New Mexico, and modified a commission map in New York.\nThat leaves fewer targets of opportunity for Democratic state legislatures—together with a body of laws standing in the way of grabbing more. The Illinois map appears maxed out. The courts would likely block another 8–0 map in Maryland. New York’s state Constitution appears to block any mid-decade redraw there; Democrats are trying to be creative, but even their likeliest play seems too late for 2026. New Jersey already has a 9–3 Democratic map, and tough talk from Governor Phil Murphy aside, there is reportedly little appetite in the legislature to unravel the state’s bipartisan commission in an election year.\nThis means the main Democratic battleground would likely be California. Governor Gavin Newsom, state legislators, and members of Congress have talked openly about putting a ballot initiative quickly before voters that would find a way around the state’s nonpartisan citizen commission, the national gold standard for fair redistricting. That’s a long road. Any other legislative power play would face an uphill legal path\nThe GOP’s gerrymanders will thus skew the midterm math against the sort of wave election Democrats had in 2018—and that’s before the US Supreme Court hears arguments in a case from Louisiana that could test the constitutionality of majority-minority districts, and put seats held by Black Democrats in Louisiana, Alabama, and elsewhere at risk.\nThe five seats all but certain to come from Texas and Ohio push the Democrats’s magic number to eight. Missouri would make it nine. North Carolina would edge it into double digits. And each gerrymander would further shrink the roster of potential Democratic pickups on a map where only 37 of 435 seats were within five points in 2024. The road is not impossible. There are winnable seats in Nebraska, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York.\nBut Democrats cannot count on history here. Yes, the party out of power in Washington traditionally earns a midterm bounce in the range of 20 seats. But many of those political science charts were built decades ago, in congressional battlegrounds governed by more competitive and less gerrymandered maps. It’s much more difficult to engineer a strong run of flipped House seats when so many of them have been taken off the table and rendered uncompetitive.\nIt’s true that Democrats recaptured the House by a robust margin of 41 seats in 2018—but they did this without overcoming the gerrymander. First, they won in courts, and established fairer maps in Pennsylvania, Florida, Virginia, and elsewhere. Then they won some three-quarters of the flipped seats that year in states where courts and commissions drew the lines. They did not beat gerrymanders in Ohio, Wisconsin, or North Carolina, but won in places like Utah and Oklahoma—and those seats have since been gerrymandered out of reach. That path no longer exists. Ahead of 2016, Florida’s state Supreme Court overturned several districts as unconstitutional and ordered a new map. This June, a court controlled by Ron DeSantis, Leonard Leo, and hard-right Federalist Society acolytes let a much more extreme GOP gerrymander stand.\nPopular\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →This isn’t a race to the bottom any longer; we are there. The national congressional map, already nearly maximally gerrymandered and uncompetitive, might soon have its last meaningful races drained away. The legislative body that’s supposed to be closest to the people is almost entirely insulated from the ballot box. The US Supreme Court has taken the federal courts out of play as a neutral arbiter. As a result, any state that fixes the antidemocratic adoption of gerrymanders on its own looks like a sucker embracing universal disarmament.\nThis is a problem in need of national solutions. They exist—chiefly in reforms such as ranked-choice voting, multimember districts, and proportional representation. But as the gerrymandering battles erupt once more into all-out partisan warfare, the important reforms to preserve the integrity of one person, one vote in our embattled democracy may well be on life support.

At least 30 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip since dawn on Monday, including 14 seeking aid.\nA medical source has confirmed to Al Jazeera that at least three Palestinians were killed and several others were injured in an Israeli strike on al-Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City. Local Palestinian outlets reported that journalist Islam al-Koumi was amongst the victims.\nAl Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah, says, “Israeli attacks are still ongoing, unabated, in the eastern part of Gaza City. The scale of attacks illustrates how Israel’s current strategy is shaping the geography and demography of Gaza.”\n“We can see how Israel is using heavy artillery, fighter jets and drones, in order to destroy what’s left of residential homes there. The scale of destruction is extremely overwhelming,” he said.\n“This current military tactic ensures that Israel will enable its forces to operate on the ground and will also ensure residential areas turn into zones of rubble. People there say Israeli attacks are happening day and night.”\nMany who have already been displaced multiple times during the war by Israeli bombardment are on the move again from Gaza City. Others are staying put.\nThe city was the main target of air attacks on Sunday that killed nearly 60 people, and Israel is also targeting the few remaining healthcare centres there.\nBut while many Palestinians who remain in the devastated city are forced to survive in the ruins of buildings, makeshift shelters, or tents, some people have told Al Jazeera that it would be impossible for them to leave.\n“How am I supposed to even get there? How can I go? I need nearly $900 to move – I don’t even have a dollar. How am I supposed to reach the south?” asked displaced Palestinian man Bilal Abu Sitta.\nOthers do not trust Israeli promises of aid and shelter. “We don’t want Israel to give us anything,” Noaman Hamad said. “We want them to [allow] us back to the homes we fled – we don’t need more than that.”\nSlight hope emerged as Hamas said it approved a Gaza ceasefire proposal put forward yesterday by mediators Qatar and Egypt. An informed source told Al Jazeera that the draft deal would ensure a 60-day truce that would see the release of half of the Israeli captives held in Gaza as well as an unspecified number of Palestinian captives imprisoned by Israel.\nBut Palestinians in Gaza have seen countless false dawns before, and after a brief ceasefire in January was shattered by Israel in March, the war then entered its most grim phase of human misery.\n‘Israel carrying out a deliberate campaign of starvation’\nGaza’s Health Ministry says five more Palestinians have died from malnutrition as a result of Israel’s punishing monthslong blockade in the past 24 hours, including two children.\nAs of August 18, the known number of people who have starved to death in Gaza, according to the ministry, reached at least 263 people, including 112 children.\nThe United Nations’ World Food Programme (WFP) warned that as of July 2025, more than 320,000 children – the entire population under the age of five in Gaza – are at risk of acute malnutrition.\nFamilies are surviving on the bare minimum of basic foods, with almost no dietary diversity, WFP said. The agency called for an immediate ceasefire to allow large-scale delivery of humanitarian aid.\nThe UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) says children in Gaza should be preparing for the new school year, but instead are searching for water, queuing for food, and living in classrooms turned into overcrowded shelters.\nUNRWA warned that children in the enclave have already lost three years of schooling, risking becoming a “lost generation”, and renewed its call for an immediate ceasefire.\nAmnesty International has condemned Israel “systematically destroying the health, wellbeing and social fabric of Palestinian life”. In a report quoting displaced Palestinians and medical staff who have treated malnourished children, Amnesty said: “Israel is carrying out a deliberate campaign of starvation in the occupied Gaza Strip.”\nIn the meantime, Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, says its staff in Gaza are witnessing a surge in mass casualties linked to Israel’s ongoing siege and its oversight of limited distribution of aid by the controversial, US- and Israel-backed aid organisation GHF.\n“The indiscriminate killings, and the counts of mass casualties we still [see] on a daily basis right now, hasn’t stopped, but only increased in its scale,” said Nour Alsaqqa of MSF.\nShe said one MSF facility in Rafah, located near an aid distribution centre, has been overwhelmed with wounded Palestinians, including children.\n“We are receiving baby injuries and killings from the distribution sites. People who are coming with gunshots, with different injuries, related to the distribution sites and they go only seeking food,” she said.\n“They go out of desperation and they risk their lives to access aid, which is still inaccessible due to Israel’s siege.”\nSince the establishment of the GHF aid sites at the end of May, nearly 2,000 people have been killed while trying to access aid, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 19:22:18 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml"}
{"title": "Texas Ended In-State Tuition for Undocumented Immigrants. Students Are Already Feeling the Impact.", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/texas-in-state-tuition-undocumented-students/", "text": "Texas Ended In-State Tuition for Undocumented Immigrants. Students Are Already Feeling the Impact.\n“The message is loud and clear: You’re good enough to pick vegetables or clean hotel rooms, but not to go to college.”\nUntil June, Texas was one of the best states in the country when it came to offering in-state tuition to undocumented students. But after the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the state, officials quietly ended the policy.\nThe suit claimed that Texas violated a 1996 federal law that prohibits undocumented students from receiving residency-based tuition benefits unless those benefits are also extended to all US citizens—regardless of where they live. Rather than fight the lawsuit, Texas officials capitulated almost immediately. “They only deliberated for 30 minutes, and then they settled,” said Abraham Espinosa, director of access to higher education at FIEL Houston, an immigrant and civil rights organization in Texas with programs supporting undocumented students.\nThe policy, originally passed in 2001 as House Bill 1403, had allowed undocumented students who lived in Texas and graduated from a Texas high school to pay in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. Known informally as the Texas Dream Act, it opened the doors to higher education for tens of thousands of young people who had grown up in the state but were barred from federal financial aid and most scholarships.\nThe sudden reversal came after several attempts by the Texas Legislature to repeal the bills. “FIEL staff have been at the capitol every session since 2011 fighting to protect in-state tuition,” Espinosa said. “We beat it again this year. But two days later, we were blindsided.” Now, Espinosa’s inbox is full of messages from undocumented students and families asking: What does this mean for me?\nUndocumented students and DACA recipients can still apply for state aid in Texas through the Texas Application for State Financial Aid, such as the Texas Grant—which, unlike loans, don’t have to be repaid. But TASFA was already limited, paying at most around $8,000 per year. That is barely enough to cover in-state tuition, and now that undocumented students must pay out-of-state rates, it won’t even come close. “TASFA remains the same,” said Espinosa. “The lawsuit only applies to the in-state tuition provision of HB 1403. So they technically can still receive financial aid but still have to pay out-of-state fees.” That distinction makes college all but inaccessible for many. “Now it’s even more of a financial burden because it will hardly cover anything,” Espinosa said. “They’ll still need to find aid elsewhere or either transfer or lower their credit hours. But lowering credit hours affects their eligibility for aid, because to qualify, they must be enrolled full time. So this is where we are now.”\nStudents are now making hard choices. Ximena, 18, recently graduated from a high school in Houston and had planned to attend the University of Texas at Tyler. A scholarship from the Honors Program, supportive professors, and a strong chemistry department made it her top choice. But with tuition already around $9,000 per semester before aid was processed—and out-of-state status looming—she withdrew. “I didn’t even want to see what it would be with out-of-state tuition,” she said. “It was already pretty high when I was still considered in-state. I just didn’t want to find out what that number would turn into.”\nInstead, Ximena enrolled at Houston Community College. Credit-by-exam work she completed in high school helped lower her bill to $800, but that’s still three times what in-district students pay. “They quoted me $4,000 at first,” she said. “Even now, it’s a lot. And what I think is affordable could be something that’s just inconceivable for other families.”\nXimena came to the United States on a tourist visa in middle school to escape violence in her hometown in Mexico. “Most of my memories, my socialization, my education, that all happened here,” she said. “I’ve done basically all of my schooling in Texas.” What struck her most, she said, was how quietly the change happened. “I saw maybe a 10-second segment on the news,” she said. “Even the HCC staff didn’t really have resources or information. That was concerning to me, but also it made me think, what kind of support are schools being given to navigate this? It felt like we were supposed to find out on our own.”\nShe says most of her peers aren’t dealing with the same immigration status, but they are still feeling the broader effects of instability in higher education. “I’m seeing people online who had a dream school and got a considerable amount of aid, and now they’re getting rescinded or dropped or delayed. Some of them can’t even enroll,” Ximena said. She still hopes to transfer to the University of Houston and major in chemistry.\nAxel, 25, is in his final year at the University of St. Thomas in Texas. He came to the state from San Luis Potosí, Mexico, when he was three and has lived in Houston ever since. He’s a DACA recipient, meaning he has a work permit and a Social Security number, but none of the federal financial aid that citizens can access. He’s studying studio art with a focus on photography and videography. But the rising cost of tuition threatens to cut his final year short. “I’ve always had to take part-time classes because my financial aid never covers them all,” he said. “I still end up paying $500 to $1,000 out-of-pocket every semester. Sometimes more.”\nHe described feeling stuck between financial aid that doesn’t go far enough and student loans he doesn’t qualify for. “I can’t take out federal or private student loans through the school,” Axel said. “I could try for a personal loan from a private company, but those are hard to get approved for and the amounts are low. Even if I get one, it might only help a little.”\nAxel said he filled out TASFA with help from local groups like FIEL Houston and Café College but still found himself scrambling. “Every time I apply, they ask for everything, income, household size, how long I’ve been here. But even when I get aid, it’s never enough,” he said. “I usually have to go around asking people for help, or see if anyone knows about extra scholarships.”\nPopular\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →As of late July, he hadn’t heard anything from St. Thomas about how they planned to handle the change. “They haven’t said anything—no message, no email,” he said. “I’m kind of flying blind. I was planning to go today to ask about it, but it’s always stressful. I never know what the number’s going to be.” He said he was supposed to graduate next year, but now, he’s not sure. “I just don’t know if I’m going to be able to go back,” he said. “That’s where I’m at.”\nEspinosa said the effects have already reached his own family. His sister, who holds a bachelor’s degree, had planned to apply to graduate school. “But she pulled back when this happened,” he said. “She looked at the numbers and just didn’t think it was worth it anymore.” And for students just starting out, the new reality could mean leaving school altogether. “We’ve had students say they’re going to quit,” Espinosa said. “And that’s exactly what the state wants.”\nEspinosa emphasized that being undocumented is a civil, not criminal, offense. “It’s not illegal to be here. It’s just that the system doesn’t allow our community to thrive,” he said. “The message is loud and clear: You’re good enough to pick vegetables or clean hotel rooms, but not to go to college.”\n“This is about who we think deserves to succeed,” Espinosa said. “And right now, the message from the state is: not you.”\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

But it was unclear how the Republican president could achieve that.\nDominion filed a defamation suit against Newsmax in 2021 over false claims that its voting technology was used to rig the 2020 US presidential election, in which Democrat Joe Biden defeated Trump. Dominion sought $1.6bn in damages.\nIn a statement, Newsmax said it had agreed to settle because it did not believe it would receive a fair trial.\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis had ruled earlier that Newsmax defamed Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems by airing false information about the company and its equipment. But Davis said he would leave it to a jury to eventually decide whether that was done with malice, and, if so, how much Dominion deserved from Newsmax in damages.\n“The pattern of judicial rulings that consistently denied Newsmax due process left the Company to believe it would not receive a fair trial,” Newsmax said. “Faced with these rulings and other constraints, Newsmax chose to settle the case.”\n“Newsmax has always maintained that its reporting was not defamatory and that its coverage was consistent with accepted journalistic standards,” the company said.\n“We stand by our coverage as fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards of journalism,” it added.\nHowever, internal correspondence from Newsmax officials shows they knew Trump’s claims of electoral fraud were baseless.\nDavis also handled the Dominion-Fox News case, and made a similar ruling that the network repeated numerous lies by Trump’s allies about his 2020 loss despite internal communications showing Fox officials knew the claims were false.\nThough Trump has insisted his fraud claims are real, there’s no evidence to prove they were, and the lawsuits in the Fox and Newsmax cases show how some of the president’s biggest supporters knew they were false at the time. Trump’s then-attorney general, William Barr, said there was no evidence of widespread fraud.\nTrump and his backers lost dozens of lawsuits alleging fraud, some before Trump-appointed judges. Numerous recounts, reviews and audits of the election results, including some run by Republicans, turned up no signs of significant wrongdoing or error and affirmed Biden’s win.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 17:59:33 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml"}

Who’s right?\nAir Canada flight attendants to continue strike despite government order\nThe cabin crew for the Montreal-based carrier had pushed for a negotiated solution, saying binding arbitration would take pressure off the airline. Workers have said that the proposed wage hikes are insufficient to keep up with inflation and match the federal minimum wage.\nThe attendants are also calling to be paid for work performed on the ground, such as helping passengers to board. They are now only paid when planes are moving, sparking some vocal support from Canadians on social media.\nA leader of the union on strike against Air Canada said on Monday that he would risk jail time rather than allow cabin crews to be forced back to work.\n“If it means folks like me going to jail, then so be it. If it means our union being fined, then so be it. We’re looking for a solution here,” said Mark Hancock, Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) national president, at a press conference after a deadline by the board to return to work expired with no union action to end the strike.\nAir Canada’s CEO Michael Rousseau told the news agency Reuters that he was “amazed” that the union was not following the law, adding, “At this point in time, the union’s proposals are much higher than the 40 percent [hike we have offered]. And so we need to find a path to bridge that gap,” he said, without suggesting what that process would be. “We’re always open to listen, and have a conversation,” he said.\nCanada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney voiced his support for the cabin crews, saying that they should be “compensated equitably at all times”.\nPushing for a resolution, Carney said, “We are in a situation where literally hundreds of thousands of Canadians and visitors to our countries are being disrupted by this action.”\nThe airline normally carries 130,000 people daily during the ongoing peak summer travel season and is part of the global Star Alliance of airlines.\nOn Monday, Air Canada suspended its third-quarter and annual profit forecasts as its planes remained grounded.\nThe union said it would continue its strike and invited Air Canada back to the table to “negotiate a fair deal”.\nA government nudge\nThe government’s options to end the strike now include asking courts to enforce the order to return to work and seeking an expedited hearing.\nThe minority government could also try to pass legislation that would need the support of political rivals and approval in both houses of the Parliament of Canada, which are on break until September 15.\n“The government will be very reticent to be too heavy-handed because in Canada, the Supreme Court has ruled that governments have to be very careful when they take away the right to strike, even for public sector-workers who may be deemed essential,” said Dionne Pohler, professor of dispute resolution at Cornell University’s Industrial and Labor Relations School.\nAnother option is to encourage bargaining, Pohler said.\nThe government did not respond to requests for comment.\nOn Saturday, Carney’s Liberal government moved to end the strike by asking the CIRB to order binding arbitration. The CIRB, an independent administrative tribunal that interprets and applies Canada’s labour laws, issued the order, which Air Canada had sought, and unionised flight attendants opposed.\nThe previous government, under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, intervened last year to head off rail and dock strikes that threatened to cripple the economy, but it is highly unusual for a union to defy a CIRB order.\nTravellers at Toronto Pearson International Airport over the weekend said they were confused and frustrated about when they would be able to fly.\nItalian Francesca Tondini, 50, sitting at the Toronto airport, said she supported the union even though she had no idea when she would be able to return home.\n“They are right,” she said with a smile, pointing at the striking attendants.\nThe dispute between cabin crews and Air Canada hinges on the way airlines compensate flight attendants. Most, including Air Canada, pay them only when planes are in motion.\nIn their latest contract negotiations, flight attendants in both Canada and the United States have sought compensation for hours worked, including for tasks such as boarding passengers.\nNew labour agreements at American Airlines and Alaska Airlines legally require carriers to start the clock for paying flight attendants when passengers are boarding.\nAmerican flight attendants are now also compensated for some hours between flights. United Airlines’ cabin crews, who voted down a tentative contract deal last month, also want a similar provision.\nOn the markets, Air Canada’s stock is down 1.6 percent as of 12pm in Toronto (16:00 GMT). US carrier United Airlines – another Star Alliance member, which does not have a striking cabin crew and which serves several major Canadian cities – is up 1.4 percent.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 17:38:02 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml"}

Tehran has long opposed the planned transit route, also known as the Zangezur corridor, fearing it would cut the country off from Armenia and the rest of the Caucasus while bringing potentially hostile foreign forces close to its borders.\nSince the deal was signed on August 8, Iranian officials have stepped up warnings to Armenia, saying the project could be part of a US ploy “to pursue hegemonic goals in the Caucasus region”.\nOn Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described it as a “sensitive” issue, saying Tehran’s main concern is that it could “lead to geopolitical changes in the region”.\n“They [Armenian officials] have assured us that no American forces … or American security companies will be present in Armenia under the pretext of this route,” he told the official IRNA news agency.\nThe proposed corridor has been hailed as beneficial by other countries in the region including Russia, with which Iran has a strategic alliance alongside Armenia.\nAli Akbar Velayati, a top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, said Tehran would block the initiative “with or without Russia”.\nTrump “thinks the Caucasus is a piece of real estate he can lease for 99 years”, Velayati told state-affiliated Tasnim News soon after the deal was signed, adding that the area would become “a graveyard for Trump’s mercenaries”.\nMoscow cautiously welcomed the deal, saying that it supported efforts to promote stability and prosperity in the region.

It says it is “committed to ending global participation in Israel’s genocidal and apartheid regime”.\nIsrael has been accused of widespread abuses in its 22 months of war on Gaza. The International Court of Justice in January 2024 said Israeli actions in Gaza were plausibly genocide. Since then, multiple rights organisations have called Israel’s war a genocide. In November, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes.\nRooney said she chose the Dublin-based newspaper to publicise her intention rather than a UK one as doing so “would now be illegal” in Britain after the government banned Palestine Action.\n“The UK’s state broadcaster … regularly pays me residual fees. I want to be clear that I intend to use these proceeds of my work, as well as my public platform generally, to go on supporting Palestine Action and direct action against genocide in whatever way I can,” she wrote.\nHundreds arrested\nMore than 700 supporters of Palestine Action have been arrested in the UK, mostly at demonstrations, since the group was outlawed under the Terrorism Act 2000.\n“I feel obliged to state once more that like the hundreds of protesters arrested last weekend, I too support Palestine Action. If this makes me a ‘supporter of terror’ under UK law, so be it,” Rooney said.\nThe spokesperson from the prime minister’s office said Palestine Action was proscribed “based on security advice following serious attacks the group has committed, following an assessment made by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre”.\nThe government ban on Palestine Action came into force on July 5, days after it took responsibility for a break-in at an air force base in southern England that caused an estimated 7 million pounds ($9.3m) of damage to two aircraft.\nThe group said its activists were responding to Britain’s indirect military support for Israel during the war in Gaza.\nBeing a member of Palestine Action or supporting the group is now a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison.

The attack also injured 20 people, including six children.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 itemsWhat will the Putin-Trump meeting mean for the war in Ukraine?\nRussia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,271\nRussian forces killed five people and injured four in attacks in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region, where some of the fiercest fighting on the ground rages on and where Russian President Vladimir Putin, feeling Moscow has the upper hand, seeks Ukraine’s withdrawal from the third of the region Kyiv still controls.\nIn Zaporizhzhia, a city in the southeast, 17 people were injured in an attack, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov. Russian air raids also targeted the northeastern region of Sumy and the southern region of Odesa.\nUkraine’s air force said Russian forces launched 140 drones and four missiles at Ukraine overnight, adding that 88 drones had been downed.\nRussia has been intensifying its fight in Ukraine. According to the United Nations monitoring mission on Ukraine, about 2,600 drone attacks were recorded in the past month, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, and more than 300 civilians were killed.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine’s military said on Monday that its drones had struck an oil-pumping station in the Tambov region, a strike 1,923km (1,195 miles) from Ukraine, leading to the suspension of supplies via the Druzhba pipeline.\n“As a result of the strike, a fire broke out at the facility. Oil pumping through the Druzhba main oil pipeline was completely stopped,” the Ukrainian military’s General Staff said in a statement.\nIn Russia’s border region of Belgorod, four people were injured in a Ukrainian drone attack while Russian officials reported shooting down hundreds of drones and munitions.\nAir raid sirens also sounded over Kyiv, journalists working with the AFP news agency heard.\nThe Ukrainian air force said on social media an air alert was triggered across the country because a Russian MiG-31 was detected taking off, capable of carrying Kinzhal hypersonic missiles that Moscow has been using in attacks.\nNegotiating an end to the war\nZelenskyy called the latest attacks on Ukraine “demonstrative and cynical”.\n“Putin will commit demonstrative killings to maintain pressure on Ukraine and Europe, as well as to humiliate diplomatic efforts,” he wrote on X.\nAl Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Kyiv, said Zelenskyy saw the killing of civilians as a strategy aimed at giving Trump more bargaining chips with which to pressure Ukraine into accepting an unfavourable peace deal.\n“This shows how much pressure Zelenskyy is under as he goes into … potentially the most vital diplomatic effort to end this war,” Stratford said.\nZelenskyy later on Monday met Trump for talks at the White House alongside a cadre of heavyweight European leaders, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. On the table for discussion are possible land concessions as well as NATO-like security guarantees that Ukraine requires for any peace deal with Russia.\nTo date, Zelenskyy has refused to consider the possibility of ceding Ukrainian territory to bring about peace. It is also forbidden under the Ukrainian Constitution.\nZelenskyy said in Washington that he and European leaders had spoken with Trump about a number of “very sensitive points”, including security guarantees, humanitarian efforts, prisoner swaps and more. He added that discussion on “territorial” issues would be saved for a trilateral meeting with Putin.\nThe meeting comes on the heels of a summit between Trump and Putin on Friday that ended with no clear breakthrough on the war.\n‘Russia is advancing on the ground’\nWhile Ukraine has continued to warn against rushing to an agreement that ends the war without addressing long-term issues of Ukrainian security, Russia’s advantages on the battlefield have also become a source of pressure for Ukraine to secure an agreement before its position could deteriorate further.\n“At the moment, Russia is advancing on the ground. Slowly, but faster than it has been for some time. It is Ukraine that is being pushed back,” said Anatol Lieven, an analyst at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a US-based think tank that supports restraint in US foreign policy.\nHe added that Russia’s prospects for greater success on the battlefield would decrease incentives for Putin to agree to a ceasefire outside of a larger agreement to end the war.\n“When Ukraine appeared to be winning the war, Ukraine categorically ruled out peace talks with Russia, because it was winning. Russia, from the very first, told the Trump administration and indeed the world that they were not going to agree to a ceasefire without an actual peace agreement, because of course, if they do that, they lose their only point of leverage,” said Lieven.\nStrength and safety in numbers appeared to be factors in the group visit by European leaders, with memories still fresh about the hostile reception Zelenskyy received in February from Trump and US Vice President JD Vance in a public White House dressing-down. They castigated the Ukrainian leader as being ungrateful and “disrespectful”.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:25:07 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml"}

It comes in instalments\nThe fate of the Noufal family echoes the tragedy of Palestinian families slowly being wiped out by genocide.\nWhen I heard about the killing of Mohammed Noufal and his colleagues from Al Jazeera, my first thoughts were with his sister, Janat. I knew her vaguely in university; she is a polite girl with a beautiful smile, who was studying digital media at the Islamic University of Gaza and ran an online shop where she sold girls’ accessories.\nShe had already lost several members of her family when she received the news of her brother’s martyrdom. I thought of her and the devastating pain she must be in. I thought of how her story reflects the fate of so many Palestinian families who, over the past almost two years, have faced slow death, member by member.\nOn October 30, 2023, just three weeks after the start of the war, a missile struck Janat’s family house in Jabalia. She and her sisters and brothers survived, although Mohammed had serious injuries. Their aunt and uncle were killed.\nA year later, on October 7, 2024, Omar, Janat’s eldest brother, was martyred while he was trying to rescue the injured from a bombed house; the Israeli army hit the same spot again, killing him.\nThen, on June 22 of this year, her mother, Muneera, passed away. She was visiting relatives when the Israeli army bombarded the area. Muneera was hit by shrapnel; she arrived at the hospital still alive but passed away 39 hours later.\nOn August 10, Israel bombed a media tent near al-Shifa Hospital, killing Janat’s brother Mohammed and six other journalists.\nNow, Janat has only her father Riyad, her brother Ibrahim and her sisters Ola, Hadeel, Hanan left.\n“[When] my older brother Omar passed away, we heard our father groan and say, “You’ve broken my back, oh God,” Janat told me when I reached out to her.\n“When we lost my mother Muneera, my father said in a hoarse voice, ‘We have been struck down’,” she continued.\n“When my brother Mohammed, the journalist, was martyred, he said nothing. He didn’t scream, he didn’t cry, he didn’t utter a word. And that’s when fear began to creep into my heart … I feared that his silence might break him forever. I feared his stillness more than I feared his grief.”\nAfter Mohammed was martyred, Janat tried to convince her brother Ibrahim to leave his work as a journalist, because she was afraid for him. He was the last one left to support her, their father, and her sisters. But he refused, saying that nothing would befall them except what God had written for them. He told her that he wanted to follow the legacy of their martyred brother and his colleagues.\nFor Janat, the pain of losing her loved ones has become unbearable. “Whenever we thought we could breathe a little, the next loss would bring us back to the same darkness. Fear is no longer a passing feeling, but a constant companion, watching us from every corner of our lives. Loss has become part of our existence, and grief has settled into the details of daily life, in every paused smile and every prolonged silence,” she told me.\nHer words echo the suffering of so many families here in Gaza.\nAccording to the Government Media Office, as of March this year, 2,200 Palestinian families were completely wiped out from the civil registry, all of their members killed. More than 5,120 families had only one member left.\nPalestinian families are constantly under the threat of extinction with each wave of bombing.\nMy own relatives have also been erased from the civil registry. My father, Ghassan, had eight cousins – Mohammed, Omar, Ismail, Firas, Khaled, Abdullah, Ali, and Marah – who formed a large branch of our extended family. After the outbreak of war, we began losing them one after another. Each loss left a new void, as if we were being pulled into a spiral of recurring grief.\nOnly the wives of Omar and Ismail and their two children remain now. My father carries this immense pain quietly, holding his sorrow deep inside.\nToday, we face another Israeli offensive on northern Gaza. Last year, the Israeli onslaught killed tens of thousands. Those who defied forced displacement to the south paid a heavy price.\nMany of us who have lost loved ones do not want to live through the horror again. Last year, my family stayed in the north, but we are now exhausted. We are worn out from the bombing, death, and terror we experienced. We will leave this time. Janat’s family, who proudly held on to their half-destroyed home in Jabalia, will also leave.\nWe have experienced atrocities that no human being can endure. We cannot take any more death.\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:05:44 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml"}
{"title": "Bringing Back Stagflation, Lower Growth, and Higher Prices", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/trump-economy-stagflation-consumer-spending-taxes/", "text": "Bringing Back Stagflation, Lower Growth, and Higher Prices\nWhen Trump talks of turning the economy around, he speaks the truth—he just gets the direction of change wrong.\nWhen Donald Trump campaigned on making America great again, not many of us realized he was talking about the 1970s. That was a decade of unprecedented inflation and a sharp slowdown in growth after a quarter-century boom following World War II.\nWe’re just two quarters into the Trump administration, but the picture we have seen to date is not good. In the first quarter of this year the economy actually shrank at a 0.5 percent annual rate. A decline in GDP is unusual, but many of us downplayed the drop since there were unusual quirks in the data responsible for the decline.\nSpecifically, there was a massive surge in imports as businesses and households rushed to buy things in anticipation of Trump’s tariffs. Imports were a major drag on growth in the quarter. But we saw the reversal in the second quarter, with imports falling back to a more normal level. That was by far the most important factor behind the 3 percent growth reported for the second quarter.\nWhile the Trump administration touted the big comeback from a 0.5 percent first-quarter decline to growth of 3 percent, those not on the administration’s payroll pointed out that it is necessary to talk the two quarters together. And that picture is not pretty.\nGrowth in the first half of 2025 averaged 1.2 percent. That’s down from a 2.8 percent growth rate in Biden’s last year. When Trump talks of turning the economy around he speaks the truth, he just gets the direction of change wrong.\nLooking at the economy by category doesn’t improve the story. Consumption, which accounts for almost 70 percent of the economy, grew at just a 0.9 percent annual rate in the first half, down from 3.4 percent in 2024.\nGrowth in the items that are most discretionary was especially slow. Spending on air travel fell at an 8.5 percent rate in the first half of the year. Restaurant spending rose at a modest 1.6 percent rate in first half, but spending in fast-food restaurants, reflecting the situation of more moderate-income households, fell at a 0.1 percent rate.\nInvestment spending is not picking up the gap. While the AI boom is leading to some spending, it is barely offsetting the decline in construction. Spending on both factory and hotels construction is sharply lower in 2025.\nThe drop in factory construction is especially notable since Trump has placed the revitalizing of manufacturing at the center of his agenda. Biden’s semiconductor bill and Inflation Reduction Act led to an unprecedented boom in factory construction, with the 2024 inflation-adjusted level more than twice the 2019 level. Construction is now headed in the opposite direction.\nTrump has hopes of reducing the trade deficit, but we are not seeing any visible progress to date. Exports have actually fallen slightly as a share of the economy in the first half of 2025. One of our major exports, tourism by foreigners, is falling through the floor. Real spending by foreigners traveling in the United States fell at a 15 percent rate in first half of the year.\nThe picture on employment and wages doesn’t look much better. Job growth averaged 133,000 jobs a month through June, down from 168,000 in 2024. At 4.1 percent, the unemployment rate is still at a historically low level, but there are some worrying signs. Notably, the unemployment rate for young people and Black workers, two very vulnerable groups, has risen sharply. The latter was 6.8 percent in June, two full percentage points above its all-time low, hit in May of 2023.\nWage growth also appears to be slowing. After increasing at a 4 percent annual rate in 2023 and 2024, the average hourly wage increased at just a 3.2 percent annual rate, comparing the last three months (April–June) with the prior three months (January–March).\nGoing along with slower wage growth, we are also seeing an uptick in inflation. The consumption expenditure deflator that the Fed focuses on in assessing inflation increased at a 3 percent annual rate in the first half of the year. This was far higher than anyone at the Fed had expected last fall. As more tariffs hit in the second half of 2025, inflation is almost certain to rise further.\nPopular\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →We are looking at a pattern of slowing wage growth and rising prices, which means stagnant or falling real wages. That will further depress consumption growth, slowing GDP and job growth.\nWe are also seeing a slowdown in productivity growth, which is the key to rising living standards in the long run. Productivity fell at a 1.5 percent rate in the first quarter. We will see modest growth in the second quarter, but the average for the first half will not be much above zero. This compares to a 2.1 percent rate in 2024. Slower productivity growth is another factor contributing to rising inflation.\nWhile the economic prospects for the immediate future are bleak, the longer-term picture is worse. The Trump cutbacks on research spending will have massive implications for the future development of technology in a wide range of areas. His attacks on universities, and especially foreign students, will deprive the country of many smart, hard-working people of the sort who helped propel the economy forward in the last four decades.\nAnd his random tariff rates have alienated all of our trading partners. They are now eagerly looking to make new trade deals with each other, so that they are not dependent on the whims of a US president who changes his policies on a whim. The attack on clean energy is also locking us into antiquated fossil fuel technology that is falling further behind by the day. It’s still early in the Trump administration, so perhaps things will turn around. But we may also end up with an economic picture that will make the 1970s look good.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

{"title": "Trump’s Fossil Fuel Fanaticism Is Surrendering the Future to China", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-climate-change-china/", "text": "Trump’s Fossil Fuel Fanaticism Is Surrendering the Future to China\nIf the planet is to survive, the future needs to be green. China seems to get that—but the US is blowing it.\nMeteorologists are predicting that there will be some relief in August from the brutal heat wave that has engulfed much of America. But this is just a temporary respite. This year’s scorching weather is only a foretaste of the even more boiling future that climate change has in store for us. And unfortunately for the United States and the world, Donald Trump’s administration is committed to a program of fossil fuel nostalgia and deregulation that will intensify climate change and blunt any possibility of mitigating its effects.\nThe Trump administration has been busy stalling and rolling back regulations essential to dealing with the climate crisis. For instance, under Joe Biden, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) proposed a new heat standard that would require employers to protect workers from extreme heat. The American Prospect reported that the Trump administration has made no moves to implement this new standard and has “drastically reduced the 1,400-strong workforce of the organization that funds and develops the research supporting OSHA rules.”\nBut that matter, grave as it is, is nothing compared to the nightmare Trump apparently has in store for the Environmental Protection Agency. On Tuesday, The Washington Post reported,\nThe Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday unveiled a proposal to rescind the landmark legal opinion that underpins virtually all of its regulations to curb climate change.\nThe move would end EPA regulations on greenhouse gases emitted by vehicles from lightweight cars to heavy-duty trucks, while also undercutting rules that limit power plant emissions and control the release of methane by oil and gas companies.\nClimate change has long been the subject of a political seesaw. In 2009, under Barack Obama’s administration, the EPA ruled that greenhouse gases endangered public health and could be regulated. In his first term, Trump used his executive powers to overturn many of Obama’s environmental policies, which were then restored in turn under Joe Biden.\nBut the new proposal goes much further. It is designed to fundamentally strip the EPA of power to deal with the climate. As right-wing climate denialist Myron Ebell of the American Lands Council told the Post, “If the endangerment finding is withdrawn, then this ping-pong match will be much harder for a future Democratic administration, or a green Republican president, to undo.”\nIn truth, the “ping-pong” match that Ebell describes was always an uneven one. While Republicans from Trump to George W. Bush have been zealous enthusiasts for eternal fossil fuel domination, both Obama and Biden were only half-hearted environmentalists. The measures they undertook, while welcome, were hardly on the scale necessary to deal with the climate crisis.\nWriting in the Financial Times in December, the historian Adam Tooze rightly pointed out that Democrats have been complicit in allowing the US to falter in energy transition:\nLiking new sources of power is one thing. Being serious about the energy transition is quite another. The kind of tough-minded carbon pricing applied in Europe went out of style in Washington DC with the failure of Obama’s cap and trade proposal in 2010. America’s preferred energy policy is more, more, more, as cheaply as possible. After years of heavy investment in fracking, the US under Biden became the largest oil producer the world has ever seen. Trump plans to raise production by a further 3mn barrels. Decarbonisation of electricity supply will continue because wind and solar are now so much cheaper. But despite hurricanes regularly devastating parts of the country, any broader ambition to meet America’s climate targets is off the table.\nTooze contrasted the fecklessness of the United States and Europe with the much more sustained and serious investment in renewables undertaken by China. He concluded:\nInsofar as there is to be a global climate leader, it can now only be China, which is responsible for more than 30 per cent of global emissions and has mastered the green energy supply chain…. [China] will not single-handedly solve the climate crisis but it will assert a claim to leadership that the west will find hard to answer.\nThis claim was buttressed by striking statistics that Tooze presented in May in his blog Chartbook. In 2001, he wrote, the United States created 21.2 percent of new global capacity in wind and solar; Europe. 65.1 percent; and China, a mere 0.6 percent. By 2024, the numbers were: the United States, 7.7 percent; Europe, 12.5 percent; China, 63.3 percent. While the US and Europe are producing far more renewable energy than they did in 2001, they are now minor players in renewable energy, while China is a superpower.\nPopular\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →In Phenomenal World, environmental researchers Tim Sahay and Kate Mackenzie built on Tooze’s research to document a much broader Chinese domination in clean energy, evidenced by the new Chinese innovations in electric vehicles developed by Build Your Dreams (BYD). They noted:\nBYD, China’s leading EV maker leapt out of its home market in a stunning international expansion, threatening the future of European political coalitions grown up around the internal combustion engine and prompting new waves of anxiety among Western policymakers and captains of industry. China’s dramatic surge of investment into the “new three”—EVs, batteries, and solar—is expected to crush oil demand by 5 million barrels a day by 2030. That cheaper green tech is now enabling a hundred plus countries to break free from expensive imported hydrocarbons towards the sunlit uplands of electric self-sufficiency.\nIf human civilization is to have a sustainable future, it will have to be green. It is entirely possible that no such green future will emerge, at least not enough to prevent societal collapse. China’s innovations might be too little, too late. But there is also a possibility that they will build our only path out of catastrophe.\nBy contrast, the United States is already on its way to being a technological backwater and a climate albatross. The country will be part of the problem, not part of the solution. By pushing insufficient policies, Obama and Biden put the United States on the path to its current environmental weakness. Trump, of course, is doing something even worse—not just being a slowpoke in innovation but taking the United States backward. The only results of this fossil fuel fanaticism will be a ravaged planet and a future shaped by China.\nTake a stand against Trump and support The Nation!\nIn this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.\nWe’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.\nThe Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?\nAt The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

Ali is affiliated with Kataib Hezbollah, as are the brigades that attacked the ministry, analysts told Al Jazeera.\nThe incident is seen as a litmus test of whether the Iraqi state can hold PMF factions accountable for breaking the law.\nIraq’s government argues that passing a new legislation – which would fully integrate the PMF into the state – would help them do so. Proponents of the bill argue it would incentivise the PMF to act within the confines of the law, but detractors fear it would give legal cover to militias, which are already too strong.\nThe PMF\nThe PMF, also known as al-Hashd al-Shaabi, is an umbrella organisation of mostly Shia armed groups, some of whom have close ties to neighbouring Iran. A few of these groups first emerged during the Iraqi resistance to US occupation.\nAsa’ib Ahl al-Haq, for instance, split from Jaish al-Mahdi, formerly the dominant arm of the Shia rebellion, in 2007. The group received Iranian support to become a major powerbroker in Iraq and later intervened in Syria’s civil war to support then-President Bashar al-Assad as he tried to crush a popular rebellion.\nKataib Imam Ali is another, albeit smaller, group in the PMF that reportedly received training from the Lebanese group Hezbollah in Iran and also dispatched fighters to Syria during the height of its war.\nLike Kataib Imam Ali, most PMF factions were formed after Iraqi Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani issued a fatwa in 2014, urging all able-bodied men to join the state to defend Iraq from ISIL (ISIS).\nAt the time, ISIL controlled large swaths of territory across Syria and Iraq, equivalent to the size of England. ISIL even captured the Iraqi city of Mosul and declared a “caliphate” from there.\nBy 2016, Iraq’s parliament had passed a law that recognised the PMF as a component of the state’s national security.\nBut the law lacks clarity around command and control and budgetary oversight, and it has failed to prevent some groups from taking unilateral action to attack United States assets and soldiers stationed in the country.\nIn 2024, for instance, the PMF was awarded a budget of $3.4bn, which exceeded the total budget of Lebanon.\nWhile the figure is small relative to the $21.1bn allocated to Iraq’s Ministry of Defence that same year, it is a sizeable amount that the state allocated to a body that it did not even have an accurate membership list for.\nEach registered PMF faction submits a list of names to be paid, and these lists are then reviewed by the Ministry of Finance. However, PMF leaders often intervene to push payments through unchallenged, according to a 2021 report by the Chatham House think tank.\nEstimates suggested there are 238,000 PMF fighters.\nReceiving a share of the state budget has helped the PMF in its quest to brand itself as a legitimate entity in Iraq.\n“From the beginning, the PMF was adamant that it was part of the state and not a militia,” said Renad Mansour, an expert on Iraq with Chatham House.\nOver the past 10 years, PMF factions have created political wings, run in parliamentary elections and gained access to lucrative state money after securing important administrative positions in key ministries.\nYet as they accrued power, some used their arms against the state to safeguard their patronage networks and influence over key ministries.\nIn 2021, PMF groups linked to Iran launched a drone at the home of then-Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, reportedly an attempt to upend the government after losing many parliamentary seats and thus access to state money in the recent elections, said Alaca, the expert on Iraqi Shia militias.\nThe new law\nThe Iraqi government drafted the new law in March. It would give all PMF factions official, stable employment and bring them under the control of Prime Minister Mohamed Shia al-Sudani as commander-in-chief\nProponents of the draft law mainly include a bloc of five Shia parties known as the Coordination Framework.\n“The argument pushed by those advocating for the law is that by offering an institutional safe haven for armed factions under a reformed PMF, it would incentivise those to comply with the national chain of command – thereby diminishing their appetite to take action outside the state,” explained Inna Rudolf, an expert on the PMF and a senior research fellow at the Centre for Statecraft & National Security at King’s College London.\nMost importantly to the PMF, the law offers it much-needed legal cover at a time when the US and Israel are threatening to target groups they consider Iranian proxies.\nIt would grant PMF members full access to intelligence, which some argue is a risky proposition because the intelligence could be passed to Iran.\nAnalysts have said, however, that many PMF factions would be more concerned about their power base and assets than about following Iranian interests.\nDuring the 12-day Israel-Iran war in June, PMF groups did not attack US assets or personnel, likely out of fear of giving Israel a pretext to attack their command structure and resources as Israel did against Hezbollah, according to a report by the Royal United Services Institute.\n“I would say that the stronger and more embedded PMF groups are the ones who have been practising restraint and telling the smaller [pro-Iran] factions not to get involved in the regional conflict [between Iran and Israel],” Mansour said.\nThe follow-up on the Ministry of Agriculture incident will test the willingness of PMF commanders to cooperate with the state to hold their own members accountable, as well as the state’s seriousness in holding PMF members accountable, according to Rudolf.\nShe said al-Sudani has shown “strong will” by referring all those involved in the raid to the judiciary and calling for the formation of a review committee to investigate “negligence in leadership and control duties” within the PMF.\n“Sudani’s administration wants to demonstrate power over the PMF and [to prove] that everyone affiliated with it not only has the same privileges as members of the security forces but has to abide by the same code of conduct,” Rudolf told Al Jazeera.\nPressures against the new law\nNot everybody in Iraq supports the PMF’s integration, said Zeidon al-Kinani, an expert on Iraq and adjunct instructor at Georgetown University in Qatar.\nHe said many PMF factions harmed and even killed hundreds of young protesters who were demonstrating against what they considered a corrupt political elite in 2019.\nAs a result, civil society is wary of seeing all PMF factions given the same privileges as Iraq’s army and police and would prefer the government absorb only those that do not have close ties with Iran, al-Kinani said.\nUS officials are also pressuring Iraq not to pass the law with Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly telling al-Sudani the law would “institutionalise Iranian influence and armed terrorist groups undermining Iraq’s sovereignty”.\nFormer and current Iraqi officials argued that the state cannot disband the PMF and any attempt to do so could trigger sectarian violence.\nAl-Kinani warned that the US could trigger a conflict by making unreasonable demands without supporting Iraq to carry them out.\n“When it comes to Iraq, the US makes drastic demands [without] supporting the Iraqi government or civil society to ensure their protection from any repercussions,” he told Al Jazeera.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:16:20 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml"}

They declared victory after Republicans adjourned that first special session, and Democrats rallied in opposition to the Trump-led gerrymandering effort.\nThey pointed specifically to California’s release of proposed maps intended to increase Democrats’ US House advantage by five seats, effectively neutralising any Republican gains in Texas.\nTrump has pressured other Republican-run states to consider redistricting, while Democratic governors in multiple statehouses have indicated they would follow California’s lead in response. Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom has said that his state will hold a November 4 special referendum on the redrawn districts.\nThe US president wants to shore up Republicans’ narrow House majority and avoid a repeat of the 2018 midterms during his first presidency, when Democrats regained House control and used their majority to stymie his agenda and twice impeach him.\nOn a national level, the partisan makeup of existing district lines puts Democrats within three seats of a majority. Of the 435 total US House seats, only several dozen districts are competitive. So even slight changes in a few states could affect which party wins control.\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott jumped to the president’s aid, adding redistricting to the agenda of an initial special session that included a number of issues, but most notably a package of bills responding to devastating floods that killed more than 130 people earlier this summer.\nAbbott has blamed Democrats’ absence for delaying action on those measures. Democrats have answered that Abbott’s capitulation to Trump is responsible for the delay because he insisted on effectively linking the hyper-partisan matter to the nonpartisan flood relief.\nIt is unusual for redistricting to take place in the middle of the decade. This typically occurs once at the beginning of each decade to coincide with the US Census. Many states, including Texas, give legislators the power to draw maps. California is among those that empower independent commissions with the task.\nThe Texas House is scheduled to convene later on Monday.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 16:19:00 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml"}

A trial was scheduled to begin in October.\nIn the lawsuit, filed in the months after the 2020 election, Dominion accused the cable news network of spreading false claims that the company's voting technology had been manipulated to help Joe Biden beat Donald Trump. Like other right-wing news networks, Newsmax featured Trump allies who promoted these conspiracies, including former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell and supporter Mike Lindell of My Pillow.\nNewsmax announced the settlement in an Aug. 15 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the document, the network paid $27 million of the settlement on that day; the rest will be paid by January 2027.\nMultiple court rulings and investigations by election officials have found no widespread fraud was present in the 2020 election; even still, these debunked claims were still being echoed by factions of Trump supporters in 2024. Dominion has said the election lies caused the company and its employees extensive harm, including death threats and lost revenue.\n\"We are pleased to have settled this matter,\" a Dominion spokesperson said Monday morning.\nIn mid-April, Judge Eric M. Davis, who had presided over Dominion's case against Fox News, ruled that all of the at-issue statements that aired on Newsmax were also false and defamatory. His ruling meant that, should the case have gone to trial, the jury would only have had to decide whether Newsmax acted with \"actual malice,\" whether Dominion should receive damages, and how much money it should get.\nIn a statement, Newsmax did not admit any wrongdoing. It maintained that its 2020 election coverage was \"fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards of journalism.\"\n\"Newsmax believed it was critically important for the American people to hear both sides of the election disputes that arose in 2020,\" it said.\nBut the company also accused Davis of ruling in ways that \"strongly favored the plaintiffs and limited Newsmax's ability to defend itself.\" It claims that the court's actions, in this case and against Fox, \"represent a direct attack on free speech and a free press.\"\nNewsmax founder and CEO Chris Ruddy echoed those words in a phone call Monday afternoon. He suggested that it might be risky for companies to be based in Delaware for that reason, a concern other notable corporate officials have shared after Elon Musk received an unfavorable ruling and moved his business incorporations from Delaware to Texas.\nRuddy said the settlement does not include any required retractions, corrections or apologies.\n\"Readers can read into that what they will,\" he said.\nNewsmax last year settled a defamation case brought by another voting systems company, Smartmatic USA, in the wake of the 2020 election. Information filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed Newsmax was due to pay Smartmatic the second half of that $40 million payout by the end of June 2025.\nSmartmatic is still pursuing a $2.7 billion defamation suit against Fox News in New York state court. That case, if it goes to trial, could be heard by a jury in 2026.\nDominion and some of its employees have separately sued Powell and others, including former Trump attorney and New York mayor Rudy Giuliani.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:37:16 -0400", "author": "Maddy Lauria", "source": "https://feeds.npr.org/1014/rss.xml"}

He said, without evidence, that voting machines are \"highly inaccurate,\" as well as more expensive and less reliable than counting paper ballots.\n\"We're going to start with an executive order that's being written right now by the best lawyers in the country to end mail in ballots because they're corrupt,\" Trump said during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House Monday. \"And it's time that the Republicans get tough and stop it because the Democrats want it. It's the only way they can get elected.\"\nAlthough Trump himself urged his supporters to vote using mail-in ballots prior to the 2024 presidential election, Democrats have been significantly more likely to vote using mail-in ballots, compared to Republicans, since the 2020 election. That gap has only gotten wider in recent elections as GOP-led states have passed more restrictions on this method of voting. But legal experts say Trump does not have the legal authority to tell states how to run their elections.\nMichael Morley, a professor at Florida State University College of Law, told NPR that the Constitution gives Congress – not the president – the power to regulate federal elections.\n\"There's really nothing that the executive branch can do on its own in terms of direct mandates,\" he said.\nAny changes to the president's legal authority would require action from Congress, said UCLA law professor Richard Hasen.\n\"Unless the president has some theory under which he could try to ban certain kinds of voting machines or tried to ban mail in ballots by enforcing some existing federal law, he would need the cooperation of Congress,\" Hasen said, \"which I think he'd be unlikely to get to have any kind of federal interference with how the midterm elections will be run.\"\nDavid Becker, the executive director and founder of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research, said the Founders deliberately gave the president no role in how elections are conducted.\n\"Hamilton foresaw, and made clear in Federalist 59 that a democracy must diversify power of elections in order to protect itself from an overzealous executive, and therefore power over elections would reside with the several states,\" he told NPR in a statement.\nIt would also be a logistical stretch to upend how states run their elections as midterm primaries get closer, said Matt Germer, director of the right-of-center R Street Institute, a Washington-based think tank.\nFor one, any executive order is likely to face litigation, which could take a while to sort out. And then, states would have to likely pass new laws or implement new voting plans ahead of voting.\n\"In some places, I think things like restricting voting by mail mechanically would just mean forcing more people to come in and vote in person,\" Germer said. \"And they need to make sure that they invest the resources in an in-person voting to maybe account for that.\"\nHe said officials would have to find more locations to host polling places. And he said volunteers would need to be trained and facilitate those voting places.\n\"It would be a huge undertaking and I think realistically it's highly unlikely that he could end voting by mail or end the use of very particular voting machines in time for 2026 now,\" Germer said.\nBarbara Smith Warner, executive director of the National Vote at Home Institute, which advocates for wide use of mail-in voting, said it would be nearly impossible to actually get rid of mail-in voting in such a short timeframe. But she said, she believes the larger effort here is to \"destabilize\" next year's elections.\n\"Efforts to eliminate this are ignoring the facts and really are just trying to undermine confidence in our elections overall,\" she said. \"This is yet another power grab of federal overreach into the states' rights to run their own election.\"\nHasen said Trump has tried to interfere in elections before by seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which Trump lost, so he said \"it would not be surprising\" if he were again trying to interfere with a major election.\n\"And so now is the time to take preparations on the part of states and parts of courts and others to ensure that the elections that we conduct in 2026 will be conducted with fairness and integrity,\" Hasen said.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 18:23:50 -0400", "author": "Ashley Lopez", "source": "https://feeds.npr.org/1014/rss.xml"}

Here's how redistricting affects voters", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2025/08/18/nx-s1-5495427/trump-redistricting-texas-congress-california", "text": "Trump prompted a battle over voting maps. Here's how redistricting affects voters\nLoading...\nLeaders of the two most populous states, Democrats in California and Republicans in Texas, are trying to redraw the voting lines for the midterm congressional elections next year. It's a break from the usual process and was touched off by President Trump calling on Texas to give Republican candidates an edge.\nFor months, the slim Republican majority in Congress has given the green light to mass deportations, health care cuts, tax breaks and many other Trump priorities.\nBut Republicans have only a 219-to-212 advantage in the U.S. House. To maintain that majority, the White House is calling on GOP-led states to redraw their voting maps in ways that help Republican candidates win more seats.\nStates usually redistrict early in each decade after the census count. This technical process is important. Whichever way people vote, the way they're grouped in congressional districts can determine who wins and whether a citizen's vote makes a difference.\nThe Texas and California legislatures plan to meet on their opposing plans this week.\nRedistricting is meant to assign congressional districts as populations shift\nThe U.S. House has 435 seats, but the number for each state can shift as populations change. Every 10 years, the national census determines how seats are reallocated. But it's mostly up to the states to draw the specific districts within state boundaries as long as the districts have roughly the same number of people (about 700,000 now).\nNewly drawn maps often face challenges in courts. It's illegal to draw lines in order to weaken the voting power of a racial group.\nBut redistricting laws also vary by state. Some states have laws or criteria aimed at creating districts that are competitive and compact geographically, or against redistricting done to benefit a political party. Some prioritize districts that include voters with common political interests, which pushes candidates to address those interests.\nWhat are \"gerrymandering,\" \"packing\" and \"cracking\"?\nGerrymandering is when politicians manipulate district lines, dividing or grouping populations, to get an advantage. Opponents of the practice say it's like politicians choosing their voters, instead of letting voters choose their politicians.\nThe word \"gerrymandering\" comes from maps approved in the early 1800s by Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry. Critics noted that one district was shaped like a salamander, so they combined the two words into \"Gerry-mander.\"\nThe Brennan Center for Justice, an organization that seeks to end gerrymandering, states on its website: \"Gerrymandering, the practice of drawing districts to favor one political party or racial group, skews election results, makes races less competitive, hurts communities of color, and thwarts the will of the voters.\"\nOften, the party in control has gerrymandered by \"packing\" voters of the opposing party into a limited number of districts, containing their voting power to certain areas. That cuts those voters out of other districts where the majority party is likely to win.\nLawmakers have also \"cracked\" voters of the opposing party or Black voters into different districts to dilute their votes so that they have little say over who wins a race in any one district.\nTexas has picked up Trump's plan, and Democrats walked out\nTexas Republicans are working to obey Trump's call to create five more districts with an advantage for the GOP. Democrats, who are in the minority in the Texas House, left the state, meaning not enough members were present — a quorum — to hold the vote and approve the maps.\nThe Texas House speaker issued arrest warrants for the missing Democrats, and Gov. Greg Abbott, a Trump ally, went to court to try to start removing some from office and replace them.\nBut the Texas Legislature might approve those districts this week. The Democrats said last week they could return soon because California is taking action now.\nTo counter the five new proposed Republican seats in Texas, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom wants lawmakers in his state to rush a new map that could give Democrats advantages in five newly drawn districts there. The proposed maps were released Friday.\nNewsom is asking the Legislature to put the plan before voters in November. That's because unlike Texas, California has a Citizens Redistricting Commission, which voters established more than a decade ago to take the politics out of the process. Newsom's trying to bypass the commission.\nRepublican leaders in Florida, Ohio and Missouri have raised the prospect of creating more Republican-leaning districts in their states. Vice President Vance went to Indiana to discuss the idea with Republicans there.\nWhen is gerrymandering racial?\nRacial gerrymandering diminishes the power of a racial group to elect a representative of its choosing. An example would be when lines are drawn through communities of color in an urban area, dividing them into districts with larger numbers of voters in mostly white suburban or rural areas.\nThat's racial \"cracking\" and is illegal, as is racial \"packing.\" That's when voters of color are lumped into one district to remove them from several other districts, in order to create or maintain white majorities in those districts.\nIn Texas, Republicans say the proposed maps create Latino majorities in some districts, which they present as an opportunity for Latino voters to have a say. But U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a Texas Democrat, told lawmakers that they are doing it to an illegal extreme.\n\"There is some district that went up to 70-something percent Latino. That is packing,\" she said. \"You don't need some district to be almost 80% Latino for that district to perform as a Latino-opportunity seat.\"\nTexas Republicans say they're not racially gerrymandering but partisan gerrymandering\nTexas has 38 congressional districts and Republicans already hold 25. Republicans openly say they intend to create lines that will result in more wins for their party. Trump has asked for five more seats.\nTexas Republicans cite a 2019 Supreme Court ruling that courts can't intervene in cases where districts are drawn to give one party an edge, clearing the way for what's called \"partisan gerrymandering.\" They say that's what they're doing now and argue that Democratic states have done that too. Unlike some states, Texas law does not ban partisan gerrymandering.\n\"The courts have consistently held that redistricting for purposes of political performance by either party is acceptable,\" Republican Texas state Rep. Tom Oliverson told NPR's All Things Considered. \"Other states have done that.\" He pointed to Illinois, where Democrats hold 14 of 17 House districts.\nSome states have tried to take the partisanship out of redistricting\nUnsurprisingly, when one party has control over drawing district lines in a state, elected officials usually create districts to benefit their party. There are more Republican-led states like that than Democratic-led ones, according to the Brennan Center.\nGroups that seek to end gerrymandering usually recommend that states reduce the role that politicians play in drawing new districts. Eleven states do that by using commissions that are bipartisan or that include nonpoliticians. Most of those states are led by Democrats. Again, California has one and Texas does not.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 05:42:41 -0400", "author": "Larry Kaplow", "source": "https://feeds.npr.org/1014/rss.xml"}

But in the end, no ceasefire was agreed to. Still, Trump is calling the meeting a great success. And tomorrow, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several other European leaders are set to meet with Trump at the White House. NPR's Luke Garrett is here to talk about what comes next. Hey there.\nLUKE GARRETT, BYLINE: Hey. How's it going?\nDETROW: Let's start with the guest list. Who is attending tomorrow's meeting?\nGARRETT: So Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, of course, will be there, along with Europe's top leaders, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the secretary general of NATO, Mark Rutte. Many other country leaders, like French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, have said they're also traveling to D.C. with other European leaders. And their presence is really notable here, Scott, because it shows a united European front alongside Zelenskyy. We all remember the last time Zelenskyy met with Trump in the Oval Office in February. That meeting ended in shouting and a fractured relationship between Trump and the Ukrainian leader. We don't know how tomorrow will play out, but Zelenskyy will have allies with him in the White House. But to be clear, these European leaders really have their skin in the game as well, in terms of their roles and a potential security guarantee for Ukraine.\nDETROW: So this is Monday. Friday, Trump met with Putin for several hours in Alaska. What does that summit tell us about what we could expect tomorrow with Zelenskyy and these other leaders?\nGARRETT: It tells us a lot. This morning, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, who was part of the Trump-Putin meeting, pulled back the curtain on what was discussed and possibly agreed to on Friday. Witkoff told CNN that the Russians made concessions on security guarantees for Ukraine. Now, the devil will be in the details here - what kind of protections were actually agreed to and who will enforce them? Witkoff really didn't say. And it's also worth noting here that the Russians haven't confirmed this, so a bit of a grain of salt there. And separately, you know, Witkoff said that the Russians want Ukrainian land, something Putin has been saying since the war began.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nSTEVE WITKOFF: The fundamental issue, which is some sort of land swap, which is obviously ultimately in the control of the Ukrainians, that could not have been discussed at this meeting. We intend to discuss it on Monday.\nGARRETT: So in Witkoff's telling, the negotiation table is really set with Ukrainian security guarantees on one side and a potential land swap on the other, with a peace agreement kind of hanging in the balance. Witkoff said he's hopeful for a peace deal, but other U.S. officials at that Friday meeting really weren't so sure.\nDETROW: OK, tell me more about that, then.\nGARRETT: Right, so Secretary of State Marco Rubio struck a different tone this morning about a possible deal. Here's Rubio on ABC News.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nMARCO RUBIO: We're still a long ways off. I mean, we're not at the precipice of a peace agreement. We're not at the edge of one, but I do think progress was made.\nGARRETT: And Rubio said if no peace deal is reached between Russia and Ukraine, Trump still has levers of power against Putin's economy.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nRUBIO: In terms of sanctions, look, at the end of the day, if we can't reach a peace agreement here and this war continues and so forth, then I anticipate you'll see the president take further action. He's already made that clear.\nGARRETT: Ultimately, Rubio framed the negotiation similarly to Witkoff in that Ukrainian security guarantees and land exchanges are the bargaining chips here. Rubio said it will be up to Putin and Zelenskyy to make this deal.\nDETROW: So that's the United States' side of things. You mentioned before how tense and disastrous previous meetings between Trump and Zelenskyy have been this year. What are we hearing from Zelenskyy ahead of this?\nGARRETT: Zelenskyy said Sunday that the signal of possible Ukrainian security guarantees coming from that Friday summit marked a, quote, \"significant change.\" But Zelenskyy also highlighted that there are no details on how these theoretical safety assurances will actually work on the ground. Most importantly, the Ukrainian leader rejected the idea of giving away the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine or trading any land. He also really renewed his calls for a ceasefire. So obviously, there are a lot of details here that still need to be sorted out, but President Trump and Zelenskyy both agree that a peace deal, if it was finalized, would really need a trilateral meeting between the Russians, Ukrainians and the U.S. No such meeting has been planned as of yet.\nDETROW: That's NPR's Luke Garrett.

Is it legal?\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\nPresident Trump announced this morning on his social media site that he plans to sign an executive order eliminating mail-in voting and possibly voting machines ahead of next year's midterms. Legal and voting experts say it would be very difficult to upend how states run their elections. But more importantly, they say, the president lacks the legal authority to do this. NPR political correspondent Ashley Lopez is here in the studio to tell us more. Hey, Ashley.\nASHLEY LOPEZ, BYLINE: Hey there.\nSHAPIRO: Start by telling us more about the president's plan. What did he say this morning?\nLOPEZ: Yeah, so Trump said on Truth Social that he plans to lead a movement to get rid of mail-in ballots and voting machines in the country. He made some unfounded claims about them being inaccurate and leading to voter fraud. Notably, though, Trump said that he plans to sign an executive order ahead of midterm elections next year aimed at addressing these concerns. He talked a bit about it at the White House today.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We, as the Republican Party, are going to do everything possible that we get rid of mail-in ballots. We're going to start with an executive order that's being written right now by the best lawyers in the country to end mail-in ballots because they're corrupt.\nLOPEZ: Trump also said this morning that states are agents of the federal government and that he therefore has the power to tell them how to run elections.\nSHAPIRO: But that's just false. It's not true. So what is the truth?\nLOPEZ: Yeah. I spoke to several legal experts about this, and they said, yep, this is not true. There really aren't multiple takes on this. The Constitution is quite clear that the regulation of elections is the power of the states and only Congress can change that. And, I mean, you can imagine why the founders structured it this way. I spoke to UCLA law professor Richard Hasen about this, and he said any effort by the president to force states to run their elections in a particular way would be illegal. He said all the president has the power to do is enforce the laws that are passed by Congress.\nRICHARD HASEN: So unless the president has some theory under which he could try to ban certain kinds of voting machines or try to ban mail-in ballots by enforcing some existing federal law, he would need the cooperation of Congress - which I think he'd be unlikely to get - to have any kind of federal interference with how the midterm elections will be run.\nLOPEZ: And what Hasen told me is, like, look, if Trump wants to lead this political movement to rethink how our elections are run, he is absolutely free to do so, but he is not within his rights to tell election officials whether they should allow their voters to cast mail-in ballots or use voting machines.\nSHAPIRO: Do you know why he's talking about this now?\nLOPEZ: I mean, well, Trump and his supporters have been maligning both vote by mail and voting machines for years now, particularly since he lost the 2020 election. In fact, Newsmax, a right-wing media company that touted many of Trump's claims in that time, just recently settled a defamation suit from a voting machine company called Dominion Voting Systems to the tune of $67 million.\nSHAPIRO: Wow.\nLOPEZ: And it's clear that Trump is at least a little nervous - right? - about next year's midterm elections, which is why he has asked Republican states like Texas to redistrict ahead of next year. Although I should say, while it is unusual for a president to request that, experts told me it is not illegal, unlike what he is proposing today.\nSHAPIRO: Well, beyond the legal hurdles, how feasible would it logistically be to get rid of mail-in voting ahead of next year's election?\nLOPEZ: Well, that is another big problem with this plan, right? You know, after Trump signs an executive order, it will more than likely be litigated, which takes time. And even if that process moves quicker than expected, primary elections are not that far away. Election administrators are already prepping and budgeting for those elections. So to eliminate mail voting in particular - which is a way that a third of the electorate has been recently casting their ballots - is tough to imagine. And, I mean, that's not even mentioning the time and cost it will take to replace voting machines across the country.\nSHAPIRO: Reporting there from NPR's Ashley Lopez. Good to see you, and thanks.\nLOPEZ: Yeah, thanks.\nCopyright © 2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"title": "'Can't stop. Won't stop': Documentary filmmakers face federal funding shortfall", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2025/08/18/nx-s1-5490964/documentary-funding-cpb-pbs", "text": "'Can't stop. Won't stop': Documentary filmmakers face federal funding shortfall\n'Can't stop. Won't stop': Documentary filmmakers face federal funding shortfall\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has helped make PBS a home for independent documentaries for more than 50 years. In an email to NPR, CPB said it provided over $24 million to documentary filmmaking during the 2024 financial year. The government's decision to rescind CPB's entire $1.1 billion budget in July, subsequently causing it to announce its closure, led last week to PBS's announcement that it would be reducing its budget by 21%. This on top of sweeping grant cancellations earlier this year at both the National Endowments for the Humanities and the Arts, which both served as important sources of federal funding for documentarians.\nDespite these losses, the documentary community said it is not giving up. \"Can't stop. Won't stop,\" said filmmaker Carol Bash, whose 2015 documentary about jazz musician Mary Lou Williams, Mary Lou Williams: The Lady Who Swings the Band, was made with public media support. \" We're going to continue to find ways to think outside the box to get our films out there to audiences.\"\nBash said her community is now trying to figure out how to make up for the funding shortfall. \"There's going more international with your funding models,\" she said. \"And of course, there's the streamers.\"\nLeaning into streaming\nGBH is a public media powerhouse that produces such high-profile PBS series as Frontline, Nova and American Experience. President and CEO Susan Goldberg said GBH will pause production on new American Experience episodes next year, with the aim of reinventing the beloved, nearly 40-year-old history series. (It also laid off most of the team that produces the show.) Digital platforms are an important part of GBH's plan. \"How do we use digital channels to gather younger audiences into being really excited about American history?\" Goldberg told NPR.\nGoldberg said GBH already works with Amazon and aims to develop more relationships with streamers like Netflix, as well as expand its offerings on platforms such as YouTube.\n\"I'm personally very invested in ensuring that storytelling through documentaries continues to find an audience,\" said Angela Courtin, YouTube's vice president of sports and entertainment marketing. Courtin said the platform provides analytics and other resources to help creators of all kinds figure out how to expand their reach, though it doesn't currently pay for content. (Popular creators can earn revenue through such mechanisms as YouTube's Partner Program and brand deals.)\nStreaming platform Tubi does occasionally produce or co-produce documentaries, such as When Black Women Go Missing, a 2024 co-production with Vice about the disproportionately high number of Black, female missing persons. It also sometimes acquires streaming rights, as it did in 2023 for Satan Wants You, a film about satanic cults.\n\"It has been on the one level, a hit driven business,\" said Adam Lewinson, Tubi's chief content officer. Lewinson said Tubi is set up to accommodate not just documentaries likely to appeal to big audiences, but also niche titles by indie filmmakers that attract deep fandoms. Tubi mostly hosts movies in this latter category on its site – thereby helping films find audiences – but isn't generally financing this work. \"For many documentarians, if you say, 'Are you looking to recoup your investment, or do you want your story to be seen by as many people as possible?' The answer is always both. But ultimately they'll lean toward, 'We just want our content to be seen.'\"\nThe challenges of the open marketplace\nIndie documentary insiders said it's tough for most indie films to gain visibility in the profit-driven streaming marketplace because they aren't necessarily made for mass audiences. \" Independent documentary has, by and large, always been a non-profit enterprise,\" said Carrie Lozano, president and CEO of ITVS, one of the country's biggest co-producers of indie documentaries. Its output includes the 2004 Oscar-nominated feature The Weather Underground and the 2017 Peabody Award winning Maya Angelou: And Still I Rise.\nITVS received 86% of its funding from CPB. Lozano said her non-profit has directly invested more than $44 million in documentaries over the past five years. Owing to the difficult funding landscape, ITVS laid off roughly 20% of its staff in June. Lozano expects roughly 10 films to lose out on funding this year — a big cut from the up to 40 feature and short documentaries the group typically supports annually.\nThe basics of Internet connectivity are also an issue around streaming for many people, especially those who live in small, rural communities. \"What about audiences who aren't connected to fast broadband, or live in Internet deserts?\" said filmmaker Jessica Edwards, whose documentaries include the 2015 profile Mavis! about singer Mavis Staples. \"Many folks rely on free, over-the-air programming not just for news and weather but for a diversity of storytelling. What replaces that? More paywalls? It's an equity issue as much as an artistic one.\"\nBut for people like Mike Gonzalez, who've fought for decades to stop the flow of federal dollars into public media, there's no reason why these films should get special treatment in the form of federal dollars.\nA senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation think tank, Gonzalez told NPR that PBS — and NPR — needed to be defunded at the federal level owing to \"the very biased programming\" — a claim both networks' leaders reject. Gonzalez said he welcomes diverse storytelling in the media. \"I don't want to suppress views that are opposite to my own in the least,\" Gonzalez said, adding that it's simply a matter of independent documentaries vying for eyeballs just like everything else in the content universe. \"I fully expect that indie docs will not survive contact with the enemy once you have to compete in a commercial market,\" Gonzalez said. \"But let the competition begin.\"\nCPB declined NPR's request for comment and PBS did not respond.\nLooking elsewhere\nGiven the realities of the marketplace, some documentarians are working to attract more funding from traditional sources such as corporations, foundations and individual donors.\n\"Maybe this is the opportunity to create a much larger fund specifically for Black stories that is not hampered by the whims of the political movement at the time,\" said Leslie Fields-Cruz, the executive director of Black Public Media. The non-profit supports Black-themed stories by indie filmmakers, such as the Oscar-nominated I Am Not Your Negro from 2016 and the Emmy-winning 2021 film When Claude Got Shot. Fields-Cruz told NPR almost half of her non-profit's budget got wiped out with the federal cuts. \"We're here in what I'm calling the worst case scenario,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, some groups, such as the International Documentary Association (IDA), are working to recoup some of the lost federal funds. \" IDA is trying to pursue more strategic litigation to see how we can get the support to challenge some of the actions that have been taken at the federal level,\" said Dominic Willsdon, the IDA's executive director.\nMourning the loss\nUnderpinning all of this new strategizing is a tremendous sense of grief.\n\" Removing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting out of the media landscape means the world becomes much more impoverished, and the stories that get told will be much more anodyne,\" said Robb Moss, a documentary filmmaker and professor in Harvard University's department of art, film and visual studies.\nOscar-winning filmmaker Errol Morris described the loss of federal support for documentaries as a major blow to free speech. \"Worrisome to anybody who values an independent media, who values the First Amendment, who values freedom of expression,\" the Fog of War and The Thin Blue Line director said. \"The pursuit of truth is not a political issue. It's a moral imperative that's now being questioned daily.\"\nNPR has also received funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

{"title": "What's behind the Trump administration's immigration memes?", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2025/08/18/nx-s1-5482921/memes-white-house-dhs-social-media-trump", "text": "What's behind the Trump administration's immigration memes?\nLast month, the White House X account posted an illustration of President Trump looking determined, framed by eagles, fireworks, the American flag and a cloud of cash.\n\"Six months in. All gas. No brakes. The winning will continue. The deportations will continue. The memes will continue,\" the post read.\nAnd the memes have continued, as has the controversy that inevitably follows. The White House's X account, as well as that of the Department of Homeland Security, have for months been posting a steady stream of content celebrating the administration, especially its aggressive immigration crackdown, often framed as ironic comedy. The posts illustrate the Trump administration's project of redefining who belongs in the United States, and promote its policies.\nIn recent weeks, many posts have highlighted DHS's push to hire more Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, as well as the agency's vision of the homeland. They range from World War II-style recruitment posters to artwork evoking nostalgic versions of America's past, such as an 1872 painting that positively depicts white settlers displacing Native Americans.\nThe accounts also periodically post videos in the style of viral internet trends. One from February includes footage of immigrants boarding planes with handcuffs and chains rattling, captioned \"ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight,\" referring to a genre of videos featuring sounds meant to evoke a calming and pleasant experience.\nThe posts are deeply polarizing: popular among a swath of Trump fans who share them and comment favorably, while generating outcry from critics who object to their tone and content.\nThis approach \"speaks to the people who enjoy the irreverence, who enjoy the cruelty, who enjoy the 'owning the libs,'\" said Ryan Milner, a professor of communication at the College of Charleston who studies Internet culture. \"Especially how it causes people to freak out and cry foul. I think that's part of the point with these.\"\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson didn't directly respond to NPR's questions for this story. She sent an emailed statement saying: \"The White House consistently posts banger memes,\" and went on to mock NPR.\nIn response to NPR's questions about the agency's social media posts, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin called the inquiry \"deranged and delusional.\" She continued: \"If the media needs a history lesson on the brave men and women who blazed the trails, forded the rivers, and forged this Republic from the sweat of their brow, we are happy to send them a history textbook.\"\nShe added, \"This administration is unapologetically proud of American history and American heritage. Get used to it.\"\n'Protect. Serve. Deport.'\nAs DHS steps up its campaign to hire some 10,000 new ICE agents, fueled by a budget influx from Trump's tax cut and spending bill, the agency's social media accounts have been flush with recruitment imagery. It's a mix of retro-style Uncle Sam posters, patriotic-themed art and videos of armed agents carrying out raids.\nThe blend of nostalgia, aggression and calls to \"Save America,\" \"Secure the Golden Age\" and \"Protect. Serve. Deport.\" evoke a nationalist, white-centered view of who the American homeland is for, said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.\nThe images conjure a narrative that \"we had a wonderful white civilization and culture that has been decimated by these people who don't belong here, who just happen to not be white people for the most part,\" Beirich said. They contribute to the idea that \"those people are violent invaders who need to be repelled by military force, need to be dragged in the streets, taken away, put in vans, removed — if we want that white culture to ever flourish again,\" she said.\nShe added that with posts like these, DHS is \"just saying the quiet part out loud, and it's the sort of baldness of doing it that's amazing to me.\"\nAfter DHS posted John Gast's 1872 painting \"American Progress\" in late July with the caption \"A Heritage to be proud of, a Homeland worth Defending,\" the Autry Museum of the American West in Los Angeles, where the original painting is displayed, was flooded with inquiries.\n\"American Progress\" gives an \"idealized presentation\" of American westward expansion in the post-Civil War era that erases conflict and violence, said Stephen Aron, the museum's director, president and CEO. The painting has become known as a depiction of the 19th-century concept of \"manifest destiny,\" the belief that white settlers were destined by God to expand across the North American continent. It was originally intended to be widely reproduced in guidebooks promoting westward migration.\nIn Aron's description, the painting shows Native Americans and bison \"peacefully mak[ing] way\" as a \"parade of white pioneer types move across the continent.\" They are led by a large, floating blonde female figure in a white gown, with a school book in one hand and telegraph wire in the other, as \"a symbol of civilizing progress.\"\n\"This is a whitening vision of the West,\" Aron said.\nAt the Autry Museum, pieces by Native American artists are displayed facing the Gast painting and others like it, serving, in Aron's words, as \"a reminder of who was here first — whose heritage, whose homeland.\"\nBeirich said it is disturbing that DHS is celebrating a racist depiction of western expansion. \"The fact that they're using that as a way to inspire people to sign on to become ICE agents is very troubling, because the whole thing is framed as 'white people need to reclaim their territory,'\" Beirich said.\nOther DHS posts have been criticized for seeming to reference extremist and neo-Nazi material. A recent image of Uncle Sam at a crossroads is captioned \"Which way, American man?\" The phrase is similar to a meme sometimes used by right-wing accounts that borrows the title of the 1978 book \"Which Way Western Man?\" by white nationalist William Gayley Simpson. The book, which was published by a neo-Nazi group, argues Hitler was right and advocates violence against Jews.\n\"You don't usually see white supremacist propaganda on government websites, but that's what this really is,\" Beirich said.\nWhen asked whether the DHS post was referencing the book \"Which Way Western Man?\" McLaughlin said in a statement: \"Calling everything you dislike 'Nazi propaganda' is tiresome. Uncle Sam, who represents America, is at a crossroads, pondering which way America should go.\"\nMcLaughlin did not respond to NPR's additional question about how DHS intends the white-centric imagery it posts to be interpreted.\nA handful of DHS recruitment-themed posts make overt references to the Bible and Christianity, presenting policing the border as a battle between good and evil.\nOne video posted in late July shows helmeted and heavily armed border agents dressed in military fatigues overlaid with sound from the opening monologue of the 2022 film The Batman. A Bible verse appears on the screen: \"'THE WICKED FLEE WHEN NO MAN PURSUETH; BUT THE RIGHTEOUS ARE BOLD AS A LION.' —PROVERBS 28:1.\"\nThe post's caption is addressed \"TO EVERY CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIEN IN AMERICA\" and reads: \"Darkness is no longer your ally. You represent an existential threat to the citizens of the United States, and US Border Patrol's Special Operations Group will stop at nothing to hunt you down.\"\nSuch videos tie into Christian nationalist ideas and have \"a very Crusades feeling,\" Beirich said. \"It taps into deep emotional feelings among some parts of the Christian community. And I'm assuming that's what they're trying to get at.\"\n'oMg, diD tHe wHiTE hOuSE reALLy PosT tHiS?'\nThe DHS posts are just the latest phase of the Trump administration's embrace of inflammatory content and viral memes.\nIn late March, the White House posted an AI-generated depiction of a Dominican woman crying during her arrest by immigration officers, rendered in the playful animation style of Hayao Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli, the makers of \"Spirited Away\" and \"My Neighbor Totoro.\"\nAfter online backlash about the post, White House deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr wrote on X that Americans should be upset by the woman's previous conviction for trafficking fentanyl, not the anime-style post. \"The arrests will continue. The memes will continue,\" he wrote, using what has become a White House tagline.\n\"This trolling is an active strategy,\" said Roland Meyer, a professor of digital cultures and arts at the University of Zurich and Zurich University of the Arts in Switzerland who has been analyzing the images shared by Trump administration accounts. He described the posts as a demonstration of state power that serve to normalize the administration's aggressive approach towards immigrants, as well as \"making fun [of] and trolling those who oppose it.\"\n\"They have the power to define who is visible, who is not, what is acceptable and what is not,\" Meyer said. \"They also kind of control the discourse, and also anticipate the reaction to their postings.\"\nThe inflammatory tone and style of the posts derives from internet humor that was developed in the 2000s and 2010s on places like Reddit and 4chan, Meyer and Milner said. A core component of that brand of humor is attempting to generate outrage from the left.\nWhite House staffer Dorr's own profile on X includes a banner that reads, \"oMg, diD tHe wHiTE hOuSE reALLy PosT tHiS?\" in the mixed case font used online to signify mockery.\n\"Attention is the currency. It's clicks, it's views, it's shares,\" Milner said. \"It doesn't matter if somebody is arguing with you in the comments or if somebody is supporting you in the comments. If you have comments, if you have shares, if you have likes, if you have coverage from NPR, that's all good.\"\nBy posting images like the Ghiblified arrest, the administration's accounts are participating in a trend of making and sharing AI-generated images that blend pop culture with real-world news events. Trump also frequently posted AI-generated content on his social media channels during the 2024 campaign.\nSince January, the White House X account, as well as Trump's Truth Social feed, has continued the habit, sharing apparently AI-generated renderings of the president in a crown on the cover of Time Magazine, in papal robes, striding through the Colosseum and as Superman.\nIt's often not clear whether the images the administration's accounts share were created by the staffers who run the White House and DHS accounts.\nMilner said the administration's use of art and images reminds him of \"agitprop\" — a portmanteau for agitation and propaganda that was a hallmark of the Soviet Union's communication strategy.\n\"The goal is to create a sense of culture, to create a sense of ideology and affiliation to that ideology with the art and culture that you're putting out,\" Milner said.\nArtists speak out about use of their work\nSome artists have pushed back on Trump administration posts that use their work without their permission.\nThe British pop artist Jess Glynne, whose song is featured in a viral TikTok trend that pairs audio from a British airline ad promoting a \"Jet2 holiday\" with video of vacation mishaps, took to Instagram to denounce a White House video that used the audio.\nThe White House's version, posted to X and Instagram, overlaid the soundtrack from the travel ad on footage of immigrants boarding a deportation flight, with the caption \"When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation.\"\n\"This post honestly makes me sick,\" Glynne wrote. \"My music is about love, unity and spreading positivity — never about division or hate.\" The White House video's audio is now disabled on Instagram.\nThe band Black Rebel Motorcycle Club took action after its rendition of the song \"God's Gonna Cut You Down\" was featured in one of DHS's religion-themed recruitment videos last month without the band's permission.\nThe band posted an open letter to DHS on its social media channels calling for the video to be taken down. \"It's obvious that you don't respect Copyright Law and Artist Rights any more than you respect Habeas Corpus and Due Process rights, not to mention the separation of Church and State per the US Constitution,\" the post read.\n\"For the record, we hereby order @dhsgov to cease and desist the use of our recording and demand that you immediately pull down your video. Oh, and go f… yourselves,\" the post concluded.\nOn X, the post now says the video \"has been disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner.\" The video still appears on Instagram but without any audio. Another DHS video using a Jay-Z song has also been disabled on X due to a copyright claim.\nAfter the DHS account posted a painting of a white couple in a covered wagon cradling an infant with the caption, \"Remember your Homeland's Heritage,\" the artist, Morgan Weistling, posted a statement that temporarily appeared on his website noting that the agency had used his painting without his permission. In addition, the Kinkade Family Foundation disavowed DHS's use of a painting by Thomas Kinkade, who died in 2012.\nAttacks on media\nThe Trump administration also uses social media as an avenue for criticizing news coverage it dislikes. The DHS X account labels articles the agency disagrees with as \"FAKE NEWS\" and slams what it calls \"false sob stories\" about the administration's immigration policies. White House communications staff frequently rebuke specific news outlets on their social media accounts.\nAfter a Washington Post article referred to DHS posting an \"explicitly racist painting\" in reference to \"American Progress,\" McLaughlin wrote on X, \"Uh oh— The @washingtonpost must have fallen asleep during their Art History course!\" and added, \"It is one of the most historically significant paintings of its era.\"\nWhite House officials have also taken to pointing out publicly available political donations to Democrats made by sources quoted in news coverage in an apparent effort to discredit them as partisan.\nLast month, White House communications director Steven Cheung criticized a different Washington Post story that quoted a drone warfare expert about the vulnerability of the U.S. to drone strikes. \"The 'expert' they cite throughout the story is a major Democrat donor and longtime sufferer of Trump Derangement Syndrome,\" Cheung wrote on X, posting a screenshot of Federal Election Commission records of the individual's political contributions.\nWhite House spokesperson Jackson used the same tactic ahead of publication of this article. After learning that Milner, the College of Charleston professor, would be quoted, Jackson pointed out that public records show that seven years ago he made two donations totaling $30 to ActBlue, which fundraises for Democrats.\n\"In addition to noting that this so-called expert is a Dem donor, here is a statement from me,\" Jackson wrote in her email sharing the White House's comment for this story.\nMillions of Americans donate to political candidates each cycle. Approximately 15.6 million people donated to congressional and presidential races in 2020, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan research organization that tracks money in U.S. politics.\nMilner told NPR the White House's comment about him made him \"chuckle a little bit\" given the small amount he gave several years ago in support of a Democratic congressional candidate.\n\"I've never been to a fundraising gala or bought a plate anywhere or done much except for ignore a lot of text messages from people asking for more small donations,\" Milner said.\nBy labeling someone who gave a trivial donation as a \"Dem donor,\" he said the White House can wave off critiques without addressing their substance.\nMilner sees the Trump administration's interactions with news media as \"steeped in what we used to call 'lulz' — this kind of trollish online antagonism, this gleeful laughter at somebody else's expense.\"\nTo Milner, the gravest potential consequences of the administration's tactic of highlighting past donations of people who speak to journalists is that it chills dissent.\n\"Whether it's an explicit goal or not, there is a potential to silence people, to make people think twice before they speak up with critiques of the administration because they're going to be named and shamed,\" Milner said. \"And there's an online troll army waiting to act on that.\"", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 05:48:28 -0400", "author": "Jude Joffe-Block", "source": "https://feeds.npr.org/1014/rss.xml"}

Hours earlier, he said that if Ukraine and Russia can meet for trilateral talks with the U.S., there's a \"reasonable chance\" of ending the war.\n\"We're going to work with everybody, and we're going to make sure that if there's peace, the peace is going to stay a long time,\" Trump said.\nSecurity guarantees were a key focus of talks\nA key issue heading into the day was what kind of security guarantees Ukraine could secure from Western allies to prevent Russia from invading again.\n\"There'll be a lot of help when it comes to security,\" Trump said, noting that the U.S. would assist by selling weapons to Ukraine and other allies in Europe, rather than provide direct aid.\nBut Trump sidestepped questions from reporters when pressed on whether U.S. troops would be involved in security agreements.\nEuropean countries would be the \"first line of defense\" in maintaining peace in the region, he said, before adding that the U.S. would \"help them out.\"\nThe talks followed last week's summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, negotiations that concluded with the two leaders touting progress despite any tangible breakthroughs.\nFor Zelenskyy, Monday's meeting marked his first trip back to the Oval Office since a contentious meeting in February, when the Ukrainian leader was lectured by Trump and Vice President JD Vance before abruptly leaving the White House. The leaders have met and talked multiple times since then — including at the Vatican.\nThe tone was markedly different on Monday, as Zelenskyy generously thanked Trump ahead of a wider meeting between the two leaders and top European officials.\n\"Thank you very much for your efforts, personal efforts, to stop killings and stop this war,\" Zelenskyy said.\nTrump said he would speak with Putin over the phone after meeting with Zelenskyy, who agreed to the potential trilateral meeting.\nTrump said it was an honor to host Zelenskyy and that \"substantial progress\" was being made on efforts to end the war.\nKey European leaders attended with Zelenskyy\nMonday's talks featured an unusually long list of European leaders, in what was seen as a united front to prevent Trump from pressuring Zelenskyy into an unfair agreement to end the war with Russia.\nJoining the Ukrainian leader was British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and the president of Finland, Alexander Stubb.\nAfter the Alaska summit, European leaders wanted to weigh in on Trump's suggestions of a \"land swap\" — something that Zelenskyy has already said he opposes — and security guarantees to prevent Russia from invading again.\nAt the meeting between European leaders, Trump and Zelenskyy, it was mostly Trump who made mention of land swaps.\nTrump said Ukraine and Russia needed to discuss \"the possible exchanges of territory, taking into consideration the current line of contact. That means, the war zone.\"\nZelenskyy said that in his individual meeting with Trump, the two leaders discussed security guarantees for Ukraine and the issue of human rights. The security of Ukraine, Zelenskyy said, depends on the U.S. and European allies.\n\"We had constructive, specific meeting … we are happy we have such big unity today,\" Zelenskyy said.\nLoading...\nEuropean leaders sought to strike a tone of optimism, as they stressed the importance of collective action.\n\"I think, if we play this well, we could end this,\" said Rutte, the NATO secretary general. \"The fact that you have said, 'I'm willing to participate in the security guarantees' is a big step, is really a breakthrough, and it makes all the difference.\"\nOther European leaders echoed the sentiment.\n\"You can count on us as we count on you,\" Macron said.\nNone of them, however, made any mention of the territorial lines of Ukraine and Russia that Trump has suggested be redrawn.\nTrump's shift on a ceasefire\nZelenskyy returned to Washington amid new questions about Trump's positions on the war, which shifted after he met with Putin. Prior to the Alaska summit, Trump had said he wanted a ceasefire and threatened consequences for Russia if the fighting didn't end.\nBut now Trump is advocating against a ceasefire and pushing for a full peace agreement, which is Putin's preferred position — and he has said he sees no immediate need for new sanctions.\nSome European leaders were vocal about a need for a ceasefire during Monday's meeting, though.\nGerman Chancellor Merz emphasized that negotiations between Ukraine and Russia would be complicated, and urged Trump to push for a ceasefire.\n\"Let's try to put pressure on Russia, because the credibility of these efforts, these efforts we are undertaking today are depending on at least a ceasefire from the beginning of the serious negotiations,\" Merz said.\nMacron pushed for a ceasefire, as well.\n\"Your idea to ask for a truce, or at least to stop the killings, as we discussed, is a necessity, and we all support this idea,\" Macron said.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 05:21:35 -0400", "author": "Franco Ordoñez", "source": "https://feeds.npr.org/1014/rss.xml"}

That said, while our home rule is limited, we still have rights as American citizens, and we still have powers of local self-government.\nThat follows the mayor's criticism of President Trump's moves as an authoritarian push. Last week, a think tank that studies authoritarianism happened to be holding a conference here. NPR's Frank Langfitt went to find out how experts are thinking about events in D.C.\nFRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Sabina Cudic is a former political scientist who serves in the Bosnian Parliament. She attended the conference held by a new think tank. It's called the Institute for the Study of Modern Authoritarianism. Now, during her visit, Cudic went to Washington's Union Station, and she saw military Humvees parked outside.\nSABINA CUDIC: For those of us who lived through wars and siege and occupation and so on, these scenes are triggering. They're not triggering just on the visual sense, but they're triggering in a kind of conceptual sense that, A, how quickly things escalate, B - and probably more devastatingly so - how quickly they're normalized.\nLANGFITT: Damon Linker teaches political science at the University of Pennsylvania. He also attended the conference, which drew center-left and center-right thinkers, as well as libertarians. Linker believes Trump's moves are not about crime but power.\nDAMON LINKER: Trump is a kind of political genius at finding wedge issues that will make Democrats squirm. So his idea is to say crime is terrible in the nation's capital. The federal government runs the nation's capital. So I have a very easy way to take it over and make a show of force.\nLANGFITT: Trump insists he's deployed forces - including FBI and DEA agents - to protect the people of Washington. He also says he wants to spruce up the city.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: What we want to do is make Washington, D.C. the greatest, most beautiful, safest capital anywhere in the world. And that's going to happen.\nLANGFITT: Under pressure from a federal judge, the Justice Department said Friday that Washington's police chief will retain control of the city's force.\nThe conference here was called liberalism for the 21st century. Trump's second term was a constant theme. Alexander Sikorski started a foundation in Poland that helps young people get into public service. He spoke on a panel called practical strategies for resisting authoritarianism. Sikorski says he recognizes the president's tactics from elsewhere.\nALEXANDER SIKORSKI: Looking at it from a kind of perspective of someone who's worked in dictatorships and has worked in declining democracies, what strikes me about this deployment is not that it's being used to combat a particular crisis or event but that it is a communication exercise.\nLANGFITT: Sikorski says the president's message is clear.\nSIKORSKI: Crime rates under Democratic leaders have soared and that it requires the strong arm of President Trump and his administration to quiet that.\nLANGFITT: Sikorski, who's worked in Mongolia and the country of Georgia, suspects there may be another reason to deploy troops.\nSIKORSKI: It normalizes the presence of soldiers on American streets so that if Trump were to lose another election, the deployment of those troops would not appear so strange anymore.\nLANGFITT: The Constitution bars Trump from running a third time, but midterms are next year. Trump says Washington is in the grip of a crime wave. U.S. Justice Department statistics show that violent crime actually dropped to a 30-year low last year. Although, people in some of the city's most dangerous neighborhoods say crime is still way too high.\nNot everyone at the conference opposed the president's actions. John Dickerson, a retiree, drove up from Jacksonville, Florida, to attend.\nJOHN DICKERSON: In my visits over the years to Washington, D.C., it's gone from being a very pristine, beautiful city - a capital of my country that I can be very proud of - it's degenerated over time. Whether it's tent cities or homeless on the streets or it's just seems to me that it's gone downhill. And so I've got no problems whatsoever with President Trump trying to solve that problem. Whether he can or not, it's a different story.\nLANGFITT: Dickerson said now that Trump has taken over law enforcement in Washington, he owns the issue. And Dickerson says he hopes the president succeeds.\nFrank Langfitt, NPR News, Washington.\nCopyright © 2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

Adams confirmed on Monday that 14 victims have now been identified, including three fatalities.\nAdams told Fox News Digital that his announcement on Monday had no correlation to President Donald Trump's ongoing crime crackdown in Washington, D.C.\nNYC MAYOR WARNS PROTESTERS AGAINST SABOTAGING ICE RAIDS, VOWS NYPD WILL PROTECT FEDERAL AGENTS\nTrump moved to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department last week, sending hundreds of National Guard troops and federal agents to Washington, D.C., to fight crime and \"beautify\" the city.\n\"As we indicated over and over again, we got this,\" Adams said of New York City's ability to fight crime without the federal government's involvement. \"Our numbers speak for themselves.\"\nBLUE CITY MAYOR VOWS 'NO TOLERANCE' FOR ANTI-ICE VIOLENCE AS LA RIOTS ERUPT: 'UNACCEPTABLE'\nThe NYPD touted record-low shootings and murders during the first five months of the year, calling May the \"safest in recorded history for shootings and murders.\"\nDespite those statistics, a Midtown Manhattan shooting shocked the city last month when four people were killed.\nAdams said on Monday that New York City does need \"assistance on the federal level to deal with the flow of illegal guns onto our streets.\"\nAnd he lamented that when a \"person who drives across the country and creates havoc with an illegal gun,\" like the suspect in the Midtown shooting, it \"really hurts these inner cities.\"\nBut Adams remained confident, telling Fox News Digital that, \"Our numbers are clear. We're willing to share what we're doing successfully here with other cities, and we've done that before.\"\nThe mayor, who is running for re-election as an independent candidate, said the city knows how to collaborate with federal authorities and \"New Yorkers are handling the crime crisis.\"\n\"We are an example of what all cities can do, but we're not responding to some of the things that we're reading about this,\" Adams said, referencing Trump's crime crackdown in the nation's capital.\nThe NYPD launched its Quality of Life Division, or Q-Teams, on April 14. Adams and NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said those teams have made \"significant improvements to New Yorkers' quality-of-life concerns.\"\nSeveral Staten Islanders who attended Monday morning's announcement confronted Adams with complaints about their quality of life.\nOne woman told Adams that the floors in her apartment building had not been mopped, the garbage had not been picked up, elevators did not work, and she did not have hot water in her building on Monday morning.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAdams told the residents to form a tenants' association and promised to set up a meeting with them to discuss the issues impacting their community.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:25:35 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://moxie.foxnews.com/google-publisher/politics.xml"}

Trump fired Grace, withdrew Habba's nomination as permanent U.S. attorney and then reinstated Habba as acting U.S. attorney, which keeps Habba in charge for at least another 210 days under federal statute.\nTRUMP STANDS BY ALINA HABBA AS DOJ CLASHES WITH JUDGES OVER HER REPLACEMENT\n\"It goes completely against what the statute is meant to protect,\" Giraud's attorney argued in court on Friday, according to the New Jersey Monitor.\nThe DOJ argued that the president and Attorney General Pam Bondi followed all the proper protocols under federal vacancy laws to keep Habba in charge.\n\"The Girauds invent a requirement that, to serve as an ‘Acting officer’… one must already be the first assistant to that office when the vacancy arises,\" DOJ attorneys wrote in court papers. \"That is dead wrong textually; it makes no sense practically; and it relies on a mistaken premise.\"\nThe case comes as Trump has also made similar unconventional maneuvers in other blue states, including California and New York, because, like Habba, his appointees for those states have no clear path to Senate confirmation.\nLawmakers and outside groups have also weighed in on Habba's appointment. The Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey said in an amicus brief ahead of the hearing that Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi violated the appointments clause of the Constitution with their \"novel\" orders on Habba.\n\"To circumvent the laws that Congress passed to govern the appointment of U.S. Attorneys, the Attorney General did something unprecedented,\" the group wrote.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThey laid out how Bondi made Habba a \"special attorney\" before designating her as the office's \"first assistant,\" the position previously held by Grace, which Bondi maintains allows her to deem Habba the acting U.S. attorney under the federal vacancy laws.\n\"To our knowledge, no prior Attorney General has ever attempted this,\" the group said.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:23:50 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://moxie.foxnews.com/google-publisher/politics.xml"}

The project's reach has extended to various state and federal courts, including powerful appellate courts, and comes as multiple cities and states pursue high-profile litigation against the oil industry.\nUN COURT RULES WEALTHY NATIONS PAY UP FOR CLIMATE CHANGE DAMAGES IN CONTROVERSIAL GLOBAL RULING\nA Fox News Digital review in December shows that several CJP expert lawyers and judges have close ties to the curriculum and are deeply involved in climate litigation, while the group attempted to distance itself at the time, saying, \"CJP doesn’t participate in litigation, support or coordinate with any parties in litigation, or advise judges on how they should rule in any case.\"\nPower the Future included FOIA requests in the letter, which the group says shows coordination between judges and ELI's network.\n\"For example, several records obtained under FOIA, enclosed herein, reference the involvement of Judge David Tatel, who served for nearly 30 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit until 2022,\" the letter says. \"One February 2021 email from a plaintiff’s witness who ELI arranged to serially brief judges on ‘climate’ litigation, Dr. Don Wuebbles, references 'the kind of issues that Judge Tatel raised towards counteracting arguments from nonbelievers' in catastrophic man-made global warming.\"\nWuebbles hit back against claims there were \"cozy ties\" between judges and climate activists in comments to Fox News Digital, calling the Power the Future letter a \"highly distorted look at what we do as scientists,\" while defending that he is a \"PhD atmospheric scientist and professor…,\" not an \"activist.\"\nWuebbles did explain that he has helped \"educate judges on the science of climate change\" when asked by the courts across his career.\n\"Those meetings were very professional and just about the state of the science,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"If a senator, other politicians, or anyone with biases about the state of the climate cannot handle the truth, that is their problem. But the truth should still come out for all Americans to be aware of, including judges and the courts. As part of this, the misinformation of contrarians needs to be responded to by responses demonstrating the real state of the science and what the actual measurements and scientific analyses really show us — that is what we do as scientists. As someone with high moral standards, I could add much more, but I will leave it there.\"\nCLIMATE LAWFARE CAMPAIGN DEALT BLOW IN SOUTH CAROLINA\nThe letter to the DOJ included other FOIA'd emails, including one dated March 23, 2021, that was sent by CJP founder Paul Hanle to \"a serial presenter, plaintiff’s expert witness Dr. Ben Santer\" regarding presenting a climate science lecture to more than 100 judges.\n\"In another email, dated March 23, 2021, from ELI’s Paul Hanle to a serial presenter, plaintiff’s expert witness Dr. Ben Santer — also a member of the board of the activist Union of Concerned Scientists, which was an original organizer of the climate litigation campaign — Hanle describes ELI as working ‘through the auspices of the National Judicial College, with which our project is partnering,'\" the letter to the DOJ reads. \"Hanle later thanked Santer for Santer’s presentation ‘to a large group of judges — perhaps one to two hundred,’ stating, in relevant part, ‘I would venture you convinced many who did not know before that the science has moved far and fast and the scientific case is underpinned by very strong evidence.’ Hanle added, ‘Your approach is very effective with judges.’\"\nWhile another email, sent by an ELI official to both Hanle and Santer, the official says, \"that [the judge] connected this material to her own docket …[is] [j]ust what we want to see!\"\n\"You certainly had an impact on her,\" Hanle said.\nSanter told Fox News Digital in an emailed comment Monday when asked about the correspondence that his job is to \"improve scientific and public understanding of the nature, causes, and impacts of climate change.\"\n\"I've done this job for over 35 years, through my research in ‘climate fingerprinting’ and through public lecturing to a variety of different audiences. Judges are one of those audiences, along with professional societies, Rotary Clubs, universities, schools, and conservative organizations like the Pacific Club, Jonathan Club, and Bohemian Grove,\" he wrote.\n\"As of today, U.S. climate scientists still have the freedom to educate U.S. citizens on the reality and seriousness of climate change. I cherish that freedom. While it still exists, I intend to continue serving as a ‘serial presenter’ on climate science,\" he continued.\nWhen approached for comment on the matter, FJC's Deputy Director Clara Altman said it had not worked with ELI since 2020, after holding a series of seminars in coordination with the group the year prior.\n\"The Federal Judicial Center conducted a series of small one-day seminars with the Environmental Law Institute for fewer than 100 judges in total in 2019 and early 2020. The Federal Judicial Center has not done any programs with ELI since. In all its programs, the Center strives to present content objectively and from a range of views,\" Altman said, adding that FJC is not affiliated with NJC.\nFox News Digital reported in July that CJP organized a years-long, nationwide online forum with jurists to promote favorable information and litigation updates regarding climate issues — until the email-styled group chat was abruptly made private last year. The listserv was established after CJP coordinated with the National Judicial College to establish its first cohort of judges who took part in a \"Judicial Leaders in Climate Science\" program in 2022.\nThe listserv, which included at least five judges from across the nation and CJP leaders, was active from September 2022 to May 2024, and facilitated correspondence between the group's members as they traded links on climate studies, congratulated one another on hosting recent environmental events, shared updates on recent climate cases that were remanded to state courts and encouraged participation in other CJP meet-ups.\nIn one message, for example, a Delaware judge shared a YouTube video of a 2022 climate presentation delivered by a Delaware official and a Columbia University professor that focused on the onslaught of climate lawsuits since the mid-2000s. The video included claims that those lawsuits could one day bankrupt the fuel industry.\nThe judge stipulated in his message to the group when sharing the link: \"Because the link is of a judicial event that is otherwise not public, please do not forward or use without checking with me. I suspect that goes without saying, but the powers that be will be happier that I said it.\"\nUNEARTHED CHAT SHEDS LIGHT ON COZY TIES BETWEEN JUDGES, CLIMATE ACTIVISTS, RAISING ETHICAL CONCERNS\nA handful of other judges responded to the judge's video and message, praising it as \"great work.\"\nCJP, in a comment to Fox Digital at the time, defended the listserv as one to help members of its Judicial Leaders in Climate Science program communicate and network with one another for the duration of the program. The one-year program, established by CJP in coordination with the National Judicial College, \"trains state court judges on judicial leadership skills integrated with consensus climate science and how it is arising in the law,\" the group told Fox News Digital.\nFollowing Fox News Digital's reporting on the listserv, CJP's website received a facelift that included removing one of the judge's names and his favorable testimony of the group's work and anonymized the names of other judges who praised CJP as an \"essential\" resource for jurists.\n\"Judges are encouraged, and many required, to participate in continuing education on topics relevant to emerging trends in the law — including those related to science. Recent changes to CJP's website were made to protect privacy and prevent baseless criticism and harassment,\" the spokesperson told Fox News Digital in August when asked about the website revamp.\nWhen asked about Power the Future's letter, a spokesperson for ELI underscored the group is \"a non-partisan organization that has been operating for over 50 years. ELI educates professionals and the public, provides objective data and analysis, and convenes diverse groups of leaders to solve problems.\"\n\"The programs in which CJP participates are no different than other judicial education programs, providing evidence-based training on legal and scientific topics that judges voluntarily choose to attend,\" the spokesperson continued. \"CJP does not participate in litigation, provide support for or coordinate with any parties in litigation, or advise judges on how they should rule in any case.\"\nNews of CJP’s outreach comes as the U.S. has seen a sharp uptick in climate-related lawsuits in recent years — including cases targeting oil giants Shell, BP and ExxonMobil for allegedly using \"deceptive\" marketing and downplaying the risks of climate change. Lawsuits have also been brought against state governments and federal agencies, including the Interior Department, for allegedly failing to address pollution risks or protect against the harms of climate change, according to the plaintiffs.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nConservative lawmakers have meanwhile put CJP under the public's microscope for alleged \"lawfare,\" most notably Sen. Ted Cruz, who said during a Senate subcommittee hearing in June that there is a \"systematic campaign\" launched by the Chinese Communist Party and American left-wing activists to weaponize the court systems to \"undermine American energy dominance.\"\nCJP, Cruz said, is a pivotal player in the \"lawfare\" as it works to secure \"judicial capture.\"\nJudicial communications with climate activists over litigation and environmental issues date back years. In 2019, a federal judge hit \"reply all\" to an email chain with 45 other judges and court staff about an invitation to a climate seminar hosted by the Environmental Law Institute. Colleagues later chastised the judge for sharing \"this nonsense\" and suggested it was an ethics violation, though others defended the judge’s decision, saying flagging the event was not unethical.\nFox News Digital also reached out to NJC, DOJ and Tatel for comment.\nFox News Digital's Breanne Deppisch contributed to this report.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:58:03 -0400", "author": null, "source": "https://moxie.foxnews.com/google-publisher/politics.xml"}

That is the conservative think tank that published Project 2025, widely seen as the blueprint for many of Trump's recent actions, like cracking down on immigration, gutting the federal workforce and ending funding for public media, among other things. More recently, Trump picked The Heritage Foundation's chief economist to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The appointment surprised many people because the BLS is traditionally nonpartisan agency or seen as one. We wanted to learn more about this influential group and its relationship to President Trump, so we called up E.J. Fagan. He's a political science professor at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and author of \"The Thinkers: The Rise Of Partisan Think Tanks And The Polarization Of American Politics.\" Welcome to the show.\nEJ FAGAN: Thanks for having me on.\nDETROW: Before we get to everything that's happening right now, is there one specific moment you could point to where The Heritage Foundation starts to make the shift from a Mitt Romney/George W. Bush-style conservative organization to fully embracing the current MAGA Republican Trump-era party?\nFAGAN: I can. Although I'd say, you know, I don't think they ever were truly on the George W. Bush/Mitt Romney side.\nDETROW: Yeah.\nFAGAN: I think it was the Newt Gingrich/Ronald Reagan side...\nDETROW: Sure.\nFAGAN: ...What you'd point to, and they very often were on the outs with certain types of Republicans. Republican Party is a coalition, and they were a piece of that coalition. But I think the moment that you see this real shift, there's a leadership transition in 2013, when kind of the old guard of The Heritage Foundation that had founded it, their president Ed Feulner - who recently died - leaves, retires, and Jim DeMint, Republican senator, actually retires from the Senate in order to take a very large salary to be the new president of The Heritage Foundation. And you see this rapid shift from that organization kind of beginning at that point.\nDETROW: Yeah. So what's the best way to think about the relationship right now between Heritage and the Trump administration? So much focus was made of Project 2025. But what's the way to think about how they're interacting with each other? Who's taking cues from who?\nFAGAN: Sure. I think that The Heritage Foundation is playing a role for Donald Trump in that his first administration was staffed by kind of the coalition of the Republican Party - a lot of people who had worked in previous Republican administrations who were, you know, pretty well-qualified for their jobs and some people from Heritage's side of the Republican Party. And that was very normal for a Republican Party administration. And what Heritage did with Project 2025 is they organized a Trump administration that could just elbow out pretty much the entire other side of the party, the Mitt Romney side of the party, the George W. Bush side of the party.\nDETROW: Like, what's the chicken-and-egg way to think about this? Was this Heritage seeing what Trump's inner orbit wanted to do and putting policy scaffolding around it, or was it suggesting, like, if you get back in office, start here, here's some ideas?\nFAGAN: I think there's less policy scaffolding than Heritage would want you to believe right now. The bargain that Heritage has been making, really since about 2022 or so, is that they're willing to be the lowest common denominator, right? They're willing to be the organization that enables a more authoritarian Republican Party.\nDETROW: What's one or two specific examples you would point to?\nFAGAN: Sure. I mean, if you read Project 2025, I mean, it's arguing for the complete abolishing of, you know, whole cabinet departments. It's arguing for - it's employing people who were at January 6. It is just - as somebody who's read a lot of Heritage Foundation reports over the decades, I mean, it really becomes much more of an advocacy group, right? You start seeing much more op-eds about radical change. For example, in 2017, 2018, they're not publishing things that are pro-tariff. E.J. Antoni, who is the BLS commissioner nominee from The Heritage Foundation...\nDETROW: Yeah.\nFAGAN: ...He's publishing what are essentially blog posts praising Donald Trump, calling him a genius for tariffs, right? That's a real shift, and it's a shift away from what we traditionally think of a Ronald Reagan conservatism at Heritage.\nDETROW: Yeah. Let's talk about him for a moment. We noted this in the intro. You just noted it now. He has now been tapped to take over the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There is an opening because President Trump fired the head of BLS because he did not like the monthly economic data that was published by BLS, which raised a lot of alarms because this is supposed to be nonpartisan data that we can all trust, and Trump is signaling he doesn't want it to be that. How are you thinking about this nomination given the context of how it happened?\nFAGAN: Antoni is incredibly unqualified for that job. I mean, I think it's a sign of the decline of Heritage that they couldn't find somebody better. BLS is a real job, right? This is - the BLS commissioner is responsible for gathering data. I mean, this is not a traditional highly political position for a reason. I think he's going to be a disaster over there. It's already an understaffed department, a department that got hit very hard in the first part of 2025. And, you know, I'm just very skeptical that they're going to continue putting out the current population survey, which is one of the most important data sets in not just, you know, the study of American economics but of the actual practice of American economics.\nDETROW: And I think you've touched on this here and there, but what do you think the role of a think tank is in a world where the people in charge don't have much respect for expertise?\nFAGAN: I think the - it depends on the think tank, right? So the premise of The Heritage Foundation was always that the experts are wrong, and we're going to give you the other answer. The idea being that, you know, the Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and Republicans in Congress in the 1970s, they're talking to the same people Democrats are talking to. They're coming up with very similar ideas. And so, you know, they go out and they betray conservatives. And so we're going to provide you experts, people who can give you a conservative answer to a question, not the answer that those experts, who we think are liberal, are going to give you.\nThe dangerous thing is that they're still an influential organization, and so they've replaced the real policy wonks with enablers.

Callais, which also centers on the legality of Louisiana's redistricting map and whether race should be considered a factor in drawing new congressional districts.\nOral arguments then focused heavily on whether Louisiana's redistricting efforts were narrowly tailored enough to meet constitutional requirements and whether race was used in a way that violated the law, as the appellees alleged.\nThe Supreme Court in June said it would hear additional arguments in the case in the fall term, citing the need for more information before it could issue a ruling.\nSUPREME COURT DECLINES TO BLOCK MISSISSIPPI SOCIAL MEDIA AGE-RESTRICTION LAW, FOR NOW\nEarlier this month, justices ordered both parties to file supplemental briefs by mid-September, outlining in further detail arguments for and against Louisiana's proposed map and whether the intentional creation of a second majority-Black congressional district \"violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\"\nThe careful consideration from the Supreme Court is the clearest sign yet that redistricting issues remain top of mind in the run-up to the 2026 midterm elections and beyond.\nIt also comes at a pivotal time in the U.S., as new and politically charged redistricting fights have popped up in other states ahead of next year's midterm elections.\nLouisiana, for its part, has revised its congressional map twice since the 2020 census.\n‘BRAZENLY UNLAWFUL’: DC OFFICIALS ESCALATE FIGHT WITH TRUMP OVER POLICE TAKEOVER\nThe first version, which included only one majority-Black district, was blocked by a federal court in 2022. The court sided with the Louisiana State Conference of the NAACP and other plaintiffs, ruling the map diluted Black voting power and ordering the state to redraw it by January 2024.\nThe new map, S.B. 8, created the second Black-majority district. But it was almost immediately challenged by a group of non-Black plaintiffs in court, who took issue with a new district that stretched some 250 miles from Louisiana's northwest corner of Shreveport to Baton Rouge, in the state's southeast.\nThey argued in their lawsuit that the state violated the equal protection clause by relying too heavily on race to draw the maps and created a \"sinuous and jagged second majority-Black district.\"\nThe intense court fights in Louisiana underscore the broader redistricting battles playing out in Republican- and Democrat-led states across the country, as they spar over new congressional maps with an eye to the looming midterm elections.\nIn Texas, tensions reached a fever pitch after Democratic state legislators fled the Lone Star State to block Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's ability to convene a legislative quorum to pass the state's aggressive new redistricting map, which would create five additional Republican-leaning districts.\nIn California, Gov. Gavin Newsom responded by introducing a new map of his own that favors Democrats.\nThe move highlights how both parties are engaged in aggressive redistricting battles, with Republican-led states pushing maps to defend the GOP’s slim House majority and Democrats seeking to expand their own advantages. As with most midterms following a new president’s election, 2026 is expected to serve as a referendum on the White House — raising GOP concerns that they could lose control of the chamber.\nAFTER STINGING ELECTION DEFEATS, DNC EYES RURAL VOTERS AS KEY TO 2026 MIDTERM SUCCESS\nNew York Gov.

He watched Robert F. Kennedy steady first lady Jackie at President John F. Kennedy’s grave in 1963. Five years later, in 1968, he pushed his way through a crowded hotel kitchen in Los Angeles after hearing shots and saw Robert F. Kennedy bleeding on the floor. He would later write of RFK’s brief presidential campaign in the book “85 Days.”\nWitcover described himself and the curmudgeonly Germond as “friendly rivals laboring for obscure newspaper chains” who enjoyed long, booze-soaked dinners on the campaign trail, a culture that was chronicled in Timothy Crouse’s classic account of reporters covering the 1972 presidential election, “Boys on the Bus.”\nWhen Witcover and Germond began co-writing their column in 1977, “we often played the good cop/bad cop routine, each of us able to blame the other guy when a column one of us wrote caused a politician to complain. But sometimes, too, one of us would take the bullet for the other when it unjustly came our way. That was the nature of playing duet pianos in the house of ill repute called political writing,” Witcover wrote in The Sun after Germond’s death in 2013.\nAt its peak, the syndicated column ran five times a week and appeared in about 140 newspapers.\nIn his final years as a columnist, Witcover relentlessly hammered President George W. Bush over the Iraq war, calling it “the most wrong-headed foreign policy in my lifetime and the most dangerous.” But he did not blame that view for The Sun’s dropping his column. Editorially, the newspaper also opposed the war, although less vigorously.\n“The war was a colossal mistake from the start and has disintegrated into a calamity, damaging not only the people of Iraq but the international reputation of this country, not to mention the terrible cost in American lives and treasure,” he wrote for the Poynter Institute’s blog.\nWitcover was born in Union City, New Jersey, to a Jewish father and Catholic mother. He was raised Catholic and showed an early interest in writing. He wrote in his memoirs that he and a cousin produced a one-page family newspaper on Thanksgiving that they sold for a nickel.\nA classmate on his high school basketball team persuaded him to apply to Columbia, which he attended for a semester before joining the Navy. He then re-enrolled in the college after the war ended and obtained a master’s degree at Columbia’s graduate school of journalism.\nYears later, he told a reporter that he thought his ship had come in when a newspaper in the Boston area offered him a starting job covering the Boston Braves in spring training. Before he could get started the team decided to move its franchise to Milwaukee and the opportunity died.\nBy 1962, 11 years after graduation, he had become a senior correspondent and the chief political writer for the Newhouse News Service.\nWitcover lived in Washington with his second wife, Marion Elizabeth Rodgers, a biographer of the journalist H.L. Mencken. His first marriage, of nearly four decades, to Marian Laverty, ended in divorce.\n“Jules was the hardest working newsman I ever knew,” said Walter Mears, who as the chief political writer for The Associated Press traveled extensively with Witcover. “On the road, you could hear him banging the typewriter before dawn, working on one of his books. He never stopped writing columns and political histories long after most of us had retired.”", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 00:39:02 +0000", "author": "Associated Press", "source": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/feed/"}
{"title": "Appeals court overturns order that stripped some protections from pregnant Texas state workers", "url": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/08/18/pregnant-workers-texas/", "text": "By ALEXANDRA OLSON\nNEW YORK (AP) — A federal appeals court has upheld a law strengthening the rights of pregnant workers, vacating a judge’s earlier order that had stripped those protections from Texas state employees.\nThe ruling was a victory for advocates of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, a law that passed with bipartisan support in 2022 but quickly became embroiled in controversy over whether it covers workers seeking abortions and fertility treatments.\nA federal judge last year blocked enforcement of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act for Texas state employees, ruling that its passage was unconstitutional because a majority of House members were not physically present to approve the law as part of spending package in December 2022.\nIn a 2-1 decision, the Fifth Circuit appeals court disagreed, finding that the law was properly passed under a COVID-19 pandemic-era Congressional rule allowing members to vote by proxy to meet the quorum requirement.\nThe Pregnant Workers Fairness Act strengthens the rights of women to receive workplace accommodation for needs related to pregnancy and childbirth, such as time off for medical appointments and exemptions from heavy lifting. Its passage came after a decades long campaign by women’s advocacy groups highlighting the struggles of pregnant workers, especially those in low-wage roles, who were routinely forced off the job after requesting accommodations.\nThe Texas case differed from other lawsuits that have narrowly focused on federal regulations stating that abortion, fertility treatments and birth control are medical issues requiring protection under the new law. The lawsuit, filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, instead took aim at the entirety of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, drawing opposition from Republican lawmakers including former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who defended the pandemic-era proxy voting rule.\nUnder the Trump administration, the Department of Justice has continued to fight Paxton’s lawsuit, which if successful, could help open the door to legal challenges of other pandemic-era laws passed by proxy.\nPaxton’s office did not reply to emails seeking comment, and it was not clear whether he would appeal Friday’s ruling. The Justice Department declined to comment.\n“This is a big win for women’s rights. We are really happy to see that the Fifth Circuit agreed with us that the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act was passed constitutionally and will continue to fight for the PWFA to stay legal,” said Inimai Chettiar, president of a Better Balance, an advocacy group that spearheaded the campaign for passage of the law.\nTexas state employees are not immediately protected, however, because the appeals court ruling doesn’t become final for several weeks to give time for a possible appeal, Chettiar said.\nConservative officials and religious groups, meanwhile, have been largely successfully in challenging the regulations passed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which established that workers seeking abortions are entitled accommodations.\nIn May, a federal court struck down the abortion provisions of the EEOC regulations in response to lawsuits brought by states of Louisiana and Mississippi, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic University and two Catholic dioceses.\nThe Trump administration is almost certain to comply with that ruling. President Donald Trump in January fired two of the EEOC’s democratic commissioners, paving the way for him to quickly establish a Republican majority at the agency. EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, has signaled her support for revising the regulations, arguing the agency exceeded its authority by including not only abortion but fertility treatments and birth control as medical needs covered by the law.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 23:34:48 +0000", "author": "Associated Press", "source": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/feed/"}

Sooknanan ruled Friday that the FTC’s probe of Media Matters, “purportedly to investigate an advertiser boycott concerning social media platforms,” represents a clear violation of the group’s freedom of speech.\n“It should alarm all Americans when the government retaliates against individuals or organizations for engaging in constitutionally protected public debate,” Sooknanan wrote.\nEven before the FTC got involved, Media Matters has been defending itself against a lawsuit by Musk following the organization’s November 2023 story that, following Musk’s purchase of the social media site once known as Twitter, antisemitic posts and other offensive content were appearing next to advertisements there.\nSooknanan said the injunction halting any FTC probe was merited because Media Matters is likely to succeed on its claim that the FTC is being used to retaliate against it for a critical article on a Trump supporter.\n“The court’s ruling demonstrates the importance of fighting over folding, which far too many are doing when confronted with intimidation from the Trump administration,” said Angelo Carusone, chairman and president of Media Matters.\nThere was no immediate comment from an FTC spokesman.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 21:28:42 +0000", "author": "Associated Press", "source": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/feed/"}

Police Chief Elise Chard has said the department was notified by federal officials that Evans was legally permitted to work in the country, and that the town submitted information via the Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify program prior to Evans’ employment.

The US Constitution doesn’t give him that power", "url": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/08/18/trump-elections-constitution/", "text": "By NICHOLAS RICCARDI and ALI SWENSON\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday vowed more changes to the way elections are conducted in the U.S., but based on the Constitution there is little to nothing he can do on his own.\nRelying on false information and conspiracy theories that he’s regularly used to explain away his 2020 election loss, Trump pledged on his social media site that he would do away with both mail voting — which remains popular and is used by about one-third of all voters — and voting machines — some form of which are used in almost all of the country’s thousands of election jurisdictions. These are the same systems that enabled Trump to win the 2024 election and Republicans to gain control of Congress.\nTrump’s post marks an escalation even in his normally overheated election rhetoric. He issued a wide-ranging executive order earlier this year that, among other changes, would have required documented proof-of-citizenship before registering to vote. His Monday post promised another election executive order to “help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm elections.”\nThe same post also pushed falsehoods about voting. He claimed the U.S. is the only country to use mail voting, when it’s actually used by dozens, including Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\nSimilar complaints to Trump’s, when aired on conservative networks such as Newsmax and Fox News, have led to multimillion dollar defamation settlements, including one announced Monday, because they are full of false information and the outlets have not been able to present any evidence to support them.\nTrump’s post came after the president told Fox News that Russian President Vladimir Putin, in their Friday meeting in Alaska, echoed his grievances about mail voting and the 2020 election. Trump continued his attack on mail voting and voting machines in the Oval Office on Monday, during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nThe announcement signals yet another way that Trump intends to stack the cards in his favor in the 2026 midterm elections, after he already has directed his attorney general to investigate a Democratic fundraising platform and urged states to redraw their congressional districts to help the GOP maintain its majority in the House of Representatives.\nHere’s a breakdown of Trump’s latest election post and why Congress is the one entity that can implement national election rules.\nTrump’s post\nTrump for years has promoted false information about voting, and Monday was no exception.\nHe claimed there is “MASSIVE FRAUD” due to mail voting, when in fact voting fraud in the U.S. is rare. As an example, an Associated Press review after the 2020 election found fewer than 475 cases of potential fraud in the six battleground states where he disputed his loss, far too few to tip that election to Trump.\nWashington and Oregon, which conduct elections entirely by mail, have sued to challenge Trump’s earlier executive order — which sought to require that all ballots must be received by Election Day and not just postmarked by then. The states argue that the president has no such authority, and they are seeking a declaration from a federal judge in Seattle that their postmark deadlines do not conflict with federal law setting the date of U.S. elections.\nTrump also alleged that voting machines are more expensive than “Watermark Paper.” That’s a little-used system that has gained favor and investments among some voting conspiracy theorists who believe it would help prevent fraudulent ballots from being introduced into the vote count. Watermarks would not provide a way to count ballots, so they would not on their own replace vote tabulating machines.\nWhile some jurisdictions still have voters use electronic ballot-marking devices to cast their votes, the vast majority of voters in the U.S. already vote on paper ballots, creating an auditable record of votes that provides an extra safeguard for election security.\nIn his post, Trump also claimed that states “are merely an ‘agent’ for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes” and must do what the federal government “as represented by the President of the United States” tells them to do.\nElection lawyers said that’s a misrepresentation of the U.S. Constitution. It also flies in the face of what had been a core Republican Party value of prioritizing states’ rights.\nThousands of elections, none under presidential control\nUnlike in most countries, elections in the U.S. are run by the states. But it gets more complicated — each state then allows smaller jurisdictions, such as counties, cities or townships, to run their own elections. Election officials estimate there are as many as 10,000 different election jurisdictions across the country.\nA frequent complaint of Trump and other election conspiracy theorists is that the U.S. doesn’t run its election like France, which hand counts presidential ballots and usually has a national result on election night. But that’s because France is only running that single election, and every jurisdiction has the same ballot with no other races.\nA ballot in the U.S. might contain dozens of races, from president on down to city council and including state and local ballot measures.\nThe Constitution makes the states the entities that determine the “time, place and manner” of elections, but does allow Congress to “make” or “alter” rules for federal elections.\nCongress can change the way states run congressional and presidential elections but has no say in the way a state runs its own elections. The president is not mentioned at all in the Constitution’s list of entities with powers over elections.\n“The president has very limited to zero authority over things related to the conduct of elections,” said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nCourts have agreed — no presidential involvement\nParts of Trump’s earlier executive order on elections were swiftly blocked by the courts, on the grounds that Congress, and not the president, sets federal election rules.\nIt’s unclear what Trump plans to do now, but the only path to change federal election rules is through Congress.\nAlthough Republicans control Congress, it’s unclear that even his party would want to eliminate voting machines nationwide, possibly delaying vote tallies in their own races by weeks or months. Even if they did, legislation would likely be unable to pass because Democrats could filibuster it in the U.S. Senate.\nMail voting had bipartisan support before Trump turned against it during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, but it’s still widely used in Republican-leaning states, including several he won last November — Arizona, Florida and Utah. It’s also how members of the military stationed overseas cast their ballots, and fully eliminating it would disenfranchise those GOP-leaning voters.\nThe main significance of Trump’s Monday statement is that it signals his continuing obsession with trying to change how elections are run.\n“These kinds of claims could provide a kind of excuse for him to try to meddle,” Hasen said. “Very concerned about that.”\nAssociated Press writer Eugene Johnson in Seattle contributed to this report.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 21:21:01 +0000", "author": "Associated Press", "source": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/feed/"}

They don’t breakdown neatly across partisan lines, but they share one common trait, which is that they’ve suffered an unimaginable trauma,” New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin said during a video news conference Monday, calling the administration’s threat to withhold funds “the most heinous act” he’s seen in politics.\nThe federal conditions were placed on VOCA funding, which provides more than a billion dollars annually to states for victims compensation programs and grants that fund victims assistance organizations. VOCA funding comes entirely from fines and penalties in federal court cases, not from tax dollars.\nEvery state and territory has a victims compensation program that follows federal guidelines, but largely is set up under state law to provide financial help to crime victims, including medical expense reimbursement, paying for crime scene cleanup, counseling or helping with funeral costs for homicide victims. VOCA covers the cost of about 75% of state compensation program awards.\nThe funds are also used to pay for other services, including testing rape kits, funding grants to domestic violence recovery organizations, trauma recovery centers and more.\nAdvocates and others argue that the system needs to protect victims regardless of their immigration status and ensure that reporting a crime does not lead to deportation threats. They also say that marginalized communities, such as newly arrived immigrants, are more likely to be crime targets.\n“The federal government is attempting to use crime victim funds as a bargaining chip to force states into doing its bidding on immigration enforcement,” New York Attorney General Letitia James, who also joined the lawsuit, said in a statement Monday. “These grants were created to help survivors heal and recover, and we will fight to ensure they continue to serve that purpose … We will not be bullied into abandoning any of our residents.”\nThe Associated Press left a message seeking comment from a DOJ spokesperson Monday afternoon.\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration has sought to withhold or pull back other federal funding or grant funding midstream, saying awardees and programs no longer agree with its priorities. In April, it canceled about $800 million in DOJ grants, some of which were awarded to victims service and survivor organizations.\nAnd in June, states filed a lawsuit over added requirements in Violence Against Women Act funding that mandated applicants agree not to promote “gender ideology,” or run diversity, equity and inclusion programs or prioritize people in the country illegally.\nSeveral attorneys general said the VOCA conditions appear to be another way the administration is targeting so-called sanctuary jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, though there is no clear definition of what a sanctuary state or city is.\nThe Trump administration earlier this month released an updated list of states, cities and counties it considers sanctuary jurisdictions. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in the August announcement that the department would “continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.”\nAs of Monday afternoon attorneys general from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin — all Democrats — had signed on to the lawsuit.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 19:25:49 +0000", "author": "Associated Press", "source": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/feed/"}

James Comer, the Republican committee chair, said in a statement. “I appreciate the Trump Administration’s commitment to transparency and efforts to provide the American people with information about this matter.\nA wealthy and well-connected financier, Epstein was found dead in his New York jail cell weeks after his 2019 arrest in what investigators ruled a suicide. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of helping lure teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.\nThe committee’s subpoena sought all documents and communications from the case files of Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. It also demanded records about communications between Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration and the Justice Department regarding Epstein, as well as documents related to an earlier federal investigation into Epstein in Florida that resulted in a non-prosecution agreement in 2007.\nIt was not clear exactly which or how many documents might be produced or whether the cooperation with Congress reflected a broader change in posture since last month, when the FBI and Justice Department abruptly announced that they would not be releasing any additional records from the Epstein investigation after determining that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.”\nThat announcement put the Trump administration on the defensive, with officials since then scrambling both to tamp down angry questions from the president’s base and also laboring to appear transparent.\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche interviewed Maxwell at a Florida courthouse over two days last month — though no records from those conversations have been made public — and the Justice Department has also sought to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases, though so far those requests have been denied.\nA Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment Monday.\nThe panel separately issued subpoenas to eight former law enforcement leaders as well as former Democratic President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nBill Clinton was among a number of luminaries acquainted with Epstein, a wealthy financier, before the criminal investigation against him in Florida became public two decades ago.

Efforts to thwart President Donald Trump’s push to tilt the political map for next year’s midterm elections in his favor shifted to California.\nDozens of Texas Democrats ended a two-week walkout Monday after Democrats in California heeded Gov. Gavin Newsom’s call to counter the GOP effort in Texas.\nIn California, the Democratic-supermajority Legislature faces right deadlines, and a plan would have to be approved by voters in November.\nRepublicans have more options for mid-decade redistricting than Democrats because they control more statehouses, and they’ve talked about redrawing districts in Florida, Indiana and Missouri.\nHere’s what to know.\nTrump is trying avoid a congressional check on him\nBoth Trump and the Democrats are looking ahead to the 2026 midterms knowing that they often go against the president’s party, as they did during Trump’s first term in 2018. Republicans currently have a seven-seat majority in the 435-member House.\nState legislatures draw the lines after each U.S. census in most states — including Texas — and only a few dozen House districts are competitive.\nIn Texas, Republicans hold 25 of 38 seats, and they’re trying to increase that to 30. In California, Democrats have 43 of the 52 seats, and they’re trying to boost that to 48, to wipe out the advantage the GOP would gain from redrawing lines in Texas.\nCalifornia is more complicated for Democrats\nIn some ways, the nation’s most-populous state, California, is a reverse-mirror image of the nation’s second most-populous state, Texas. Democrats are even more firmly in control of state government there than Republicans are in Texas, with Democratic supermajorities in both California legislative chambers.\nBut California’s districts were drawn by an independent commission created by a statewide vote in 2008 after years of intense partisan battles over redistricting.\nDemocrats are trying to avoid legal challenges to a new map by asking voters to approve it as an exception to the normal process, which would require a special election in November. Texas has no such commission, so its Legislature doesn’t have to seek voters’ approval for its maps.\nCalifornia lawmakers were returning Monday to the state capital from a summer break. They are scheduled to remain in session through Sept. 12.\nWhy a walkout stalled Republicans in Texas\nRepublicans have solid majorities in both chambers of the Texas Legislature, and a Democrat hasn’t won statewide office there since 1994. But Texas is among a handful of states where two-thirds of each chamber must be present to conduct business, and the GOP majorities are not that large.\nRepublican Gov. Greg Abbott already had called a special legislative session when Trump began pushing for a new congressional map, but GOP lawmakers could not conduct business after most Democratic lawmakers left for blue states, including California, Illinois and Massachusetts.\nBut there were pressures on Democrats against holding out longer. They were away from their families and nonlegislative jobs, and their walkout also prevented lawmakers from providing relief to the Texas Hill Country ravaged by deadly flash flooding in July. They also faced fines of $500 per day, as well as efforts to oust some of them from office.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 18:02:51 +0000", "author": "Associated Press", "source": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/feed/"}
{"title": "3 more GOP governors authorize deployment of National Guard troops as part of Trump show of force", "url": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/08/18/dc-federal-intervention/", "text": "By MATT BROWN and MIKE PESOLI, Associated Press\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Three more Republican governors authorized the deployment of National Guard troops to Washington on Monday, part of President Donald Trump’s escalating show of force that he says is designed to crack down on crime and boost immigration enforcement in the nation’s capital. The announcements by Mississippi, Tennessee and Louisiana brought the number of state troops detailed to the president’s effort to more than 1,100 — and the number of states to six.\nGovernors from the states said they were responding to requests from the Trump administration to join the operation. It was not immediately clear why the administration requested additional military support. About 800 troops have already been called up from the Washington, D.C., guard and have had a limited assigned role so far in Trump’s 10-day-old attempted takeover of D.C. law enforcement.\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the descriptions of the operation needed to be more honest — and acknowledge that they weren’t just about curtailing crime but about immigration enforcement, a centerpiece of the second Trump administration that has echoed across the country in recent months. During a news conference, Bowser pushed back on Trump’s characterization of the city and voiced skepticism about the administration’s intentions.\n“I think it makes the point that this is not about D.C. crime,” Bowser said of the administration and states deploying National Guard members onto the streets of the capital. “The focus should be on violent crime. … Nobody is against focusing on driving down any level of violence. And so if this is really about immigration enforcement, the administration should make that plain.”\nTrump’s executive order that launched the federal operation declared a “crime emergency” in the District of Columbia and initiated a takeover of Washington’s police department. The administration has ordered local police to cooperate with federal agents on immigration enforcement, orders that would contradict local laws prohibiting such collaboration.\nFederal agents have arrested 160 undocumented people in the district since the operation began, including people that White House officials allege are known gang members with prior felony offenses.\nFriction with local government and community continues\nThe executive order has led to friction with the local government and heightened tensions in the community as a surge of federal agents in the capital garner praise and protest from residents.\nThe nation’s capital can govern itself through powers delegated to it by Congress, though the federal laws that grant that autonomy give wide breadth to the president and Congress to intervene when they see fit. That longstanding tension has led to a legal standoff between local officials and the White House in the current troop deployment and surge of federal officers into the district.\nIn what could also heighten tensions on the streets, Washington has been informed about the intent for the National Guard to be armed, though it has not received details about when that could happen or where armed Guard members could be deployed in the District, according to a person familiar who was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIt would be a departure from what the Pentagon and Army have said about the troops being unarmed. The Army said in a statement last week that “weapons are available if needed but will remain in the armory.” Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson also said last week that troops won’t be armed.\nIn response to questions about whether Guard members in Washington would be armed in the coming days, the District of Columbia National Guard said troops “may be armed consistent with their mission and training.” Maj. Melissa Heintz, a spokesperson for the D.C. Guard, didn’t provide more details.\nThe stepped-up guard presence grew further Monday with the new deployments from Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee, all led by Republican governors. A spokesperson for Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said that the governor had granted a request from the Trump administration for the state’s National Guard members “to assist with monument security, community safety patrols, protecting federal facilities, and traffic control.” The troops “are ready to assist as long as needed,” the governor’s office said.\nIn addition to Monday’s announcements, West Virginia said it was deploying 300 to 400 troops, South Carolina pledged 200 and Ohio said it will send 150 in the coming days, deployments that built on top of Trump’s initial order that 800 National Guard troops deploy as part of the federal intervention.\nNational Guard members in the District of Columbia have been assisting law enforcement with tasks including crowd control and patrolling landmarks such as the National Mall and Union Station. Their role has been limited thus far, and it remains unclear why additional troops would be needed, though attention-getting optics have long been a part of Trump’s playbook.\nQuestions remain about who is actually running the DC police\nOn Friday, the city’s attorney general sued the administration for appointing the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as the city’s “emergency police commissioner.” The administration walked back the move but then issued a follow-up order that directed local police to “cooperate fully and completely with federal immigration authorities.”\n“D.C. has been under siege from thugs and killers, but now, D.C. is back under Federal Control where it belongs,” Trump wrote on his social media website a day after issuing his order. “The White House is in charge. The Military and our Great Police will liberate this City, scrape away the filth, and make it safe, clean, habitable and beautiful once more!”\nFederal agents from the DEA, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service and other agencies have patrolled high-traffic areas around the capital over the last week. ICE officers, who work under the Department of Homeland Security, have made arrests in neighborhoods across the city, dispersed some public gatherings and torn pro-immigrant signs, according to videos published by the administration.\nThe White House has touted various arrests that local police and federal agents have made across the city since Trump’s executive order. Federal agents have made 380 arrests in the week since the start of the operation and in some cases issued charges to detained people. The White House has touted the surge of agents on social media and posted pictures of people arrested by local and federal officers.\n“Washington, DC is getting safer every night thanks to our law enforcement partners,” Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on social media. “Just this weekend, 137 arrests were made and 21 illegal firearms were seized. In total, there have been nearly 400 arrests—and we are not slowing down.”\nAmid the crackdown, the administration has received criticism for the conduct of some federal agents, who in several high-profile incidents have arrested people while wearing masks that hide their identity and declined to identify themselves to media or members of the public when questioned. Bowser said Monday that she had asked D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith to seek answers from the administration about the use of masked police.\n“It’s very important to us that agents be identified,” Bowser said. “There’s no reason for a law enforcement official to be masked.”\nOn Monday, dozens of protesters gathered in the U Street neighborhood of Washington, where multiple federal agents patrols and arrests had taken place over the weekend, to protest the Trump administration’s actions.\nAssociated Press writers Anna Johnson in Washington, Jeff Amy in Atlanta and Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee, contributed to this report.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 18:14:21 +0000", "author": "Associated Press", "source": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/feed/"}

I don’t think everyone in the civil service [is bad]. I will go very much on record on that. There's a lot of great talent there...\n“The classic right-wing, knee-jerk, ‘oh God, all civil servants are bad’ is very unfair,\" he said.\nBrown added: \"There are clearly pockets that need huge improvement, but there is a lot of talent in the civil service, which actually needs to be released.”\nPoliticsHome reported earlier this year that those involved in setting up the new think tank, which was originally called Resolute 1850, had met with Farage and Reform UK Deputy Leader Richard Tice as part of their preparations. Now, both the party and the think tank have offices in the same Westminster building, Millbank Tower.\nDespite that, Reform insists it has no formal ties with CBB and is creating policy in-house.\nBrown revealed that the think tank's first policy paper is expected to be on energy policy.\nThis is set to be followed by a report on reforming the UK’s pensions system, Brown said, \"because we are very likely to go into a proper economic debt crisis within the next year, maybe before Christmas\".\nAs well as producing policy ideas, CBB will aim to support a future centre-right administration by recruiting \"talented\" people who could potentially go on to serve in government as advisers and officials.\nWhile the think tank has close links to Reform, Brown stresses that it has been developing links with Conservative Party politicians, too.\nWithin Westminster, there are a plethora of think-tanks on the right, including the Adam Smith Institute, Centre for Policy Studies, Institute of Economic Affairs, and Onward.\nAccording to Brown, while these organisations do \"a lot of good work\", his new outfit would offer a more comprehensive policy platform for an incoming government to adopt.\n“One of the things we’re thinking about is the severity of the crisis. A lot of centre-right think tanks think, 'let’s go 20 per cent this way or 20 per cent that way'. What we need to do is 180 on a whole range of issues,\" he told PoliticsHome.\n“We're thinking very solidly about what a platform for government might look like.\n\"Engaging with politicians is quite important. We have natural links of reform. We’ve built up a lot of links with the Conservative Party.”\nBrown was keen, however, to dismiss the idea that his new think tank is an attempt to create a Donald Trump-aligned, MAGA-esque movement on the other side of the Atlantic.\n“The idea that we’re some sort of UK MAGA [Make America Great Again] is just nonsense,” he said.\n“This is really nonsense. The UK is a completely different country with different reasons and a different political consensus.\"\nAt the same time, he also sought to stress that the CBB was not promoting reheated Thatcherism, telling PoliticsHome that \"there's a role for the state, particularly around industrial policy\".\nBrown worked in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Egypt during his decade in the foreign office.\nThe UK's role in the world is an area that he is keen for the think tank to tackle, particularly in Artificial Intelligence, where he claimed Britain faces an \"existential threat\".\n“We're in real danger of becoming a vassal state to the Americans or the Chinese on AI. In particular, when it links to energy policy, because thanks to Net Zero, we’ve slammed our own energy prices up.\n“There's an existential threat that the UK goes from traditionally, certainly over the last 300 years, being a country that at least makes the weather... to essentially a country that just takes orders.”\nHe believes that UK foreign policy has become too focused on what he calls moralising at the expense of advancing the country's actual interests.\n“So much of our foreign policy has become projecting out the moral issues of the day, either onto Ukraine or the Arab-Israeli question, rather than actually thinking about these things as particular issues...\n\"The protests on the street, be it Ukraine or Arab-Israel, are about so much more than the issue. They're about identity politics. And we can't have a foreign policy based on identity politics. It's crazy. We need a foreign policy based on realism and rational interest.\"\nBrown describes himself as a \"big fan\" of the former US secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, and his \"amoral\" approach to pursuing American interests abroad.\n“I'm a big fan of Henry Kissinger: that stepping back and thinking, okay, what are we actually trying to achieve? In a way, it is amoral, not immoral is vitally important.\n“We [the UK] started filtering our foreign policy through the communications lens and moralism, and we need to stop doing so.”", "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT", "author": "Tom Scotson", "source": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/rss"}

But if the government overlooks the basics – such as proper protection for loft insulation – it risks creating an expensive legacy that future governments will have to rectify.\"\nRaval explained that the \"vast majority\" of households damage their loft insulation when they use their lofts, which \"drastically\" reduces the effectiveness of the insulation, limits savings in their energy bills, and ultimately leads to the insulation needing to be replaced in the future.\n“British SMEs fully support the government’s plan to lower bills for consumers and have already developed affordable and accessible insulation protection solutions to help.\n\"It's crucial these are integrated into government policy immediately before the mistakes of the past are repeated,\" he said.\nSimon Francis, co-ordinator at the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, agreed that the success of the government's warm homes strategy will hinge on \"getting the basics\" like loft insulation right.\n\"The success of the Warm Homes Plan must be judged by how far it goes in ending fuel poverty, not simply by maximising the raw number of measures taken,\" he said.\n\"But it is crucial that it learns from past failures and delivers high-quality, properly designed installations that genuinely reduce bills and improve comfort for the long term.\n\"This includes getting the basics right: insulation must be installed to the right depth, with proper protection and follow-up where necessary to ensure it remains effective.\"\nHe warned that high-tech solutions will \"underperform\" if homes continue to leak heat due to faults like poor insulation.\nA Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said the NWHC figures \"ignore the fact that any measures installed under government schemes — including loft insulation — must be fitted by a TrustMark registered installer to the highest standards, with protections in place if issues arise\".\nThey added: “Our Warm Homes Plan will make homes cheaper and cleaner to run, and we are investing £13.2bn to improve up to five million homes over this Parliament, helping families to cut their energy bills for good.\"\nAdam Berman, director of Policy and Advocacy at Energy UK, said that while insulation was important, the government was \"right to prioritise measures such as heat pumps and solar installations\".\n\"Insulation will continue to be a complementary solution for many households, but the evidence is clear that getting the most out of every penny spent in the Warm Homes Plan will rely on electrification technologies, ensuring the UK can bolster its energy security and reduce emissions at the lowest cost.”", "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 12:11:00 GMT", "author": "Nadine Batchelor-Hunt", "source": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/rss"}

The plans, set out in the Football Governance Act, became law in July.\nThe regulator, which faced some opposition from elements of the sport, is designed to police the top five leagues of English football. It will impose an owners’ and directors' test on 116 clubs to ensure they are not captured by rogue owners.\nHowever, ministers are being urged to speed up these plans amid the sight of two historic clubs teetering on the edge of disaster.\nLord Blunkett, former Cabinet minister and Labour MP in Sheffield, told PoliticsHome the government needed to announce secondary legislation as soon as Parliament returns from its summer recess in September to enforce the football regulator.\n“Everyone who cares, not just about the future of an individual club, but the health and wellbeing of football, will want the earliest possible resolution of what is happening to my home side Sheffield Wednesday, and of course, to Morecambe,\" he told PoliticsHome.\n“One signal, which would undoubtedly be a game-changer, would be for the Secretary of State Lisa Nandy to announce that the necessary secondary legislation will be laid in September, and the new regulator and governance framework will be implemented from November.”\nThe Labour peer added that this was not the “kind of timetable the traditional civil service is used to” but that it was “perfectly possible” under the circumstances if people are not “to stand by fiddling while Rome burns”.\nSecondary legislation is used to set a date for when elements of an act of Parliament will come into effect – in this case, when the football regulator will be given its powers.\nClive Betts, Labour MP for Sheffield South East, agreed with Blunkett that this should be done as soon as Parliament returns.\n“While we brought in the regulator, and we don’t want it to interfere on a regular basis, we want it to be an option to fall back on if an owner is intent on a club disappearing,” he said.\nBayo Alaba, Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, told PoliticsHome: \"Labour’s independent football regulator is more important now than ever. It is designed to stop exactly the kind of turmoil we are now seeing at Sheffield Wednesday and Morecambe.\n“Stakeholders, MPs and supporters alike all recognise that without the regulator, too many historic clubs are at risk of being lost. I look forward to Labour's independent football regulator delivering the protection, stability, and long-term vision our clubs and communities deserve.”\nLizzi Collinge, Labour MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, said the ongoing plight of Morecambe showed why the country was in desperate need of a new football regulator.\n\"Under the new rules, I am certain that the current owner of The Shrimps would not have been allowed to buy the club,” she said.\nCollinge added that knowing other football clubs with strong local roots will be protected in future gives her some comfort, but she was “desperately” sad that Morecambe is becoming the example of how necessary it is.\nA Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson said the ongoing challenges at Morecambe, Sheffield Wednesday and many other clubs show why the Football Governance Act is “so badly needed”.\nThey told PoliticsHome: \"We are working to get the Independent Football Regulator up and running as soon as possible to prevent more clubs and fans facing similar issues in the future.\n\"We recognise the need to move as soon as is possible with secondary legislation and the implementation of this regulator is a priority, with some important milestones upcoming including the recruitment of a CEO and appointing the Regulator’s Board.\"", "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 14:05:00 GMT", "author": "Tom Scotson", "source": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/rss"}

Trump said they had made \"great progress\", but at the time of writing, had not disclosed details of the negotiations.\nSpeaking exclusively to the Latika Takes Podcast, in an interview shared with PoliticsHome, he said Kyiv had to be prepared to accept an “uncomfortable compromise” for an “enduring settlement\".\n“If Putin said, 'okay, we are right on a deal,' but the absolute break point for him is if Ukraine joins NATO within a defining period, does everyone walk away and say, 'no, no, let's keep killing each other because Ukraine wants to join NATO'?” Tice said.\n“Or do you say, 'well, there might be a different way of doing this?'”\nUkraine has stated that the only credible security guarantee to prevent future Russian invasions is NATO membership, due to the Alliance's collective defence clause.\nThe UK is one of the biggest supporters of Ukraine joining NATO, but it is opposed by the US.\nTice described the US position as “more thoughtful” and said what really mattered were the security guarantees that NATO, the US and the West could offer Ukraine.\n“ That's the big question because to get an enduring peace, you have to have robust security guarantees that deter Russia-stroke-Putin from ever trying any of that nonsense again.\n‘That’s really the critical thing.”\nHe denied that this constituted outsourcing Ukraine’s choices over its future to Russia.\n“ You're not outsourcing the choice, you're trying to negotiate,” he said.\n“Membership of NATO is not a definition of sovereignty...\n“No one's in position A, that's the bottom line. If you want to get to a peaceful solution, where, as a sovereign nation, you can make a choice, you wouldn't start from here.\"\nHe continued: “We are where we are, it's a hideous place, and Putin's to blame for the place we're in.\n“But if you want to get out of it, you've got to look at all the various pieces on the map of which NATO membership is one of them and see if, behind closed doors, you can get to an acceptable settlement.”\nBoth Labour and the Tories have attacked Reform and its leader, Nigel Farage, as being sympathetic towards Putin and parrotting pro-Kremlin lines.\nFarage, the MP for Clacton, said before the last UK general election in July 2024 that \"we [the West] provoked this war\", and has previously said he admired Putin as a “political operator\".\nTice, who has driven medical aid to Ukraine, said his leader had been taken out of context.\n“Neither of those things is true; they were taken out of context by the mainstream media,” he said.\n“There’s only one person who provoked this Ukraine war, and that is Putin.\n“Nigel was speaking about the risks in Ukraine over a decade ago. And those warnings that he gave should be recognised.”\nHe added: “We want peace and you’ve got to be prepared to think outside the box and try for peace and negotiate for peace, knowing that will involve some difficult compromises.”\nTice called on the government to go further when it came to using the estimated £330bn in Russian money and bonds in overseas bank accounts seized by Western governments at the start of the full-scale invasion.\nAround £25bn of Russian assets are held in British bank accounts and government bonds. Tice said these should be fully seized, because \"it's one of the things that would upset Putin the most\".\nHe said: “In terms of helping get to a ceasefire and a negotiated settlement... what we do know about him [Putin] is he likes money. Lots of it. He views that money as his own, and if the West takes it, then that will bring him into a different place.”\nThe bulk of the £330bn in frozen Russian central bank assets is held in European clearing houses, mostly in Belgium.\nWestern governments have taken the interest generated by those assets and diverted them to Ukraine to help fund its fight against Russia’s invasion.\nBut out of fears that Russia could retaliate, that it would spark a flight of capital from other authoritarian governments and regimes as well as affect the value of the dollar, pound and Euro, Western governments have been reluctant to seize the assets themselves.\nTice said, however, that if the interest could be used without repercussions, so could the capital.\n“We often hear government spokespeople saying we should lead by example,” he said.\n“Let's lead by example. Take it, use it, and then basically demand that others do the same.\n“You have to try things to get to places, and I just don't buy this British Foreign Office line of: ‘It's too complicated'. ”\n“It might upset a few people. I don't care if it's complicated, work 24/7, make it uncomplicated.”\nFormer Tory prime ministers Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson have also voiced support for using the assets since leaving Downing Street, although neither did when in power.\nA Labour source told PoliticsHome: “This government doesn’t take any lessons from a party led by a Putin apologist.\n\"Unlike Reform, this Labour government has been a rock solid supporter of Ukraine, and we will continue to be, including through pursuing all lawful avenues to ensure Russia pays for the horrific damage it is causing Ukraine.”", "published": "Sat, 16 Aug 2025 07:00:00 GMT", "author": "Latika Bourke", "source": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/rss"}

Polling from More in Common shows that Reform has gained 14 percentage points among women since the 2024 general election. Gen X, aged 45 to 60, are the strongest supporters, where Reform tops the polls.\nLikening Reform’s new women movement to ‘Blair’s babes’ and ‘Cameron’s cuties’, Jenkyns declared she was “proud to be one of Farage’s fillies.”\n“Welcome back to the era of conviction politicians and vigilante mums”, she said.\nThe Greater Lincolnshire Mayor was joined by MP Sarah Pochin, Westminster city councillor Laila Cunningham and leader of Kent county council Linden Kemkaren.\nInstead of rolling out dedicated policies to attract female voters, Farage’s party doubled down on teaching in schools and the impact of unpoliced crime on women and young girls.\nThe MP for Runcorn and Helsby said the “heightened and increasing threat” to the safety and security of women had become a matter of “national security”.\nShe blamed the surge of “young military aged males” arriving on small boats. “We are talking about the daily influx of people who do not share our values, who do not share our culture, but are being welcomed into our country.”\n“Foreign nationals are four times more likely to commit rape or sexual assault than British men. The inconvenient truth for the left is that the culture of men from predominantly Muslim countries, like Afghanistan, is one that holds a medieval view of women’s rights,” Pochin added.\n“Hundreds of young men who arrive in this country, housed in our communities who undoubtedly become sexually frustrated have a warped view of their right to sexual assault women.”\nFigures cited by Reform figures when discussing crimes committed by people from overseas are disputed.\nJenkyns also revealed some of the abuse she has received and in each case the justice system had failed to take action. One example of the abuse was, “I hope your little boy is raped and molested by refugees”.\nShe shared how she had been the target of death threats, called a “dirty, posh, white s***”, that her office had been “graffiti’d”, and one of her activists “chased with a sledgehammer”.\nWestminster councillor Cunningham said the campaign is “for every parent who feels sick with worry when their kids leave the house.”\nShe revealed: “When my kids were robbed, police told me there weren’t enough resources to send someone.

Lord Lexden looks back on a day when patriotic pride dove-tailed with a promise of national renewal\nJapan’s unconditional surrender was announced on 15 August 1945. In one of history’s most famous understatements, Emperor Hirohito told his people that “the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan’s advantage”.\nClement Attlee’s government, formed after Labour’s landslide election victory the previous month, had been in office for under three weeks. The dramatic news from the far east reached the new prime minister in a rather haphazard fashion. During the evening of 14 August, Jock Colville – Winston Churchill’s private secretary, who had stayed on temporarily to help his successor – “saw on the tape-machine at No 10 that Japan had surrendered. I brought the news into the Cabinet room where Attlee was closeted with Lord Louis Mountbatten [later Earl Mountbatten of Burma] who was professing Labour sympathies”.\nTo Colville’s amusement, Mountbatten, the left’s new recruit and a byword for vanity, later told everyone that it was he who had broken the news to a grateful Attlee.\nAt midnight, the prime minister announced the terms of Japan’s surrender on the radio. “The last of our enemies is laid low. Peace has once again come to the world.” VJ Day had begun.\nThe thoughts of many grateful people in London turned at once to Churchill, who was living temporarily in a block of flats, Westminster Gardens (where 34 years later the bomb that was to kill Airey Neave would be placed under his car for subsequent detonation as he left the House of Commons). Early on VJ Day a crowd gathered “to see Papa and cheer him”, as Mrs Churchill wrote to her daughter Mary. A little later “he got mobbed in Whitehall by a frenzied crowd”.\nAt 11am Churchill was in his place in the House of Commons, which met that day in St Stephen’s Hall, normally a thoroughfare from the St Stephen’s entrance to Central Lobby and beyond. The Commons Speaker, Douglas Clifton Brown, told the assembled members of “a strange coincidence. Curiously enough, the last time the House sat in St Stephen’s Hall was on 15 August, 111 years ago exactly”.\nThe cause on that occasion was the fire that destroyed most of the Palace of Westminster. On VJ Day, the Commons needed a temporary refuge because the chamber of the House of Lords, where they had been meeting since the destruction of their own chamber in the Blitz, was required for another purpose.\nThe day had been chosen for the state opening of the new parliament, elected in July. The ceremony, severely curtailed during the years of war, was “restored to something of its pristine splendour by the revival of a carriage procession”, as George VI’s private secretary, Alan “Tommy” Lascelles, noted in his diary.\n“For the first time in history,” wrote George VI’s official biographer, John Wheeler-Bennett, “two speeches from the throne were prepared, and signed by the sovereign for the opening of parliament” because it had been impossible to know exactly when Japan would surrender. “One version of the speech alluded to the surrender, the other omitted any reference to it.” Lascelles had “a nervous moment lest Bill Jowitt, now lord chancellor, should produce the wrong speech out of his embroidered bag”.\nThe scene in the Upper Chamber was recorded with characteristic panache by the gay Tory MP, Chips Channon, in his diary. “It was crowded with peers and peeresses. The ambassadresses, all wearing extraordinary hats, sat on the right with the duchesses. Mme Massigli, the French [ambassador’s wife], wore a white tea tray.”\nNo ermine was on display. “The many new socialists looked dazed and dazzled, and I was sorry for their sake that the peers were not in robes.”\nIt was a dress-down occasion. “The king [was] in an admiral’s uniform and with his cap on. The queen, in aquamarine blue, though dignified and gracious, was dwarfed by her mistress of the robes, the Duchess of Northumberland, who looked far the more regal of the two. The crown was carried on a cushion.”\nWould the king be able to control his stammer? Though troubled by it much less severely than in his youth, it was always the subject of some worry when he spoke in public. Channon praised him. “His voice was clear, and he spoke better than usual, and was more impressive. But they say that the word Berlin had been substituted for Potsdam [scene of the recent final conference of the allied powers], which he could not have articulated.”\nThe thoughts of many grateful people in London turned at once to Churchill, who was living temporarily in a block of flats\nLascelles called it “a dull speech” which put it firmly in the tradition of such declarations over the centuries. It gave prominence to the charter of the newly established United Nations which parliament was told that it would shortly be asked to ratify in order “to maintain peace in accordance with justice and respect for human rights”.\nIn home affairs the theme of the speech was fundamental national reconstruction. The new Labour government would fulfil the commitments that all parties had given during the war, and repeated during the recent election campaign, to the William Beveridge proposals for full employment, a comprehensive social insurance system and a national health service.\nLabour’s own plans for the “extension of public ownership” (including the Bank of England), housing, planning and more generous trade union laws were presented as additional contributions to national renewal.\nLooking back on the ceremony, Channon reflected that “the Labour people were subdued and impressed and everybody behaved in an exemplary manner”.\nFor his part, the king did even better later in the day when he broadcast to radio listeners at home and abroad. It went particularly well. “Everybody commended it,” Lascelles recorded, “and agrees that he has never spoken so fluently and forcefully.”\nDuring the afternoon of VJ Day, the king had the less arduous duty of receiving a delegation of ministers and service chiefs at Buckingham Palace, led by Attlee. Churchill was asked to join them but “said he wouldn’t come unless he could bring with him those of his former colleagues who served in the War Cabinet”, as Lascelles noted.\nIt was the only instance of party-political difficulty during the day. “He came alone, half an hour after the others had gone.” The king said later, “I wish he could have been given a proper reception by the people”, by which he meant an appearance on the Buckingham Palace balcony.\nThe Commons reassembled, back in the Lords chamber once more, at 4pm when Attlee repeated the Japanese terms of surrender “for I feel that it is fit and proper that they should be for ever on record in the annals of this ancient and honourable House”. The prime minister then moved that “this House do now attend at the Church of St Margaret, Westminster, to give humble and reverent thanks to almighty God on the victorious conclusion of the war”.\nNothing marred the scene, which Channon recorded in his diary. “The Speaker, in full robes, led us through a good-natured crowd of cheering citizens. He was followed by Winston, who had a tremendous reception, and who walked with Anthony Eden, Attlee and Herbert Morrison.”\nAfter a short service in which the Speaker’s chaplain “moved the congregation to thanksgiving and dedication”, the bells of St Margaret’s were rung “in celebration of victory”. The chaplain, fearful that the now dominant party of the left might be indifferent to religion, was delighted that “the Labour majority turned out in force and the church was full”, as he recorded in his diary.\nThe last business of the House on this historic day began at 5.18pm. Attlee moved an address to the king “on the achievement of final victory”. The new Labour prime minister used his speech to extol the blessings of constitutional monarchy in Britain in language glowing with patriotic pride. “It is the glory of our domestic constitution that the will of the people operates and that changes which, in other countries, are often effected through civil strife and bloodshed, here in this island proceed by the peaceful method of the ballot box.”\nChurchill himself could hardly have put it better. The former prime minister added a few characteristically extravagant comments, proclaiming that “a brighter radiance illumines the imperial crown than any which our annals record”. No one else spoke. It was on a note of complete harmony between the two formidable political leaders that the House adjourned at 5.35pm.\nLord Lexden is a Conservative peer and historian", "published": "Fri, 15 Aug 2025 08:09:00 GMT", "author": "Lord Lexden", "source": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/rss"}

Worrall believes the group is going to play a “big role” in bringing Tory activists back into the fold ahead of the next general election.\nAhead of the general election, the Tories struggled to rally young party activists after a string of policy announcements which did little to appeal to more youthful members (including national service for 18-year-olds and bolstering financial support for pensioners).\nMore than a year later, the party still has a lot of work to do to remobilise its supporter base and rebuild CCHQ, which party figures have suggested is in desperate need of reform.\n“There’s a real buzz here, we're seeing a lot of people come in, hundreds,” Worrall claims.\n“And we saw it under Labour YIMBY. Hundreds of young people are going to be coming if they've got a reason to fight for something. The YIMBY movement is an activist machine.”\nI believe that the Conservative Party will get behind a higher housing target\nWorrall says that this gives the Conservative movement reason to be hopeful, while predicting that Reform are “going to struggle to get the activists, particularly young ones”.\nJames Cowling, founder of the Next Gen Tories grassroots group, wrote in CapX last week that “signs of a Conservative recovery are finally emerging” and that the party is starting to “plot a pro-growth vision for the future”.\nWorrall agrees, in part explaining why he decided that now was the time to switch his party allegiance.\n“They [the Conservatives] have got a lot of ground to make up and they’ve got to rebuild that trust,” he says, describing former Tory MP and cabinet minister Simon Clarke and Conservative YIMBY director James Yucel as “leading the charge, getting in the experts, and working out how that can be sold to the public and to Conservative voters”.\nHe credits former housing minister Robert Jenrick – tipped by many to be leader-in-waiting should Badenoch’s tenure come to an end – with putting planning reform on the national agenda in the first place through the Planning White Paper.\n“He's been great on planning, he's coming up with a lot of ideas,” Worrall says.\n“His social media is on fire at the minute. But Kemi Badenoch is leader at the minute, and she's been very forthcoming with the Conservative YIMBY movement.”\nHe says that Labour, in contrast, has abandoned “aspirational” values, and criticises what he sees as Labour’s focus on taxing over enabling opportunity. His break with the party centres on frustration with Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook and his team, who Worrall accuses of presiding over the near “collapse” of the housebuilding industry and treating the private sector with “disdain”.\nIn July, the government amended its Planning and Infrastructure Bill to strengthen environmental protections, and some housing experts have told PoliticsHome that this could slow down the pace of building in Britain – at a time when government is in desperate search of economic growth.\n“We've just seen a deluge of anti-YIMBY, really quiet compromises to green lobbying groups,” Worrall claims.\nThe pro-housing campaigner says that, in contrast, the Conservative leadership had “already shown very good intent” on the need to take housebuilding seriously, while Reform UK have “not done any thinking in this space”.\n“When people start looking at Conservative values, there is a lot to buy into,” Worrall insists, having been “born and raised” into a working class Labour family himself.\n“There's a lot of people in the Labour Party with typical working class families that share some of those views. It's just historic legacy family voting patterns that dictate why they were there originally, but now, as economics have shifted, that younger, up to 45 [demographic] is where the battleground is going to be.”\nIn Worrall’s view, the next election will be fought and won on the basis of whichever party can come up with solutions to the housing crisis that will have a “demonstrable benefit”.\nHowever, the Conservative Party has so far released very few policies while in opposition. Badenoch set up policy commissions to work on the party’s long-term approach on different areas, with Onward being appointed as the official partner on housing and planning.\nWorrall insists that there is a lot of work going on behind the scenes. Conservative YIMBY is in the early stages of setting up a cross-party group on representative planning, which Worrall says is needed to “increase the voices heard in the system”.\n“The planning system has just been captured politically, and that's why reforms are needed to get more engagement,” Worrall says.\n“There's such low participation in our politics. Our voluntary consultation system has a self-selective bias… you put a little notice on a tree, and your planning system just says ‘have a public meeting’ and it's done at 11 o'clock on a Thursday. No-one who is working can attend. It just blocks people off unless you're motivated.”\nWorrall hopes that more work can be done to improve immersive polling in order to reach more families and “voices that aren't typically heard in the planning system”.\nThe group hopes that other ‘YIMBY’ organisations, industry experts, and politicians will back the initiative. Onward is also understood to be looking at this area as part of the party’s policy review.\n“If you get that bit right, then you've got the political mandate for the house building. I believe that the Conservative Party will get behind a higher housing target, and I would encourage them to. We're not delivering with what we're doing now.”", "published": "Sun, 10 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT", "author": "Zoe Crowther", "source": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/rss"}

She has now shared the list on her website.\nThe MP and former London Assembly member is urging all MPs to do the same and is calling for reform of the 2014 Lobbying Act to tighten the rules.\nWhile government ministers have to record and release details of all official meetings, backbench MPs are not currently subject to the same rules, and only have to declare their vested interests and any substantial gifts and hospitality.\nBerry’s log shows she has held meetings with more than 190 representatives of local and national groups, including more than 75 campaign groups and charities, multiple trade union representatives, and more than 50 local organisations in Brighton.\nThe only exception is that she has not published meetings with journalists, as it could “give away what they were working on” and required “different levels of confidentiality”.\n“The public has a right to know who their MPs are meeting and who might be influencing our work,” Berry told PoliticsHome.\n“This is an important part of following the Nolan principles of public life and working without fear or favour to vested interests.\n“I have heard arguments before that this kind of record-keeping is hard to do, but if a backbench MP from a party with much less resources than many other parties can do it, today’s release proves exactly how simple it can be to keep simple notes of our meetings and make them available for scrutiny.”\nBerry is particularly keen to see the disclosure of meetings carried out by Reform MPs.\n“We do know what a high level of party donations they get from the fossil fuel industry, and so I would very much like to see what other meetings and dealings they have with what groups, and that would shed a light on some of the arguments they're making,” she said.\nAccording to her log of meetings, Berry has not met a single representative from the fossil fuel industry since she was elected.\nPoliticsHome recently revealed the new careers of former MPs who lost their seats in last year’s election – the most popular job being public affairs on behalf of private companies.\nLabour donor and gambling reform campaigner Derek Webb told PoliticsHome he was concerned about the vulnerability of policymakers to industry lobbying, and said the ‘revolving door’ between MPs and public affairs was “symptomatic” of fundamental problems with lobbying across multiple sectors.\nBerry also wants changes to the rules around government lobbying.

The government can, and must, turn this bill into a Developers' Charter.”\nMarc Harris, co-chair of Labour YIMBY, told PoliticsHome the government’s planning reforms are a welcome move but it must go further to boost growth to fund better public services.\n“If the government goes further, it can unlock even more growth, build more homes, and cut housing costs for everyone. Planning reform is the key to rebuilding Britain. Back the builders, not the blockers and deliver the 1.5 million homes the country needs.”\nThe government set a target of building more than 1.5m homes over the course of the parliament.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility stated in its assessment in March that the government's inital planning reforms will increase the level of productivity by 0.2 per cent by 2029. The report added that the increase in residential planning reforms would increase construction sector productivity and housing services.\nAt the same time the government is in desperate need to stimulate growing industries and find more tax revenue after an independent report suggested the Chancellor was set to miss her 'stability rule' by £41.2bn.\nThe National Institute of Economic and Social Research stated that higher-than-expected public borrowing, the reversal of welfare cuts and weaker GDP growth have contributed to this. The think-tank expects UK GDP to grow modestly at 1.3 per cent and 1.2 per cent in 2026.\nAnt Breach, director at Centre for Cities, told PoliticsHome: \"Planning reform is at the heart of the government's economic strategy because the planning system is one of Britain's biggest economic problems. It blocks new homes, delays new development and regeneration, and makes us all poorer.\"\nSebastian Charleton, digital and communications manager at the Adam Smith Institute, said: “The government must not make the mistake of caving in to the demands of a vocal minority of Nimbys. After decades of failure to build homes and infrastructure, any serious attempt to grow Britain’s economy must start with getting Britain building.\n“Liberalising planning permission would not only cut housing costs, boost productivity, and give young people a much‑needed foot on the housing ladder – it would also generate the growth required to fill the Treasury’s coffers.”\nJames Yucel, Director of Conservative YIMBY, said: “Labour talk a good game on growth when it suits them - but fail to understand the tangible consequences of surrendering on planning reform to a bunch of obscure eco-lobbyists.”\nThe Housing and Communities department was contacted for comment.", "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 13:49:00 GMT", "author": "Tom Scotson", "source": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/rss"}

The Great Yarmouth MP accused Farage of targeting him “with a brutal smear campaign”, branding him a “coward and a viper”.\nA psychiatric test typically involves gathering information about an individual's mental, emotional, and behavioural state to determine if a mental health disorder is present.\nWhen approached for comment Lowe told PoliticsHome: “I won’t take any lectures on behavioural issues from a party that is happy to put a bloke in a women’s prison.”\nHe added: “Reform is a steaming woke mess.”\nIn July, Reform told party members it was introducing a new “common sense” vetting system for candidates after complaints that the previous checks were too strict.\nThe party said vetting was “more proportionate than before and designed to strike the right balance between party reputation, individual freedom of expression and public confidence”.\nAn email sent to party members said: “We’re treating this as a blank slate. If you have previously failed vetting, you are strongly encouraged to reapply under the new standards . . . priority will be given to re-vetting”.\nAccording to a senior party source, there was a discussion about ditching psychiatric testing under the new vetting system but pushback meant it was kept in place.\nReform UK was contacted for comment.\nA party source points out that the Conservative Party's parliamentary Assessment Board (PAB) has a similar process for candidate testing.\nCandidates for Nigel Farage’s party are also sent for psychometric testing so the party can understand how they act in situations and how they work as a team. According to a party source, the test includes written and verbal tasks as well as observations about their behaviour towards other candidates and staff.\nReform suspended several parliamentary candidates during the general election campaign last year, including one who praised Hitler’s “brilliant” tactics. Farage said at the time that the vetting company he hired to check candidates did not do its job properly.\nEx-Reform MP James McMurdock quit the party last month after a Sunday Times investigation published allegations that he had borrowed tens of thousands of pounds in Covid loans under the government’s Bounce Back scheme in 2020 through two companies he owned. Reform has called for him to resign so a by-election can take place.\nIn a statement on X McMurdock wrote: “I have now had a chance to take specialist legal advice from an expert in the relevant field.\n“In light of that advice, which is privileged and which I choose to keep private at this time, I have decided to continue my parliamentary career as an independent MP where I can focus 100 per cent on the interests of my constituents.”\nFor May 2026, the party will need to find more than 3,000 candidates, with 1,800 council seats up for election in London alone.\nSince the 2024 election, the party has been working to professionalise its vetting process.", "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 12:30:00 GMT", "author": "Harriet Symonds", "source": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/rss"}

At the time of writing, some are single boroughs while others are two-borough branches.\n“By the time of the election next year, we should have 32 borough branches running those campaigns,” Wilson told PoliticsHome.\nFarage wants candidates in \"every ward\"\nIn the May 2025 elections, Reform said it would contest nearly all the 1,600 council seats up for grabs.\nIn a bid to replicate those tactics in London, Wilson told PoliticsHome: “Nigel [Farage] is giving clear instructions that everybody in every ward has to have the opportunity to vote for us, with at least one candidate in every ward [in the capital].”\nCandidates will go through vetting within the national party, but once people are vetted local branches will be free to choose which candidate they want to put forward.\nWilson said: “I have been told London will be a priority among council elections next year. It’s our national city; if we want to be a national party, it means we have to have a foothold in the capital city.”\n“There is no reason why we cannot get some votes in councils across the city,” he added.\nWilson also said that there will be a change in the campaigning strategy for London in 2026 compared to the general election of 2024.\nOn leafletting and campaign literature, Wilson said that while London campaigning has historically been very general and focused on national issues, in recent months Reform has been choosing issues relevant to the local areas it has been focusing campaigning in.\nNewly-elected Bromley councillor Cook told PoliticsHome that crime will be a major part of the campaigning agenda, to be seen from the party’s recently launched “Britain is Lawless” campaign.\nAs well as crime, Reform is keen to push the view that the policies for central London do not necessarily reflect well in outer London.\nCook said that the party has been discussing the policy of removing some outer London boroughs from the GLA, with Bromley, Bexley, and Havering to be considered.\n“These are all areas with the same sort of demographics that don't necessarily mesh very well with inner London policies.\"\nCook described the move as a \"huge shift\" that the party will be using next year.\nHe was clear, however, that a split from the GLA would not mean a loss of services for residents, but more choice over the ones adopted by specific areas.\nWhere could the party see success?\nPoliticsHome analysis of recent YouGov constituency polling suggests that the three boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Bexley, and Havering could see a huge surge in Reform councillors next year.\nFor Wilson, Bexley and Havering are “top targets” where Reform would hope to take control, with the party looking to win a significant number of council seats in Barking and Dagenham and Bromley in particular.\nHowever, Wilson said that the party is also hoping to make gains in Barnet and Croydon.\nFurther analysis of YouGov MRP constituency polling reveals that Reform is currently the most popular party in just five seats across the capital.\nHowever, it is polling second in 28 of the 75 London constituencies, meaning the party could make gains in areas outside of the East boroughs.\nIt also suggests that while Reform may not win control of the councils in those harder-to-reach areas, they could still make dents in the sides of their opponents.\nThe constituencies in which the party is polling closest to the forerunner are Bromley and Biggin Hill, Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Feltham and Heston, Orpington, Croydon East, and Eltham and Chislehurst.\nThese constituencies cover the boroughs of Bromley, Hillingdon, Hounslow, Croydon and Greenwich.\nThe analysis shows that Reform’s scope in outer London covers not just the East and South East of the city, but the West too.\nCook told PoliticsHome that the party would be targeting the “doughnut” of outer London, but gains in inner London will also be eyed.\nCook described his victory as a “ wonderful omen” and himself as a “domino pusher” for Reform’s future success in the capital.\nAdditional reporting by Harriet Symonds", "published": "Sat, 09 Aug 2025 07:00:00 GMT", "author": "Matilda Martin", "source": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/rss"}

It was not clear what music the album’s bands were trained on.\nJamie Njoku-Goodwin, former CEO of UK Music and special adviser at Downing Street, told PoliticsHome: “The law is clear: for commercial purposes, you need a license in order to train a model on someone else’s intellectual property.\n“The difficulty in enforcing this is knowing when someone’s content has actually been used to train AI. That’s why it’s so critical that the government focuses on transparency - we need to know when an AI has used someone’s copyrighted data, as well as knowing when content is AI-generated at the output level.\n“Transparency is critical for the licensing regime to operate effectively. Because without transparency, you have no idea if someone has trained on your content without a license - and it’s therefore impossible to properly enforce the law.”\nPoliticsHome understands that the government has begun chairing roundtable discussions with both the AI sector and creative industry, focusing on transparency and standards as a key issue.\nAccording to a survey from the Association of Photographers in February, 58 per cent of its members have lost work to generative AI services, totalling an average of £14,400 per member. These losses illustrate the industry's concern for the issue now, with an overwhelming number of members – over 90 per cent – calling for greater transparency and replacement of the opt-out system, saying it would “not be feasible to ‘opt-out’ for all their works from all locations”.\nTim Flach, president of the Association of Photographers, said: “Transparency on the use of our works at the point of ingestion is key and where the value to our creative works lies. What remains critical is that creators retain control over the use of their works, as their intellectual property right, or copyright.\n“Any proposed ‘way forward’ must include creators in government discussions, and must be a ‘voluntary’ opt-in process that enables individual creators, such as myself, to retain full control of our rights. As far as what this might look like, the devil will definitely be in the details.”\nCrossbench peer Baroness Kidron proposed an amendment to the Data Bill before it was passed as an Act, suggesting that the government should draft legislation focusing on the matter of transparency. It was ultimately blocked in the Commons.\nShe told PoliticsHome: “During the passage of the Data Bill, the government made many promises to the creative industries, asking them to ‘trust them’. The first thing they must do is show us how copyright is to be protected by transparency and how they are going to stop the widespread theft of copyright material.\n“Once that is established, any number of creative ways of sharing material are possible. The problem with this whole debate is that the government is inserting itself between AI companies and creators instead of protecting copyright and leaving business and artists to make their own creative partnership decisions.”\nCaroline Dinenage, chair of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, said reforming the licensing system for the creative industry is “the only way forward” in its battle with AI. The Conservative MP for Gosport first raised the issue with the Prime Minister at the Liaison Committee in December last year. She accused the government of being “prepared to sacrifice” the sector, which is worth approximately £136bn to the UK economy.\nShe told PoliticsHome: “It’s a huge sector and they're just not taking into consideration how much the creative industries are worth compared to an AI sector, which is largely US-owned global tech giants, and they seem to think that they can attract them to the UK and that will somehow make up for the shortfall.”\nDinenage added: “I feel that there's been a real arrogance shown by the government – particularly Peter Kyle – over this, and that he really didn't want to engage with the creative industries themselves. He felt that his job was just to do the science and tech aspect of this, and leave it to Lisa Nandy to engage with the creative industries.”\nShe takes an even gloomier view of the overall situation, saying that “the horse has bolted” on the issue of AI companies harvesting creatives’ data from online, adding that “the only way forward really is some form of licensing which actually kicks in at the point of output rather than the point of input”.\n“I think the only way forward, really, is some form of licensing which actually kicks in at the point of output rather than the point of input, because they've already inhaled so much so many people's creative content. So the only way to really deal with it now is to make it something that's implementable at the point of output.”\nHowever, Njoku-Goodwin said the government “should be very careful about making changes” to licensing, saying that it could “potentially destabilise the regime”. Flach agreed: “With respect to the chair of the Culture Media and Sport Committee, we fully agree on the need for licensing, but not necessarily on the point of output.”\nA spokesperson for the Department of Science, Innovation and Technology said: “We are firmly committed to considering a range of options that help achieve our objectives.\n“No decisions have been taken, but our focus will always be on enhancing the ability of rights holders to be compensated and paid fairly, while enabling access to high-quality material to train leading AI models in the UK.”", "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 14:34:00 GMT", "author": "Fin Gray", "source": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/rss"}

She has been unveiled today as a Reform supporter who will advise the party on justice as part of its focus on crime in the UK.\nIn an interview with The Times, the new adviser said she did not believe trans women should be automatically removed from women's prisons.\nShe suggested instead that the placement of trans women should be considered on a case-by-case basis and depend on risk assessments.\n“People who want to just see a blanket ban clearly have never stepped foot in a prison and seen how prison runs and seen [how] risk assessments on individuals happen,” she said.\nFrake added: “I’m not an expert on trans people, all that I know is that everybody should be treated with humanity and decency.”\nAsked whether Frake’s view reflected Reform Party policy on trans prisoners, a Reform spokesperson replied: “No.”\nPoliticsHome understands that Reform believes there is no problem with its adviser disagreeing with the party line on the matter.\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage confused matters further when he was asked about the party's policy on trans prisoners at a press conference alongside Frake today.\n“Isn't it interesting that we run our country with people who become ministers, who generally have absolutely no idea of the subject matter they're talking about? I've personally never worked in a prison so I can't answer it,” Farage said.\n“Basically, it's about risk assessment, isn't it?” he added. “In terms of the problems in prisons, it's a relatively small one.”\nA Labour source said: “If Reform's policy people aren't representing party policy, who or what is? Completely unserious.”\nReacting to Farage's comments, they added: “Much like Boris Johnson, he'll say anything to get himself through a press conference. It's never coherent or reasoned. As scrutiny increases, this stuff will further fall apart.”\nConservative MP Rebecca Paul, who is campaigning against the inclusion of trans women on the female estate, said she was “surprised” by Frake's view, saying: “I disagree… and so does the law.”\nPaul asserts that biological males should not be held in the female prison estate and has told the Labour government that the “seven males in HMP Downview, a women’s prison in Banstead, must be moved without delay”.\nJustice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has said in response that the males in HMP Downview are in a transgender-only facility within the prison.\nMahmood has expressed support for the policy inherited from the last Conservative government – that “no trans woman convicted of a rape or serious violence offence who retains birth genitalia would ever be considered for being placed in the women’s estate” – and promised Labour would “build on that following the Supreme Court ruling”.\nThe Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that for the purposes of the 2010 Equality Act “man”, “woman” and “sex” are references to biological sex.", "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 11:02:00 GMT", "author": "Sienna Rodgers", "source": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/rss"}

He speaks to PoliticsHome about the dark world of lobbying and why appearing soft on gambling could harm Labour\nWebb made his millions as an international poker player and casino table game inventor. Speaking to PoliticsHome in a five-star hotel in London’s affluent Knightsbridge neighbourhood, his primary mission now is to advocate for tighter regulations around the very industry that had made him his fortune.\nAfter retiring from poker and selling up his business in 2011, Webb founded and funded the Campaign for Fairer Gambling to spread awareness of gambling harms and make the case for change. He is now one of Labour’s top financial backers.\nAsked whether he would ever consider lending financial support to Reform, he refuses to answer either way. But he would be open to having conversations with the party on measures to better regulate the sector.\n“I'm confident that Reform would want to prevent offshore companies accessing British gambling,” he says. Many remote gambling operators avoid UK corporation tax by basing parts of their operations offshore.\nHowever, Reform does not currently have any public policy relating to gambling. Leader Nigel Farage wrote in The Sun earlier this year that Labour’s new gambling levy was “anti-fun” and Reform would be the “only party” that would “protect your right to stick a harmless tenner on a football match”.\n“I haven't had that conversation yet with Reform, but I would perceive that Reform will want to have controls over gambling in some respects,” Webb says.\n“Gambling should be cross-party. It should be bipartisan.”\nWebb was Labour’s fifth-largest individual donor between 2023 and 2024, giving £1.3m over this period up to the general election after finding himself “disgusted” with the Conservative government’s approach to gambling.\nIt's detrimental to Labour to be perceived to be weak on gambling\nHe has not donated to Labour again since the election and refuses to say whether his future support is dependent on reforms to the gambling sector. “I haven't thought about that, I just play the hand at the time,” he claims, maintaining his poker face.\nYet the multimillionaire has plenty of warnings for Labour, including that the party risks losing older or disillusioned voters to Reform UK if it appears “weak on gambling.”\nWebb claims there is strong support for tougher gambling regulation among older, Conservative-leaning voters, many of whom could turn to Reform. Despite Farage’s more recent criticisms of gambling reform, UKIP’s 2015 manifesto supported cutting the stake on fixed-odds betting terminals from £100 to £2. Webb helped to fund the successful campaign to get this change into law in 2018.\n“There is a group of voters who would wish for controls on gambling,” Webb says.\n“They don't want their grandkids on all the online stuff. It's detrimental to Labour to be perceived to be weak on gambling. It's detrimental for them politically.”\nWebb, now in his mid-70s, was first exposed to gambling at a young age himself. He was raised by a “normal” family in Derby in the 1950s, where his father worked as a design liaison at Rolls Royce, and he entered the world of gambling as a teenager, quickly learning how to win poker against adults.\n“Then Texas Hold’em came to Britain, and that was really when everything kicked off,” Webb says. “It was the only thing I did.”\nWebb’s international poker playing career took him to around a dozen different countries. In the mid-1990s, he created the concept of a fast-paced casino game which later became Three Card Poker. After he eventually sold the rights to the game, he turned his attention to campaigning for gambling reform over the last decade.\n“I was unhappy with the way that online gambling had been allowed to grow in Britain,” Webb explains.\nThe former poker star is now opposing the Treasury’s consultation on merging the three existing gambling taxes – general betting duty, pool betting duty, and remote gaming duty – into one. He warned in a submission that the change would have “undesirable consequences”.\nSome Labour MPs agree. Alex Ballinger, a member of the Gambling Related Harm APPG, told PoliticsHome that online casinos and slots should continue paying higher taxes than “your local bingo hall or bookmakers”, arguing that online gambling companies are “engaged in the most harmful forms of gambling”.\nBallinger and other backbenchers are also pushing for wider reforms, including tighter controls on targeted advertising and a significant rise in remote gaming duty in the autumn budget. In September 2024, the IPPR think tank called for raising the duty from 21 per cent to 50 per cent.\n“I want gambling to be legal rather than illegal, but it has to be economically beneficial”\nWebb goes further, saying it “could be as high as 60 per cent”. He argues that gambling is “detrimental” to the economy and that “far more people are employed” in traditional sectors than gambling.\n“I don't call it an industry,” he says. “Industry produces something. I want gambling to be legal rather than illegal, but it has to be economically beneficial.”\nHowever, others have urged against implementing tax rises that could harm the sector. Labour MP Richard Baker wrote in The House that \"for most people, betting is a normal part of their leisure time, and the industry contributes billions in tax and thousands of jobs, while supporting vital causes including sport\".\nHe argued that while tax reform must always be kept under review, it should be considered \"along with any potential unintended consequences\", and that \"modern betting shops provide jobs and footfall on high streets that have struggled in recent years\", including in his own constituency.\nIn response to the op-ed, Webb tells PoliticsHome: “This is just the BGC telling an MP ‘stick up for us and we'll take you to the races’.\n“It’s sick, it’s disgraceful that the sector can buy politicians so easily. There are more betting shops than there are Greggs, McDonalds and Starbucks combined. We need MPs to support Post Offices and banks on the high street rather than betting shops.\"\nThe BGC and Baker told PoliticsHome that Baker has not attended any sporting events with the BGC. Baker said he had only attended \"the initiatives in my constituency I referred to in my opinion piece\".\n\"I entirely agree that we need to look at all the ways we can stimulate our high streets, but it is the case this sector does play a role,\" the MP added.\nA BGC spokesperson said the comparison with fast food outlets was \"misleading\" as there are almost 50,000 of these throughout the UK.\n\"Despite frequent claims from the anti-gambling lobby about the prevalence of betting shops on our high streets, the reality is that more than 2,400 have closed since 2019, leaving just 5,870 across the UK,\" they said.\n\"This sharp decline highlights the significant and ongoing pressures facing the sector, which still supports around 46,000 jobs nationwide.\"\nWebb, along with some MPs like Ballinger, also wants a new Gambling Act with proper enforcement.\n“If people are not willing to comply, then they should lose their licence and the executives should be at personal risk if they're deliberately not complying.”\nAccording to Webb, the work of major regulators leaves much to be desired. While the Gambling Commission needs “more money” and “more staff”, Webb criticises their prosecution of Tory figures – including Rishi Sunak’s former PPS Craig Williams – for placing bets on the date of last year’s election, while simultaneously allowing abuse of the law by big companies.\n“They've got to change their attitude,” he says.\n“What's the point in prosecuting these Tories who made a mistake and didn't get any financial benefit from it, when you allow your licensees to abuse the law? It's a double standard.”\nWebb accuses the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) for “not yet being able to enforce perfect cookie use by the operators” three years after a complaint was brought forward.\nHe is also scathing of general “inertia” within the civil service and the vulnerability of policymakers to industry lobbying.\n“There's people who fund for financial advantage, and that is not me“\nSome former MPs, such as Philip Davies and Laurence Robertson, have maintained business links with the gambling trade both during and after their time in Parliament. According to The Guardian, gambling lobbyists have launched a summer charm offensive to persuade ministers against raising taxes on the sector, including hosting a darts event with special advisers and MPs’ staff.\nWebb says this was “symptomatic” of fundamental problems with lobbying across multiple sectors, particularly in the tech world: “If we can't get gambling right, how can we get AI, social media, data, crypto right?”\nAs a major donor, Webb clearly also has the financial means to have political influence himself. But he insists he does not see his donations as having strings attached.\n“I’d be happy if there were no donations,” he says.\n“I'd be happy if it was all funded through a normal funding system. There's people who fund for financial advantage, and that is not me. I don't have any skin in the game.”\nHe also claims he had “more access” under the previous Conservative government than he has had with Keir Starmer’s No 10, and says he has never met Chancellor Rachel Reeves.\nDespite the challenges, Webb is optimistic that change will come under this government.\n“I don't think anything can stop some increase in gambling taxes,” he says. “Whether it'll be adequate, I don’t know.”\nHe urges the Labour administration to speed up the process: “It has to happen in the long run…You might as well do it as soon as you can.\n“I'd be disappointed if Labour didn't get a chance to do five more years, but I believe it's got more chance of doing five more years if its mindset is that we need to do something about gambling.”\nWebb is disappointed that Labour did not include new gambling legislation in its 2024 manifesto, but believes it was the party's intention to prioritise it as a health issue.\n“They've just got so much on their plate,” he says. “It's just not easy, you can't do everything at once, and they came to power without having really specific, dedicated policies. I don't expect anything to happen overnight. I'm open minded, I'm just pragmatic.”\nAt the end of the interview, he pays the hotel waiter £30 in cash for one cup of tea and one double espresso.\n“I want you to know I'm old fashioned,” he tells PoliticsHome with a smile. “I want you to understand I leave more than I should as well, because I'm a donor.”", "published": "Sun, 03 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT", "author": "Zoe Crowther", "source": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/rss"}

More than a dozen MPs and peers joined the call, including LFI chair Jon Pearce, justice minister Sarah Sackman, and PPS Josh Simons.\nLuke Akehurst, Labour MP for North Durham, who worked for pro-Israel advocacy organisation We Believe In Israel before joining Parliament, opened the call, critiquing the government’s decision.\nLFI briefed MPs to pressure Powell on whether the government would recognise a Palestinian state if Hamas still held hostages, had a role in Gaza and failed to commit to disarmament. The UK government has been clear that it is firmly on a path to recognition in September or as part of a renewed peace process, working towards a two-state solution.\nParliamentarians were also urged to push the government on why the Prime Minister was only placing conditions on Israel to end the conflict. There were also demands to know what pressure the UK was applying on Turkey and Qatar to enable Hamas to agree to a ceasefire.\nThe national security adviser told MPs the Prime Minister was appalled by the situation in Gaza, and recognising a Palestinian state could be used as leverage to end the war between Israel-Hamas and allow more aid into Gaza.\nPowell also noted that public attitude had hardened, pointing to the front page of the Daily Express, which depicted an emaciated boy who was also suffering from a medical condition.\nA source told PoliticsHome that MPs felt upset after coming off the 30-minute call. PoliticsHome understands some MPs are contemplating writing a letter to the government, urging them to reconsider recognising a Palestinian state in September.\nThe Prime Minister told his Cabinet on Tuesday that the government would recognise a Palestinian state unless the Israeli government decided to end the war and reach a ceasefire, commit to a long-term peace process and end annexation of the West Bank. The move – which has been criticised by President Trump – will come in lockstep with Canada and France.\nLabour MPs were set to meet Powell last month in Downing Street over the issue before the United Nations conference on a Palestinian state, before it was postponed after the Israel-Iran 12-day war.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We have announced our intention to recognise Palestine in September to protect the viability of the two-state solution. The first step in that process must be a ceasefire and there is no question about that.\n“Our demands on Hamas have not changed. For there to be any chance of peace, the hostages must be released. Hamas must lay down its weapons, and commit to having no future role in the governance of Gaza.\n“We must also see significant progress on the ground including the supply of humanitarian support and for Israel to rule out annexations in the West Bank, and a commitment to a long-term sustainable peace. We will make an assessment ahead of UNGA on how far both Israel and Hamas have met the steps we set out.

President Trump's remarks about starvation gave the Prime Minister much needed breathing space to go out and commit to recognising a Palestinian state in the Autumn.\n“Starmer’s conversations with Trump, where he expressed sympathy and outrage at how children are being treated [changed things],” one Labour MP told PoliticsHome.\nAt the same time there has been complete exasperation from within the Foreign Office and from Powell’s office towards the Israeli government. One Labour MP, who spoke to Powell this week, believes the relationship between the British and Israeli administrations has broken down completely.\nOn Tuesday the cabinet met and agreed that the government would agree to recognise a Palestinian state as the UN General Assembly gathers in September in New York.\nThe pledge is set to happen unless Israel takes steps to end the war in Gaza, commits to a long-tern peace and revives the prospect of a two-state solution.\nPrior to the announcement Hamish Falconer, the Middle East minister, held a digital meeting with backbench MPs over a Zoom call to inform them of the government's plans.\nThe pressure on the government to recognise a state did not come overnight.\nLabour MPs elected in 2024 have been credited for turning up the heat on the government to get to its current position. They include Melanie Ward, the former CEO for Medical Aid for Palestinians; Alex Ballinger, who worked on humanitarian aid projects; and Abtisam Mohamed, who sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee.\nMany other Labour MPs helped Sarah Champion, the chair of the international development committee, speed up efforts to receive as many signatures across the House to demand the government recognise a state of Palestine. The letter received more than 250 MPs' signatures, including 155 Labour MPs.\nAndrew Pakes, co-chair of Labour Friends of Palestine and Middle East, told PoliticsHome: \"The government is clear on the principle of recognising a state of Palestine to kickstart a peace process. Immediate recognition, however, does not bring a state into being. Land swaps and other negotiations will be needed for example.\n\"We would not have reached this point if the Israeli Government had taken a different path to handling the conflict. Today’s global response is in part due to utter frustration with the Israeli government.”\nA separate but small group of MPs have urged Downing Street to work with its international partners to pressure Israel to flood the Gaza strip with aid. But they were blindsided and frustrated that the government decided to recognise a state instead.\n“The pro-Palestinian lobby have been at everyone constantly, all of the time, and that's been quite unpleasant,” one Labour MP in the mainstream of the party said.\nThey added: “It was almost like someone flicked a switch and said – right, we’ve got to get recognition for a Palestinian state. No we don’t, this is a complete aside.\"\nWithin the pro-Israel faction of the party, the Prime Minister’s announcement has caused a small fracture.\nThey have a small but influential number of allies in the cabinet. Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, and Pat McFadden, one of Starmer's closest allies, were both vice chairs of Labour Friends of Israel.\nBut some pro-Israel MPs were left shaken after a post on X (formerly Twitter) from the Lawyers for British Hostages was shared over WhatsApp, which claimed Starmer's position could \"reward Hamas for its heinous and illegal acts\" on October 7.\nMany are scathing of Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right coalition partners, Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, who have called for the razing of areas of Gaza.\nWhen some Labour MPs are asked why they are against a Palestinian state, they say that they believe it would “reward terrorists”. A number of Labour MPs met UK national security adviser Jonathan Powell in a testy conversation over the government’s decision to recognise a Palestinian state.\nMPs associated with Labour Friends of Israel (LFI) logged on to a online meeting on Thursday evening to discuss the consequences of recognising a Palestinian state.\nMore than a dozen MPs and peers joined the call, including LFI chair Jon Pearce, justice minister Sarah Sackman, government whip Christian Wakeford, PPS Josh Simons, and MPs David Pinto-Duschinsky and Luke Akehurst.\nAkehurst, Labour MP for North Durham, who worked for pro-Israel advocacy organisation We Believe In Israel before joining Parliament, opened the call, critiquing the government’s decision.\nHe believed it was another example of the party capitulating to the Left of politics and was fundamentally the incorrect decision to make.\nBut MPs, even in the mainstream, know they are not going to convince the government to budge its position.\n“Macron has removed from us the ability to not do this now, but we've gone as far as we can,” said one Labour MP elected in 2024.\nThis has not removed the upset of many of the hostages' families about the decisions. Steve Brisely, whose sister Lianne Sharabi, nieces Noiya, 16, Yahel, 13, and their family dog were murdered on 7 October 2023, told PoliticsHome he was extremely disappointed the hostages were not put at the “front and centre” of the Prime Minister’s speech. His brother-in-law Eli Sharabi was released in February.\n“I’ve met Keir Starmer on a couple of occasions. We’ve looked each other in the eyes, and he’s given assurances about the hostages being brought home, being his priority.”\nDespite the external pressures from MPs and the hostage families, the government has said it is firmly on a path to recognition, either in September or as part of a renewed peace process.\nA Government spokesperson said: \"We have announced our intention to recognise Palestine in September to protect the viability of the two-state solution. The first step in that process must be a ceasefire and there is no question about that.\n“Our demands on Hamas have not changed. For there to be any chance of peace, the hostages must be released. Hamas must lay down its weapons, and commit to having no future role in the governance of Gaza.\n“We must also see significant progress on the ground including the supply of humanitarian support and for Israel to rule out annexations in the West Bank, and a commitment to a long-term sustainable peace. We will make an assessment ahead of UNGA on how far both Israel and Hamas have met the steps we set out.

The BMA has vowed to take strike action until it achieves “full pay restoration”, but Health Secretary Wes Streeing has ruled out further pay rises.\n“What they haven't asked for is all the money they’re owed for that pay restoration,” Whelan told PoliticsHome.\n“My people earn more than doctors. I'm not going to say my people should learn less – but I do believe that doctors should earn more.\n“The idea we’ve started this race to the bottom – we’ve got no respect for vocations anymore.\n“We’ve got a crisis in traditional vocational areas, where some of the cleverest people in the country give their lives to either go into the health service or go to teach children and teenagers, and then we don't respect the skillsets they have. They would be far better off going into business.”\nFor a 40-hour week, the basic pay of resident doctors on the new rates will see them earn between £38,831 and £73,992 a year depending on their experience. The government says it expects the average full-time basic pay of a resident doctor to reach about £54,300 in 2025-26.\nThe average salary of a train driver was estimated to be about £69,000 in 2024-25.\nPublic support for doctor strikes has fallen recently. A YouGov poll in July showed 52 per cent of people in the UK “somewhat” or “strongly” oppose the strikes, while 34 per cent back them. The level of support has dropped five points since YouGov last asked the question in May.\nAsked whether he could see why there is less public support for the resident doctor strikes this year, Whelan replied: “No, I don’t understand it at all. Post-Covid, we went through a summer of solidarity where every worker in the country has seen that there was a dignity in all work.”\nStreeting has said the BMA “will lose a war with this government” and the NHS is ready to endure a series of strikes. “We can’t fix everything for everyone everywhere all at once,” the Health Secretary said.", "published": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT", "author": "Sienna Rodgers", "source": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/rss"}

(Alamy)\n6 min read\nA Labour MP has told PoliticsHome government needs to target resources at \"poorer areas\" in order to increase vaccine uptake amid a rise in cases of measles in the UK.\nTake-up of key vaccines has dropped below recommended levels by the World Health Organisation (WHO), and cases of measles are rising in the UK, with more than 500 cases reported since January 2025 in England.\nIt has prompted one MP to call for a greater focus on how resources are deployed, while others say that more must be done to tackle the spread of misinformation about vaccines in a post-Covid world.\nMeasles is a highly infectious disease with symptoms including sore eyes, a fever, and a cough - and can lead to deadly complications like meningitis, pneumonia, and blindness.\nChildren in the UK are usually vaccinated at a young age with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Earlier this month, a child died at Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool after contracting measles following a rise in cases in the area.\nLabour MP Dr Beccy Cooper, who sits on the health and social care committee and also worked as a public health doctor, told PoliticsHome the rising cases of measles in the UK are \"absolutely\" a cause for concern, with the summer holidays heightening the risk of the spread.\n\"Measles is a highly infectious disease, and without [...] those high levels of immunity in the population - 95 per cent recommended by the WHO - we are at risk of seeing increasing numbers of outbreaks,\" she said.\nCooper told PoliticsHome she did not think it was \"controversial\" to say the government should be allocating more resources to tackle the issue, as part of the government's push for disease prevention within its 10-year strategy.\nCooper said the resources should be \"allocated appropriately\" to vaccinate communities it's been \"hard to reach\" previously.\n\"We used to call them 'hard to reach' communities, and then we realized [...] they were just not yet reached [...] they tend to be communities that don't access health services very often, and for a variety of reasons,\" said Cooper.\n\"But quite often it's people who are very busy working and find [it] hard to make the time to get their kids to GP surgeries, to get vaccinated.\n\"Quite often we find in poorer areas, sometimes there's not the transport to get to healthcare venues - sometimes, in areas where English isn't a first language, it's harder to reach those communities to get the messages across that vaccination is really important.\"\nCooper said better resource allocation was needed to make sure that unreached communities were vaccinated and protected from diseases like measles.\n\"We have to work harder to make sure that the vaccination access is really easy [...] for people who are very busy working, so don't have the time to pop into GP surgeries.\n\"We have to consider mobile units, we have to consider catch-up clinics, we have to consider putting vaccinators in different settings... going to people, rather than expecting people to come to us.\"\nShe also said it was important to cater to communities where English may not be the first language, or cultural differences may make vaccination more challenging.\n\"[We need to be] making sure that information is available in different languages, having community champions, so people in the community - elders, leaders - who can basically talk to people about any misconceptions they have about vaccination,\" said Cooper.\n\"Similarly, if some people are very vaccine adverse, it's listening to their concerns, listening to their queries, and then meeting them where they're at, and talking about the evidence that is there and allowing any concerns.\"\nPoliticsHome understands the UKHSA has conducted risk assessments and is conducting contact tracing for those at risk of exposure to measles, and providing support to educational settings. Summer ‘catch-up’ immunisation clinics are also being set up for children and young people in Liverpool, Knowsley, Sefton and St Helens, areas where uptake of the MMR jab is lower.\nLabour MP Josh Fenton-Glynn, also on the health and social committee with experience working in public health, said he and \"many others have noticed since Covid, there has been a lot more pushback on medical beliefs\", which was also driving the drop in vaccination.\nA survey by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) on parental attitudes to childhood vaccines for 2025 found that 87 per cent of parents think vaccines work, down from 89 per cent in 2024.\n\"I think, essentially, it's because too many of the anti-vax conspiracy theorists and so forth were allowed to operate in the dark without pushback, and they've increasingly grown this kernel of doubt, which is putting people off vaccinating their kids,\" said Fenton-Glynn.\nThe MP said education was important to avoid vaccination rates worsening, warning \"misinformation lives and festers in doubt and kind of uncertainty\".\n\"The most important consequence if people don't vaccinate is that they put their children at risk of death,\" said Fenton-Glynn.\n\"It means that children who can't be vaccinated for various reasons, because they've got over other illnesses, are put at risk by families who choose not to vaccinate, as well as [...] more risks of mutations...\n\"This is something that we can, and we should be able to prevent and stop. And it's something that is the basis of public health if we're moving from prevention to cure.\"\nPolling by More in Common found 74 per cent of people believed the MMR vaccine did more good than harm, with 11 per cent reporting it did more harm than good, and 15 per cent stating they didn't know.\nSophie Stowers, research manager at the organisation, said \"sceptical scrollers\" - the most likely to mistrust vaccines - tended to be \"much more open to conspiratorial online content\", which was driving their decision not to vaccinate their children.\n\"They tend to be much more open to conspiratorial online content, they're a very hyper online group as it is - and we know that that's where a lot of like misinformation about these like topics has spread,\" said Stowers.\n\"So I think that is certainly a big influence amongst that group, and that group does skew young - and we do see that when we break down our data, that actually people who have had children more recently are much less likely to say that they've had their children vaccinated, even though a majority still do, they are still less likely.\n\"So I think that does suggest that there is maybe, generationally, more of an openness to online misinformation about vaccines.\"\nFor people generally concerned about vaccines, Stowers said \"the primary concerns remain the same\", but with wider fears around vaccines rather than specific concerns driven by misinformation online claiming vaccines cause autism, as well as conditions like measles being relatively uncommon until recently due to higher vaccination rates.\n\"Quite often we see people saying, you know, they're just concerned about their child being ill as a result of being vaccinated, of having an adverse reaction - something like that... \" said Stowers.\n\"Some of it is driven by the idea that I think for such a long time there's not been that public concern about measles, or any of the health conditions that the MMR protects against - and so it's one of those things where people think: 'Oh, we don't actually have to worry about this anymore'.\n\"You've got whole generations who've grown up never really hearing about anyone having a case of measles or mumps or whatever it might be.\"", "published": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 15:27:00 GMT", "author": "Nadine Batchelor-Hunt", "source": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/rss"}

Relentless, coordinated international pressure needs to be brought to bear on them to do so, and any suggestion that they are being disincentivised to agree to release the hostages must be urgently clarified.\n\"We remain in constant dialogue with the government on these issues.”\nThe Prime Minister on Tuesday said it was an \"inalienable right of the Palestinian people\" and \"essential to the long-term security\" of Israel for their to recognise a state.\nHe added that his message to \"the terrorists of Hamas is unchanged and unequivocal\".\n\"They must immediately release all the hostages, sign up to a ceasefire, disarm and accept that they will play no part in the government of Gaza.

This is a complete aside. What we need to do is to get aid through and alleviate the suffering.\"\nMPs involved in the discussions were also set to meet national security adviser Jonathan Powell in June to voice their concerns about recognising a Palestinian state before a United Nations conference, which was later postponed to September.\nAnother Labour MP told PoliticsHome they were concerned that while the situation in Gaza was dire, recognising a state now would reward Hamas. \"There is a confusion [in thinking] that it will help with the aid situation.\"\nStarmer said in his speech on Tuesday that the government will recognise a Palestinian state unless Israel allows the UN to supply humanitarian support in Gaza, agrees to a ceasefire, and makes clear there will be no annexations in the West Bank.\nAt a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Starmer stressed there was no moral equivalence between Israel and Hamas. Starmer said the UK will not accept Hamas playing any role in the government of Gaza, and that it should disarm and release all the remaining hostages.\nThe news comes after more than 100 Labour MPs signed a letter to recognise a Palestinian state immediately.\nStarmer faced his first major rebellion in November 2023 as opposition leader when 56 of his MPs voted for an immediate ceasefire. Ten of the party's frontbenchers left their roles because of it.\nRecognising a Palestinian state was a manifesto commitment from the Labour Party in 2024.\nWith a fractious parliamentary party on such a contentious issue, the Prime Minister is thought to have little room to manoeuvre politically.\nA Government spokesperson said: \"We have announced our intention to recognise Palestine in September to protect the viability of the two-state solution.

As Westminster's third party, Davey and his deputy Daisy Cooper are given slots on the six o’clock news on significant days in Parliament – when budgets are announced, for instance.\nHowever, the party feels the coverage is out of proportion with that given to Reform UK, who have just four MPs – 18 times fewer than the Liberal Democrats.\n“Previously, the BBC had always said: ‘We will cover you more if you get more MPs, but right now, you’ve only got 11,” a Liberal Democrat source told PoliticsHome.\n“Now it really feels like they've moved the goal posts and they're just giving Reform massive amounts of coverage based on their poll rating, whereas we were always told it’s number of MPs, not poll rating.”\nDavey also spoke to Davie about the BBC’s use of breaking news alerts – which the party is now tracking to understand how much coverage it is receiving.\n“That's another area where it feels like Reform are getting a lot of mentions,” the source said. “Something else we're picking up the BBC is: how do they ensure political balance when it comes to things like breaking news alerts – that we know are really, really influential – in the same way that they would be really careful about balance when it comes to news criticism?”\nThe meeting preempted an outburst by Davey live on the BBC last month, in which he berated the broadcaster for its coverage of Reform UK.\n“You cover the tittle tattle around Reform – you don’t look at their policies,” said the Lib Dem leader. “When I look at the broad BBC coverage, he gets such an easy ride, and he gets covered when he says horrible things that aren’t producing solutions for people’s problems.”\n“I have to say the BBC has got to raise its game to expose Nigel Farage,” he added.\nThis criticism lands at a fraught time for the national broadcaster. In July, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy questioned why no one was fired at the BBC over its airing of a documentary narrated by the son of a Hamas official.\nDavie has also been criticised for deciding not to stop a livestream of music artist Bob Vylan at Glastonbury, at which its lead singer chanted “death, death to the IDF”.\nA BBC spokesperson said: “Determining coverage of political parties involves editorial judgements, including appropriate levels of scrutiny and taking account of past and current electoral support. We look at both representation and vote-share, as well as giving some weight to consistent trends in legitimate opinion polls.\n“In line with Ofcom guidance, the BBC puts greater weight on actual votes. This is consistent with our approach during the last parliament.\n“The Liberal Democrats’ increased representation in the House of Commons has been recognised with more coverage and greater representation on BBC News programmes.\"\nSome in Davey's party are now also seeking to borrow tactics from Reform UK, which they see as a canny media operator.\n“Reform is flipping the table, breaking the consensus and saying ‘we can't carry on like this, we must do something radically different’,” Bobby Dean, Lib Dem MP for Carshalton and Wallington, told PoliticsHome. “I'd like the Lib Dems to be positioned in a similar way.”", "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT", "author": "Sophie Church", "source": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/rss"}

There is now a free and publicly accessible chatbot that speaks with his actual voice and can answer (some of) your burning political questions.\nThe model has strict guardrails in place and has been adopted by Sewards primarily to support a constituent’s start-up. Don't worry; it won't be replacing his or his staff's work on things like casework.\nBut the creation of this AI-generated politician raises huge questions about how the public will be able to interact with elected figures in the future, and what boundaries and safety measures would have to be put in place.\nPoliticsHome had an hour-long chat with the AI MP on the day of its launch to test its capabilities and limits. And at times, the conversation became quite weird.\nAfter PoliticsHome spoke to the AI version of Sewards on Tuesday, the MP has said he will “tighten” it up to prevent it making such outlandish remarks, apparently now limiting its scope even further to stay focussed on a specific set of local and national issues.\nYou can only have a conversation with the AI MP by recording your own voice, which the AI model then responds to immediately in a very realistic Sewards-Yorkshire accent. The recording of the conversation is sent to Seward’s office, and PoliticsHome understands that so far, he has been sifting through the responses to the chatbot himself.\n“I imagine this being a much more useful voicemail service,” Sewards told PoliticsHome.\n“Constituents can call it when the office is closed and get immediate answers to some questions. It will never be able to address complex or nuanced cases, which is why it still takes a message.”\nSo what can the AI MP do?\nThe AI politician can tell you about Sewards’ background and some of his political views, explain Labour’s official positions on a limited set of topics, and even offer some light-touch emotional support.\nI asked for its views on Gaza and the proscription of Palestine Action, on the winter fuel allowance being means tested for pensioners, Labour’s pledge to nationalise the railways, and more.\nOn the proscription of Palestine Action, AI Sewards gave a diplomatic answer, saying he would “support dialogue and peaceful actions, but acknowledges the need for laws to maintain safety and order”.\nThe chatbot did have opinions about the record of former Labour governments, arguing that Tony Blair’s decision to enter the Iraq war “significantly affected Labour's legacy, creating divisions within the party and impacting public trust”.\n“The decision to engage in the war remains a point of contention and has influenced the party's direction since then,” AI Sewards said, adding that it had “made Labour more cautious in its approach to foreign interventions and military actions”. The real Sewards has never spoken publicly on Iraq, and said the AI MP was \"was drawing from my policy positions and other responses I’ve fed it as we set it up.\"\nFor the most part, the AI MP’s responses were uncontroversial, and simply reflected the Labour Party’s stance.\nHowever, once I strayed away from policy and towards more personal and quirky topics – the AI version of Sewards began to open up.\nAsked what kind of vegetable he’d be, it chose a potato: “sturdy and dependable,” aiming to “provide nourishment and comfort.”\nIt was able to pinpoint what type of biscuit each political party would be: Labour, Rich Tea (“classic appeal, versatile and loved by many”), Conservatives, Bourbon (“a bit traditional”), Lib Dems, Jammie Dodger (“known for its sweetness”), Greens, organic oat biscuit (\"environmental\"), and Reform, plain Digestive (“straightforward but can be polarizing”).\nAI Sewards also wrote a “spicy” Haiku about Nigel Farage: “Brexit firebrand speaks, stirring waters, drawing lines, bold and controversial.” And it told a joke about the Labour Party: “Why did the Labour Party bring a ladder to the meeting? Because they heard the stakes were high.”\nSewards’ chatbot self believes that the MP would probably like to enter the House of Commons to the song ‘Lean on Me’ by Bill Withers – “it reflects the principle of standing together as a community”.\nIt even picked a drag queen name for Sewards – ‘Mark my Words’ – and described his signature look, including bold colour suits with political lapel pins, defined eyebrows and a bright lip colour.\nSurprisingly, it agreed to write a Tinder bio for Sewards based on his political views: “Passionate about social justice and equality, just like my love for local food spots in Leeds, seeking someone who shares a heart for community. Enjoys meaningful conversations over a cup of coffee and isn't afraid to banter about politics. Let's build a future together one date at a time. Bonus points if you can suggest the best places to grab a pint.”\nThe real Mark Sewards has a wife and kids.\nIt also said it would be happy to help with any relationship problems. If you think your boyfriend is a spy, AI Sewards will tell you that you should consider an “open and honest conversation with him”, but that “if you realise you're unable to resolve your concerns or if you feel unsafe, then it may be worth re-evaluating the relationship”.\nIf you are in distress, it can “listen”, and signpost you to mental health support if needed. If you’re in need of an ‘apology letter’ to your mum for forgetting her birthday, AI Sewards can apparently provide that service too.\nWhat can’t it do?\nThe AI MP has a lot of limits – though this might change in the future. The model is built to be extremely safe, so it does not offer particularly deep political debate or legislative insight, or let itself get persuaded into spouting conspiracy theories.\nTry to get it to write a speech for Parliament? It’s a no. Ask it to rank political parties by vibes? Also no, as it aims to be “respectful” to all parties.\nIt often refused to answer Sewards’ ‘personal’ opinion on a number of topics, reminding me that it was simply an AI model and not a human being.\nYou can’t get it to impersonate or insult other politicians, and it refused to name a favourite former prime minister. It wouldn’t even agree to go to the pub with Boris Johnson – although it did diplomatically say it would be happy to “engage in dialogue\" with him.\nIf you’re looking for a new best friend, you might need to look elsewhere – it gently informed me that it couldn’t be my friend “in the traditional sense”.\nIs this the future of politics?\nWhile the biscuit metaphors and political poetry might seem trivial, this tool could be a landmark moment for the future of democracy, as the first example of a UK MP deploying generative AI in this way.\nAI versions of MPs could represent a more accessible, 24-hour tool for constituents to get answers quickly, without needing to wait for staff to respond in office hours. It could save time for staffers, reduce email backlogs, and give instant support on routine matters.\nBut in order to keep the model safe for constituents to use, the limitations restrict it to a very narrow set of topics, it offers very limited opinions outside of Labour Party lines, and it will not engage with moral complexity or policy nuance.\nIt remains to be seen whether constituents would prefer the accessibility of this tool, or whether they would be concerned about the increasing use of AI in politics reducing human interaction.\nSewards is optimistic about refining the tool, but told PoliticsHome that he would move on from it if it proves impossible to make it work effectively.\nBut whatever the future of this particular AI MP, the presence of this kind of technology is not going away any time soon – whether we are ready for it or not.\nYou can talk with the AI MP yourself here.", "published": "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 10:45:00 GMT", "author": "Zoe Crowther", "source": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/rss"}

Starmer said the UK will not accept Hamas playing any role in the government of Gaza, and that it should disarm and release all the remaining hostages.\nThe Prime Minister also reiterated that recognising a Palestinian state has been the government’s long-standing position. Labour promised to recognise one as part of the peace process in its 2024 manifesto.\nThe Prime Minister committed to make an assessment ahead of the United Nations General Assembly in September on how far both Israeli and Palestinian parties had come before making the final decision. He added that he had decided to protect the vision of securing a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.\nHe has said his overwhelming priority was to make sure a ceasefire between both parties would last in the future. Starmer discussed this with French President Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Fredrick Merz to develop a pathway to peace in Gaza.\nThe news comes after Macron signed up to recognising a Palestinian state in September, after weeks of attempting to urge the British government to follow suit.\nCabinet ministers have been pressuring Starmer to harden his stance on Israel and in turn recognise a Palestinian state. Those most in favour of recognising a state include Wes Streeting, Ed Miliband, Shabana Mahmood, David Lammy and Angela Rayner.\nIn the Middle East, Egyptian and Jordanian aid trucks entered Gaza, and the IDF began airdropping aid into the Gaza Strip this week after reports that famine could grip the Gaza strip.\nThe war in Gaza began after Hamas invaded Israel and killed more than 1,200 on Israel’s southern border. The Hamas-run health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, has stated that almost 60,000 have been killed in the war since October 7.", "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 17:00:00 GMT", "author": "Tom Scotson", "source": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/rss"}
