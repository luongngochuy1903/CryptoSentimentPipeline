{"title": "Ethereum Goes ZK-First: L1 zkEVM Roadmap Unveiled", "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-goes-zk-first-l1-zkevm-roadmap-unveiled/", "text": "The Ethereum Foundation has set a twelve-month clock running on one of the most audacious upgrades in the network’s decade-long history: replacing full block re-execution with real-time verification of succinct zero-knowledge proofs native to Layer 1. “Ethereum is going all in on ZK,” research engineer Sophia Gold declared in a July 10 blog post that sketches the path to an L1 zkEVM capable of handling live main-net traffic without compromising decentralization or security.\nEthereum Goes All-In On ZK\nGold’s plan begins by letting validators opt into so-called “ZK clients.” Instead of replaying transactions, these clients will “statelessly verify” three independent proofs—each produced by a different zkVM mirroring the EVM—to achieve the same defence-in-depth that client diversity provides today. Proof verification is quick enough, and the artefacts compact enough, that downloading several proofs per block is “very reasonable,” she wrote.\nFor the first release the heavy cryptography can run off-chain, provided the Glamsterdam hard fork introduces pipelining to buy provers a few extra seconds. Once a super-majority of stake is comfortable, gas limits will rise to levels that make proof verification, rather than re-execution, a hardware necessity. Those same proofs can then feed an EXECUTE precompile, opening the door to native zk-rollups.\nTo prevent bottlenecks, the Foundation proposes a strict “real-time” proving target: ninety-nine percent of main-net blocks must be proved in ten seconds or less—well within the twelve-second slot time minus propagation overhead. Proof systems must hit 128-bit security and stay under 300 KiB without trusted recursive wrappers, though a temporary floor of 100 bits is tolerated during the first months.\nA parallel effort focuses on “home proving.” Gold argues that some solo stakers running validators from their living rooms should also be able to generate proofs, providing a final bulwark against censorship. The Foundation therefore caps on-premise capital expenditure at $100,000—just above today’s 32-ETH stake—and limits power draw to 10 kW, a load compatible with residential EV chargers. “More than hardware cost, the most significant constraint for home proving … is energy usage,” she noted.\nThe announcement lands amid a break-neck zero-knowledge arms race. Last month Succinct’s open-sourced SP1 Hypercube zkVM proved 93 percent of 10,000 live Ethereum blocks in an average 10.3 seconds, edging inside the Foundation’s latency envelope—albeit on a GPU cluster costing roughly $300,000–400,000.\nBetween now and Devconnect Argentina in mid-November, the Foundation expects zkVM teams to drive those figures down to the point where proofs can be minted on a single rack and verified almost instantly by every validator. Gold framed the competition as a “race to real-time,” one whose finish line will see Ethereum transformed into “by far the largest ZK application in the world.”\nShould the roadmap hold, 2026 could open with an Ethereum mainnet where every block, transaction and smart-contract call is vouched for by cryptographic certainty rather than expensive re-execution—a radical shift that promises higher throughput, lower hardware barriers and new on-chain privacy primitives, all without splitting the chain or compromising its core ethos of trustless computation.\nAt press time, ETH traded at $2,984.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 13:30:48 +0000", "author": "Jake Simmons", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/ethereum/feed/"}
{"title": "Ethereum Daily Chart Signals Strength As Bulls Reclaim Momentum", "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-daily-chart-signals-strength/", "text": "A crypto analyst stated that Ethereum continues to show resilience on the daily timeframe as of July 7. After a period of consolidation, ETH is holding above the key support level and maintaining its higher-low structure, and if ETH defends its current range, the path toward higher targets will remain intact.\nEthereum Holds Above Key Support Zone\nIn an X post, Believer pointed out that ETH has reclaimed key Fibonacci support at $2,572 and is now grinding higher toward the resistance level. The immediate focus is on flipping $2,605 into support, which would confirm short-term bullish control and open the door toward $2,665, which is the next key resistance level.\nTechnically, the indicators are starting to favor the bulls, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 55.73, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has crossed into positive territory, signaling growing upward momentum. Also, the support is at $2,503, while the resistance is at $2,605, $2,665, and $2,759.\nBeliever notes that bulls want to break the stubborn range above $2,665. He also stated that Patience may soon pay, as signs of accumulation, rising indicators, and price pressing against resistance.\nAnother analyst, Crypto Bureau XLab, also analyzed that Ethereum is coiling for a breakout of an ascending triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart. A confirmed breakout above $2,720 could ignite a sharp rally toward the $3,150 region with momentum building, which is a bullish continuation pattern.\nHowever, XLab warns of a potential rejection scenario, that if ETH fails to break through the $2,720 zone, it could lose short-term bullish momentum, which might send ETH back down to retest deeper support near $2,100 to $2,000 zone, which has previously served as a strong accumulation zone.\nBreakout Could Trigger Rapid Climb Toward $4,000\nCrypto Jaibrah also took to X to reveal that Ethereum is shaping up for a breakout, with a massive cup and handle formation developing on the 3-day chart, a bullish pattern that often precedes explosive moves.\nETH is finding support on the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) ribbons, showing that the uptrend remains intact and structurally strong. A confirmed breakout above $2,850 will activate the price target at $4,000. Ethereum is also undergoing a significant Bollinger Band Width squeeze on the chart, a reliable signal that shows volatility is about to expand, and these periods of compression often lead to sharp directional moves.\nThe Volume Range Visible Profile (VRVP) reveals a notable volume gap between $2,850 and $3,200, which means there’s little resistance in that zone. If ETH breaks above $2,850, the price could rapidly accelerate toward $3,200 with minimal friction.", "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 18:30:57 +0000", "author": "Sandra White", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/ethereum/feed/"}
{"title": "Ethereum To Outperform Bitcoin: Buy Before Mid-August, Analyst Warns", "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-to-outperform-bitcoin/", "text": "A crypto market expert has predicted that Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin, is about to flip the script on Bitcoin (BTC), the number one cryptocurrency. According to the forecast, ETH could significantly outperform BTC in this bull cycle—but the opportunity won’t last long. The analyst warns that the key window to buy in is before mid-August, when Ethereum could start showing real strength in the market.\nEthereum To Overtake Bitcoin By Mid-August\nExperienced crypto analyst Polaris_xbt presented a macro analysis of the ETH/BTC chart on a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, suggesting that Ethereum is on the verge of a major reversal that could see it overtake Bitcoin once again.\nDrawing from historical price cycles and on-chain volume patterns, the expert highlights that Ethereum tends to lag behind Bitcoin in performance following a market bottom, but eventually catches up with explosive upside. This pattern has repeated in past cycles, with Ethereum beginning to outperform Bitcoin two months after its 2017 bottom and four months after the 2019 low.\nThe current ETH/BTC cycle shows a much slower and extended downtrend that has lasted several years, culminating in a Rounded Bottom formation. Based on the analyst’s chart, Ethereum appears to have established a macro low at a key support zone between 0.01789 and 0.02326 BTC, following a 120-day consolidation period. This mirrors the 125-day lag observed in 2019 before the ETH/BTC breakout began.\nPolaris_xbt has identified August 17, 2025, as the end of a key speculative window, indicating that this cycle is similarly delayed, and an altcoin outperformance, led by Ethereum, is likely to begin shortly afterward. The analyst chart points to a macro control level at 0.03116 BTC as a critical region, with higher resistance zones mapped out at 0.05372 and 0.08148. These areas represent potential upside targets if Ethereum resumes its historical trend of outpacing Bitcoin during the latter stages of each market cycle.\nWith the chart structure showing a break from the long-term downtrend, the setup strongly supports an accumulation at current levels. Polaris_xbt warns that the next five weeks represent a rare opportunity to buy ETH at a significant discount ahead of the projected shift in market dynamics.\nETH-BTC Reversal Timing Sparks Debate\nPolaris_xbt’s optimistic ETH/BTC forecast has sparked debate within the crypto community, with some analysts questioning whether the pair’s momentum will shift this year at all. One community member suggested the bullish conditions of the ETH/BTC ratio might not play out completely until 2026–an outlook that appears to contradict the cycle structure observed since the inception of the crypto market.\nIn response, Polaris_xbt acknowledged the uncertainty but maintained confidence in a mid-2025 recovery. He expects a potential Double Bottom pattern to form during the summer months, after which the ETH/BTC pair could begin a steady upward trajectory. The analyst added that the key milestone remains the mid-range level around 0.03116 on the chart, which acts as both a macro resistance and psychological pivot point.", "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 17:00:28 +0000", "author": "Scott Matherson", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/ethereum/feed/"}
{"title": "Rising Bets On Ethereum: Futures Open Interest Jumps To Fresh Multi-Month High", "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-open-interest-jumps/", "text": "Bullish sentiment is noticeably returning to the crypto market once again, and Ethereum has made a remarkable upward move. With the fresh wave of optimism, ETH’s price has reclaimed the key $2,700 mark, which has captured investors’ attention. While prices have strongly increased, recent reports reveal that ETH’s open interest also witnessed a notable uptick.\nTraders Are Doubling Down On Ethereum\nEthereum’s price appears to have regained upside traction, and its derivatives market is heating up. This notable uptick in the derivatives market is attributed to a recent surge in ETH’s Futures Open Interest (OI) to new multi-month highs.\nGlassnode, a popular on-chain analytics and financial platform, in a post on X highlighted that Ethereum CME Futures open interest has increased to $3.27 billion. ETH CME futures open interest’s rise to this figure marks its highest level since February 2 this year.\nThis notable expansion in futures is a clear indication that investors and traders are ramping up their bets on the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. It also demonstrates a renewed capacity for speculation and an increasing level of assurance on ETH’s short-term prospects.\nAccording to the on-chain platform, this indicates a definite improvement in institutional standing, as price and demand are increasing simultaneously. As ETH’s price action levels off following recent volatility, increasing open interest implies that market players are setting themselves up for potentially big moves in the future. Such a positive advancement could further bolster the general attitude toward Ethereum and its future performance.\nA Persistent Decrease In ETH Exchange Reserve\nWhile ETH bullish momentum builds, it is being met with robust confidence from investors from all crypto exchanges, solidifying the current upward trend. BlackMen, a market expert, has reported a positive action among ETH investors on crypto exchanges.\nAfter examining the Ethereum Exchange Reserves metric, the expert stated that the amount of ETH in exchanges is rapidly decreasing. Such a decline in exchange reserves highlights the increasing inclination of investors to move their ETH to decentralized platforms or long-term safekeeping.\nInvestors are also locking their Ethereum in staking, which keeps it in the system, and this rate is getting close to all-time highs. This pattern is often classified as a bullish indication, indicating that holders are less likely to sell and more optimistic about ETH’s prospects.\nBlackMen stated that these developments are typically the precursor to bull runs that begin quietly, not hype or coincidence, noting that a slight hype could occur after August. The expert’s claims may imply that the ongoing bull market cycle still has room to extend.\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $2,812, reflecting a nearly 7% increase in the last 24 hours. Ethereum is witnessing renewed bullish sentiment from investors and traders following the recent rally above the $2,800 price mark. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that ETH’s trading volume has risen by more than 64% in the past day, suggesting growing conviction in the newfound rally.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 22:00:44 +0000", "author": "Godspower Owie", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/ethereum/feed/"}

While its price has somewhat slowed in recent weeks, the acclaimed “king of altcoins” is in a much better position than it was three months ago.\nHowever, Ethereum’s recently found position seems to be at risk, according to the latest on-chain revelation. Recent data shows that ETH investors seem to be moving their tokens away from long-term storage and rather onto centralized trading platforms.\nBullish Perspective On Rising ETH Reserves On Binance\nIn a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst BorisVest shared that the Ethereum reserves on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume, have been swelling over the past few weeks. According to the crypto pundit, the exchange now holds over 4% of ETH’s total circulating supply.\nData from CryptoQuant shows that the Ethereum reserves on Binance have not risen to this level since May 2023. Typically, the flow of ETH tokens to centralized exchanges — which usually offer trading services — suggests that the assets are being positioned to be offloaded or sold into the open market.\nHence, the recent surge in the Ethereum reserves on Binance is a bearish signal for the price of ETH, as it signals impending selling pressure. This means that this trend could exacerbate an ongoing price correction or trigger the beginning of downward price movement.\nSource: CryptoQuant\nHowever, BorisVest also painted a bullish picture for the Ethereum price based on this on-chain observation. “If these ETH transfers are being positioned ahead of a potential rally, and price holds firm despite increasing reserves, it could indicate strong underlying demand or strategic positioning by whales,” the analyst said.\nFurthermore, BorisVest mentioned that the last time the Ethereum reserves on Binance rose to this level, the price of ETH dropped from $1,900 to around $1,600. However, this brief price correction was followed by a sharp, abrupt rally to the upside.\nThe on-chain analyst also noted that the ETH price has not witnessed any major downward movement since the Binance reserves started rising, suggesting price resilience by the altcoin. Ultimately, BorisVest urged investors to stay alert as these recent exchange movements could trigger the next move for the Ethereum price.\nEthereum Price At A Glance\nAs of this writing, the ETH token is valued at around $2,516, reflecting a 0.4% price increase in the past 24 hours.\nThe price of ETH on the daily timeframe | Source: ETHUSDT chart on TradingView", "published": "Sun, 06 Jul 2025 18:30:56 +0000", "author": "Opeyemi Sule", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/ethereum/feed/"}

However, the prominent altcoin and second largest cryptocurrency continues to trade $2,600 which has acted as an efficient price barrier over the past month. Interestingly, recent technical data shows Ethereum is still likely to experience significant price growth in the current market cycle, despite its ongoing price struggles.\n2.25 MVRV Emerges As Critical Exit Point For Ethereum Investors – Analyst\nIn an X post on July 4, popular market analyst Burak Kesmeci shares an interesting insight on the Ethereum market. Using data from Tradingview, Kesmeci observes ETH has held an MVRV value between 1.20-1.25, indicating a strong market uncertainty despite investors retaining a modest profit.\nAs the name suggests, the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio compares an asset’s current market value (MV) to its realized value (RV), which reflects the average price at which the asset was last moved on-chain. It is a key indicator used to assess whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued. An MVRV >1 indicates that investors are in profit, holding unrealized gains indicating significant potential for profit taking, while an MVRV <1 suggests investors are at a loss presenting a good time for accumulation as the asset is undervalued.\nAs earlier stated, the present MVRV levels between 1.20-1.25 signals Ethereum investors are presently profitable. However, Burak Kesmeci states 2.25 has emerged as a crucial psychological and technical level in the current cycle. The analyst explains that it was precisely at this point that many investors opted to lock in profits during the major price upswing in Q4 2024, effectively ending Ethereum’s rally at the time.\nWhile Kesmeci states it is unknown if Ethereum’s MVRV will return to such levels, the current standings indicate the altcoin is far from its peak price levels of the current market cycle, indicating the present price uptrend still presents room for growth before entering an overheated market phase.\nETH Price Overview\nAt press time, Ethereum trades at $2,520 on the daily chart reflecting a price loss of 1.35%. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is down by 9.8% and valued at $16.29 billion.\nAccording to data from CoinCodex, the general Ethereum market sentiment remains neutral but with a Fear & Greed index of 73 indicating strong levels of greed. CoinCodex analysts forecast that Ethereum could trade around $2,737 within the next month, with a potential climb back to local peak levels near $4,099 over the next three months, suggesting a bullish mid-term outlook despite the current cautious sentiment.", "published": "Sun, 06 Jul 2025 05:30:10 +0000", "author": "Semilore Faleti", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/ethereum/feed/"}

The on-chain metric of interest here is the “Supply Distribution” from the analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the total amount of an asset that a given wallet group is holding right now.\nAddresses or investors are divided into these cohorts based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balance. The 1 to 10 coins cohort, for instance, contains all the holders owning between 1 and 10 ETH.\nIn the context of the current topic, the whale group is of focus. The range of this cohort is typically defined as 10,000 to 100,000 ETH. At the current exchange rate, the lower bound converts to $26.2 million and the upper one to $262 million.\nThus, the only investors who would qualify for the group would be the big-money ones. Such holders can carry some degree of influence in the market, so their behavior, represented by the trend in their Supply Distribution, can be worth monitoring.\nHere is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution of the Ethereum whales over the last couple of weeks:\nThe value of the metric appears to have shot up in recent days | Source: @ali_charts on X\nAs is visible in the above graph, the Ethereum Supply Distribution for the 10,000 to 100,000 coins investors has recently seen an increase, implying these holders have participated in net accumulation.\nIn total, the whales have added 200,000 ETH (worth around $524 million) to their holdings with this buying spree. This is a significant amount and suggests some large holders think the cryptocurrency is worth buying at the current price. It only remains to be seen, however, whether this bet would pay off for these investors.\nIn some other news, there is a strong accumulation zone for Ethereum around the $2,500 level, as the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out in an X post.\nThe trend in the Cost Basis Distribution of ETH over the last few months | Source: Glassnode on X\nThe above chart shows the data for the Ethereum Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap, an indicator that tells us how much of the asset’s supply was last purchased at what price levels.\n“ETH’s Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap shows ~$2.5K as one of the strongest accumulation zones in months,” notes Glassnode. “Over 3.45M $ETH has a cost basis in the $2,513–$2,536 range, reinforcing this level as a major support zone.”\nETH Price\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,600, up 3% in the last 24 hours.\nLooks like the price of the coin has seen a surge over the past day | Source: ETHUSDT on TradingView", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 10:30:54 +0000", "author": "Keshav Verma", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/ethereum/feed/"}

Scaramucci said that kind of ride is what pioneers signed up for.\nHe warned that anyone who can’t handle sudden drops might bail out before the next rally. At the same time, those who stay could see big gains.\nImage: Benny Marty/Shutterstock.com\nAccording to market data, Bitcoin hit a record high of $118,200 today before slipping back to $111,120. Trading volume surged as that peak was reached. It’s a reminder that every rally brings its own tests.\nAltcoin Spotlight On Solana\nWhile Scaramucci’s focus is on Bitcoin, he revealed his top alternative holding is Solana. Based on reports, he said SOL’s speed and low fees make it useful for more than just trading. That choice shows he’s betting some of his gains on other networks. Many investors follow a similar playbook: put most money in Bitcoin and a smaller share in projects that could grow faster.\nRegulatory And Market Challenges Ahead\nScaramucci didn’t shy away from risks beyond price swings. He mentioned that US regulators are still deciding how to treat crypto. Data shows that any new rules on exchanges or tokens could shake up the market. He also flagged the chance of a big sell‑off if economic worries spike again.\nBitcoin Market Still Maturing\nHe argued that Bitcoin is still in its infancy. By comparing it to Manhattan in 1690—before any tall buildings existed—Scaramucci wants to show there’s room to grow.\nHe forecast a BTC price of $200,000 before year‑end. Those numbers suggest he sees at least an 80% jump from current levels.

This technical formation, where the 50-day moving average climbs above the 200-day moving average, last occurred on Ethereum’s daily candlestick chart in December 2024 and resulted in an 18% surge.\nThis time, though, the story is very different. Rather than triggering another rally, Ethereum’s price action has been quite flat, which makes it difficult to imagine a break above $3,000 very soon.\nLack Of Follow-Through Shows Ethereum’s Weakness\nAccording to technical analysis initially noted on the social media platform X, Ethereum recently exhibited a golden cross. However, according to the analyst, this was a failed golden cross, as Ethereum’s price barely moved when it happened on the daily timeframe.\nThe analyst, who goes by the name Honey on the social media platform, noted that the lack of movement shows more profound issues in current market conditions, especially in terms of liquidity and sentiment. The golden cross should have injected life into Ethereum’s price action, but instead, it shows the absence of momentum.\nEthereum’s price performance following the crossover has made the pattern feel more like a false signal than what the golden crossover is mostly known as. The chart below shows that while the moving averages did cross, the price action around that moment was uneventful and even slightly bearish. This is a huge difference from what happened in December 2024, when the same pattern was followed by a quick upside push. Back then, Ethereum’s price surged by about 18% to touch $4,000 very briefly.\nReturn To $3,000 Might Take Longer Than Expected\nThe bigger takeaway is not just the failed breakout, but what it implies about the coming quarter. According to the analyst, this entire crypto market might witness a sluggish and choppy Q3, particularly if Bitcoin is below the $111,000 mark.\nIn this environment, it’s difficult to imagine Ethereum making a clean run to the $3,000 milestone any time soon. The lack of momentum does not bode well for bullish forecasts, even though Ethereum has so far held its ground at support levels around $2,400.\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,548, down by 2.1% in the past 24 hours. Data from CoinGecko shows that the leading altcoin reached an intraday high of $2,630 in the past 24 hours, but it has failed to hold up this momentum. For Ethereum to break out of its current zone and move to $3,000, it would need a wave of liquidity and confidence.\nThis recent volatility is tough for Ethereum’s bullish prospects, but its long-term outlook is relatively strong. Interestingly, one particular analyst believes that Ethereum is going above $10,000 this cycle.", "published": "Sat, 05 Jul 2025 01:00:40 +0000", "author": "Scott Matherson", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/ethereum/feed/"}
{"title": "Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Breakdown — Here’s The Best Time To Buy", "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-breakdown-buy/", "text": "The Bitcoin price continues to trend very close to its all-time high levels and has dominated the market in terms of gains over the last few months. Given how much the price has grown during this time period, expectations have begun to skew toward a possible drawdown as the price moves to correct after continuously moving upward. This is highlighted by crypto analyst Xanrox, who has warned investors of an impending Bitcoin price crash and revealed the best time to actually buy the digital asset.\nAnalyst Calls Out Bitcoin Price Recovery As Takeout\nOver the last week, the Bitcoin price has climbed higher and briefly moved above the $110,000 level before rolling back downward. This has pointed to a steady climb in participation as crypto investors begin to make their bets once again. However, while the market has celebrated this climb, crypto analyst Xanrox has called it out for being a bearish development.\nThe analysis focuses on the Bitcoin price uptrend that saw it tap $110,000. But he points out that instead of a clean break, the digital asset had failed to continue its uptrend even after breaking out of its descending channel. Given this, Xanrox explains that this is a false breakout of a pattern, or what is commonly known in the crypto community as a “bull trap.”\nThe thing about bull traps is that they are ultimately bearish in nature. So, while the Bitcoin price seems to be in an uptrend, if Xanrox is right, then it means that the cryptocurrency will be seeing a downturn soon, and that will trigger a price crash.\nAdditionally, the analyst explains that the uptrend from the past week has now trapped bulls in long positions, while whales will need liquidity from orders and stop losses. Thus, to grab this liquidity, whales will need to drive the price downward, and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement of the previous impulse wave just below $103,000 is the most likely culprit.\nWhen Is The Best Price To Enter BTC?\nTo figure out where the Bitcoin price might be headed next, the crypto analyst applies the Elliot Wave Theory to the current trend. He explains that Wave 1 is already complete, meaning the bearish Wave 2 is now in play, which is an ABC correction.\nWith this correction forming, the analyst advises investors to wait before entering a long position. The 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level lies at $102,909, making it the best time to enter the digital asset. Xanrox also points out that there is an unfilled Fair Value Gap (FVG) between $102,000 and $104,000 that is expected to fill quickly during this time.\nHowever, despite the expected retracement, the overall trend for the Bitcoin price remains bullish with the Elliot Wave Theory. If Wave 2 plays out completely, then Wave 3 is expected to begin, which is usually an even more bullish move compared to Wave 1, and could put BTC on the path to new all-time highs.", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 11:30:02 +0000", "author": "Scott Matherson", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/bitcoin/feed/"}
{"title": "Bitcoin Soared—But Mainstream News Was Missing In Action, Study Reveals", "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-soared-but-mainstream-news-was-missing-in-action-study-reveals/", "text": "In the second quarter of 2025, Bitcoin drew very different reactions from the top names in financial news. According to data gathered by market intelligence firm Perception, from 18 major outlets, there were 1,116 Bitcoin articles published between April and June.\nOverall sentiment leaned a bit negative: 31% of headlines were tagged positive, 41% came across as neutral, and 28% fell into negative territory.\nElite Media Coverage Gaps\nThe Wall Street Journal ran just two Bitcoin stories in Q2. The Financial Times managed 11, and the New York Times ran another 11.\nThat’s a tiny share compared with other reports these papers produce—especially odd for an asset that has outperformed almost everything else over the past decade.\nBased on the study conducted by Perception, these outlets treated Bitcoin almost as if it were off their radar. By comparison, those same weeks saw in‑depth coverage of ECB bond yields and quarterly earnings from large retailers.\nHigh Volume Outlets Step In\nAt the other end of the theater were high‑output financial titles. Forbes led the pack with 194 articles, tagging 43% as positive and 24% as negative.\nCNBC published 141 pieces, with a 42% positive rate and just 17% negative. Fortune added 117 stories, splitting 25% positive against 18% negative.\nThese publishers hardly ignored Bitcoin; they treated it as a moving market, not a fringe topic. They also drilled into specific angles—75% positive on retail adoption in Forbes, and 100% positive on institutional moves, for example.\nUS media coverage of Bitcoin shows wide divide in Q2 2025. Image: Meta.\nWarnings From Negative Coverage\nOther outlets leaned the opposite way. The Independent ran 45 Bitcoin articles but marked 42% of them as negative versus only 18% positive.\nFox News produced 32 reports with 38% negative headlines, often focused on crime and security. Barron’s—ironically part of the same group as the Journal—put out 65 Bitcoin stories, nearly split between 25% positive and 27% negative tones.\nThese critical takes still kept Bitcoin in the pages, but they painted it mostly as a risk zone.\nReal‑Time Tracking Can Help Investors\nInvestors who rely only on elite papers may miss big moves. When Barron’s runs 65 stories but its parent paper runs two, there’s a clear gap in what each audience sees.\nBy tracking headlines and sentiment as they appear—instead of waiting three months for a quarterly report—traders can spot shifts faster.\nAccording to analysts, setting up a simple dashboard that taps multiple outlets could highlight when a bullish run is building or when warning signs are rising.\nWhat It Means For Readers\nThis split coverage matters. If you’re reading only the Journal and the FT, you might think Bitcoin is a niche topic. If you’re following Forbes or CNBC, you’ll see it as a major market force.\nBased on these numbers, the big takeaway is simple: broaden your news sources. That way, you’re less likely to get blindsided by Bitcoin’s next big move.\nAs the sages would say: the more, the merrier.\nFeatured image from Meta, chart from TradingView", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 09:00:13 +0000", "author": "Christian Encila", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/bitcoin/feed/"}

It owns 15,555 BTC today. Based on reports, its CEO Simon Gerovich wants to boost that to more than 210,000 BTC by 2027. That goal would put the firm’s stash at 1% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist.\nRacing To Build A Bitcoin Nest Egg\nAccording to Gerovich, the company started buying Bitcoin in 2024. At first, it was just a hedge against rising prices. Now it feels more like a sprint. On Monday, Metaplanet spent $237 million to add 2,204 BTC to its vault.\nImage: Bankless Times\nAt about $108,600 per coin, that purchase lifted its average price per BTC to roughly $99,985. Investors have taken notice. The share price is up 340% this year, even though the company still makes only modest revenue.\nJapanese microstrategy Metaplanet announced that its Bitcoin strategy has entered the second phase, planning to use BTC as collateral leverage to acquire cash flow businesses. Potential targets include Japanese digital banks, providing digital banking services that are better…\n— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 8, 2025\nPlans To Turn Crypto Into Cash\nAccording to reports, Metaplanet has two phases for this strategy. Phase one is about accumulation. Phase two will use Bitcoin as collateral to borrow cash. That borrowed money would fund deals to buy profitable businesses.\nGerovich has mentioned a digital bank in Japan as an example. He thinks the firm could offer better services than current banks provide. In April, big names such as Standard Chartered and OKX began pilot programs for crypto‑backed loans. Metaplanet hopes to follow their lead but on a larger scale.\nThe biggest public Bitcoin treasury companies. Source: Bitcoin Treasuries\nSizing Up The Competition\nMetaplanet now ranks among the top five companies in Bitcoin holdings. For comparison, Strategy holds over 597,000 BTC and sports a $112 billion market cap. Metaplanet, by contrast, has a market value above $7 billion.\nBoth companies believe that Bitcoin will outperform cash over the long haul. But Gerovich has ruled out convertible debt. He prefers issuing preferred shares. He doesn’t want to face arbitrary repayments tied to a shifting share price.\nBTCUSD trading at $108,499 on the 24-hour chart: TradingView\nPromises And Pitfalls Of A Bitcoin‑Powered Model\nBorrowing against Bitcoin carries risks.

That uncertainty could slow down or even halt the plan.\nBTC price nearing the $109k mark. Source: Coingecko\nThen there is the challenge of integrating a digital bank. Metaplanet started as a hotel operator. Running a bank requires a very different skill set.\nMetaplanet’s gamble is bold. It offers a fresh twist on how companies can use Bitcoin. If all goes well, it could pioneer a new breed of corporate finance.\nIf things go wrong, this Tokyo firm may struggle under the weight of its own ambition.

If the court sides against Strategy, the company could face hefty write‑downs. That might make it harder to funnel more cash into bitcoin.\nBitcoin Trading Inches Closer To Record\nBitcoin’s current trading level suggests a market on edge.

{"title": "Why Satoshi-Era Bitcoin Are Relevant To Market Dynamics — Analyst Explains", "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/satoshi-era-bitcoin-are-relevant-to-market-dynamics/", "text": "The crypto market was shaken by a rare occurrence on Friday, July 4, when a dormant whale—holding Bitcoin mined as far back as 2011—became active again. The Satoshi-era entity ended up moving around 81,000 BTC (worth around $8.8 billion) that had been held for 14 years.\nThese significant movements, the largest single-day transfer volume of 10+ year-old coins, sparked interesting conversations in the crypto community. A popular on-chain analyst has come forward with their interpretation of this phenomenon, saying that “old Bitcoin still matters”.\nWhy Does Old Bitcoin Matter?\nIn a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, pseudonymous analyst Darkfost provided on-chain context on the significance of dormant BTC addresses waking up and shaking the market. This on-chain analysis is based on UTXO Age Bands %, which segments the total BTC supply based on the last time they were transacted.\nTo begin their analysis, Darkfost acknowledged that the coins moved on Friday were reportedly mined in 2011 when Bitcoin was valued at below $1. According to the crypto analyst, these movements are a reminder of the market influence of miners due to extremely large BTC reserves.\nIn their Quicktake post, Darkfost used the UTXO Age Bands % metric to visualize how significant the holdings of these Satoshi-era miners are. According to data from CryptoQuant, the 10+ year age band holds a substantial 17%, the largest percentage of the total BTC supply.\nSource: CryptoQuant\nThe cohort of Bitcoin holders with the second largest portion (15.8%) of the total supply lies within the 6 – 12 month age band. This investor group is followed closely by the 3-5 year age band, with 14.3% of the total BTC supply. “This shift represents the transition from STH to Long LTH and suggests that recent buyers are still holding despite market conditions,” Darkfost explained.\nFurthermore, investors in the 7 – 10 year age band also hold a significant portion of the total supply, reflecting the control that long-term holders wield over the largest cryptocurrency market. Ultimately, Darkfost concluded that the movement of old BTC is critical to market dynamics as it can carry macro-level implications.\nBitcoin Price At A Glance\nThe price of Bitcoin has been relatively steady since the occurrence of these large-scale coin movements, while there has been no indication of selling by the Satoshi-era miner.

His move comes as he takes aim at what he calls wasteful government spending and vows to shake up the status quo.\nMusk’s short statement—that “fiat is hopeless”—has already sent ripples through both political and crypto circles.\nMusk Launches Political Bid\nAccording to Musk’s recent tweet, his new centrist party will start by fielding candidates for the US Senate and House. He’s on record saying he won’t jump straight to a White House run.\nInstead, he plans to build out support at the state level first.

Each state has unique rules on deadlines, forms and signature thresholds.

The analyst said that Bitcoin could be worth as much as $258,000 if history repeats itself.According to apsk32, Bitcoin's price action has followed a long-term power curve trendline, a mathematical model reflecting BTC’s exponential growth over time. It measures price deviation from this trendline, not just in dollar terms, but in units of time, an approach known as Power Law Time Contours.\nThe analyst explained that Bitcoin is slightly more than two years ahead of its power curve, meaning if the price stayed flat, it would take over two years for the long-term trendline to intersect it again. Apsk32 said,\n“We’re currently above 79% of the historical data using this metric. The top 20% is what I call “extreme greed.” These are the blow-off tops that come around every four years.”\nThe “extreme greed” zone spans from $112,000 to $258,000, a zone seen during Bitcoin’s euphoric peaks in 2013, 2017, and 2021. The analyst implied that “if the four-year pattern continues,” Bitcoin could be between $200,000 and $300,000 by Christmas, before the bullish momentum begins to fade at the start of 2026.\nLikewise, Satraj Bambra, CEO of perpetual trading platform Rails, told Cointelegraph that a couple of macroeconomic forces could drive Bitcoin significantly higher in 2025. Bambra pointed to an expanding Federal Reserve balance sheet and a pivot toward lower interest rates, potentially under new Fed leadership responding to the economic drag from rising tariffs, as key catalysts. Together, these shifts could ignite a broad-based rally in risk-on assets, with Bitcoin poised to benefit.\nBambra cited the US Dollar Index (DXY) dropping below 100 as a critical early signal of this macro pivot, suggesting that a wave of rate cuts and fresh stimulus may soon follow. Against this backdrop, the CEO said,\n“I see Bitcoin going parabolic in the region of $300K–500K driven by two key forces.”\nRelated: Is the crypto market entering a new supercycle?

This strong rebound from a slow 2025 start signals growing institutional interest and confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value.\nBitcoin remains a risk-on asset, with a moderate correlation to the Nasdaq 100 over the past 12 months, consistent with its five-year average. Its low correlation with gold and bonds highlights its unique portfolio role.\nEchoing that sentiment, Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro, Jurrien Timmer, recently remarked that the baton has swung back to Bitcoin. According to Timmer, the narrowing gap in Sharpe ratios between Bitcoin and gold points to BTC offering superior risk-adjusted returns. The Sharpe ratio gauges how much excess return an asset delivers for the level of risk taken, comparing its performance to a risk-free benchmark adjusted for volatility.\nThe chart below, based on weekly data from 2018 through July 2025, highlights how Bitcoin’s returns (1x) have been closing in on gold’s (4x). In relative performance terms, gold stands at $20.34, while Bitcoin has climbed to $16.95.\nRelated: Bitcoin $120K expectations add fuel to ETH, HYPE, UNI and SEI\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Legkodymov was indicted in January 2023, pleaded guilty in December, and was sentenced to time served in July 2024 after being in custody for about 18 months.\n“Anatoly [...] became a target in a political campaign against the crypto market and talented Russian programmers,” said Ivan Melnikov, vice president of the Russian branch of the International Committee for Human Rights, according to TASS. “His decision to ask for a pardon is based on the hope that the US will return to a more balanced and fair approach to digital finance.”\nAccording to his indictment, Legkodymov was part of an operation that facilitated the transmission of illicit funds through his role at Bitzlato. US authorities alleged that hundreds of millions of dollars flowed from Bitzlato to the dark web Hydra Marketplace, and the exchange received about $15 million connected to ransomware attacks.\nRelated: Binance founder CZ Zhao asked Trump to pardon money laundering conviction\nFrench authorities were reportedly attempting to extradite Legkodymov to face similar charges after his time in the US. It’s unclear if Trump has received the pardon request or whether he will act on it.\nCointelegraph reached out to the White House for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.\nPardons for crypto industry figures who pleaded guilty or were convicted\nSince taking office in January, Trump has issued at least 58 presidential pardons. Among them were Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, who had been facing two life sentences in federal prison, and four former executives of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX: Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, Gregory Dwyer and Samuel Reed.\nFormer Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said in May that he had applied for a pardon from Trump. Zhao pleaded guilty to one felony charge in November 2023 as part of a deal between US authorities and Binance. He served four months in prison.\nReports have suggested that former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was also attempting to secure a federal pardon from Trump by speaking on conservative news outlets and distancing himself from the Democratic Party.

VanEck research shows Bitcoin mining execs are outearning peers in related industries.\nBinance helped create World Liberty Financial stablecoin — Report\nCryptocurrency exchange Binance reportedly helped create the code behind the stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial (WLF), one of the crypto businesses tied to US President Donald Trump.\nAccording to a Friday Bloomberg report citing three people familiar with the matter, Binance helped create, promote, and played a role in the largest transaction of WLF’s USD1 stablecoin. The crypto business, backed by Trump and his three sons, launched USD1 on March 4.\nAn Abu Dhabi-based investment firm, MGX, announced a $2-billion investment in Binance on March 12 using a then-unnamed stablecoin. Eric Trump, one of WLF’s co-founders, said in May that the company would be using USD1 to settle the investment.\nAccording to Bloomberg, 90% of all the USD1 coins used in the transaction remained in Binance’s wallets as of Friday, potentially generating tens of millions of dollars in interest for Trump and his family.\nCointelegraph reached out to a Binance spokesperson and World Liberty Financial but had not received responses at the time of publication.\nPeter Schiff says sell Bitcoin for silver as BTC smashes new highs\nLongtime Bitcoin critic and gold advocate Peter Schiff said the latest BTC rally may be a selling opportunity for investors to buy silver instead.\n“With Bitcoin hitting new highs today (in dollars), it’s a great time to sell some and buy silver ahead of silver’s next big leg up,” Schiff said in a Thursday X post as Bitcoin\nput on its moon boots again and set new highs above $112,000.He claimed that silver has more upside potential than Bitcoin and added that while BTC “can easily crash, silver’s downside seems very limited.”\nArthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, also weighed in on market conditions in a Friday X post. He said he was “slightly bearish” due to the US Treasury General Account being replenished through new debt issuance, which could temporarily drain liquidity.\nStill, Hayes said he is bullish after Bitcoin reached a new all-time high and Ether\nwent on a march upward:“[Ether] will outperform, get ready for a monster [altcoin season.]”\nHayes added that the market believes US President Donald Trump will “chicken out” on the tariffs, adding that his family office fund, Maelstrom, is ready to reenter the market.\nInvestors are balking at “excessive” Bitcoin miner exec pay: VanEck\nUS Bitcoin mining executives are earning well above their peers in the IT and energy sectors due to generous stock compensation packages, and shareholders are fighting back, according to new findings from asset manager VanEck.\nDespite “aggressive compensation packages,” Bitcoin mining firm shareholders are “balking,” VanEck head of digital assets research Matthew Sigel and investment analyst Nathan Frankovitz reported on Thursday.\nThe researchers found that average shareholder approval for executive pay packages is just 64% compared to around 90% for S&P 500 and Russell 3000 companies.\n“That skepticism appears well-founded. Mining executives continue to grant themselves oversized equity awards that dilute shareholders without reliably linking pay to long-term value creation,” they added.\nThe researchers reviewed executive compensation across eight US-listed Bitcoin miners: Bit Digital, Cipher Mining, CleanSpark, Core Scientific, Hut 8, MARA Holdings, Riot Platforms and TeraWulf.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 22:59:57 +0100", "author": "Cointelegraph by Cointelegraph", "source": "https://cointelegraph.com/rss"}

Earlier this week, the firm announced a new $100 million fund dedicated to investing in early-stage Bitcoin companies.Meanwhile, Robinhood is doubling down on its tokenization push, even as European regulators scrutinize its so-called “private equity” offerings. While Robinhood has long been active in digital assets, its deeper commitment to the space has helped propel its stock to all-time highs.\nThis week’s Crypto Biz explores Bitcoin-focused venture capital, Robinhood’s tokenization ambitions, CoreWeave’s acquisition of Core Scientific and former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao’s knack for calling out questionable announcements.\nEgo Death Capital targets Bitcoin startups\nVenture firm Ego Death Capital has raised $100 million from family offices and other investors to back Bitcoin startups, calling BTC “the only decentralized and secure base [...] to build on.”\nThe firm has already invested in Bitcoin-focused exchanges, payment rails and savings platforms, and is now targeting additional companies generating between $1 million and $3 million in annual revenue.\nLaunching a Bitcoin-only venture fund comes at an opportune time, as institutional interest in Bitcoin surges thanks to the availability of US spot ETFs and a growing trend of companies adding BTC to their corporate treasuries.\nFollowing Strategy’s lead, dozens of companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets this year. However, not everyone is convinced this is a viable long-term business strategy, especially for businesses “without a serious niche,” according to Glassnode’s James Check.\nRobinhood stock surges on tokenization push, but regulators have questions\nShares of Robinhood have rallied sharply since the company unveiled its tokenization-focused blockchain, which aims to offer more than 200 US stock and ETF assets to European investors.\nHowever, European regulators are scrutinizing the company’s “private equity tokens,” particularly those linked to OpenAI and SpaceX. The Bank of Lithuania said it is “awaiting clarifications” regarding these offerings after OpenAI said that the product does not actually provide private equity in the company.\nRobinhood CEO Vlad Tenev explained that these tokens do not technically represent equity in the underlying companies but give investors indirect exposure. Despite the regulatory questions, Tenev said several private companies have already approached Robinhood about launching similar products.\nCoreWeave acquires Core Scientific in all-stock deal\nAfter more than a year since its initial buyout proposal, CoreWeave has finalized a deal to acquire Bitcoin miner Core Scientific in an all-stock transaction valued at $9 billion. The acquisition will expand CoreWeave’s data center capacity as it aims to become a leader in AI and high-performance computing (HPC).\n“Through this acquisition, CoreWeave will own approximately 1.3 GW of gross power across Core Scientific’s national data center footprint with an incremental 1 GW+ of potential gross power available for expansion,” the company said.\nHowever, acquiring a Bitcoin miner doesn’t necessarily signal CoreWeave’s return to the crypto market. According to the announcement, CoreWeave plans to repurpose Core Scientific’s assets for HPC, which could include divesting its crypto mining operations.\n“Is this real?” CZ questions TON’s UAE Golden Visa announcement\nLast weekend, The Open Network (TON) announced a new immigration program in the UAE that would grant users a 10-year Golden Visa if they stake $100,000 worth of TON coins and pay a $35,000 processing fee. However, for Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the announcement immediately raised red flags.\n“Is this real?” CZ asked on social media, pointing out that there were no official government statements supporting the claim.\nLess than a day later, UAE regulators issued a joint statement denying reports that Golden Visas are available through digital asset activities, confirming CZ’s hunch to “trust but verify.”\nThe TON Foundation later clarified that the Golden Visa program is “being developed independently” and does not have official government backing.\nCrypto Biz is your weekly pulse on the business behind blockchain and crypto, delivered directly to your inbox every Thursday.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 21:00:00 +0100", "author": "Cointelegraph by Sam Bourgi", "source": "https://cointelegraph.com/rss"}

Take, for example, X user CryptoKaleo, who recently posted about the “real” super cycle.\nEven if the assumptions shared by CryptoKaleo prove accurate, it is still far too early to conclude that the market has entered a crypto super cycle. The current total capitalization of $3.4 trillion is just 29% above the $2.65 trillion peak recorded in November 2021.\nSo far, that projection remains unfulfilled, but there are certain factors to look for that would confirm the start of a super cycle.\nUS Dollar weakness, Crypto ETF growth and Strategic Bitcoin Reserves\nOne such catalyst would be the US Dollar Index (DXY) dropping below 95, a level last seen in November 2021. Continued weakness in the dollar against other major fiat currencies would signal growing investor discomfort with the US fiscal situation. In that case, a portion of the $24.7 trillion in US Treasurys held by the public could flow into alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies.\nAnother major potential driver is the rapid expansion of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry. Despite recent momentum, the current $190 billion in crypto-related assets under management is still negligible compared to traditional asset classes. For comparison, the three largest S&P 500 ETFs alone control a combined $2 trillion in assets.\nDespite initial enthusiasm, the US government’s strategic Bitcoin reserve plan remains vague. Should the Trump administration accumulate at least 200,000 BTC, that could significantly shift market sentiment. A similar effect might come from corporate treasury allocations by tech giants like Google, Apple, or Microsoft.\nRetail investor interest and sector-themed hype\nRetail investor participation also plays a critical role in triggering a supercycle. Search volumes for terms like “buy Bitcoin” and “buy crypto” have remained flat for five months and sit well below their November 2024 highs. Likewise, the Coinbase and Robinhood apps have slipped in US App Store rankings over the past three months.\nWhile institutional capital has taken the lead in this cycle, retail-driven FOMO still serves as the fuel for parabolic growth. Another key signal would be a resurgence in altcoin sector narratives — whether driven by AI tokens, casino coins or traditional meme tokens featuring cats and dogs.\nCurrently, the memecoin market capitalization is $68.5 billion, down from the all-time high of $140.5 billion reached in December 2024, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\nRelated: Bitcoin supply is shrinking: Will Saylor’s relentless BTC buying cause a supply shock?\nThese scenarios remain speculative and hinge on unpredictable macroeconomic and geopolitical developments, including the US Federal Reserve’s ability to avoid a recession and the evolution of global trade relations.\nHowever, the closer the market gets to meeting these conditions, the more likely a surge past $13.2 trillion in market capitalization becomes, representing a 400% increase over the November 2021 peak.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

You’ll learn how to add volume filters, whale flow checks and confirmation rules to avoid emotional or manipulated trades.\nPost-trade journaling with ChatGPT helps you improve win rate, avoid repeat mistakes and build a system around reflection, not just reaction.\nThe rules of day trading are changing fast. What once took hours of analysis can now happen in seconds, thanks to a new class of AI tools.\nThis article explains how traders are quietly using platforms like ChatGPT and Grok to gain an edge in the 24/7 world of crypto, sometimes in ways you wouldn’t expect.\nWhat is day trading in crypto?\nDay trading in crypto means entering and exiting trades within the same day, sometimes within minutes, to capitalize on small, rapid price changes. It’s a short-term hustle, focused on momentum, volume and speed, not long-term holds.\nHere’s how it works:\nSpotting the setupTraders work on 5‑minute to 1‑hour charts, watching for breakout patterns. Indicators like RSI, MACD, or sudden volume surges often confirm these moves.\nDefining the trade\nEntry: Just above a breakout or chart resistance.\nStop-loss: Tightly below recent support or breakout level.\nTake-profit: Based on resistance zones, Fibonacci targets, or a fixed reward-to-risk ratio (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1).\nDay traders aim to profit from short-term intraday price movements, typically opening and closing positions within one trading day. This style relies heavily on technical analysis, discipline and strict risk management.\nWhy crypto day trading is different\nCrypto markets are far more volatile and 24/7. Order books can be thin, and social media sentiment plays a huge role. That’s where tools like Grok (for early sentiment alerts) and ChatGPT (for structuring setups) matter; they help cut through noise and make decisions faster.\nFor instance, in early June 2025, Solana’s DeFi activity surged, and its total value locked (TVL) climbed above $9 billion, a sign of real momentum. Traders could have used Grok to detect early trend shifts and ChatGPT to help structure trade setups, including entry planning, stop placement and profit targets.\nHow to identify trending crypto day trading opportunities with Grok\nGrok, accessible on X (x.com or X apps), grok.com, or Grok apps, helps traders spot crypto trends via real-time sentiment, market data and news analysis.\nWhether you’re looking for breakout tokens, technical entries or early scam warnings, Grok can help you spot opportunities with speed and precision.\nHere are three actionable ways to use Grok in your crypto day-trading strategy:\n1. Track X sentiment for token hype\nHow it works: Grok scans X posts for token mention spikes or sentiment shifts, signaling potential pumps (e.g., $WIF up 7x in mentions often predicts a rally).\nAccess:\nFree: 10 messages/2 hours, three image analyses/day. Suitable for one or two daily token checks; may miss fast-moving hype.\nPaid: X Premium ($8/mo, $84/yr), Premium+ ($16/mo, $168/yr), or SuperGrok (pricing available at https://x.ai/grok) allows frequent queries. Premium+ Think mode refines sentiment analysis.\nExample prompt:\n“What’s the X sentiment on Pi coin?”\nHere is the output:\nGrok reports mixed X sentiment on Pi Coin: bulls see $1–$1.25 potential with strong community and Chainlink boost, while bears warn of $0.40 drop due to unlocks, centralization, and KYC issues.\n2. Check technical indicators (via Grok.com)\nHow it works: Grok pulls real-time data (e.g., RSI) from sources like CoinMarketCap to time trades (e.g., BTC’s RSI at 62 signals bullish momentum).\nAccess:\nFree: 10 messages/2 hours, limits to 1–2 daily indicator checks; suits swing traders.\nPaid: Higher quotas allow multiple checks (e.g., BTC, ETH hourly). Premium+ DeepSearch boosts web-based TA.\nExample prompt:\n“What’s Bitcoin’s RSI as of July 9, 2025? Please give me short answer with proper justification.”\nAccording to Grok, Bitcoin’s RSI is 54 on July 9, 2025, using a 14-day timeframe, indicating neutral momentum (see image below).\n3. Verify token legitimacy\nHow it works: Grok cross-references X sentiment and web data (e.g., white papers, community feedback) to flag potential scams or assess fundamentals. This is critical for memecoins like $GROK, which has been linked to scam concerns.\nAccess:\nFree: Query limits may slow down checking multiple tokens.\nPaid: Higher quotas enable verifying several tokens or deeper analysis (e.g., “Check $GROK’s contract for red flags”)\nExample prompt:\n“Is Bittensor (TAO) a scam token?”\nBased on the above prompt, Grok reports mixed X sentiment on Bittensor (TAO): bulls see $1,000–$10,000 potential by 2030 for its AI marketplace, but bears highlight centralization, insider token control, hacks, and governance issues, urging caution.\nDay trading insights from Grok use cases\nSentiment spikes often precede price action; monitoring X mentions can help identify early momentum in tokens.\nSocial media hype is a valid signal, especially in memecoin trading, but should be paired with other indicators.\nRSI and other technical tools provide context, and combining sentiment with real-time indicators improves timing and trade setup.\nGrok can surface mixed sentiment, helping traders see both bullish potential and downside risks (e.g., Pi Coin or TAO).\nFundamental checks are critical; Grok’s scam detection flags risks like centralization, unlocks, or governance issues.\nReal-time data enables rapid decision-making, valuable in fast-moving day trading environments.\nStructured prompts help refine trade plans; Grok can assist in formulating entry, stop-loss, and exit strategies.\nLimitations of Grok (and why they matter)\nThe free tier has strict limits on query frequency and scope.\nSentiment analysis can misread tone or lack real-time reactivity during high-volatility events.\nNo direct trading integration; it’s an insight tool, not a trading platform.\nPrompt quality affects output; vague or general prompts can lead to unhelpful results.\nMay not catch all red flags, especially for brand-new or obscure tokens with limited data.\nLag in data refresh or indicator updates can affect trade timing in highly volatile markets.\nHow to use ChatGPT to structure crypto trades\nOnce you’ve identified a credible signal using Grok, the next step is turning it into a structured trade. That’s where ChatGPT becomes a powerful assistant, helping you define entries, stops, exits and even reflect on trades afterward.\nUsing the TAO example discussed above, here’s how ChatGPT can help:\nExample 1: Trade the bullish momentum with caution\nUse case: The Grok output highlights bullish sentiment driven by TAO’s user base, integrations and long-term growth potential.\nHow to trade it (with ChatGPT):\nAsk ChatGPT: “Based on current bullish sentiment around TAO, what short-term price action would confirm momentum for a day trade?”\nExample 2: Fade the rally on bearish risk factors\nUse case: Grok points to serious concerns, such as token centralization, governance opacity and past hacks.\nHow to trade it (with ChatGPT):\nAsk ChatGPT:\n“Given bearish sentiment and risk factors for TAO, what are safe conditions for a short setup today?”\nLimits of AI in trading: What it still can’t do\nAI is transforming how traders operate, but it’s not a crystal ball. Tools like Grok and ChatGPT can scan sentiment, summarize market noise, and help structure plans faster than any human. But speed isn’t the same as certainty, and automation doesn’t eliminate risk.\nHere’s the reality: AI is only as good as its data and the person using it.\nGrok might detect a sentiment surge, but it can’t always tell if it’s genuine momentum or coordinated hype. ChatGPT might help draft a perfect trade plan, but it can’t pull the trigger, manage slippage or feel the market shift in real time.\nAI doesn’t have skin in the game.\nIt doesn’t feel FOMO, panic or greed. That’s a strength and a weakness. Without human judgment, AI tools can mislead just as easily as they can guide. Poor prompts, outdated data or overreliance on sentiment can turn a good idea into a bad trade. And while they can reflect on past performance, they don’t learn from experience the way a seasoned trader does, unless you build that loop yourself.\nSo yes, AI is powerful.

In June, Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, Hines and Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis said the chamber would work toward drafting, introducing and passing a bill by Sept. 30, before the House announced its “crypto week” plans for the CLARITY Act.\n“This will be our best draft of a market structure bill that’s been debated in the House […] since 2023,” said House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill on a Friday release of the Thinking Crypto podcast:\n“We’ll vote on it in the House. It will go to the Senate and then we’re looking to Senator Scott, Senator Lummis, Senator Gillibrand, Senator Hagerty and others to put their views about market structure [out].”\nA market structure bill would likely clarify the roles significant US financial regulators would have over digital assets, specifically the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The proposed bill in the House suggested giving more authority to the CFTC for the registration and regulation of digital assets.\nMagazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 21:47:08 +0100", "author": "Cointelegraph by Turner Wright", "source": "https://cointelegraph.com/rss"}

The move affects users of Omni Layer, Bitcoin Cash SLP, Kusama, EOS (now Vaulta), and Algorand.\n“Sunsetting support for these legacy chains allows us to focus on platforms that offer greater scalability, developer activity, and community engagement,” Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, said in a statement.\nTether’s sunsetting of support for these particular blockchains has been in the works for some time. In August 2023, the company announced it would no longer be issuing USDt on the Omni Layer, Kusama, and Bitcoin Cash SLP. In June 2024, Tether halted minting on EOS and Algorand.\nUSDt is the largest stablecoin in circulation with a market capitalization of $139.4 billion according to Cointelegraph indexes. A review of USDt balances across the affected blockchains shows that Omni Layer holds a net circulation of $82.9 million USDt, while other networks have a smaller participation: Bitcoin Cash SLP with $986,500, Kusama with $240,000, EOS with $4.2 million, and Algorand with$841,600.\nRelated: Many see stablecoins soaring to $2T in ‘handful’ of years: Ripple CEO\nUsers on Algorand ‘should experience no disruption’\nAccording to DefiLlama, USDt is the third-most-popular stablecoin on the Algorand blockchain. USD Coin (USDC), issued by Tether’s main competitor Circle, is the most popular stablecoin, accounting for nearly $73 million more in market cap on the Algorand network.\n“Our users should experience no disruption, given Tether made the decision to stop offering Tether on Algorand last year,” a representative for the Algorand Foundation told Cointelegraph. “At the time, they gave customers one year to complete redemptions. In this same year, we’ve only seen our stablecoin volumes grow.”\nAccording to data from the Token Terminal, Algorand's revenue amounted to $42,300 over the past 30 days. Blockchain companies often make money through transaction fees.\nTether said that the discontinuance, for at least the Omni Layer, was due to the lack of USDt usage on the network.\nMagazine: Legal Panel: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 20:31:46 +0100", "author": "Cointelegraph by Christopher Tepedino", "source": "https://cointelegraph.com/rss"}

J3 conducted an investigation that led to the arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov in August 2024.\nX faces growing scrutiny across Europe\nSince Elon Musk purchased X in 2022, it has had several run-ins with regulators, especially in Europe. In February, two German NGOs won a ruling from the Berlin Regional Court that required X to provide access to publicly available engagement data to assist researchers in analyzing potential election interference.\nThe European Union is investigating X for a possible violation of the Digital Service Act. This new landmark regulation requires online platforms to take down illegal content and increase transparency around algorithms.\nAs Musk pushes to turn X into a financial hub with crypto at its core, mounting pressure from European regulators could undermine the trust he needs to secure approval for offering financial services in the EU.\nMagazine: Inside a 30,000 phone bot farm stealing crypto airdrops from real users", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 22:07:04 +0100", "author": "Cointelegraph by Nate Kostar", "source": "https://cointelegraph.com/rss"}

CoinGlass data shows that roughly $570 million in BTC short positions were liquidated on Thursday.Another positive is that the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds witnessed the second-largest daily inflows of $1.17 billion on Thursday, according to Farside Investors data. That suggests the institutional investors expect BTC’s up move to continue.\nMarket analyst Axel Adler Jr said in a post on X that studying the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) oscillator and its data over the past four years shows that distribution starts when MVRV hits the 2.75 mark. That corresponds to roughly $130,900 on Bitcoin.\nCould Bitcoin extend its uptrend, pulling select altcoins higher? Let’s analyze the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that look strong on the charts.\nBitcoin price prediction\nBTC completed a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern after breaking above the neckline on Thursday.\nUsually, after the breakout from a pattern, the price turns down and retests the breakout level. If the BTC/USDT pair rebounds off the neckline, it signals that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That increases the likelihood of the continuation of the uptrend toward the pattern target of $150,000.\nThe first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the neckline. That signals profit-booking at higher levels. The bears will have to pull the price below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) ($106,981) to gain the upper hand.\nThe price turned up sharply from $110,530 and broke above the neckline. The up move has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) into the overbought territory on the four-hour chart. That increases the possibility of a short-term correction or consolidation. If the price maintains above the neckline, the uptrend could reach $123,000.\nThis optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down sharply and breaks below the $110,530 support.\nETH price prediction\nEther\nrallied sharply from the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA_ ($2,613) on Tuesday and soared above the $2,879 resistance on Thursday.The 20-day EMA has turned up, and the RSI is in the overbought zone, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. There is minor resistance at $3,153, but if the level is crossed, the ETH/USDT pair could ascend to $3,400 and subsequently to $3,750.\nThe first support on the downside is at $2,879 and then at $2,733. Sellers will have to pull the price below $2,733 to trap the aggressive bulls. Until then, every minor dip is likely to be viewed as a buying opportunity.\nThe RSI on the four-hour chart has jumped into the overbought zone, suggesting a short-term consolidation or correction. The pair could pull back to $2,879, where the buyers are expected to step in. If the price bounces off $2,879 with force, it indicates that the bulls are trying to flip the level into support. That improves the prospects of the continuation of the uptrend.\nShort-term buyers may book profits if the price tumbles below $2,879. The pair may then descend to the 20-day EMA.\nHYPE price prediction\nHyperliquid (HYPE) rebounded off the 50-day SMA ($37.66) on Tuesday and picked up momentum after breaking above the 20-day EMA ($39.69).\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers sustain the price above $45.80, the H&S pattern will be invalidated. The failure of a bearish setup is a bullish sign, which could catapult the price to $50 and later to $60.\nSellers will have to yank the price below the 50-day SMA to stall the bullish momentum. The HYPE/USDT pair may then slump to $30.70.\nThe pair is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the $45.80 level. If the price turns down, it is likely to find support at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $42.83 and then at the 20-day EMA. A strong bounce off the 20-day EMA increases the possibility of a break above $46.46. The pair may then soar to $50.\nContrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests that the bulls are booking profits. The pair may slump to the 50-day SMA and then to $37.\nRelated: Here’s what happened in crypto today\nUNI price prediction\nUniswap\nhas been forming a series of higher highs and higher lows, signaling a potential trend change.Both moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating that buyers have the edge. There is resistance at $8.64, but a close above it opens the doors for a rally to $10.36. Sellers will try to halt the rally at $10.36, but if buyers do not allow the price to dip below $8.64 on the way down, the UNI/USDT pair could soar to $13.\nThis bullish view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($7).\nThe pair has broken out of the $8.64 resistance, signaling the continuation of the up move. If the price maintains above $8.64, the pair could surge to $10.\nSellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price back below the breakout level of $8.64. If they can pull it off, the pair could slide to the 20-day EMA. A strong bounce off the 20-day EMA indicates buying on dips. The bulls will then again try to resume the uptrend.\nThe selling could accelerate if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. That could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA.\nSEI price prediction\nSei\nturned up sharply from the 20-day EMA ($0.26) on Thursday and has reached the overhead resistance of $0.34.The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the overbought zone signal an advantage to buyers. A close above the $0.34 resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend toward $0.44.\nThe immediate support on the downside is at $0.29. If the price turns down from $0.34 but finds support at $0.29, it suggests the positive sentiment remains intact. The bulls will again try to drive the SEI/USDT pair above the overhead resistance. Sellers will have to pull the price below the 20-day EMA to signal a comeback.\nThe four-hour chart shows the pair has broken out of the $0.24 to $0.34 range, but the bulls are struggling to maintain the higher levels. The overbought level on the RSI suggests a correction or consolidation in the near term. If the price turns up from the current level or the $0.31 support, the bulls will again try to drive the pair toward $0.44.\nOn the contrary, a break and close below $0.31 could sink the pair to $0.29. That suggests the pair may remain inside the $0.24 to $0.34 range for a while longer.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

While overall network activity shows a potential reshuffle instead of an expansion, some metrics indicate that Solana may be on the rise, with a potential expansion in memecoin activity.\nIn addition, decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi) may converge sooner than people think. Nelli Zaltsman, head of blockchain payments innovation at JPMorgan’s Kinexys, said this could happen in the next few years.\nReal-world asset (RWA) platform Projective Finance offers exposure to government-backed blockchain technology projects, while NFT platform OpenSea is expanding to DeFi and perpetuals after a major acquisition.\nMeanwhile, security researchers have thwarted a $10-million DeFi backdoor that threatened thousands of smart contracts for months.\nLetsBonk flips PumpFun in 24-hour revenue: DefiLlama\nA new memecoin launchpad gained traction within the Solana ecosystem, eclipsing the top platform in 24-hour sales.\nOn July 7, DeFi data platform DefiLlama showed that LetsBonk, a Solana memecoin platform supported by the Bonk\ncommunity, generated $1.04 million in revenue. This record doubled Pump.fun's revenue of $533,412 for the same period.The surge marked an uncommon shift in dominance in Solana memecoins, where Pump.fun is usually on top. Even though LetsBonk showed a spike in daily revenue, Pump.fun remained dominant in the monthly chart, recording over $37 million in protocol revenue.\nLetsBonk’s launch also seemingly affected the BONK memecoin, as the token has recorded an almost 52% increase in value since the memecoin launchpad’s release. BONK is one of the top Solana memecoins, with over 430,000 followers on X. The token has a market cap of almost $1.8 billion, making it the 68th-largest token in the crypto space.\nDeFi, TradFi convergence could arrive sooner than expected: JPMorgan\nA JPMorgan executive said the divide between TradFi and DeFi could disappear in the next few years.\nAt the RWA Summit Cannes 2025, Nelli Zaltsman said that JPMorgan is attempting to merge onchain assets with institutional-grade payments infrastructure. This signals a potential tipping point for mass blockchain adoption.\nThe executive said their goal was to find a way to work with the public blockchain, as the regulatory environment permits. Zaltsman described JPMorgan’s approach as “asset agnostic,” hinting that the company aims to provide multichain access to clients.\nThe executive also said the boundaries separating TradFi and DeFi may dissolve faster than expected. This is being driven by both industries’ willingness to collaborate.\nProjective Finance opens $7 million onchain lending pool for Illinois solar projects\nA RWA financing platform focused on sustainability launched a $7-million lending pool for public schools in Illinois.\nThe platform, Projective Finance, gives DeFi investors access to municipal infrastructure in the United States. The lending pool will fund solar energy installations across Illinois. The company said infrastructure loans will be executed entirely onchain.\nUsing blockchain technology, the project allows access investments without the intermediaries traditionally required. Projective Finance co-founder Josh Chinnaswamy said that with the blockchain, the investments can be done with full transparency.\nThe company lets investors take part in government-backed projects, which typically have high credit ratings and lower default risks. This includes government initiatives focusing on renewable energy. However, the platform does not provide investors with exposure to crypto assets.\nOpenSea expands to mobile with Rally deal, eyes “onchain everything app”\nNon-fungible token (NFT) platform OpenSea continues to expand beyond digital collectibles, acquiring a mobile and token-focused company called Rally.\nThe acquisition showcases OpenSea's intention to go beyond NFTs and develop a mobile-focused platform for crypto trading. The platform said that the future of NFT and token trading “fits in your pocket.” Meanwhile, Rally posted on X that users can expect a new mobile experience later in 2025.\nRally co-founders Chris Maddern and Christine Hall will be a part of OpenSea's leadership, bringing their token trading expertise to the platform.\nIn an X post, Maddern, who will also be OpenSea's new chief technology officer, said the team is working on a product to grow the onchain economy for creators and traders.\nResearchers foil $10 million DeFi backdoor in thousands of smart contracts\nA group of crypto security researchers discovered and rescued thousands of smart contracts affected by a DeFi backdoor, preventing potential losses of over $10 million in crypto.\nOn Thursday, pseudonymous Venn Network researcher Deeberiroz shared that a backdoor exploit had been quietly threatening the industry for months. The attack exploited uninitialized ERC-1967 proxy contracts, which allow malicious actors to hijack contracts before they have been set up properly.\nVenn Network co-founder and president Or Dadosh told Cointelegraph that the attacker essentially front-ran contract deployments and injected malicious implementations. “In the simplest terms, the attacker exploited certain deployments which allowed them to put a well-hidden back door in thousands of contracts,” Dadosh told Cointelegraph.\nDadosh said the attacker could have targeted the vulnerable contracts at any point. However, since the team discovered the vulnerability on Tuesday, it worked with other security researchers to evaluate affected contracts and secure vulnerable assets.\nDeFi market overview\nAccording to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, most of the 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization ended the week in the green.\nA token called MemeCore (M) was last week’s largest gainer, increasing by 1,058%, followed by Hyperlane (HYPER), which recorded over 400% in gains this week.\nThanks for reading our summary of this week’s most impactful DeFi developments.

{"title": "How to use ChatGPT for crypto strategy, signals, and sentiment", "url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-analyze-crypto-market-movements?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound", "text": "Key takeaways\nChatGPT can simplify and accelerate crypto analysis by interpreting market data, summarizing sentiment and generating strategy templates.\nReal traders use ChatGPT for bot development, technical interpretation and backtest simulation, showing practical applications beyond theory.\nIts strength lies in augmenting, not replacing, human trading decisions, especially when paired with tools like TradingView and LunarCrush.\nLimitations include a lack of real-time data and occasional prompt misinterpretation; success depends on prompt clarity and manual oversight.\nCombined with external platforms, ChatGPT becomes part of a powerful hybrid workflow for retail and professional crypto traders.\nIn the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, staying ahead of market trends is not just an advantage — it’s a necessity. With thousands of coins, ever-shifting prices and global economic factors influencing value in real time, crypto markets can be overwhelming to monitor and analyze. Traditional methods often fall short in speed, depth and insight.\nEnter ChatGPT, an AI-powered assistant that transforms how traders and investors engage with data. ChatGPT helps users process vast amounts of information with clarity and confidence, from decoding complex charts to summarizing market sentiment.\nThis article explores how to use ChatGPT for crypto analysis, from generating market insights to crafting personalized trading strategies using historical data and real-time sentiment cues.\nWhether you’re a beginner experimenting with your first trade or a seasoned investor managing a diverse portfolio, AI tools like ChatGPT are rapidly becoming indispensable in crypto investing.\nUnderstanding ChatGPT’s role in crypto analysis\nChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is a language model trained on a massive data set capable of interpreting, summarizing and generating human-like text based on input prompts. It understands patterns in data and can translate numbers, events and sentiment into actionable insights.\nFor crypto traders and analysts, ChatGPT can help with:\nExtracting insights from technical indicators and trading metrics\nSummarizing sentiment from social media and crypto news\nDrafting and refining crypto trading strategies\nPerforming qualitative risk assessments and scenario planning\nGenerating conceptual price prediction scenarios based on current data and trends.\nHowever, ChatGPT cannot predict future prices with real-time accuracy. Any forecasts or scenarios it offers are purely hypothetical and should not be interpreted as investment advice.\nEven if ChatGPT doesn’t replace live data feeds or pro-level analysis tools, it boosts productivity, enhances clarity, and complements other technical and analytical platforms.\nThe above is an example of a user who asked ChatGPT to create a crypto trading bot that places trades when relative strength index (RSI) divergence trend lines are broken and exits on hidden divergence or 5% profit, using BTC/USDT on a 15-minute chart with a directional movement index (DMI) above 20. DMI is a technical analysis indicator that helps identify whether an asset is trending and the strength of that trend.\nStep-by-step guide: How to use ChatGPT for crypto market analysis\nStep 1: Define your objective\nBefore prompting ChatGPT, identify what you want to achieve:\nAre you trying to determine if it’s a good time to enter the market?\nAre you researching a specific coin or trend?\nAre you designing a new trading algorithm?\nClear, outcome-focused objectives result in sharper, more relevant AI responses.\nStep 2: Use clear, structured prompts\nThe effectiveness of ChatGPT is largely driven by the quality of your input. Be specific and concise. Example prompts:\n“Analyze the recent BTC price trend using historical data and moving averages.”\n“Summarize Ethereum sentiment from X, Reddit, and crypto news articles for the past week.”\n“Generate a scalping strategy using RSI, MACD, and 15-minute chart intervals.”\nFor example, ChatGPT was tasked with designing a bot to trigger trades only when the RSI dropped below 30 and the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) showed divergence. It not only generated the Pine Script logic but also recommended adding volume filters to reduce false signals.\nThe above script looks for strong buying opportunities when the market is oversold and momentum starts to shift upward. It checks if the price has recently hit a low, momentum (MACD) is improving, and RSI is very low, then it signals a potential bounce by placing a buy order.\nStep 3: Analyze technical indicators\nChatGPT can break down indicators like relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci retracements, moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) and more. Although it cannot access real-time charts, you can input data points such as:\n“BTC RSI is 72, and MACD just signaled a bullish crossover with increasing volume. What does this imply?”\nChatGPT will interpret the technical conditions and provide logical explanations for what those signals may mean.\nStep 4: Evaluate market sentiment\nCrypto markets are highly influenced by sentiment. Fear, hype and FOMO can drive price action more than fundamentals. ChatGPT can help assess the emotional tone of the market by analyzing user-provided summaries or scraped content:\n“Summarize market sentiment for DOGE based on X posts and Reddit comments from the past 24 hours.”\nHere’s ChatGPT’s response:\nStep 5: Backtest trading strategies (conceptually)\nWhile ChatGPT isn’t designed to perform statistical backtesting, it is good at conceptual validation. You can describe a strategy and ask it to walk through how that strategy would have performed under different historical conditions:\n“Backtest a moving average crossover strategy on ETH from 2020 to 2023 with a 50/200-day setup.”\nChatGPT will simulate the outcomes (as in the image above) based on historical assumptions and explain the strengths and weaknesses. Still, for numerical accuracy, this should be cross-checked using actual backtesting software.\nStep 6: Simulate scenarios and predictive outcomes\nPredictive analysis is where ChatGPT could shine as a strategic advisor. Traders can input hypothetical scenarios and request implications:\n“What would happen to Bitcoin if US inflation spikes to 8% and interest rates rise by 1.5%?”\nWhen asking ChatGPT, it responded that if US inflation spikes to 8% and interest rates rise by 1.5%, Bitcoin\ncould face short-term bearish pressure due to reduced liquidity but may gain long-term appeal as an inflation hedge.“Speculate on the potential short-term price movement of SOL based on whale wallet activity and volume changes.”\nIt is important to understand that ChatGPT could give speculative insights based on historical logic and sentiment patterns, not real-time or statistically driven predictions.\nExamples prompts for ChatGPT-powered crypto trading\nThe quality of your prompts defines the quality of insights you’ll get. Below are well-rounded examples tailored for active traders, combining technical, onchain and sentiment analysis:\nBuild a swing trading strategy for XRP\nusing RSI < 30 and MACD. Include stop-loss and take-profit guidelines.Generate a weekly market summary for BTC, ETH and SOL, including price action, volume changes and major news catalysts.\nCompare recent onchain trends between Polygon and Avalanche. Focus on active addresses, gas fees and total value locked (TVL).\nProject DOT price movement over the next 90 days, assuming Polkadot ETFs are approved. Consider market sentiment and historical ETF launch effects.\nSummarize recent stablecoin-related regulatory changes in the EU and US and explain how they might affect DeFi protocols and centralized exchanges.\nThese prompts provide examples for traders who want to use AI to support their research and analysis. While helpful for speeding up insights, they should not be relied on for making final trading decisions.\nBenefits of using ChatGPT in crypto trading\nChatGPT for crypto traders is a dynamic extension of your toolkit, whether you’re evaluating crypto signals, backtesting logic or summarizing trends. It empowers crypto traders by offering:\nAccessibility: No coding experience needed. Anyone can ask smart questions and receive detailed answers.\nSpeed: Generate comprehensive analysis, strategy templates or summaries in seconds.\nCustomization: Tailor every response to your specific needs, from swing trading to long-term hodling.\nAdaptability: ChatGPT can shift between fundamental, technical and sentiment-based perspectives.\nAutomation: With integrations, ChatGPT can be built into bots or dashboards for continual analysis.\nLimitations of ChatGPT\nDespite its power, ChatGPT has some limitations you should be aware of:\nNo real-time data: Unless connected to APIs or plugins (in advanced ChatGPT versions or via third-party tools), ChatGPT cannot fetch live prices or charts.\nNot licensed financial advice: ChatGPT offers general guidance, not professional investment advice. You should never rely solely on AI-generated output for financial decisions.\nPrompt quality matters: The AI is only as good as the input it receives. Clarity and detail are critical.\nNo quantitative accuracy checks: It cannot verify data correctness without validation from external sources or live APIs.\nIntegrating ChatGPT with other crypto tools\nTo unlock ChatGPT’s full analytical potential, it helps to pair it with specialized platforms that deliver real-time data, visual analysis and automation.\nThe following tools serve as critical extensions that enhance ChatGPT’s interpretive power:\nReal-time market feeds: Use CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap or Messari to supply ChatGPT with current market stats via manual input or APIs.\nCharting platforms: Extract RSI, MACD and other indicators from TradingView, CoinGlass, Glassnode or CryptoQuant for ChatGPT to interpret.\nOnchain and sentiment analytics: Feed data from Santiment, Nansen or LunarCrush into ChatGPT to analyze wallet flows, token velocity and sentiment trends.\nAutomation tools: Use Zapier, Make or Python bots to trigger ChatGPT workflows based on alerts or price actions.\nAdvanced plugins (Pro): Extend ChatGPT’s capabilities with plugins like Link Reader to fetch real-time info directly.\nBy combining ChatGPT’s pattern recognition and synthesis with the precision of crypto tools, you create a hybrid analysis stack that’s AI-assisted, data-driven and ready for action. But always remember, AI insights should guide, not replace, critical thinking and due diligence.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The speculative hype of 2021 is now a thing of the past.\nMemecoins and DeFi derivatives no longer move markets like they used to. Investors are no longer chasing vapor; they are looking for substance. They want tangible assets, real returns and real infrastructure. This is precisely where real-world assets (RWAs) come into play.\nIn a market that’s tired of pumps and dumps and desperate for durability, tokenizing assets like real estate, luxury goods and commodities offers a rare trifecta: tangible value, yield and access. No white paper fiction with mostly fake advisers, no tokenomics that benefit insiders and early VCs — just good old bricks, gold and oil, but onchain.\nIn the UAE in particular, among all the RWA categories, real estate stands out as the most promising, and it’s not hard to see why.\nRWA tokenization in Dubai\nFor the first time, owning a piece of prime Dubai real estate no longer demands massive upfront capital. Tokenization has opened the gates, allowing anyone with a smartphone and a few hundred dollars to buy fractional shares in a luxury villa, a downtown apartment or a high-yield rental property in JVC.\nThe promise of democratized investing, an idea that has been circling the industry for years, is no longer just theoretical but a framework grounded in law.\nIn May, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) introduced updated rules. The regulator created a new category of virtual assets: Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVAs), specifically designed to allow the compliant tokenization of real-world assets like real estate.\nTokenized real estate in Dubai\nThis new framework enables the issuance and trading of tokenized real estate on regulated exchanges or through regulated brokers. Issuers must obtain a Category 1 VARA license, meet capital requirements, undergo audits, publish white papers and make proper disclosures. It is a regulated, secure framework designed to support a new generation of global capital. And it’s already delivering results.\nLast month, the Dubai Land Department, together with VARA and leading developers, oversaw the tokenization and sale of two apartments. The entire offering sold out within minutes. Buyers came from over 35 countries, and remarkably, 70% of them were first-time real estate investors in Dubai. This was not an institutional play; it was global retail, arriving with crypto wallets in hand, ready to purchase property onchain. Tokenization made it possible.\nThe benefits aren’t limited to investors. Developers finally have an alternative to traditional funding channels. Tokenization enables them to access global capital markets without relinquishing equity, incurring excessive debt with banks, or navigating painstakingly slow fundraising processes.\nInvestors now can diversify across multiple properties rather than committing all their capital to a single deal. And with Dubai’s rental yields consistently outperforming those of most major global cities, the value proposition speaks for itself.\nSo why now? What’s driving this surge in interest around RWAs?\nUAE’s regulatory clarity around RWA tokenization\nIn uncertain macroeconomic conditions, capital seeks hard assets. Commodities such as gold, oil and natural gas are beginning to look increasingly attractive. The UAE now offers both regulatory clarity and real market and infrastructure access.\nThis was not always the case.\nRelated: Dubai real estate sales hit $18B in May amid tokenization push\nThe St. Regis Aspen Resort tokenization project, launched in 2018, raised $18 million and was among the first SEC-compliant real estate offerings onchain. It faced numerous challenges. The tokens were not listed on exchanges until 2020, which caused delays for investors seeking liquidity.\nEven after listing, trading volume remained low, and the token price dropped significantly from $1.32 to $0.85 by early 2022. Access to the offering was limited to accredited investors, and the project’s switch from Ethereum to Tezos introduced additional complexity.\nAlthough many initially viewed the project as a failure, by 2024 the Aspen tokens had recovered and surged over 200%, indicating that the early struggles were more a result of the growing pains of a new model than a flawed concept.\nOne of the most high-profile early attempts at real estate tokenization — the attempted tokenization of The Plaza Hotel in New York, powered by the same blockchain platform (Harbor) — never made it to market. Despite raising $28 million in venture funding and generating significant buzz, the project was ultimately shelved due to a web of operational, legal, and stakeholder complexities.\nThese early setbacks revealed an uncomfortable truth: While the vision was sound, the surrounding ecosystem, technological, legal, and financial, simply was not ready.\nThe US attempted to regulate 21st-century innovations with a legal framework built in the 1930s. It did not work. Founders looked elsewhere. And Dubai finally stepped up.\nThe UAE didn’t try to bend old rules to accommodate new tech. It built something new and that has made all the difference.\nSuppose you're a founder building a tokenization platform, a VC looking to back infrastructure plays, a family office allocating toward alternative assets, or a builder looking for the next high-impact vertical — if the UAE’s RWA tokenization is not already on your radar, you’re behind.\nThe rails are built. The market is live. And while they used to say “Habibi, come to Dubai” — now, Dubai is coming to you wherever you are, in the form of tokenized real-world assets.\nOpinion by: Irina Heaver, crypto lawyer\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The stock has climbed more than 21% over the past month, in line with a broader rebound among Bitcoin\nmining stocks.The latest rally was fueled by news that Hive Digital surpassed 12 exahashes per second (EH/s) of Bitcoin mining hashrate, doubling its output since the start of the year. The company is currently generating over $250 million in annualized revenue and expects to reach $400 million once it scales up to 18 EH/s.\nCEO Aydin Kilic said the company is now mining more than 6 BTC per day with an operating margin of roughly 55%.\nHIVE ranks among the 20 largest public Bitcoin holders, with 2,201 BTC reported in its latest filing.\nRelated: Investors are balking at ‘excessive’ Bitcoin miner exec pay: VanEck\nAverage Bitcoin mining costs rise\nThe Bitcoin mining industry has faced significant operational challenges since the latest halving, which cut miners’ block rewards by 50%. This sharp drop in revenue, combined with high energy, equipment and overhead costs, has made profitability more difficult to sustain.\nTo stay ahead of these pressures, some miners have diversified their business models by expanding into artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads. Early signs indicate that this pivot toward AI is paying off, notably for Core Scientific, which avoided financial collapse in part by shifting resources to AI operations. Core Scientific has since been acquired by CoreWeave in a $9 billion all-stock deal.\nHIVE Digital told Cointelegraph last September that it had repurposed several GPUs for AI workloads — a move that significantly increased its revenue.

However, not every country is clamping down. In fact, a few forward-thinking jurisdictions are bucking the trend, offering complete tax freedom on crypto gains.\nFor anyone wondering where crypto is tax-free in 2025, these crypto tax-free countries have become havens for traders, long-term Bitcoin holders and digital asset entrepreneurs alike.\nWhether you’re managing a decentralized finance (DeFi) portfolio, planning your offshore relocation or simply looking to live tax-free with crypto, understanding the best cryptocurrency tax-free jurisdictions for 2025 could unlock serious financial advantages.\nFrom Caribbean islands to the Middle East and even some unexpected parts of Europe, these destinations are rewriting the rulebook.\nIn this guide, we’ll highlight five of the best countries for crypto taxes in 2025 — places where the Bitcoin tax haven becomes a legal reality.\nLet’s explore where crypto profits can still fly under the radar.\n1. Cayman Islands: Live tax-free with crypto\nIf you’re seeking a true digital asset tax-safe zone, the Cayman Islands should be at the top of your list. This classic offshore financial center imposes no personal income tax, capital gains tax or corporate tax — and yes, that includes cryptocurrencies. Whether you’re trading Bitcoin\n, holding long-term or managing a DeFi treasury, your gains stay untouched.For those concerned about regulation, Cayman also delivers. The updated Virtual Asset (Service Providers) Act, with a fully operational licensing regime from April 2025, gives the country a clear and compliant framework. This means exchanges, custodians and other platforms can operate legally, under standards aligned with global norms.\nAdd to that a stable local economy (the Cayman dollar is pegged to the US dollar), English common-law protections and a high-end expat-friendly lifestyle, and it’s easy to see why the Cayman Islands are among the most reliable tax-free crypto zones.\nFor many, it’s the ultimate answer to “Where is crypto tax-free in 2025?”\n2. United Arab Emirates: Tax-free crypto zones\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) continues to cement its place as one of the most crypto-friendly countries in 2025. Across all seven emirates, including Dubai and Abu Dhabi, individuals pay zero tax on crypto trading, staking, mining or selling. It’s a full-spectrum crypto tax haven with no personal income tax and no capital gains tax on digital assets.\nMoreover, the appeal goes beyond tax policy. With dedicated crypto regulators such as Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (Dubai International Financial Centre) and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (Abu Dhabi Global Market), the UAE offers regulatory clarity for startups, VCs and major players alike. Whether you’re minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or building a layer-1 protocol, there’s a clear licensing path.\nAdd in attractive visa options, world-class infrastructure and offshore crypto tax benefits, and the UAE becomes an obvious choice for those looking to relocate for crypto tax savings.\nFor many global citizens and crypto nomads, this is the closest thing to a tax-free Bitcoin lifestyle.\nDid you know? A recent study shows around 25.3% of UAE residents own crypto, and Dubai scores 98.4/100 for “crypto obsession” — among the highest globally.\n3. El Salvador: Bitcoin tax haven\nWhen El Salvador declared Bitcoin legal tender back in 2021, it sent shockwaves across the financial world. Fast-forward to 2025, and this small Central American nation still ranks among the most radical Bitcoin tax havens on the planet.\nThanks to its Digital Assets law, there’s zero capital gains or income tax on Bitcoin transactions — whether you’re trading, hodling or spending it via Lightning wallets like Chivo. It’s one of the few crypto tax-free countries in 2025 where that promise still holds, especially for long-term investors.\nRemember that El Salvador is building Bitcoin City, a geothermal-powered crypto metropolis with no income, property or capital gains taxes — an emerging tax-free crypto zone designed for miners, startups and digital nomads alike.\nFor those seeking to live tax-free with crypto while staying plugged into a forward-looking ecosystem, El Salvador represents a bold — and fully legal — alternative.\nDid you know? Tether, the issuer of the top stablecoin USDT, is moving its headquarters to El Salvador in 2025 to capitalize on the country’s crypto-friendly environment.\n4. Germany: Crypto-friendly country\nGermany may not scream “tax haven,” but for long-term crypto holders, it’s quietly one of the most crypto-friendly countries in 2025. Here’s why: If you hold your Bitcoin or other digital assets for over 12 months, any sale, swap or even everyday use is completely tax-free.\nThat’s right — Germany treats long-held crypto as a private asset, not a speculative one. It’s one of the rare crypto tax loophole countries where holding equals exemption.\nEven for short-term trades, there’s relief. If your total gains for the year stay under 1,000 euros, you owe nothing — no filing required. Only gains above that threshold get taxed, and only if sold before the one-year mark.\nIn a high-tax nation like Germany, this setup is surprisingly generous. If you’re a disciplined hodler or digital asset investor, Germany may be one of the best low crypto tax nations in 2025, especially for those based in the EU looking for legal, local relief.\n5. Portugal: Country with zero crypto tax\nStill a strong contender on any list of countries with zero crypto tax, Portugal offers a unique mix of sun, surf and tax savings. For assets held longer than 365 days, crypto capital gains are fully exempt, making it one of the top cryptocurrency tax-free jurisdictions in Europe.\nThe appeal is even greater for those who qualified under the Non-Habitual Resident (NHR) program before the March 31, 2025 cutoff. Under NHR, most foreign-source crypto income is tax-exempt, and domestic income is taxed at just 20%.\nHowever, the landscape isn’t entirely tax-free. Short-term gains (under a year) are now taxed at 28%, and income from staking or business-like activity is also taxed. Still, for long-horizon investors and retirees seeking crypto tax relief, Portugal remains one of the most attractive digital asset tax safe zones.\nIt’s no surprise Portugal continues to attract remote workers and crypto expats looking to relocate for crypto tax savings.\nDid you know? Börse Stuttgart Digital, licensed by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, or BaFin, now offers crypto custody and trading under Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), serving institutional clients across Europe.\nWhere is crypto tax-free in the world?\nSo, where is crypto tax-free in 2025? These five countries — Cayman Islands, UAE, El Salvador, Germany and Portugal — stand out as top-tier no crypto tax countries, each with its own model for unlocking offshore crypto tax benefits and maximizing gains.\nFrom long-term holding exemptions in Germany and Portugal to outright zero tax on crypto in the Caymans, UAE and El Salvador, these destinations offer serious advantages for those building a tax-free Bitcoin lifestyle.\nThat said, these benefits don’t come without conditions. Residency requirements, documentation and ongoing legal compliance are essential. Also, laws can change fast; El Salvador’s negotiations with the International Monetary Fund are a reminder that today’s tax haven could face tomorrow’s revisions.\nIf you’re planning to move abroad to avoid crypto tax, do it smartly. Seek local tax counsel, track evolving regulations and explore your options thoroughly. Because in a world tightening around crypto, these five countries remain rare global crypto tax relief options — at least for now.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Increasingly, it’s crypto scammers targeting Americans and laundering stolen millions overseas.\nIn 2025, online romance can feel thrilling, but cryptocurrency dating scam $36.9 million headlines show its darker side. It usually starts with a friendly message on social media or a dating app. Then slowly, week by week, they build trust, seem charming, knowledgeable, affectionate and eager to share their investment tips, often in crypto.\nVictims are lured by getting flattering messages, late-night voice calls, links to fake trading platforms or receiving fake videos of their crypto gains. But every time victims try to withdraw their profits, they’re met with fees, delays, manipulation or demands for more deposits. The platforms vanish once the scammers have squeezed out enough money.\nIn 2023 alone, Americans lost over $5.6 billion in crypto scams, 71% of which were investment-related. And romance scams, also known as pig butchering scams, were the most prominent.\nHow a flirty DM turned into a global crypto laundering scheme\nThis scam grew from a flirty DM into an international money laundering operation through shell companies, businesses that exist mostly on paper with no real operations or employees. These entities are often used to hide money trails, avoid taxes or obscure the true ownership of assets.\nIn this case, five men, scattered across the US, Spain, China and Turkey, were charged after using dating apps and social platforms to reel in American victims. Two scammers, Jose Somarriba and Shengsheng He, founded Axis Digital, a fake crypto business that served as the financial front. They opened a Deltec bank account in the Bahamas under Axis Digital’s name and used it to accept victim funds. Another co-conspirator, Jingliang Su, worked as a director and was in charge of converting stolen money into Tether USDt , a stablecoin favored by both fraudsters and legitimate users for its speed and liquidity.\nYicheng Zhang and Joseph Wong handled the dirty work in the US by operating bank accounts, moving money between states and disguising the origins of the funds. Eventually, everything ended up in wallets managed by scam centers in Cambodia, a hub of laundering activity.\nThe US Department of Justice (DOJ) says this case, which shocked the public in June 2025, involved lengthy conversations through dating apps, calls and even fake investment dashboards. Victims were told their crypto investments were growing when, in fact, their funds were being funneled into crypto wallets abroad.\nWhat’s more, the DOJ moved to seize more than $225 million in crypto tied to pig butchering scams, involving over 400 victims tricked through fraudulent investment platforms. The DOJ also credited Tether for aiding the investigation.\nWhat made this scheme stand out was how polished it was. Victims weren’t just being tricked by a person; they were being fooled by a whole system complete with corporate fronts, international bank transfers, technical jargon and screenshots of unimaginable gains at the ready to make everything seem legit.\nWhy romance scammers prefer Tether for laundering millions\nUnlike traditional bank wires, stablecoin transactions such as USDT can be moved across borders instantly with minimal scrutiny. That makes it perfect for transforming ill-gotten gains into seemingly clean assets.\nThe Tether laundering scheme used in this case is a classic example of how crypto’s anonymity and speed attract criminals. After Axis Digital collected the funds, they were converted into Tether and sent to wallets based in Cambodia. From there, they were redistributed using Telegram-based crypto laundering rings, some of which have links to sanctioned entities.\nThe US government has grown increasingly concerned about stablecoins being used in illicit finance. That’s why the DOJ’s crackdown on cases like this goes hand-in-hand with larger efforts to regulate Tether and monitor suspicious crypto flows. By tracing the onchain movements, investigators uncovered wallet addresses, payment patterns and conversion activity consistent with known laundering behaviors.\nDid you know? According to Chainalysis’s crypto crime report, USDT money laundering cases accounted for an astounding 63% of all illicit crypto transactions in 2024. It’s a significant jump from previous years, showing its growing appeal to fraudsters due to its speed and low fees.\nThe global web of crypto crime\nAxis Digital is just one node in a sprawling digital spider web. The DOJ crypto scam crackdown is targeting more than just romance scams; it’s pursuing international syndicates, shell firms and state‑backed groups.\nThe Huione Group crypto crime activity illustrates how criminal networks overlap with geopolitical players. Treasury officials say Huione has become the “marketplace of choice for malicious cyber actors” such as North Korea’s Lazarus Group.\nWhat’s more, this underworld is dizzyingly interconnected: Axis Digital funnels to Cambodia, Huione funnels Korean‑linked funds through similar channels, and Telegram-based crime rings share cover services and guarantee syndicates.\nWith DOJ prosecutors securing a crypto scammer’s guilty plea from Jose Somarriba, one of the ringleaders behind the Axis Digital crypto romance scam, it signals that 2025 may be the year things turn. The case, which involved millions in stolen crypto funneled through shell companies and laundered abroad, has become a cornerstone in the DOJ’s broader crackdown on pig butchering-style scams.\nThis guilty plea isn’t just a formality; it’s an admission from within the ring, and maybe the way toward unraveling larger syndicates. US agents are poring through transactions, tracing USDT across Asia and beyond, mapping out digital corridors. They’re seeing a pattern: Romance crypto scamming Americans leads to USDT, which feeds a global laundering pipeline.\nDid you know? The stolen money from romance scams doesn’t just disappear. The funds often flow through laundering operations connected to sanctioned groups, feeding wider cybercrime ecosystems.\nHow to avoid falling into the crypto-dating trap\nFraudsters use various technological and behavioral techniques to trick victims of crypto schemes. These traps frequently use trust, a sense of haste and the promise of large returns to bypass sound judgment.\nLooking out for red flags can help you stay safe. Be wary of unsolicited investment advice, especially from someone you just met online.\n- Trading platform scams: If a new dating match suggests a platform promising guaranteed profits or asks for more deposits before withdrawals, that’s a major warning sign. Never share ID documents or personal data with platforms you haven’t thoroughly vetted.\n- Do some research: Check if the company is registered with a financial authority and search for independent reviews. Check if that investment platform exists by looking for SEC and DFPI registrations.\n- Question “too good to be true” relationships: Love or crypto investments shouldn’t feel like a rollercoaster. If someone you just met online starts pushing crypto on you, it’s worth checking the legitimacy of the crypto opportunity and the relationship.\n- Telegram scams: If someone you barely know suggests using Telegram for crypto offers, it’s likely a scam.\n- Meet face-to-face or don’t invest: Scammers tend to hide their real faces and avoid face-to-face conversations, sending fake proof of gains. A live call might help, but even that can be faked with artificial intelligence.\nEmotional vulnerability can also play a role. People in love may have a blurred perception of reality and miss the warning signs. Others may lack crypto knowledge and only hear about “huge gains” on social media. That’s where crypto education matters: Understanding the basics can mean the difference between spotting a scam and falling for one.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 15:05:00 +0100", "author": "Cointelegraph by Tobias Vilkenson", "source": "https://cointelegraph.com/rss"}

Throughout the first half of the year, the network’s strategic focus centered on reinforcing its role as a leading blockchain for stablecoin transfers. In its latest report, Cointelegraph Research examines TRON’s performance across core metrics and explores its expanding presence in the global stablecoin ecosystem.\nUSDT activity on TRON reaches new highs\nTRON has continued to solidify its position as a leading network for stablecoin settlements. Since the beginning of the year, the supply of stablecoins on TRON has grown by 40% and reached $81 billion, primarily by active USDT issuance. USDT now makes up 99% of the stablecoin supply on the network, and, following recent mints, 51% of the total USDT in circulation is on TRON. The stablecoin is now held by over 67 million accounts on TRON, and more than 1 million of them conduct daily transfers. This netted 65 million USDT transfers in June, with a volume of over $600 billion. This underscores TRON’s role as a core infrastructure layer for stablecoin transfers.\nLooking forward, the TRON DAO has introduced gas-free USDT transfers as a response to rising gas fees. To enable this option, users must activate a GasFree wallet with a one-time fee of 1 USDT. Each subsequent transfer then incurs a fixed commission of 1 USDT, paid in USDT rather than TRX. While this provides a more predictable fee structure, it may be inefficient for users who make small and frequent transactions.\nKey onchain metrics continue to rise on TRON\nIn the first half of 2025, TRON demonstrated sustained growth in onchain activity, and key metrics rose to some of the highest levels in the network’s history. Both the number of active users and transaction throughput continued to expand, driven by the stablecoin transfers and trading on decentralized exchanges. The latter showed a significant increase compared to 2024.\nTransaction volume and active addresses were among the strongest metrics in Q2. TRON recorded 780 million transactions, a 37% year-over-year increase and the second-highest quarterly total on record. This surge was largely driven by a significant rise in TRX transfers, which now account for nearly 41% of all activity in the network. Daily active addresses increased by 25% in Q2 compared to the same period in 2024. The network consistently ranked second in both metrics behind Solana, which put it ahead of major competitors, such as BNB Chain, Ethereum and Polygon.\nThe rise in onchain activity during the first half of 2025 also translated into growth in TRON’s financial metrics. In Q2, the network achieved an all-time high in revenue, with a significant increase of 20% compared to the first quarter.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The crypto business, backed by Trump and his three sons, launched USD1 on March 4.\nAn Abu Dhabi-based investment firm, MGX, announced a $2-billion investment in Binance on March 12 using a then-unnamed stablecoin. Eric Trump, one of WLF’s co-founders, said in May that the company would be using USD1 to settle the investment.\nAccording to Bloomberg, 90% of all the USD1 coins used in the transaction remained in Binance’s wallets as of Friday, potentially generating tens of millions of dollars in interest for Trump and his family.\nThe reported relationship between one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges and a business closely tied to the US president raises questions about potential conflicts of interest and the use of political influence for business gain.\nCointelegraph reached out to a Binance spokesperson and World Liberty Financial but had not received responses at the time of publication.\nRelated: Trump family-backed business votes on making governance token tradable\nChangpeng “CZ” Zhao, the former CEO of Binance, pleaded guilty to one felony count as part of a settlement with US authorities in 2023. Although he had already served four months in prison, he said in May that he was seeking a presidential pardon from Trump.\nSuch a pardon could potentially allow Zhao to return to a managerial or operational role at a US crypto business. At the time of publication, he had not publicly commented on the report.\nCongress, Trump looking to sign off on stablecoin bill\nTrump’s crypto ventures have been under scrutiny from many US lawmakers since before he took office — the president made several campaign promises suggesting that he would tailor policies for the crypto industry.\nAmong his financial entanglements were World Liberty Financial and its stablecoin, the launch of his memecoin Official Trump\nand contributions from crypto executives who supported his campaign.The Bloomberg report came as Republican leaders in the House of Representatives are expected to consider three crypto bills, among them legislation to regulate payment stablecoins in the US.\nThe GENIUS Act — whose name also refers to one of Trump’s many social media posts — has already passed the Senate and is expected to receive a floor vote in the House soon.\nThough Democrats in the Senate initially stopped a crucial vote for the stablecoin bill, citing Trump’s crypto interests, it ultimately passed with bipartisan support. It’s unclear whether the bill will have enough support to pass in the House, where Republicans also hold a slim majority.

Congress is also considering a law preventing the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\nCrypto has found support on both sides of the aisle, with Democratic and Republican lawmakers each making a number of amendments to the bills under consideration. Major crypto exchanges operating in the United States, like Coinbase, have stepped up their campaigning for the legislation as well.\nWith Congress set to take action on three critical bills during Crypto Week, here’s a look at what they’re considering and what it means for the crypto industry.\nCrypto week aims to pass three bills into law\nThe US House Financial Services Committee announced Crypto Week would start on July 14. It will consider three bills, namely:\nThe Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY Act)\nRepublican Representative French Hill introduced the CLARITY Act only at the end of June. The bill aims to provide a framework for the digital assets industry, including defining the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\nThe crypto industry has long thought that the Howey test, as outlined in the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is out of date and that the SEC should not apply it nor exercise jurisdiction over digital assets.\nThe CLARITY Act would “provide an exemption from the Securities Act of 1933’s registration requirement for offers of investment contracts involving digital commodities on mature blockchains that meet certain conditions.”\nIt also defines “mature” blockchains as networks that have a digital commodity “substantially derived from the use and functioning of the blockchain.” It can’t have user restrictions and must limit certain holders to less than 20% of ownership.\nUnder the bill, the CFTC would gain “exclusive regulatory jurisdiction” over crypto transactions. Crypto exchanges and brokers would be required to register with the commission and would be subject to record keeping, reporting, antitrust considerations and other regulatory considerations.\nThe Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act)\nPerhaps the most well-known of the three bills being considered during crypto week is the GENIUS Act, the long-awaited regulatory framework for stablecoins.\nThe bill was introduced in February, just over a week after President Donald Trump took his oath of office, by a bipartisan group of legislators. It is now in the House after passing the Senate in a bipartisan vote on June 17.\nThe bill defines what type of entities may issue stablecoins and states that “issuers must maintain reserves backing the stablecoin on a one-to-one basis using U.S. currency or other similarly liquid assets, as specified.”\nRelated: GENIUS Act could strengthen dollar power, write ‘rulebook’ for global financial system\nIt also subjects issuers to the Bank Secrecy Act and sets provisions for the event of a stablecoin issuer going insolvent.\nAnti-CBDC Surveillance State Act\nRepublican Representative Tom Emmer introduced the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act on March 6, which seeks to prevent the Federal Reserve, the US’s central bank, from issuing a CBDC.\nUnder the pretense of concern over citizens’ privacy, the act would forbid the Fed from issuing a CBDC either by itself or through a third party, prevent the Fed from using a CBDC to influence monetary policy and give Congress the sole authority to issue a digital dollar.\nAccording to an announcement from the House Committee on Financial Services, supporting organizations include the Blockchain Association, the Digital Chamber of Commerce and a number of banking lobbies.\nCan the crypto bills actually pass?\nGiven the glacial pace of lawmaking in Washington, one week is a short time to pass three laws, especially considering the size and economic implications of these three bills.\nMajor crypto companies like Coinbase have been lobbying hard. On July 7, Stand With Crypto, the “grassroots” crypto lobbying organization started by Coinbase, sent a letter to lawmakers signed by 65 executives from various crypto firms, urging Congress to pass the CLARITY Act.\nRelated: Coinbase crypto lobby urges Congress to back major crypto bill\nOn July 9, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote a message supporting the same, saying that “America is ready for crypto.”\nPolymarket doesn’t reflect this readiness. Participants in the “Clarity Act signed into law in 2025?” market give the bill a 52% chance at publishing time.\nThe CLARITY Act has been panned by lawmakers and consumer protection organizations alike as being a “crypto crash grab” and a means for companies to avoid SEC regulation.\nAmericans for Financial Reform (AFR) called the bill “a massive deregulatory bill backed by a gusher of campaign cash and lobbying muscle from ultra-wealthy venture capital firms and crypto billionaires. The bill will enrich them at the expense of consumers, communities, and financial stability.”\nThe AFR also raised concerns about Trump’s personal crypto dealings and noted that the bill contains no provisions regarding corruption and ethical concerns.\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, a noted crypto critic, has also opposed the bill, stating that it allows major firms to skirt SEC regulation.\n“Under the House bill, a publicly traded company like Meta or Tesla could simply decide to put its stock on the blockchain and — poof! — it would escape all SEC regulation,” said Warren.\nThe GENIUS Act, by comparison, has experienced more debate and revision in both halls of Congress. According to Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the bill’s sponsors, the Senate has done significant work to include provisions addressing Democratic concerns over terrorism financing and money laundering.\nWhen the bill passed the Senate in mid-June, Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said it “targets illicit finance, places limitations on Big Tech, puts in place ethical guardrails, and strengthens national security.”\nConcerns remain, like the potential effect the act could have on dollar dominance and treasury markets. Even so, betting markets are optimistic. Participants on Polymarket give the bill a 92% chance of passing this year.\nThe anti-CBDC bill is still under deliberation. On July 9, the House Committee on Ways and Means and Oversight Subcommittee announced a July 16 hearing on “affirmative steps needed to place a tax policy framework on digital assets.”\nThe hearing is reportedly set to address aspects related to Emmer’s anti-CBDC bill.\nWhether pro-crypto lawmakers can pass three laws in a week seems a high bar to clear, but even if they don’t, their focus in the near future is definitely crypto.\nMagazine: Inside a 30,000 phone bot farm stealing crypto airdrops from real users", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 14:58:00 +0100", "author": "Cointelegraph by Aaron Wood", "source": "https://cointelegraph.com/rss"}

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\nRICH Miner offers a new way to grow crypto assets, turning static holdings into stable daily income via cloud mining.\nIn the cryptocurrency market, how to achieve continuous appreciation of the crypto assets in hand has become a common focus of investors. In the past, storing Bitcoin or XRP in a coin library or digital wallet was considered a safe option, but now, with the development of cloud mining technology, this static holding method is gradually being replaced by “dynamic appreciation”.\nThe rise of RICH Miner is providing a new strategy for global users: no complicated operations are required, and crypto assets can be converted into stable daily income through cloud mining alone.\nStorage ≠ appreciation: The limitations of traditional coinbase strategies\nMany investors choose to store cryptocurrencies in centralized exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase or decentralized wallets, such as MetaMask, SafePal. This frozen asset method ensures security but lacks the ability to increase value.\nIn a bull market, price increases may bring profits, but in a consolidation period or a bear market, assets not only cannot appreciate, but may even depreciate. Simple storage means missing the opportunity for active returns.\nThe rise of cloud mining: a passive income tool that breaks the technical threshold\nTraditional mining used to be the patent of technology geeks and large mining farms. Ordinary people who want to participate are often limited by high hardware costs, electricity costs and technical maintenance barriers. However, the emergence of cloud mining has changed everything.\nThrough platforms such as RICH Miner, users do not need to purchase equipment. They only need to register, select contracts, and invest in mainstream assets such as USDT or BTC to obtain stable cryptocurrency income every day, truly realizing using assets to generate assets.\nRICH Miner: An efficient, secure and transparent asset appreciation engine\nAs a leader in the field of cloud mining, RICH Miner provides a variety of mainstream cryptocurrency mining contracts including Bitcoin (BTC) and DOGE, with a yield rate far higher than the industry average. Some contracts have a daily yield of up to $4,850, suitable for investors seeking high returns.\nThe platform’s advantages include:\n- Zero technical threshold: No need to deploy mining machines, suitable for all users.\n- Daily settlement, transparent income: All mining income can be checked and withdrawn in real-time.\n- Multi-wallet compatibility: Supports withdrawals from mainstream wallets such as Coinbase, Trust Wallet, and SafePal.\n- The platform operates stably: With global server and mining pool support to ensure maximum mining efficiency.\nFrom passive waiting to active appreciation: How do you cash out assets?\nSuppose someone holds $10,000 worth of Bitcoin or USDT, which is stored in the coin library for a long time. After choosing RICH Miner, they can invest part of their assets in the cloud mining project, and realize a stable crypto value-added channel every day while ensuring the safety of the principal.\n1: Create an account: Users can get $15 computing power by registering an account on the official website.\n2: Contract selection: Choose a mining plan according to budget.\n| Contract Type | Contract Price | Contract duration | Daily income | Total revenue |\n| Daily Sign-in Rewards | $15 | 1 | $0.6 | $15+$0.6 |\n| New User Experience Contract | $100 | 2 | $3 | $100.00 + $6 |\n| Canaan Avalon A15XP | $600 | 8 | $7.20 | $500.00 + $57.60 |\n| Bitdeer SealMiner A2 | $1,300 | 13 | $17.30 | $1300.00 + $221.39 |\n| Bitmain Antminer L7 | $3,000 | 17 | $42.30 | $3000.00 + $719.10 |\n| Bitmain Antminer S21 Immersion | $5,000 | 24 | $75.00 | $5000.00 + $1800.00 |\n| Bitmain Antminer L9 | $12,000 | 32 | $204.00 | $12000.00 + $6528.00 |\nFollow the link to view the full contract.\n3. All income can be checked in real time, and withdrawals are credited to the account in 5 minutes, which truly achieves clear and transparent, fast arrival.\nThere are more than 5 million registered users worldwide who are continuously earning passive income through RICH Miner, including novices and institutional investors. Users on third-party platforms such as Trustpilot also continue to share positive reviews such as stable income, convenient operation and professional customer service.\nConclusion: Step out of Coinbase and embrace the new era of smart mining\nFuture wealth accumulation is no longer just buy and hold, but allocation, management and creation. RICH Miner is becoming the preferred value-added tool for more and more crypto investors, helping them achieve real active asset growth.\nInvestors who already have cryptocurrency might want to take action now to convert dormant coins into daily surging income, move from Coinbase to RICH Miner, and start a new era of value-added crypto gold.\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party.

Instead, analysts say spot ETF demand and corporate treasury strategies are driving this historic move. Meanwhile, altcoins are surging in BTC’s wake.\nBitcoin (BTC) shattered its previous all-time high of $116,000 on July 11, peaking at $118,872 before settling near $117,300, pulling a 3% daily gain that masked the frenzy beneath the surface. Ethereum (ETH) outpaced BTC with a 7% surge, reclaiming $3,000 for the first time since February, while memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) posted double-digit rallies.\nAccording to Thomas Perfumo, Kraken’s global economist, Bitcoin is “breaking a months-long range” and entering fresh territory for price discovery. Perfumo noted that over $1 billion in short positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours alone, while Bitcoin dominance slipped slightly—a rare sign that altcoins are leading the charge.\n“Concurrently, strength in U.S. equities, currently trading at or near all-time highs, is showcasing a robust risk-on environment, a supportive backdrop for crypto,” Perfumo said in a statement obtained by crypto.news on Friday.\nWith Bitcoin dominance dipping to 54%, the market is witnessing a rare convergence, one where institutional accumulation and derivatives chaos fuel gains across the board, not just at the top. The question now isn’t whether macro matters, but whether crypto’s market mechanics have permanently decoupled from traditional triggers.\nMarket structure, not macro, is steering the rally\nWhat distinguishes this rally from previous surges is its foundation. Analysts aren’t pointing to central banks or macro volatility as the spark. Instead, they’re watching structural flows inside the crypto market itself, most notably the direct impact of spot ETF demand.\nBitcoin ETFs logged their biggest single day of inflows in 2025 on Thursday, pulling in $1.18 billion, according to SoSoValue data. Ethereum ETFs followed suit with their second-strongest performance of the year at $383 million. These are not speculative futures bets or proxy trades through microcap equities. They are direct, capital-intensive commitments to spot assets.\nNicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, views the breakout through that lens.\n“In my view, this isn’t a macro-driven rally, but rather an isolated event. That said, recent U.S. policy developments such as fiscal expansion and expectations of further monetary easing have created a backdrop that is undeniably favorable for Bitcoin. We’re seeing Bitcoin treasury strategies proliferate across companies, which reflects growing institutional confidence in BTC as a balance sheet asset,” he also said in a statement sent to crypto.news.\nSondergaard emphasized that Bitcoin’s clean break through key liquidation levels, and its ability to hold above them, acted as a trigger point for this latest market-wide rally.\nWhat comes next hinges on sustainability. Past rallies relied on macroeconomic tailwinds. This one is testing whether crypto’s internal mechanics, such as ETF flows, corporate adoption, and derivatives markets—can independently support valuations. If so, we may be witnessing the birth of a new market paradigm, one where crypto writes its own rules.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 20:42:27 +0000", "author": "Brian Danga", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

NYSE-listed DDC will help develop and implement strategies via which Animoca Brands can optimize its yield from the Bitcoin assets it holds.\nThe announcement comes a few days after DDC revealed a major investment plan targeting Bitcoin, and its deal with Animoca Brands will boost this effort, the companies noted in a press release.\nAs part of the collaboration, DDC is tapping Animoca Brands co-founder Yat Siu to join its Bitcoin Visionary Council.

Kraken and Robinhood already allow their users to trade tokenized stocks. Bitwise’s Matt Hougan estimates the value of assets that can be tokenized at $257 trillion, a massive market not yet represented in innovative marketplaces. Regulators are reacting to the trend: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins encourages the emergence of tokenized stocks, while his colleague Hester Peirce warns about “unique risks.”\nWhat does Hester Peirce say?\nOn July 9, 2025, as the tokenization of stocks became a topic of discussion, SEC Crypto Task Force head Hester Peirce issued a statement on the SEC website. Her message, titled “Enchanting but not Magical,” was summarized by the media as: “tokenized securities are still securities.”\nIn her message, Peirce emphasized that tokenized securities qualify for existing securities laws. Blockchain does not transform securities into cryptocurrency or any other asset class. Therefore, securities laws apply to tokenized assets, and investors and issuers must recognize this to avoid risks.\nRegarding “unique risks,” Peirce noted that some securities are tokenized by entities that didn’t issue them, or they tokenize security entitlements. Traders should be aware of such possibilities as they introduce counterparty risks, while distributors of tokenized securities must remember their disclosure obligations.\n“While blockchain-based tokenization is new, the process of issuing an instrument representing a security is not. The same legal requirements apply to on- and off-chain versions of these instruments.”\nAt the end of her statement, Peirce calls on market participants to meet with SEC representatives to work together on creating a clear legal framework for tokenized securities trading.\nThe Biden-era SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, was known for considering most cryptocurrencies unlicensed securities, leading to multiple legal battles. Hester Peirce’s statement is markedly different. She reminds the public that the format of securities doesn’t change their legal essence. Gensler claimed altcoins are securities; Peirce says securities are securities.\nDoes Peirce’s statement represent the SEC’s position?\nWhile Peirce’s comments are cautionary, SEC Chair Paul Atkins has made favorable statements about tokenized stocks. As reported by multiple media outlets, Atkins referred to tokenized securities as “innovation” and stated that the SEC should advance innovation in the marketplace.\nHe did say that, but Atkins is not suggesting current trading practices can remain unchanged. In the same interview, he noted that tokenized securities are not a new product type, but considers them beneficial for the market and seeks to adjust the rules accordingly.\nOverall, Atkins and Peirce are aligned, so Peirce’s statement fully matches the SEC chair’s vision.\nWhat are the problems in the RWA markets?\nRaising awareness among traders, market supervision, and rule adjustments are vital as there have been recent incidents in which companies denied involvement with tokenized securities traded or announced by marketplaces.\nOne such instance is OpenAI’s recent dismissal of Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev’s public statement that tokenized OpenAI shares would soon be tradable on Robinhood. Tenev later admitted that “stock tokens” traded on Robinhood do not qualify as OpenAI equity.\nWhat’s the future of tokenized stocks?\nRobinhood’s Vlad Tenev has called for the tokenization of shares, believing it will empower retail investors to trade securities and benefit institutional traders as well. In a Bloomberg interview, he mentioned that the SEC is working with businesses, including Robinhood, to adjust rules for tokenized stocks.\nIn a recent memo, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan outlined the prospects for the tokenized stock market. He estimates the total value of the global stock and bond markets at $257 trillion and predicts that Layer 1 blockchains and marketplaces will compete for pieces of this emerging market. Hougan cites BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who said: “Every stock, every bond, every fund, every asset, can be tokenized.”\nCompared to the $257 trillion tokenized stock market, the estimated $2 trillion stablecoin market expected by 2030 is barely visible. Hougan believes tokenization can develop quickly, and says modern-day stock token investors are “very early.”\n“I still think it will take more than a decade before the majority of stock and bond trading happens on-chain. But with major financial firms like Robinhood and Tradeweb positioning themselves for the transition today, I’ve started to wonder: Could tokenization achieve 1-5% penetration in a few years? Could a dozen major pilot projects lift us to that level of market penetration? It seems possible, and it would translate into trillions of dollars … more than any other crypto application or asset, including Bitcoin.”", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 18:59:47 +0000", "author": "Alexey Borovets", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

{"title": "Trump crypto holdings edge higher as WLFI pushes for open trading", "url": "https://crypto.news/trump-crypto-holdings-edge-higher-as-wlfi-pushes-for-open-trading/", "text": "Trump crypto holdings edge higher as WLFI pushes for open trading\nWith pre-market listings already live and a proposal on the table, WLFI’s transition into a tradable token could reshape Trump’s digital asset profile. The market is already responding, with his wallet value up nearly 2.5% in a day.\nOn July 4, World Liberty Financial, the Trump-affiliated DeFi venture, proposed a major tokenomics shift that would convert its WLFI governance token into a tradable asset. Though WLFI remains locked in a non-transferable state for now, decentralized exchanges including MEXC, BingX, and LBank have already listed it for pre-market speculation.\nThe project is awaiting community approval to finalize the token’s transition.\nTrump, listed as “chief crypto advocate” on the platform’s website, stands to benefit significantly from the move, with WLFI among the assets indirectly tied to his personal holdings. As anticipation builds, his publicly visible crypto portfolio tracked by Arkham Intelligence climbed to $1.41 million, a modest gain fueled largely by renewed interest in WLFI.\nThe billion-dollar disconnect between Trump’s public wallet and private crypto empire\nWhile Donald Trump’s Arkham Intelligence-tagged wallet shows a balance of just over $1.41 million, the former president’s true exposure to crypto stretches far beyond what’s on-chain. The discrepancy highlights a calculated strategy: Trump’s public wallet contains mostly supporter-donated assets, including TROG and TRUMP coin, while his real crypto wealth flows through opaque corporate structures.\nAccording to Forbes, Trump has already banked $246 million in post-tax profits from his ventures in the space and could eventually receive up to $1 billion, an amount that surpasses the estimated combined value of both Mar-a-Lago and Trump Tower.\nPublic disclosures and media investigations, including reports from Bloomberg, CBS, and State Democracy Defenders Action, estimate that Trump and his family collectively hold 22.5 billion WLFI tokens, representing a controlling stake in the protocol.\nAdditionally, a family-affiliated entity is entitled to 75% of all net revenue from token purchases after a $30 million threshold is crossed. If WLFI’s proposal to allow open trading is approved by Q3 2025 as anticipated, Trump’s slice of the market could balloon even further.\nA high-stakes experiment in crypto-political fusion\nTrump’s crypto trajectory mirrors his business playbook: leverage personal brand equity, court speculative capital, and operate in regulatory gray zones. But the WLFI proposal marks a new phase—transforming a governance token into a liquid asset could test whether crypto markets view Trump-affiliated projects as legitimate ventures or political sentiment vehicles.\nMeanwhile, the intertwining of policy and profit has raised alarms in Washington. Democratic lawmakers have introduced multiple bills aimed at barring presidents and their families from owning or promoting crypto assets.\nIn a recent amendment to Trump’s budget bill, Senator Jeff Merkley proposed curbing presidential conflicts of interest in digital asset markets. Other critics, including ethics watchdog Public Citizen, have warned that the Trump family’s role in crypto represents a historic precedent where the lines between governance and business blur beyond recognition.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 18:55:54 +0000", "author": "Brian Danga", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}
{"title": "First-ever pro-crypto U.S. administration: bummer or slowburner?", "url": "https://crypto.news/first-ever-pro-crypto-u-s-administration-bummer-or-slowburner/", "text": "First-ever pro-crypto U.S. administration: bummer or slowburner?\nJuly 14, 2025, marks the beginning of Crypto Week in D.C. The event signals that the administration continues its work on regulating (and sometimes deregulating) the crypto space. The results of the first half of 2025 indicate little to no easy wins for the industry, but some advances in place can’t be ignored.\nRare wins\nOne of the promises Trump made during his campaign was a full pardon to Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road marketplace. Charged with engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, money laundering, and drug trafficking, he was sentenced to life in prison in 2013 following his arrest in Manhattan.\nUlbricht was among the first to create a high-scale business accepting Bitcoin, playing a major role in Bitcoin’s grassroots adoption.\nWhile Ulbricht admitted his brainchild turned out to be harmful—as it facilitated fatal overdoses for many—he remained a symbolic hero for many early bitcoiners who believed 12 years served in prison was enough to pay for his crimes.\nIndeed, at the end of his first day in office, Trump signed a full, unconventional pardon for Ross, a move lauded by the crypto community.\nRoss wasn’t the only one who could breathe a sigh of relief thanks to the new administration. BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed, charged with financial crimes, were pardoned too. Now, the developers of Bitcoin mixers accused of money laundering hope for a more favorable outcome, as they didn’t launder money and only created the tool used by criminals and law-abiding citizens. The pardon of early Bitcoin evangelist Roger Ver, charged with tax fraud, was reportedly discussed by Elon Musk while serving in the Department of Government Efficiency. Still, it doesn’t appear that Ver’s fate is significant for the POTUS.\nOnce anti-crypto Gary Gensler resigned from his position as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission following Trump’s inauguration, the SEC became one of the most crypto-friendly agencies in the U.S. The agency used a combination of executive actions and guidance to create a smoother path for U.S. cryptocurrency businesses to develop in a loose and predictable legal environment. More than that, the SEC welcomed crypto business leaders and experts to help shape new industry rules.\nA Crypto Task Force created in January 2025 is working to provide U.S. crypto entrepreneurs and innovators with a much-needed framework. Names like Hester Peirce, Mark Uyeda, and Paul S. Atkins are associated with the positive shift in the legal status of cryptocurrency. The old-fashioned application of securities laws to cryptocurrencies caused significant trouble for the industry, an approach left behind in 2025. The memecoins’ status changed to “collectibles,” paving the way for less restrictive business in that sector.\nThe SEC in 2025 dropped several enforcement actions started during the Gensler era. It discontinued legal battles with Coinbase, Ripple, and other key industry players.\nChallenges and disappointments\nAnother of Trump’s campaign promises was the creation of a Bitcoin stockpile, which echoed Sen. Cynthia Lummis’ plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.\nMany failed to realize how different these two plans were. Trump’s vision, which materialized on March 6, 2025, via executive order, meant the creation of a Bitcoin stockpile composed of seized bitcoins held by the U.S. government (around 200,000 BTC). The reserve may be topped up through budget-neutral methods.\nLummis’ plan (and respective bill) proposed the U.S. purchase one million bitcoins over five years. The crypto community lauded this plan, but it did not come to fruition. Instead, Trump’s version was seen as a disappointment by some, as it simply rebranded seized bitcoins as a “reserve.”\nOn top of that, Trump’s order stipulated that an audit of U.S. Bitcoin holdings would be carried out. The audit was due in April, but there have been no updates on the results.\nTrump opposed work on central bank digital currencies, citing privacy concerns and expressing preference for stablecoins issued by private companies rather than government institutions. However, he did emphasize the need for clearer regulation of stablecoins. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, is intended to shape this framework. Some believed it would be adopted in the spring, but the legislation took longer to finalize.\nAlthough the GENIUS Act was conceived as a bipartisan effort, during House discussions, Democrats suddenly pushed to include clauses restricting sitting U.S. presidents and other top officials and their families from participating in the cryptocurrency business. While they did not succeed, the bill’s adoption was delayed.\nThe president’s family’s involvement in the crypto industry is a concern shared by both Trump’s critics and some supporters. Trump, his wife Melania, and his sons Eric and Donald are reportedly behind ventures such as World Liberty Finance, memecoins Official Trump and Melania, the mining company American Bitcoin, and other ventures, using their influence as a privilege in the sector. Bloomberg estimates that Trump’s crypto gains reach $620 million at a minimum. Democrats continue their efforts to dismantle Trump’s crypto empire.\nHow have the Trump Administration’s efforts in crypto regulations already influenced the industry?\nAccording to Carter Razink, co-founder of the company building stablecoin-backed rewards Spree Finance, the current influence can be described as having both hard and soft impacts. The hard impact is pro-crypto legislation such as the GENIUS Act, which gives stablecoins a definitive, trillion-dollar regulatory runway. The soft impact is that founders no longer fear “Operation Chokepoint 2.0”-style debanking—building the future of finance on U.S. soil now feels safe and even encouraged.\nRaznik says:\n“Together, these forces recalibrate the risk profile for digital-asset startups and tilt the scales back toward American innovation. As history shows, when the U.S. hosts the tech giants, it gains disproportionate geopolitical clout. Pairing that technology scale with financial leverage positions America to dominate the next wave of financial technology.\nWe’re already seeing this unfold at Spree Finance, where on-chain stablecoins power rewards programs that work and feel like airline miles or credit card points. The more usable and well-regulated these stablecoins become, the more they’ll bridge traditional finance and the next generation of digital money.”", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 18:45:15 +0000", "author": "Alexey Borovets", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

Trump announced a 35% tariff on Canadian goods, which currently face a 25% rate. Still, some goods will be exempt, including oil, gas, and potash.\nThese key industrial goods are currently regulated under the USMCA agreement and are subject to a 10% tariff. Canada is one of the largest U.S. trading partners and a key exporter of energy and raw materials to the country.\nIn other tariff news, reports surfaced that Vietnam’s government was surprised by Trump’s 20% tariff announcement against the country. According to Bloomberg, the country is hoping to bring the rate lower, possibly in the 10-15% range.\nVietnam is a major exporter to the U.S., with the third-largest trade surplus with the country. Over the years, it has taken over several export industries to the U.S. from China, with electronics, textiles, and footwear as major categories. Previous administrations saw this move as an advantage, as Vietnam is more geopolitically aligned with the U.S. than China.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 18:17:40 +0000", "author": "David Marsanic", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

Price now approaches high time frame resistance, where a correction or breakout will determine the next trend leg.\nDogecoin (DOGE) has shifted its market structure decisively to the upside after breaking above its high time frame support at $0.15, a level that previously marked the base of its range. Following a bullish engulfing candle and strong volume expansion, price reclaimed the point of control (POC) and triggered a breakout, pushing into higher territory. As DOGE approaches a major resistance cluster, the next few sessions will be pivotal in determining whether the trend accelerates or cools off for a healthy pullback.\nKey Technical Points\n- Bullish Market Structure Break: Confirmed by engulfing candle and new high.\n- $0.15 Support Reclaimed: Value area low acted as the key reversal zone.\n- Current Resistance at $0.22–$0.24: In confluence with value area high and 0.618 Fibonacci.\n- Next Upside Target at $0.32: Fibonacci extension and prior structural resistance.\nDogecoin’s recent breakout is technically significant. After weeks of consolidation and failed rallies, price action decisively broke above the $0.15 high time frame support, reclaiming both the POC and establishing a new higher high, effectively flipping market structure bullish. The move was accompanied by strong volume, adding credibility to the rally and suggesting genuine buyer interest rather than a simple short squeeze or anomaly.\nCurrently, DOGE is approaching a well-defined resistance zone between $0.22 and $0.24, where the value area high and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level from the prior downtrend converge. This makes the area a strong confluence zone where a short-term rejection is technically healthy, especially if followed by the formation of a higher low, a key component of a sustainable bullish trend.\nShould price reject here, traders should watch for support tests around prior breakout levels and ensure volume remains steady. This would preserve structure while allowing price action to reset. However, if price breaks above the $0.24 resistance with strong volume continuation, the next expansion target lies at $0.32, which aligns with a key Fibonacci level and a historical price ceiling.\nOverall, the trend has now shifted bullish. Whether it consolidates or continues upward in the short term, the breakout from $0.15 and structure confirmation sets the stage for further upside.\nWhat to expect in the coming price action\nDogecoin is now in a bullish phase. A correction from $0.22–$0.24 is likely but healthy. If this resistance breaks with volume, a sharp move toward $0.32 becomes the high-probability scenario.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 18:41:19 +0000", "author": "Aziz Zamani", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

With institutional investors accumulating the largest crypto and rising capital inflows, further gains in the top three cryptos are likely.\nTraders and investors sitting on the sidelines could find it useful to open long positions in the top three cryptos. Derivatives market data shows that options traders are bullish and expect further gains in risk assets as the cloud of tariff uncertainty is cleared.\nTable of Contents\nBitcoin hits new all-time high, $130K in sight\nBitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high on Wednesday, July 9, in what appeared to be a retest of the peak at $111,980. The largest cryptocurrency has entered price discovery since then, inching closer to the $120,000 level.\nThe next target is the 127.20% Fibonacci retracement level of the rally from the April low of $74,508 to the July all-time high of $118,869. Bitcoin is currently trading 11% away from the target of $130,935.\nA key momentum indicator, the MACD, flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line, indicating underlying positive momentum in Bitcoin’s price trend. The RSI shows BTC is currently overvalued; traders should watch the indicator closely for a trend reversal. If RSI slips back under 70, it could generate a sell signal.\nEthereum and XRP price rally\nEthereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are rallying alongside Bitcoin. The top two altcoins kicked off a bull run in response to Bitcoin’s break above the May 22 peak of $111,980. Ethereum rallied past the psychologically important resistance at $3,000 on Friday.\nXRP climbed to a peak of $2.70 on July 11, the highest level for the altcoin in nearly four months.\nEthereum and XRP enjoy a relatively high correlation with BTC, catalyzing gains in Ether and XRP alongside Bitcoin.\nEthereum’s next target is the $3,500 level, above the resistance at $3,478, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the drop from the December 2024 peak of $4,122 to the April low of $1,391.\nEther is currently 17% under its $3,500 target and consistent demand from institutional traders could drive the altcoin higher.\nXRP is trading above key resistance at $2.70, at $2.77 at the time of writing.

Bitcoin traders are consistently taking more profits on their holdings as BTC rallies higher. Ether recorded a large spike in profit-taking, and XRP traders are taking profits at a slower pace compared to June 2025, as seen on Santiment.\nBitcoin has recorded a decrease in the number of holders, while Ethereum and XRP have noted an increase in 2025, as seen on Santiment. The decrease in Bitcoin’s holders corresponds to the increase in price, meaning traders are likely redistributing their holdings, while large wallet holders and institutions are accumulating further.\nBitcoin’s retail traders holding less than 1 BTC have shed their holdings, while traders with 10 to 100 and 100 to 1,000 BTC have increased their exposure. BTC whales are scooping up more Bitcoin, while small wallet investors and retail traders distribute their holdings.\nTrump effect on Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP\nTrump administration officials had initially suggested that the U.S. would strike several deals with trade partners by Wednesday, July 9. However, instead of announcements, the President set new rates for different countries while delaying the imposition of tariffs until August 1, the next key date for crypto traders to watch.\nJapan, South Korea, and several other nations face at least 25% tariffs starting from August; Brazil faces 50% tariffs, among others. The country has warned of reciprocal tariffs, with no further measures for now.\nThe U.S. is imposing 35% tariffs on Canada, starting August 1. Southeast Asian countries face between 30% and 40% tariffs.\nStock markets responded positively to the news and the Trump effect pushed Bitcoin to a new peak.\nExpert commentary\nPetr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO at Mercuryo, told Crypto.news in an exclusive interview:\n“Bitcoin has surged past $118,000 to a new all-time high amid sustained institutional demand for the biggest cryptocurrency, which has been such a driving force in this current market cycle. While altcoins are also in the green with Ethereum spiking past the $3,000 mark, the underlying ‘orange pill’ narrative remains steadfastly in place.\nBitcoin’s growing status as a store of value is one that more and more big players and institutions are simply unable to ignore. This is evidenced by sustained inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs this week.”\nNick Jones, founder and CEO of Zumo, added:\n“With Bitcoin setting a fresh record high, the market is booming.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\nPi Network’s massive token release in July may impact prices as XYZVerse gains early traction with strong community momentum.\nTable of Contents\nJuly brings a significant milestone for Pi Network: a large-scale token release that may influence its price trajectory. What are the implications for investors? We assess the risks and highlight other crypto projects gaining traction amid market shifts.\nMarket snapshot\nThe Pi Network ecosystem faces its most significant test yet. Between July 4 and July 15, the protocol is expected to unlock more than 300 million PI tokens, equivalent to over 4% of its circulating supply. The single largest daily unlock, totaling 19.4 million tokens on July 4, marked the biggest release in Pi’s history.\nSimultaneously, token reserves on centralized exchanges hit record highs, climbing from approximately 263 million in March to over 370 million in July — a 40% increase in just a few months. Such accumulation indicates institutional-grade sell pressure, with whales increasingly offloading unlocked tokens. On‑chain and OTC markets reflect this tension, despite steady but tepid user activity following new feature rollouts.\nStill, there are glimmers of cautious optimism for Pi Network. The recent backing by 137 Ventures, a prominent U.S. venture capital firm with a track record of investing in high-growth companies like SpaceX and Airbnb, has provided a significant credibility boost, signaling institutional confidence in Pi’s long-term potential.\nOn the technical side, recent backend upgrades have enabled the mainnet migration of over 500,000 users, a notable milestone that enhances the project’s infrastructure and paves the way for broader dApp adoption. These improvements also support Pi’s growing ecosystem, which now includes tools like Pi App Studio and Directory Staking.\nHowever, in the immediate term, these advances may be overshadowed by the ongoing supply shock. The sharp rise in circulating tokens and limited short-term demand drivers, particularly in the absence of major exchange listings, continue to weigh on investor sentiment. While the foundation is being strengthened, the market’s focus remains fixed on liquidity and price resilience in the weeks ahead.\nPI price technical outlook\nPi Network is currently trading in the $0.45 to $0.50 range, reflecting a 35% decline from its May high. This pullback coincides with mounting market pressure ahead of the July token unlock, and several key technical indicators suggest that further downside is likely in the short term.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around 41, indicating weakening momentum and approaching oversold territory. At the same time, the MACD has confirmed a bearish crossover, reinforcing the view that sellers are currently in control.\nFrom a price structure perspective, support levels sit at $0.40 and $0.35, with the latter being a critical threshold. On the upside, resistance lies at $0.53 and $0.60, and would need to be reclaimed to signal any meaningful bullish recovery.\nIs Pi Network entering a bearish phase?\nGiven the heavy token unlocks and rising exchange reserves — now at record highs — continued sell pressure remains the dominant risk. If this trend persists, a retest of the $0.35–$0.38 zone appears highly probable.\n- Short-Term: Expect continued price pressure. Unless emergency liquidity or exchange listings occur, PI faces the risk of retesting $0.35–$0.40. The large unlock and increasing exchange reserves threaten to overshadow positive fundamentals.\n- Mid- to Long-Term: Holders should look for signs of ecosystem traction, Pi App Studio’s AI tool builder, identity dApps, and domain features could begin driving real usage. That said, liquidity remains limited on major CEXes, limiting recovery potential absent broader adoption or listings.\n- Market Context: In comparison to broader crypto, where assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum are seeing renewed institution-led inflows, Pi functions as a specialized micro‑cap — subject to both idiosyncratic risk and opportunity.\nHowever, for mid- to long-term holders, the outlook isn’t entirely bleak. Ecosystem developments such as Pi App Studio, identity infrastructure, and the integration of staking and dApps may support gradual recovery, provided they translate into real user activity and token demand.\nFor investors looking to diversify amid Pi’s turbulence, one rising star is XYZVerse.io, a memecoin designed to merge sports betting, gamified staking, and social virality.\nAlternative play: XYZVerse is gaining momentum\nXYZVerse (XYZ) is one of the most dynamic new memecoins in 2025, blending sports culture, web3 utility, and community engagement into a cohesive ecosystem.\nUnlike many mainstream crypto projects now largely driven by macro market cycles, XYZVerse is still in its early-stage growth phase, fueled by grassroots community support and strong presale momentum. Rather than riding existing market waves, it’s building its own.\nMassive presale momentum: Nearly $15M raised\nLaunched amid a bear market, XYZVerse quickly captured investor attention through a transparent, tiered presale structure that rewards early entry. As market sentiment shifted bullish, the project’s growth accelerated:\n- Current Presale Stage: 12 out of 15\n- Presale Price Range: From $0.0001 to $0.003333\n- Final Presale Target: $0.02, offering early backers a discount of up to 99.9%\n- Post-Listing Target: $0.10, representing a potential 30× return from current levels\nThis level of structured early access is increasingly rare in today’s memecoin space, which is saturated with hype-driven launches and unsustainable tokenomics. XYZVerse stands out by combining early-mover potential with long-term vision and token utility.\nCommunity-driven growth and real-world partnerships\nXYZVerse has quickly built a loyal and rapidly expanding community, with over 21,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter) and 12,000+ active Telegram members. This grassroots momentum has been a key driver of its early success, fueling organic marketing and presale demand. The project’s strong engagement and transparency earned it the title of “Best New Meme Project” by CryptoNews, further validating its position in the next generation of meme-based crypto assets.\nBeyond community hype, XYZVerse has also formed a strategic partnership with bookmaker.XYZ, integrating real-world sportsbook features directly into its ecosystem. This collaboration enables token holders to access exclusive betting perks, adding tangible utility and reinforcing the project’s unique bridge between crypto, entertainment, and sports culture.\nKey features and user benefits:\n- Airdrops through the Ambassador Program and ongoing community campaigns\n- Play-to-earn Telegram games and upcoming dApps with real token rewards\n- Free betting perks and special access via bookmaker.XYZ for token holders\n- Deflationary model with buybacks and token burns to support long-term value\nFinal thoughts\nThe July token unlock wave may test Pi Network’s price resilience. While its long-term fundamentals remain promising, short-term volatility could lead to further downside. Investors should monitor key levels and macro sentiment closely.\nIn parallel, exploring well-positioned early-stage tokens like XYZVerse offers a strategic way to balance risk and capture potential upside, especially in a market environment increasingly shaped by narratives and community-driven growth.\nTo learn more about XYZVerse, visit the official website, Telegram, and Twitter.\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party.

The stablecoin giant is shedding legacy chains to focus on networks that actually move volume, signaling where stablecoin liquidity is heading.\nUSDT issuer Tether announced on July 11 it will discontinue support for its stablecoin on five blockchains, including Omni, Bitcoin Cash SLP, Kusama, EOS, and Algorand, effectively freezing remaining tokens by September 1.\nThe decision, part of a broader infrastructure review, marks the formal end of support for several networks that once helped Tether (USDT) scale across the crypto ecosystem. The decision follows a strategic review of usage data, with Tether citing dwindling activity on these networks as it shifts focus toward chains with stronger adoption and scalability.\nWhile the removal of these chains may appear procedural, it reflects a deeper realignment of priorities at the world’s largest stablecoin issuer.\nA calculated retreat with wider ripple effects\nTether’s decision to sunset USDT support on Omni, Bitcoin Cash SLP, Kusama, EOS, and Algorand doesn’t just tidy up its backend. It marks the end of the line for chains that once underpinned major phases of the stablecoin’s early rise. Omni, the original home of USDT, processed over $7 million worth of transactions across testnet applications and attracted more than 400,000 users in its heyday.\nEOS, despite its controversies, once boasted monthly user figures north of 30 million, driven in part by integrations with platforms like MetaMask. Even so, sustained usage on these networks has plummeted, prompting Tether to formally pull the plug on redemptions and freeze tokens by September.\n“Sunsetting support for these legacy chains allows us to focus on platforms that offer greater scalability, developer activity, and community engagement — all key components for driving the next wave of stablecoin adoption,” Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said.\nThe fallout extends beyond infrastructure. Projects built on these chains now face hard choices: migrate liquidity, lobby for alternative stablecoins, or risk isolation. Tether has given users until September 1 to redeem or migrate holdings, but the clock is ticking for ecosystems to prove their relevance.\nMeanwhile, Tether continues to double down on Layer 2 networks like Lightning and active ecosystems such as Ethereum and Tron, which already host the vast majority of USDT supply. The company now issues USDT across a dozen networks, including Solana, Polkadot, Avalanche, and TON, but has made clear that the days of maintaining low-volume chains are over.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 16:25:28 +0000", "author": "Brian Danga", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

A range of positive developments contributed to the upside action, among them an announcement by the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.\nThe exchange revealed new integrations for Binance Wallet, allowing users to access and stake coins via multiple decentralized applications. Omni Network is one of the top dApps Binance Wallet outlined support for, alongside others including Momentum, Aarna AI, Elderglade, Paintswap, Silo Finance, and Meta Pool.\nOmni Network integration means Binance Wallet users now have access to OMNI staking directly from within the wallet’s mobile app. Those who stake tokens to help secure the Omni Network have an opportunity to earn rewards at an annual percentage rate of 11%.\nOMNI price spiked amid explosion in derivatives volume\nOmni Network pumped hard in the last 24 hours.\nBut notable is the huge spot volume on exchanges – over $195 million on Binance and $238 million on MEXC. Also massive for the small cap token is the level of leveraged trades it sported, with derivatives volume exploding exponentially to over $1.46 billion.\nPer data from Coinglass, the open interest in OMNI jumped nearly +300% to $34 million.\nHowever, as an analyst Wise Advice pointed out on X, funding hovered negative to suggest increased shorting as the price rose.\nIn this case, Omni Network has seen more than $5.69 million in 24-hour liquidations. About $3.35 million of this accounts for liquidated shorts, with $2.68 million in the past 12 hours coinciding with OMNI price skyrocketing.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 15:06:45 +0000", "author": "Benson Toti", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

Now, they’re taking that expertise to Coinbase, and the implications for onchain markets could be massive.\nOn July 11, crypto exchange Coinbase announced it had poached Opyn’s core leadership team, including CEO Andrew Leone and Head of Research Joe Clark, in a talent-focused acquisition that underscores its aggressive push into onchain finance.\nThe move, framed by Coinbase as a way to accelerate its onchain markets strategy, brings aboard two of DeFi’s most influential derivatives architects, known for pioneering innovations like Power Perpetuals and Squeeth.\nWhile the deal doesn’t include Opyn’s underlying protocol, it marks a clear talent acquisition as Coinbase doubles down on bringing traditional market functionality onto public ledgers.\nCoinbase bets big on the architects of DeFi’s derivatives revolution\nUnlike previous acquisitions driven by product or protocol expansion, this was a bet on people. According to Coinbase, the decision to onboard Opyn’s top minds was made under its build-buy-partner-invest framework, with the leadership team’s hybrid grasp of DeFi primitives and traditional market mechanics standing out.\nLeone and Clark aren’t just engineers. The two are heralded as architects of market structure, having launched some of DeFi’s most novel instruments during Opyn’s experimental run. At Coinbase, they’ll be placed within the institutional Onchain Markets division, tasked with advancing efforts like Verified Pools and contributing to broader onchain exchange infrastructure.\nThe Opyn team’s move underscores a broader industry reckoning. After navigating regulatory scrutiny, including a 2023 CFTC settlement over unregistered trading, Leone and Clark bring hard-won experience in balancing DeFi’s permissionless ideals with compliance realities.\nIn its announcement, Opyn framed the transition as a natural evolution, stating, “Coinbase shares our belief that the future of finance is onchain and they are committed to making that a reality.”\nThis marks Coinbase’s sixth acquisition this year, following strategic grabs like Deribit’s team in May and onchain analytics platform Spindl in January. The pattern is clear: Coinbase is assembling a war chest of niche expertise, betting that the next phase of crypto adoption hinges on seamless integration between centralized trust and decentralized efficiency. As Clark noted, their goal is to build “the connective tissue of finance on immutable public ledgers.”\nThe implications extend beyond talent. By embedding DeFi-native thinkers like Leone and Clark into its institutional framework, Coinbase is signaling that the future of trading isn’t just onchain, it’s hybrid. For traders, that could mean deeper liquidity and novel products; for competitors, it’s a warning that the exchange isn’t ceding ground to upstarts.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 15:03:44 +0000", "author": "Brian Danga", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

On Friday, July 11, Blocksquare, an infrastructure provider for real estate tokenization, announced it had surpassed $200 million in tokenized assets on chain.\nThe milestone comes as tokenized RWAs have seen an 800% increase in total value locked in 2025. Across all applications, RWAs TVL is now higher than $65 billion. Blocksquare’s own tokenized assets in real estate are now used across 29 countries and 66 properties.\n“This $200M milestone is more than a number — it reflects a shift from experimentation to real-world adoption,” said Denis Petrovcic, Co-Founder and CEO of Blocksquare. “We’re proud to power a global ecosystem where local marketplace operators can tokenize real estate in a compliant, scalable, and investor-friendly way.”\nBlocksquare specifically specializes in tokenizing real estate property directly. This means that individuals can become fractional owners of specific properties, giving investors more flexibility compared to traditional real estate funds.\nThe company offers these assets through its legal entity in Luxembourg, which it launched in February. This entity uses an EU-compliant real estate tokenization framework, aligned with relevant MiCA rules.\nRWA’s see growing adoption in real estate\nAs the appetite for tokenized real estate grows, the firm states that it plans to expand, especially in the U.S. market. In April, the company partnered with Vera Capital, with a stated goal to tokenize $1 billion worth of U.S. real estate. Vera Group currently manages over $100 million in real estate assets through a traditional integrated model.\nTokenized real estate offers several advantages compared to traditional real estate investments.

According to CoinGlass, more than $1 billion in short positions were wiped out in the past 24 hours alone, marking the largest daily liquidation event in four years.\nOver 232,000 traders were affected.

The total market capitalization of all coins jumped to over $3.6 trillion.\nWhy crypto is up today\nCrypto prices rallied ahead of the upcoming crypto week, during which politicians in Washington will consider three major bills. One of them is GENIUS, which will regulate stablecoins and has already passed in the Senate.\nLawmakers will also consider the CLARITY Act, which separates the roles between the SEC and the CFTC. Additionally, regulators will review a bill to ban Central Bank Digital Currencies in the U.S.\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are also moving higher due to hopes that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September and continue through 2026. Some Fed officials, like Christopher Waller and Michele Bowman, have called for a rate cut as soon as this month.\nFed interest rate cuts are expected to accelerate in 2026 when Donald Trump’s nominee to replace Jerome Powell is sworn in.\nTrump, who has called for a 300 basis point cut, has hinted that he will only nominate an official who will cut rates. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies historically perform well in a low-interest-rate environment.\nFurther, crypto is rising due to increasing Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows, which signal strong demand from American investors.\nBitcoin ETFs have added over $51 billion in inflows since inception, while Ethereum funds crossed the $5 billion milestone. In a note to crypto.news, Premyslaw Kral, the CEO of Zondacrypto, said:\n“We’re observing increased interest from institutional players, largely in the form of ETFs, which have significantly changed the reality of the crypto industry, alongside simple capital inflows, as observed now on the BTC market.”\nThere are also hopes that the Chinese government will legalize cryptocurrencies. A top regulator told a conference that the government was studying digital coins. Unbanning cryptocurrencies would likely lead to increased demand from Chinese individuals and retail investors.\nBest altcoins to buy in this crypto bull run\nAnalysts, including Arthur Hayes believe that the altoin season is around the corner. Such a move would benefit many altcoins, especially meme coins. Some of the best meme coins to consider are the popular names like Pepe (PEPE), Dogwifhat (WIF), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN).\nTop utility cryptocurrencies, especially those with high ETF approval hopes like Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL), will be the other top beneficiaries of this bull run.

But this time, they handpicked SharpLink as the buyer. Behind the $25.7 million transaction lies a deeper narrative about staking, institutional alignment, and Ethereum’s next phase.\nOn July 11, Minneapolis-based iGaming giant SharpLink Gaming announced it had closed a direct on-chain purchase of 10,000 Ether (ETH) tokens from the Ethereum Foundation, marking one of the largest peer-to-peer mainnet transfers between a protocol steward and a public company to date.\nThe $25.7 million acquisition, executed at $2,572.37 per ETH, was finalized on July 10 without any intermediaries or custodial bridges. It’s a move that not only expands SharpLink’s crypto-heavy treasury strategy but also signals a rare, deliberate handoff of assets from the core of Ethereum’s development body to a listed entity aligned with the network’s long-term goals.\nThe purchase, following another $19.2 million ETH acquisition last week, solidifies SharpLink’s position as the second-largest corporate holder of Ethereum, trailing only the foundation itself.\nA strategic alliance with Ethereum’s future at stake\nThe Ethereum Foundation’s decision to sell directly to SharpLink, rather than through open markets, speaks volumes. Historically, large ETH transfers from the Foundation have sparked sell-off fears, but this transaction was structured to avoid market disruption.\nIt also aligns with the Foundation’s revised treasury strategy, which now focuses on strategic liquidity management rather than outright divestment. For SharpLink, locking in a sub-market price for 10,000 ETH provides more than just a discount. The move establishes a direct relationship with Ethereum’s core developers, potentially giving the company early insights into protocol upgrades and DeFi integrations.\nAccording to Joseph Lubin, who chairs SharpLink and also co-founded Ethereum, the transaction reflects more than balance sheet maneuvering.\n“This isn’t a trade – it is a commitment to our long-term vision. SharpLink is acquiring, staking and restaking ETH as responsible industry stewards, removing supply from circulation and reinforcing the health of the Ethereum ecosystem.” Lubin stated.\nSharpLink also views this deal as “the start of something bigger.” In Lubin’s words, the company hopes to model how public entities can “advance our ecosystem’s shared goals of decentralization, economic empowerment, and protocol-native finance.”\nInternally, the firm has engineered its ETH holdings into a transparent metric: the ETH Concentration score, which tracks tokens per 1,000 diluted shares. That level of visibility is rare in crypto-heavy firms and speaks to SharpLink’s intent to set benchmarks, not chase trends.\nAt the same time, SharpLink said it’s undertaking a full-scale overhaul of its legacy iGaming business, tapping Ethereum’s smart contract infrastructure to build a more dynamic, trustless betting ecosystem.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 14:09:36 +0000", "author": "Brian Danga", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

Each token is backed 1:1 by the underlying stock, verified through Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve mechanism.\nTokenized stocks are digital assets that attempts to offer similar returns of real-world equities but on the blockchain. This unique product offers global accessibility and lower entry barriers while offering indirect equity exposure.\nIn the conversation below, Bitrue’s O’Neill addresses how price discovery functions during non-market hours, the risks and advantages for retail traders, expansion plans, and how their approach compares to previous tokenized stock offerings.\ncrypto.news: Trading tokenized stocks 24/7 is a major selling point, but when U.S. stock markets are closed, there’s no official price feed. How exactly does price discovery work during these after-hours periods, and isn’t there increased risk for market makers providing liquidity during those times that result in a high premium paid by the user?\nAdam O’Neill: For tokenized stocks, price discovery during these after-hours or weekend periods relies heavily on the supply and demand dynamics within the specific crypto exchange or blockchain platform where these tokens are traded. There is an increased risk for market makers providing liquidity for tokenized stocks outside of traditional market hours, and this risk often translates into wider spreads for users, but we feel that it’s important for users that are spread around the world in different timezones to have increased options.\nCN: As a follow up from the prior question, for retail traders transacting during after-hours or weekends, what should they expect in terms of liquidity and spreads? Is slippage a bigger concern when fewer market participants and pricing references are available?\nAO: Trading volumes are indeed lower during off-hours which does make for a tougher trading environment for users. Users are advised to take extra caution when trading during this time and make full use of the data available, including trading depths, which are fully transparent on the exchange. The problem mostly affects large traders who are generally aware of the risks to watch out for – the problem is lessened when trading in small amounts, which covers 95%+ of traders.\nCN: What advantages do tokenized stocks on Bitrue offer to everyday retail investors compared to buying stocks through traditional brokers? On the flip side, what are the risks or limitations that investors should be mindful of when trading these tokenized stocks?\nAO: The advantages are 24/7 trading access, fractional ownership, faster settlement, global accessibility, lower transaction costs, and increased transparency. Conversely the drawbacks include price dislocation risks, cybersecurity risks, and potential tax implications depending on where the user is located.\nCN: The initial batch of tokenized stocks includes six major companies: NVIDIA, Apple, Tesla, MicroStrategy, Circle, and an S&P 500 ETF. Why did Bitrue choose these particular stocks to start with? Are there any minimum market cap considerations or other metrics that have to be met to be included?\nAO: NVIDIA, Apple, and Tesla are among the most popular and actively traded stocks globally, so listing these allows us to meet a proven demand while reducing the potential friction of understanding the tokenization aspect. These stocks generally have very high trading volumes in traditional markets, which provides a strong underlying price reference.\nIncluding an S&P 500 ETF provides retail investors with immediate diversification across a broad market index. We do not have minimum cap considerations, however we are currently focused on offering well-known blue-chip brands.\nCN: Do you plan to expand the range of tokenized stocks available on Bitrue? What can users expect next, i.e more stocks, ETFs, or even other asset classes (gold?) as tokens?\nAO: Further expansion of our offerings will be based on user feedback – we are constantly monitoring what our users are asking for on social media as well as analyzing the trading data that we have available to us. In the few days that these tokenized stocks have been made available for trading the feedback has been quite positive, so within the next few weeks we’ll be consistently adding more well-known names as tokenized stocks to the exchange. The exact stocks are still TBD, but Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon are among those shortlisted.\nCN: How can users be confident that each tokenized stock is truly backed 1:1 by the real stock? Is there a custody or proof-of-reserves mechanism in place to ensure the tokens are fully collateralized?\nAO: xStocks adopts the Chainlink interoperability and data standards, including the Chainlink Proof of Reserve, providing a robust and transparent mechanism to verify that the tokenized stocks are indeed backed 1:1. Chainlink has been operating for over a decade and is the gold standard for blockchain based verification systems.\nCN: Once someone buys these xStock tokens on Bitrue, are they able to withdraw them off the exchange? Can users hold tokenized stocks in their own wallets or use them in DeFi ecosystems? Will it ever be possible to exchange a token for an equity share?\nAO: These tokenized stocks are from a technical standpoint identical to other cryptocurrencies, and so they can be withdrawn and used in DeFi products that support them. They do not grant ownership or similar rights however, and cannot be converted into the underlying stock.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 13:25:00 +0000", "author": "Jayson Derrick", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

However, the breakout remains in progress, and confirmation hinges on DOT holding above $3.75, a zone of high technical confluence.\nAfter several weeks of compression under a historical resistance, Polkadot (DOT) has finally breached the key ceiling with strong momentum. The breakout is developing on the weekly timeframe, adding to its potential significance. At the core of this move is the $3.75 level, a crucial zone that previously acted as resistance and is now being retested as support. If price action holds above this level, DOT could be setting up for a powerful trend reversal.\nKey technical points\n- Support Reclaimed: The $3.75 level holds strong confluence, previously a ceiling, now key support.\n- Weekly Engulfing Candle: A decisive bullish pattern breaking past multi-week resistance.\n- Next Major Resistance: $7 high-timeframe resistance is the next major upside target.\nFrom a technical perspective, the breakout is promising but remains incomplete until the weekly candle closes and subsequent candles confirm strength above $3.75. The current structure shows signs of a bullish engulfing pattern, which often leads to continued buying, especially when coupled with a reclaimed support level. However, one concern is volume, which remains below average. For a breakout of this magnitude to be sustained, stronger volume would typically provide firmer confirmation.\nHistorically, similar breakout patterns on DOT have led to extended rallies, particularly when backed by solid closes above key resistance levels. Should this breakout follow suit, the next logical target is the $7 resistance zone, which previously acted as a ceiling during earlier market cycles.\nThe $3.75 zone now becomes the battleground between bulls and bears. If DOT can close multiple weekly candles above this level, the recent lows may be confirmed as a deviation, marking a shift toward a new bullish structural phase. This would likely attract additional buying interest and accelerate momentum toward the $7 target.\nHowever, failure to maintain support above $3.75 could invalidate the breakout, trapping long positions and sending DOT back into its prior range.\nWhat to expect in the coming price action:\nIf DOT can close above $3.75 with strong volume, a sustained rally toward the $7 resistance becomes increasingly probable. Bulls must defend this reclaimed level to preserve the breakout structure. Failure to do so could result in a retracement and nullify the current bullish setup.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 13:00:58 +0000", "author": "Aziz Zamani", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

Still, there are several reasons why the coin is on the verge of a bullish breakout.\nFirst, data shows that the monthly token unlock will slow down over the next few months, reducing the number of coins brought to the market. Pi will unlock over 175 million coins this month, 137 million in August, 116 million in September, and 93 million in October.\nThe token unlock pace will then rebound in November and December before falling for the next eight consecutive months.\nSecond, Pi Coin price will likely benefit from the ongoing crypto bull run. Bitcoin (BTC) has already jumped to a record high as we had predicted here and here. This rally could continue as it targets the cup-and-handle target of nearly $150,000. A Bitcoin surge will likely lead to more gains among most altcoins.\nThird, Pi Network’s developers recently unveiled the Pi AI Studio that is helping developers build artificial intelligence-powered applications.\nData shows that developers have already pitched thousands of applications. While not all will succeed, a few successful ones could help power its ecosystem.\nApps developed on the network will be supported by existing Pi Network products like Pi Ad Network, .pi Domains, and Pi Wallet. Those with substantial potential may also receive funding from the $100 million Pi Network Ventures.\nMost importantly, there is still a slim chance that Pi Network will be listed by major exchanges like Upbit, Binance, and Coinbase. Such a listing would likely trigger a major short squeeze.\nPi Network price analysis\nThe daily chart shows that Pi Coin price has formed contrarian patterns that could stimulate a rebound. It has formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.40 and a neckline at $1.6625.\nPi Network has also formed a falling wedge chart pattern, a popular bullish reversal signal. In addition, its Bollinger Bands and Average True Range point to low volatility, which often leads to a short squeeze. If this happens, the next point to watch will be at $1, followed by the neckline at $1.6625.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 13:08:03 +0000", "author": "Crispus Nyaga", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

Made in several transfers of ETH and FRAX around 8:00 AM UTC, the total sent so far represents nearly 90% of the $42 million drained just two days ago in the original exploit.\nThe refund follows GMX’s public offer of a 10% bounty for the safe return of funds, with a 48-hour deadline and a promise not to pursue legal action.\n“Ok, funds will be returned later,” the hacker wrote in response via an on-chain message before following through with the fund transfers.\nThe native token GMX (GMX) jumped 16% on the development, modestly recovering from the 28% drop it suffered in the immediate aftermath of the exploit. While GMX is yet to publicly acknowledge receipt, the protocol thanked the hacker on-chain.\n“Thank you, we greatly appreciate this,” the team wrote.\nIt remains unclear whether the attacker intends to return the remaining funds from the exploit, estimated to be around $4.5 million.\nThe GMX hack ranks among the largest industry exploits so far this year. Other high-profile victims include Bybit, which suffered a $1.4 billion hack executed by the infamous North Korean hacker group Lazarus, and Cetus Protocol, which was drained for $223 million.\nLike GMX, Bybit also offered a 10% bounty to recover the funds.

The Chinese government has never officially disclosed its Bitcoin holdings or any sale strategies.FTX payouts in China add fuel to speculation\nBeyond the rising calls for stablecoin adoption, speculation about China’s potential pivot toward crypto has intensified amid controversy over local payouts from the FTX bankruptcy estate.\nIn early July, the FTX estate requested that a US bankruptcy judge authorize a freeze on distributions to creditors in “potentially restricted foreign jurisdictions,” including China, which accounts for 82% of the value of the affected claims.\nThe move has triggered outrage in the community in many countries, with some Chinese creditors highlighting that China has never banned holding crypto.\nOn Tuesday, a Chinese creditor filed an objection to an FTX estate motion, representing a group of at least 300 creditors seeking to recover funds from the collapsed crypto exchange.\nAccording to court filings, a ruling on the motion is expected on July 22.\nMagazine: China’s 100K TPS blockchain, Japan’s Minna Bank eyes Solana: Asia Express", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 12:18:15 +0100", "author": "Cointelegraph by Helen Partz", "source": "https://cointelegraph.com/rss"}

In the latest reported case, 15 victims from Tasmania lost an estimated $2.5 million, local media reported on Friday, June 11.\nAccording to Tasmania Police, many of the victims suffered “lifelong impact” from the losses. The average victim was 65 years old and lost approximately $165,000. In one case, a victim lost $750,000 through the scam.\n“In some cases, it delayed retirements, Tasmania Police Detective Sergeant Turner said. “It meant that victims were forced to sell assets and then become reliant on social services and payments.”\nThese scams typically involve fraudsters convincing victims to deposit cash through a crypto ATM under false pretenses. Authorities say scammers employ threats, intimidation, and promises of high financial returns, often creating a false sense of urgency to manipulate their targets.\n“Common scams these victims were falling to were romance scams and investment scams. Also, government and authority scams, and tech support scams, where you receive a phone call from an agency purporting to be who they’re not,” Tasmania Police Detective Sergeant Turner said.\nCrypto ATMs become a tool for scammers\nCrypto ATMs are an increasingly favored method for fraudulent transfers. Once a victim sends crypto to a scammer’s wallet address, the transaction is irreversible, unlike standard bank transfers, which may offer recovery mechanisms.\nAustralian authorities have already noticed this problem and have reacted with tighter regulations. Earlier, on June 3, Australia imposed cash limits for crypto ATMs to curb this type of scam.\nSome countries went even further, and on June 9, New Zealand announced a ban on crypto ATMs. In New Zealand’s case, the stated goal was to restrict the ability of criminals to convert ill-gotten cash into crypto.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 12:57:08 +0000", "author": "David Marsanic", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

Under MiCA, companies offering crypto services must obtain a CASP license from a national regulator to operate across the EU.\n“Some CASPs may even use their regulated status under MiCA as a marketing argument and encourage confusion between regulated and unregulated products and services,” the regulator stated.\nPut simply, ESMA is saying that some crypto companies might brag about being MiCA-regulated to attract customers, but at the same time, they offer other products that aren’t regulated. This can confuse people into thinking all their products are safe and protected when that’s not true.\nESMA’s warning follows the publication of a recent peer review in which it critisized Malta’s Financial Services Authority for its lax approach in granting crypto licenses. The review found that while Malta has the expertise and resources to supervise crypto firms, its authorization process only “partially” met expected standards, raising concerns about regulatory consistency across the EU.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 12:56:17 +0000", "author": "Darya", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

With whispers of a potential 1,000-fold increase at launch, this newcomer is capturing attention across the market.\nXYZ sees surging demand, nearing $15m market cap\nWith significant investor interest, XYZVerse (XYZ) seamlessly blends the realms of sports and cryptocurrency. It distinguishes itself from typical memecoins by establishing itself as a long-term endeavor, complete with a well-defined roadmap and an active community. Its recent recognition as the Best New Meme Project further enhances its appeal.\nThe XYZ token has demonstrated consistent growth throughout its presale, climbing from an initial price of $0.0001 to its current $0.003333. The next stage aims for a price of $0.005, with the final presale price set at $0.02.

Every play is designed to strengthen its price and rally a community of believers, pushing it further toward something legendary.\nEthereum’s next big move\nLooking at market trends, Ethereum’s future seems promising. Currently at $2,976.81, ETH predictions suggest its price could soar as high as $6,580.53 next year. By 2025, even the estimated low is $2,700.31, showing solid potential.

Ethereum’s advancements and commitment to efficiency make it an attractive option in today’s market. Its focus on making things faster and cheaper could keep it at the forefront of the crypto scene.\nSolana speeds ahead in the crypto race\nThe potential of Solana lies in its high-capacity network that doesn’t rely on sharding or second-layer solutions. This makes it appealing for developers looking to build high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, SOL, at $163.87, looks attractive due to its technological advantages and growing adoption.\nWhile Ethereum struggles with high fees and slower speeds, Solana offers a faster and more cost-effective alternative.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\nA memecoin priced under $0.0015 is turning heads with claims of hitting $0.30 in just four months, Little Pepe may be the next breakout Layer-2 blockchain.\nTable of Contents\nIn crypto, timing is everything. If they buy too late, people end up paying peak prices. The ideal will always be buying early when momentum begins to pick up and before the mainstream investors catch on. Imagine doing just that with a token under $0.0015 that’s positioned to outshine Cardano and Dogecoin, and even shoot past $0.30 in just four months. That token? Little Pepe (LILPEPE).\nFrom memecoin to meme chain\nThere’s more to LILPEPE than frog-themed flair. This is not another pass-the-meme rinse-and-repeat token. Instead, it’s being built as a Layer‑2 blockchain for memes, combining what everyone loves about meme coins, viral energy, community-driven hype, playful branding, with real infrastructure aimed at serious adoption.\nLILPEPE’s presale has moved fast: stages one through three sold out in record time, and stage four is live at $0.0013 a token. As of July 7, 2025, the project has raised over $4 million. That’s warmed-over meme energy, and the money backing it suggests people are paying attention.\nWhy LILPEPE is built to run\nOne of the big complaints about memecoins is that they’re a flash in the pan. LILPEPE aims to flip that script. It’s a Layer‑2 EVM-compatible chain, which means it’s built atop Ethereum but designed to be far cheaper and faster. Transactions are nearly zero-cost, confirmations come in sub-second timeframes, and defensive features block sniper bots that prey on early buyers.\nOn top of that, there’s no transaction tax. That might sound minor, but it matters. It lowers barriers, keeps community momentum high, and avoids the typical “2 % exit fee” that eats into smaller wallets, especially relevant in a meme-centered system where members are often first-timers.\nHow LILPEPE can beat ADA and DOGE in 120 days\nCardano and Dogecoin have their merits, but their ceiling may already be too well known. Dogecoin (DOGE) is squarely meme-market driven, and ADA trades on academic promise and slow-moving ecosystem updates. LILPEPE, however, is at a different stage of the narrative:\n- Affordable entry: At $0.0013, there is a low entry barrier, allowing retail investors to gain access to the token without breaking a sweat.\n- Underlying speed and utility: If the chain delivers, each transaction helps validate demand in a way ADA and DOGE cannot match.\n- A viral next-gen proposition: Building memes on a meme chain isn’t just cute, it’s a smart product-market fit.\nAnalysts are projecting a potential run to $0.30 within four months post-launch. Let’s be clear: that implies a 23,000 %+ upside. It’s ambitious, yes, but not unheard of in meme tokens with infrastructure built in. If Dogecoin hit $0.164 recently, why couldn’t a Layer‑2 meme chain with better mechanics prove it has more room?\nRoadmap: From “pregnancy” to “growth”\nLILPEPE isn’t flying blind. Its roadmap is cleverly disguised in fun meme-themed phases, “Pregnancy,” “Birth,” and “Growth,” but the tech allows clarity behind the name. Phase one involved building infrastructure and conducting a presale.\nPhase two includes mainnet launch, exchange listings, and staking launches. Subsequent phases cover governance features, launchpad rollouts for upcoming meme tokens, and mobile wallet integration. That narrative of progression, matched with visible milestones, gives investors measurable signposts to look for. And with presale stages rising in price, there’s a built-in incentive to enter before the price climbs.\nAssessing the risks\nNothing in crypto is guaranteed. LILPEPE is still a presale. Execution risk exists at every layer, from audits to token listings to community retention. And heavy reliance on meme virality can backfire if the market mood turns sour. That’s why investors are treating it like a lottery ticket: a smart pocket of capital, but not the whole portfolio.\nYet the backing from crypto veterans, combined with the technical architecture, helps differentiate it from token clones that disappear after launch. If milestones are hit, mainnet goes live, staking is introduced, CEX listings follow, it shifts in perception from “just another memecoin” to “fully operational meme blockchain.” That fundamentally changes the risk formula.\nFinal word\nIf investors missed DOGE, SHIB, or PEPE’s early moves, this feels like the last chance to ride true meme magic, not as a token, but on its own Layer‑2 system. LILPEPE at $0.0013 is a low-cost position with a wildly optimistic upside scenario baked in.\nFour months isn’t long in crypto, but if this takes off, it could mean serious stack growth, and perhaps even a rerouting of meme token paths toward utility. It won’t be easy. But the potential to outpace Cardano and Dogecoin cannot be ignored.\nAs summer unfolds, keep an eye on presale continuation, delivery of roadmap milestones, and whether the chain attracts meaningful developer and community engagement. If those align, $0.30 might not just be hype, it might be the punchline nobody sees coming.\nTo learn more about Little Pepe, visit the website, Whitepaper, Telegram, and Twitter (X).\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party.

With this surge, ENA price has now broken above the upper trendline resistance of a descending triangle pattern that had been forming since mid-May. The descending triangle, typically a bearish continuation pattern, has instead resolved to the upside — a bullish signal made more convincing by explosive volume that accompanied the breakout.\nThe breakout followed a rebound from what appears to be the bottom of a months-long consolidation range between $0.24 and $0.46. If ENA can successfully reclaim and hold the ~$0.30 zone on a retest of the breakout level, it could lay the foundation for further upside towards the top of that range.\nThe current rally appears to be driven by today’s listing on South Korea’s largest exchange by trading volume, Upbit, which added Ethena trading pairs for KRW, Bitcoin (BTC), and Tether (USDT). This follows Upbit’s recent listing of Hyperlane (HYPER), which has seen a 100%+ surge in a single day after the listing, and Babylon (BABY) tokens.\nENA’s price rally is also likely buyoed by the broader crypto market surge, with Bitcoin breaking above $118,000 and setting a new all-time high.\nEthena’s ability to hold the lower horizontal support since early April is notable, especially amid regular token unlocks. The latest unlock released over 171 million ENA tokens worth over $63 million, representing 2.7% of circulating supply.

The former BitMEX CEO had recently warned that the U.S. Treasury’s efforts to rebuild its cash balance at the Fed, known as the TGA refill, could pressure risk assets by draining liquidity from the market, dampening short-term sentiment.\nHowever, the crypto market’s sharp move higher this week appears to have invalidated those fears. “I was slightly bearish in my last essay due to TGA refill. What changed? $BTC busted through ATH on good volume,” he wrote.\nWhile BTC led the breakout, Hayes expects Ethereum (ETH) to take the lead from here, aligning with the asset’s steady climb over the past few days. Historically, such momentum often precedes capital rotation into altcoins, prompting the former executive to add that the long-awaited altcoin season is near.\n“Get ready for a monster alt szn,” Hayes said.\nAnother factor driving his outlook is improving macro sentiment. He noted that markets expect President Trump to ease tariffs, which could support global trade and boost overall market performance.\nThe former BitMEX CEO previously said in May that BTC must cross the $110,000 mark for the altcoin season to truly kick off, and predicted the breakout to occur around June or early Q3. With that breakout now confirmed, he believes the next phase of the cycle is underway.\nLong-term, Hayes has always been bullish on Bitcoin’s future. He expects BTC to reach around $250,000 by the end of the year and sees a possible path to $1 million by the end of Trump’s current term in 2028.\nHayes’ altseason forecast is already playing out, with momentum building across the market. Several assets such as SEI (SEI), SUI (SUI), and HBAR (HBAR) have jumped between 10% and 20% over the past 24 hours, with more than 98% of altcoins already outperforming Bitcoin in the ongoing rally.\nWhile the Altcoin Season Index from CMC still leans toward Bitcoin dominance, sitting at 30/100, some analysts say the tide is already turning and that a much bigger season for the asset class is already underway.\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin has continued to shatter records throughout the day, trading at an all-time high of over $118,500 at the time of writing.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 10:22:06 +0000", "author": "Grace Abidemi", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

Users must register via the official claims portal before the token’s public launch to receive their allocation.\nThe ERA token will serve as the backbone of Caldera’s ecosystem, enabling omnichain gas payments, validator staking, and decentralized governance. It is designed to power both the Rollup Engine, used to launch modular L2 chains on frameworks like Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), Base, and zkSync (ZK), and the Metalayer.\nMetalater is Caldera’s interoperability protocol that links all rollups into one network with shared liquidity and intent-based bridging. It acts as a connecting bridge between Caldera-based chains, allowing assets and data to move freely across rollups while maintaining security.\nValidators will stake ERA to verify cross-chain messages and secure future infrastructure, including ZK-specific subnets. As the ecosystem matures, token holders will also guide protocol upgrades, vote on developer grants, and elect representatives to the foundation’s governance councils.\nThe token launch comes after several major infrastructure upgrades in early July, such as the complete rollout of the Metalayer and improvements to the Rollup Engine. With these enhancements, developers can now handle rollups as programmable services with integrated interoperability, facilitating quick and safe bridging across over 100 chains.\nCaldera currently powers more than 50 live rollups with a total value locked of over $400 million, and has processed over 750 million transactions across 27 million wallet addresses. High-profile partners include Manta Pacific, ApeChain, and B3.\nThe Caldera Foundation, based in the Cayman Islands, will oversee the token distribution and lead the ecosystem’s progressive decentralization. Its mission is to grow the network while empowering the community to drive its future.\nAs the modular blockchain movement accelerates, Caldera’s ERA token aims to provide the coordination layer, and economic engine, for what it calls the “Internet of Chains.” With the airdrop live and core infrastructure in place, the project is now inviting users and builders to shape the next era of scalable, composable blockchains.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 10:23:45 +0000", "author": "Leon Okwatch", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

The token is set to launch on July 12.\nAccording to data from CoinGlass, the meme coin launchpad’s native token has already garnered high traction from traders. Although it has not officially been launched on the market, its pre-market perpetual contracts have reached $333.17 million, soaring by as much as 376.93% in the past 24 hours of trading.\nThe majority of PUMP perps volume comes from Binance, which represents $204.75 million of the total on-chain volume. the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid is the second largest contributor, with a pre-market volume that stands at $115.4 million.\nThe perpetual contract for the long-anticipated token has even reached $120.12 million in open interest. Unlike the perps’ volume, most of the Futures Open Interest for the token comes from Hyperliquid with an OI of $81.9 million, representing nearly 70% of the total open interest.\nThe spike in futures open interest occurred exactly one day before the token is set to debut on the crypto market on July 12.\nWhat does a high open interest mean for PUMP?\nOpen interest is a metric that is used measure the number of outstanding futures contracts deployed on exchanges. A token does not particularly have to be on the market in order for traders to set perpetual contracts. Open interest is often used as an indicator for how much demand there is for an asset.\nTherefore, a large volume and open interest in PUMP’s perpetual contracts suggest strong speculative interest, even before the token launches on the market. This means that a large number of traders are betting on what the price of PUMP will be upon launch.\nHowever, a high open interest could also mean that there’s a high chance for volatility on launch day. If the price dips even slightly less than the perpetual contracts set by traders, many long positions could get liquidated. This could trigger a major price correction for PUMP.\nAccording to the long sentiment data on CoinGlass, the projected price for the token is $0.0052, which is around 30% higher than the initially set pre-sale price for the token.\nAs previously reported by crypto.news, the meme coin launchpad Pump.fun will launch its native token PUMP on July 12 with an initial coin offering 15% of the total token supply, which is around 150 billion tokens.

The token remains up approximately 113% from its lows last month.\nIts market capitalization now stands at $1.78 billion, ranking it as the 70th largest digital asset, while daily trading volume jumped by over 200%, reflecting a sharp increase in market participation.\nSEI’s price surged after the team announced that the network will soon support native USDC, issued directly by Circle, the issuer of the most widely regulated and institutionally adopted stablecoin.\nThe announcement also confirmed the upcoming integration of Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP). This will allow users to move USDC seamlessly between Sei and other major chains like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, without relying on third-party bridges or wrapped assets.\nThese integrations significantly enhance Sei’s value proposition by enabling fast, secure, and cost-efficient capital flows across ecosystems. Native USDC on Sei can power more efficient global payments, deepen liquidity across DeFi protocols, and lay the groundwork for institutional-grade financial applications.\nThe significant surge in trader interest and sustained buying pressure helped SEI break out of a well-defined inverse head and shoulders pattern on the daily chart. The neckline, positioned between $0.26 and $0.27, was decisively breached, and a successful retest has confirmed the validity of the breakout.\nAccording to pseudo-anonymous analyst Crypto Feras, the breakout projects an upside target of approximately $0.499, based on a measured move from the pattern’s base near $0.15. As of press time, this target remains nearly 55% from the current price level.\nBullish sentiment is also being echoed by other market analysts, with some projecting that SEI could reach as high as $1.50 by year-end, should macro and ecosystem developments remain favorable.\nMultiple bullish catalysts in play\nMomentum indicators seem to favour a continuation of the rally at least in the short term. The MACD line has crossed above the signal line, and RSI has continued to trend upward. This means buyers are currently dictating short-term price action..\nAdding to that, derivatives data further supports this outlook. According to CoinGlass, open interest in SEI futures has surged by more than 210% over the past three weeks, rising from under $50 million in mid-June to approximately $318 million as of press time. Traders are likely positioning themselves in anticipation of a breakout.\nMeanwhile, data from DeFiLlama shows total value locked across Sei’s DeFi protocols has reached a new all-time high of $1.4 billion. The scale of capital inflow points to sustained user activity across decentralised applications beyond just speculative interest in the SEI token alone.\nAs more liquidity anchors into the network, Sei stands to benefit from deeper markets, greater pricing stability, and improved conditions for developers building DeFi infrastructure.\nFurther support for Sei’s growth outlook may come from institutional positioning. Circle’s IPO prospectus, filed recently with U.S. regulators, confirms a holding of 6.25 million SEI tokens. This level of exposure suggests that Circle views Sei as a meaningful component in its broader blockchain strategy.\nMoreover, Sei is currently one of eleven blockchain networks under review by the Wyoming Stable Token Commission for the upcoming WYST stablecoin project. A final decision is expected on July 17.\nShould Sei qualify for the selection, it would mark another big step toward regulatory alignment and could further reinforce the network’s credibility as a compliant, institution-ready blockchain infrastructure in the U.S.\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Instead of charging users trading fees, Robinhood routes orders to third-party market makers, who pay the platform for the right to fill those trades.\nWhile this model enables commission-free trading on the surface, the AG’s office argues that it may result in less favorable execution prices for customers, making it more expensive overall than rival platforms offering all-in pricing.\n“Robinhood has long claimed to be the best bargain, but we believe those representations were deceptive,” said Attorney General James Uthmeier in the statement, emphasizing that investors deserve full transparency when buying and selling digital assets.\nUthmeier also noted that “crypto is a vital component of Florida’s financial future,” and framed the enforcement action as aligned with President Trump’s broader push to advance the U.S. crypto market.\nAs part of the probe, the AG’s office has issued a subpoena demanding Robinhood to turn over marketing materials, internal communications, pricing data, user disclosures, and employee records related to crypto operations in Florida.

That drop tested the lower trendline support, reinforcing the ascending triangle pattern, which features a relatively flat horizontal resistance around $685 – $700. The price is currently testing this level, trading at $686, after wicking as high as $695 today.\nThis time, BNB may be poised for a breakout, supported by multiple bullish catalysts. First, BNB Chain recently completed its 32nd quarterly token burn, permanently removing 1.59 million BNB from circulation. This reduction in supply is typically seen as a bullish driver, as it increases the token’s scarcity.\nSecondly, BNB’s active addresses have been rising steadily since mid-April, climbing from around 500,000 to over 1 million by early June, according to Glassnode data. While there has been a slight pullback recently, current levels remain elevated — hovering between 900,000 and 1 million — well above the March lows of around 400,000.\nIf BNB price breaks above the $700 horizontal resistance with strong volume and follow-through, it could trigger a move toward the $730–$745 zone — a key area where the price faced multiple rejections during previous rallies, before the current ascending triangle pattern began forming. On the downside, immediate horizontal support lies at $625–$635, followed by weaker support around $615, and then the ascending trendline support near $600.\nMomentum indicators support the bullish case. The RSI is at 67, approaching overbought territory, which could lead to a brief pullback or consolidation, though there’s still room for a breakout above the trendline. The MACD also remains bullish, with the MACD line above the signal line and the histogram printing rising green bars.\nTo sum it up, a confirmed breakout above $700 with strong volume could drive BNB toward $730–$745 in the near future.

Through its “10 Year Plan,” the company aims to steadily accumulate BTC as both a hedge against currency debasement and a potential growth asset.\nThe move comes amid growing adoption of Bitcoin treasury strategies, pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, with more European firms following suit. Meanwhile, alternative corporate crypto treasury strategies involving Ethereum (ETH), and more recently Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Binance Coin (BNB), are also beginning to gain traction.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 08:35:15 +0000", "author": "Darya", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

The numbers marked the funds’ sixth consecutive day of positive flows and the largest single-day inflow in months, a level last seen in November 2024.\nAmong the top performers was BlackRock’s IBIT, which once again led the charge with approximately $448.5 million. Fidelity’s FBTC followed closely with $324.34 million, and Ark 21Shares with $268.7 million.\nOther issuers, including Bitwise, VanEck, and Valkyrie, saw smaller inflows under $100 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC moved the opposite way, logging $40.2 million in outflows.\nIBIT also led all 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs in trading activity by a wide margin, pulling in $5 billion in volume, twice its daily average and up from $3.5 billion the day before.\nThe strong influx of funds came alongside fresh momentum in Bitcoin’s price. On the same day, BTC (BTC) extended the upward trend it kicked off earlier in the week, shattering multiple all-time highs.\nTrading over $118,100 at the time of writing, the crypto market giant is up roughly 6.3% in the past 24 hours, sharpening positive investor sentiment. But what’s driving the surge?\nWhy Bitcoin is climbing\nThe bullish setup in BTC is powered by a mix of rising institutional interest and supportive macro conditions, reversing the bearish mood that earlier gripped the markets.\nMore financial institutions are betting on Bitcoin’s long-term reserve value. Q2 saw over 159,100 BTC purchased across 125 public companies, which now collectively hold 847,000 bitcoins, worth just under $100 billion at current prices. Like the ETFs, these institutional inflows provide more stable momentum for Bitcoin’s performance than traditional rally drivers like retail interest and market hype.\nMacro economic backdrop is contributing to the rally. The U.S. economy is showing unexpected strength, with June nonfarm payrolls adding 147,000 jobs and the unemployment rate falling to 4.1%. This data prompted traders to rethink the pace of Fed rate cuts, with odds of a July cut dropping to just 5%, down sharply from 24% earlier in the week, per CME FedWatch.\nBitcoin’s rally also coincides with a rising stock market. The Dow Jones rose 270 points, or 0.61%, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.28%, signaling broader risk appetite across markets.\nAnalysts expect the current trend to continue and forecast that the combination of positive factors will establish a stronger foothold above $118K. According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, the current move is likely just an “interim high,” echoing broader market predictions that see Bitcoin on a path toward $200,000.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 07:59:35 +0000", "author": "Grace Abidemi", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

The second largest cryptocurrency by market cap has finally surpassed the $3,000 mark. The last time ETH went beyond $3,000 was back in early February before it fell into an extended slump that lasted well into July.\nOn July 11 at 06:30 AM UTC, ETH bounced back up to a peak price of $3,019.

That address then moved a third of that chunk to a different address, approximately moving 7,000 ETH or $20.9 million.\nAfterwards, the third address swapped 1,210 ETH for USDC (USDC) worth $3.5 million within the past 24 hours.\nMany traders reacted negatively to the transfer, accusing the ETH Foundation of dumping its own native token. However, there were also traders that came to EF’s defense by stating that it was part of the network’s new treasury policy.\n“A lot of FUD going on right now about the Ethereum Foundation selling ETH, don’t believe it!” said a trader with the X handle @digitalartchick.\n“The Ethereum Foundation uses it’s 200K ETH treasury to participate in DeFi and generate yield, they do not sell ETH anymore since the leadership change this year,” the user continued in the post.\nEarlier in June, the Ethereum Foundation informed the public that it would implement a new treasury strategy that would see the foundation executing more regular ETH sales to maintain a fiat reserve.

Posing as representatives of emerging startups, they offer incentives such as cryptocurrency payments in exchange for testing software.\nVictims are then directed to polished company websites designed to mimic legitimate startups, complete with whitepapers, roadmaps, GitHub entries, and even fake merchandise stores.\nOnce a target downloads the malicious application, a Cloudflare verification screen appears, during which the malware quietly collects system information such as CPU details, MAC address, and user ID. This information, along with a CAPTCHA token, is sent to the attacker’s server to determine whether the system is a viable target.\nIf the verification succeeds, a second-stage payload, typically an info-stealer, is stealthily delivered, which then extracts sensitive data, including cryptocurrency wallet credentials.\nBoth Windows and macOS versions of the malware have been detected, with some Windows variants known to be using code-signing certificates stolen from legitimate companies.\nAccording to Darktrace, the campaign resembles tactics used by “traffer” groups, which are cybercriminal networks that specialize in generating malware installs through deceptive content and social media manipulation.\nWhile the threat actors remain unidentified, researchers believe the methods used are consistent with those seen in campaigns attributed to CrazyEvil, a group known for targeting crypto-related communities.\n“CrazyEvil and their sub teams create fake software companies, similar to the ones described in this blog, making use of Twitter and Medium to target victims,” Darktrace wrote, adding that the group is estimated to have made “millions of dollars in revenue from their malicious activity.”\nA recurring threat\nSimilar malware campaigns have been detected on multiple occasions throughout this year, with one North Korea-linked operation found to be using fake Zoom updates to compromise macOS devices at crypto firms.\nAttackers were reportedly deploying a new malware strain dubbed “NimDoor,” delivered through a malicious SDK update.

In a June 11 analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Avocado Onchain noted that several important indicators point to the market not being overheated.\nThe MVRV ratio, which compares Bitcoin’s (BTC) market value to its realized value, currently stands at 2.2. That’s well below the overheated levels of 2.7 seen during the March and December 2024 highs, pointing to relatively moderate speculation.\nThere’s also been a noticeable shift in investor behavior. During earlier bull market tops, short-term holders, wallets that held BTC for less than a month, made up around 30% of the market. Today, that number has dropped to 15%. Fewer short-term players often means less volatility and a lower risk of sudden selloffs.\nSimilar conclusions can be drawn from other indicators. There appears to be little sell pressure based on the lack of a significant spike in the Short-Term Holder SOPR, which measures profit-taking among recent buyers.\nMeanwhile, miners, often early sellers during market tops, are staying relatively quiet. The Miner Position Index has been drifting lower, and some mining firms appear to be accumulating rather than selling.\nRetail investors are also missing from the picture, according to another CryptoQuant analysis. Their “Spot Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency Surge” metric remains in the gray zone, a signal that retail traders have yet to re-enter the market.\nRetail frenzy has historically been associated with late-stage bull market peaks. Given that institutions and exchange-traded funds are still driving the trend, the current absence might indicate that the top is still a long way off.\nLooking ahead, short-term support levels may offer clues about where the market heads next. The $106,500 and $101,200 zones, which represent the average cost basis for holders who purchased Bitcoin in the previous one to three months, are being watched by analysts.\nThe upward trend may continue if Bitcoin maintains its position above those levels. A drop below could trigger short-term selling but might also bring in new buyers.\nOverall, this rally appears to be more sustainable than previous ones. Bitcoin may have more room to rise without the chaos that frequently occurs near the top, as long as there is steady institutional interest, calm on-chain signals, and retail still largely on the sidelines.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 07:19:45 +0000", "author": "Leon Okwatch", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

Solana staking will be managed entirely by Robinhood, enabling users to earn rewards without dealing with validator setup or maintenance.\nDue to local regulatory restrictions, the staking service is currently unavailable in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Wisconsin. On October 1, 2025, Robinhood will begin charging a 25% fee on staking rewards. This fee will be comparable to other platforms’ rates and will include fees from third-party validators.\nThe move represents Robinhood’s deeper push into the cryptocurrency infrastructure space, following its recent acquisition of Bitstamp and its plans to enter the perpetual futures market, subject to CFTC approval. It also complements its European tokenized stocks rollout, although those products are not yet available in the U.S.\nRegulatory headwinds had previously delayed Robinhood’s entrance into staking. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement actions against other platforms earlier in the cycle prompted a more cautious approach. However, now that the landscape is stabilizing, Robinhood is joining rivals like Coinbase in providing yield-bearing services that both institutional and retail users find appealing.\nStaking ETH or SOL on Robinhood doesn’t require technical knowledge or hardware. The application abstracts away the validator infrastructure, providing a streamlined entry point to blockchain participation. This user-friendly experience fits with Robinhood’s strategy to make crypto more accessible and reduce barriers to entry.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 07:06:05 +0000", "author": "Leon Okwatch", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

The law recommends an extended sentencing to be between 51 and 63 months.\nHowever in Truglia’s case, he allegedly moved his stolen funds around and converted them to Bitcoin (BTC) and took a cut for himself, thereby violating his terms. A damning video of him speaking in a masked voice about how he would still get to keep his stolen crypto even after being in prison for 10 years convinced the judge to extend it to 12 years in prison.\n“If ten years are okay, I’ll be sentencing you to twelve [years],” said Senior Judge Alvin K.

Instead he failed to do so and retained approximately $673,000 from cuts made.\nBack in December 2022, then-25-year-old Nicholas Truglia was sentenced to prison for 18 months for his participation in a SIM swap crypto scam that stole over $20 million worth of cryptocurrency from crypto investor Michael Terpin.\nHe was able to gain access to the victim’s emails and other accounts by hijacking the Terpin’s phone number by replacing it with a SIM card he controlled.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 07:04:28 +0000", "author": "Trisha Husada", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

This adds an extra layer of security without slowing things down.\nEthereum to become the largest zero-knowledge application\nZK-proofs are a cryptographic method that enables a prover to validate a claim without disclosing information about the claim itself. It allows the verification of confidential data without disclosing the data.\nThe EF’s initiative positions the Ethereum network to eventually become the world’s largest ZK application. To support the transition, the network will define real-time proving as a technical and hardware standard that zkVM teams should aim for.\nThe EF is pushing zkVM teams to follow specific goals to ensure that the technology is fast, secure and can be run from home. More specifically, the EF wants zkVMs to create proofs in under 10 seconds, be secure and work on hardware costing less than $100,000 and use less than 10 kilowatts of electricity.\nThis would allow everyday people to help secure the network, protecting Ethereum against censorship and central control.\nRelated: ETH maxis scream for $3K, but data shows pro Ether traders cautiously positioned\nEthereum’s ZK rollout will be gradual\nGold said the change will be gradual, with optional ZK clients running alongside current validator setups. However, as ZK clients prove their reliability and performance, the network will shift to requiring proof verification instead of re-execution.\nWhile the timeline seems ambitious, the EF said the momentum in ZK research and open-source developments makes it achievable.

However, in 2020, 70% of the initial applicants failed to secure the license, with many speculating that the rules were too stringent.\nIn 2021, a unit within Malta’s Chamber of Commerce dismissed allegations that the country had failed to maintain proper regulatory oversight of cryptocurrency businesses.\nIn 2022, The Times of Malta also reported that the collapsed crypto exchange FTX had two Malta-registered firms, but the MFSA said neither was licensed to provide services.\nSome investigations pointed to Malta’s “fast-and-loose approach” to attracting crypto companies, highlighting that 85% of crypto businesses registered in Malta eventually left the island after the two-year transition period as of 2023.\nMagazine: Inside a 30,000 phone bot farm stealing crypto airdrops from real users", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 11:09:40 +0100", "author": "Cointelegraph by Helen Partz", "source": "https://cointelegraph.com/rss"}

Decentralization makes it fair | Opinion", "url": "https://crypto.news/the-future-of-ai-powered-work-needs-decentralization/", "text": "The future of work is AI-powered. Decentralization makes it fair | Opinion\nDisclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial.\nIn a recent study published by Stanford researchers, 1,500 U.S. workers, including writers, designers, and artists, shared their views on AI in the workplace. The data is clear: creative professionals, if one can believe it, do not want AI to automate their core work. Less than a fifth of tasks in arts, design, and media were seen as suitable for automation. Creatives welcome help with repetitive chores but want to keep authorship and control.\nFor anyone working in creative fields, this is a familiar feeling. Creative labor is already undervalued, and new AI tools blur the line between collaboration and co-optation. They open their feeds and see their art, remixed by AI, printed on merch, and sold by strangers without their consent or any credit. But someone’s getting paid, and it isn’t the creatives.\nGenerative AI is already transforming work. It drafts emails, composes music, designs logos, and scripts dialogue. For many creatives, this isn’t collaboration. It’s co-optation. The very models doing the work were trained on your voice, your style, your archive.\nAs AI becomes both collaborator and competitor, questions about ownership grow louder. Who gets paid when a machine generates? Who is protected when reputations are at stake?\nWhen AI becomes the artist and the thief\nWhile it has opened doors for creativity and productivity, the centralized AI economy is built on scraped content.\nIn 2023, artists Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan, and Karla Ortiz sued Stability AI and Midjourney for training models on their work without permission. Getty Images filed suit after its watermarked photos appeared in AI outputs. A deepfake of Taylor Swift went viral with over 45 million views. Scarlett Johansson’s team intervened when OpenAI released a voice assistant that resembled her, despite her refusal to license her voice. The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for using its archives without authorization. Universal Music accused Anthropic of generating copyrighted lyrics.\nThese legal fights reflect a system that imitates human creativity while distancing itself from the people who made the originals.\nWhat DeAI can do for creators\nThere is another path. Decentralized AI, or DeAI, offers a structural alternative. It embeds rights and attribution into the systems themselves. It is not a silver bullet. DeAI depends on legal clarity, broad adoption, and strong governance. But it does address one core problem: creators are too often excluded from the platforms and tools that rely on their work.\nDeAI makes attribution programmable. A creator uploads data, defines usage terms, and binds those terms to smart contracts. These contracts automatically determine who can access the data, how it can be used, and under what conditions. A song trained on your voice without a license could be flagged and blocked before anyone ever hears it.\nThis is already happening in the field. The startup MyShell, which builds multilingual voice AI, used the Sahara platform to source tens of thousands of voice clips in a decentralized way. Instead of scraping YouTube or hiring a studio, they crowdsourced samples from contributors around the world by tracking, attributing, and compensating them using on-chain records. Creators retained control of their data while still participating in a scalable training pipeline. MyShell, meanwhile, saved time and cost without compromising quality. That is the promise of DeAI: fair exchange at the point of data.\nImagine a photographer uploading a portrait with rules attached: free to view on social platforms, $5 to use in a blog post, prohibited for AI training without a separate agreement. Ethical developers could license it with one click. Bad actors would be denied access automatically. That creates a different kind of system, one in which artists are licensors, not victims.\nA long fight, a new toolkit\nThis debate has a long history. The Statute of Anne in 1710 gave authors, not printers, the right to control their work. France’s 19th-century moral rights protected the integrity of creative output. Even Renaissance artists like Albrecht Dürer fought against unauthorized copies. Every era of technological disruption has forced a redefinition of ownership.\nDeAI continues that lineage. Where copyright created legal scaffolding, DeAI turns rights into software logic. And where laws often lag behind technology, decentralized infrastructure can help enforce ethical standards at scale.\nStill, no system is perfect. DeAI could be co-opted. A consortium dominated by large studios might set licensing standards that sideline independent creators. A bug in a smart contract could lock a work away forever, with no one to fix it. There is no guarantee that decentralization alone will create fairness. Like any system, it depends on who builds it, who maintains it, and who benefits.\nBut these risks already exist in today’s opaque and extractive AI landscape. The difference is that DeAI, at its best, allows creators to help shape the tools that govern their work.\nThe next creative economy\nMillions of people are trying to build sustainable lives through creative labor. For Gen Z and younger millennials, many of whom are priced out of traditional assets, burdened by student debt, and navigating unstable job markets, the ability to participate in ownership matters.\nIf we don’t rebuild the infrastructure of authorship now, we risk locking in a system that exploits by default. The choice is not between a flawless decentralized model and the current one. It is between a system with transparent, addressable flaws and one with opaque, unaccountable ones.\nGetting this right will take more than good intentions. Creators and their guilds need to begin standardizing digital identity and asset registration. Developers should prioritize open, interoperable systems instead of closed platforms. Policymakers must create legal protections for artists who register their work on-chain, recognizing those registries with the same authority as traditional copyright offices.\nCreative labor deserves protection. Participation should be rewarded. Exploitation should not.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 06:57:35 +0000", "author": "Guest Post", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

Executive Summary\nArbitrum (ARB), one of Ethereum's leading Layer 2 solutions, has had a mixed week with significant developments across adoption, partnerships, and security. Positive catalysts include the expansion into Latin America, a surge in total value locked (TVL), and collaboration with Robinhood for tokenized stock trading. However, two major security breaches—affecting GMX and Kinto Coin—have raised concerns. ARB is trading at $0.41, with technical indicators showing a weak bullish trend but notable resistance around $0.44.\n2. Recent Market Developments\nPositive Developments\n- LatAm Expansion (July 11, 2025): Arbitrum has launched hackathons and an Ambassador Program in Argentina, aiming to boost adoption in Latin America. This outreach solidifies Arbitrum's global presence and fosters grassroots developer engagement, which could drive long-term ecosystem growth.\n- ARB Grants Pool Increase (July 11, 2025): Community enthusiasm led to an increase in the ARB grants pool to 514,000 ARB. This move incentivizes builders and highlights the network’s commitment to ecosystem development.\n- TVL Growth to $2.5 Billion (July 8, 2025): Arbitrum's TVL surged by 32%, driven by tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and the Robinhood partnership. This reflects strong demand and utility beyond DeFi.\n- Robinhood Partnership (July 2, 2025): Robinhood launched tokenized US stock trading on Arbitrum, enabling commission-free trading for EU investors. This integration bridges traditional finance and blockchain, expanding Arbitrum's use cases.\nNeutral Developments\n- Stablecoin Adoption (July 7, 2025): The stablecoin market cap on Arbitrum reached $6.8 billion, marking an all-time high. However, ARB's price saw limited upward momentum, reflecting market caution.\nNegative Developments\n- GMX Exploit (July 9, 2025): A $42 million exploit on GMX’s V1 protocol caused significant market alarm. While GMX offered a 10% bounty to the attacker, the incident raises questions about Arbitrum's security protocols.\n- Kinto Coin Crash (July 10, 2025): A smart contract exploit on Arbitrum led to the Kinto token losing 99% of its value. This incident highlights the risks associated with deploying poorly audited contracts.\n3. Technical Analysis\nArbitrum (ARB) is currently trading at $0.41, with a 24-hour change of -0.29%. Technical indicators suggest a weak bullish trend:\nMoving Averages\n- Short-term: SMA7 ($0.37) and EMA12 ($0.36) show bullish momentum.\n- Long-term: SMA_200 ($0.44) indicates resistance above current levels.\nMomentum Indicators\n- RSI (66.74): Approaching overbought territory, signaling potential resistance near $0.44.\n- MACD (0.0146): Positive histogram suggests upward momentum.\n- Stochastic Oscillator (%K: 82.31, %D: 86.03): Overbought conditions could lead to a short-term pullback.\nBollinger Bands\n- Upper Band: $0.40, indicating ARB is trading near its short-term limits.\n- Middle Band: $0.34, reflecting strong support.\nKey Levels\n- Resistance: $0.43 (short-term), $0.44 (long-term).\n- Support: $0.26 (critical level).\n4. Trading Strategy and Signals\nShort-Term Strategy\n- Entry Point: Traders may consider entering positions near $0.40, provided RSI and MACD remain bullish.\n- Target: Short-term upside potential to $0.43-$0.44, with strong resistance at these levels.\n- Stop Loss: $0.38 to mitigate downside risk.\nLong-Term Strategy\n- Accumulation Zone: $0.34-$0.37 based on moving averages.\n- Upside Potential: A breakout above $0.44 could see ARB retest $0.50, contingent on market sentiment and security improvements.\n5. Price Predictions and Outlook\nThe mixed market sentiment reflects both optimism and caution:\n- Bullish Case: Continued growth in TVL, LatAm adoption, and the Robinhood partnership could propel ARB toward $0.50 in Q3 2025.\n- Bearish Case: Security concerns from recent exploits may cap gains, with a potential pullback to $0.34 if market confidence wanes.\n6. Risk Analysis\nWhile Arbitrum's fundamentals remain strong, the following risks should be considered:\n- Security Vulnerabilities: Recent exploits (GMX, Kinto) highlight the need for robust contract audits.\n- Market Volatility: Despite bullish indicators, macroeconomic factors and Ethereum Layer 2 competition could impact ARB’s price trajectory.\n- Regulatory Risk: As Arbitrum bridges traditional finance with blockchain, regulatory scrutiny could pose challenges.\n7. Conclusion\nArbitrum (ARB) stands at a pivotal moment, with strong adoption trends counterbalanced by security concerns. The LatAm expansion and Robinhood integration demonstrate Arbitrum’s potential to redefine Layer 2 utility. However, addressing vulnerabilities is essential to sustaining investor confidence. Traders should monitor resistance at $0.44 while leveraging technical trends for strategic entries. Long-term prospects remain promising, provided the ecosystem can maintain its growth momentum and enhance security protocols.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Sat, 12 Jul 2025 03:38:14 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

However, the 200-day SMA at $5.95 signifies that APT remains bearish in the long term.\n- Momentum Indicators:\n- RSI (14): 57.03 (Neutral-Bullish, room for upward movement).\n- MACD: Positive histogram at 0.0447 reflects increasing bullish momentum.\n- Stochastic Oscillator: %K at 78.69 suggests the asset is nearing overbought territory, requiring caution.\n- Bollinger Bands: Prices are approaching the upper band at $5.13, indicating potential resistance.\nKey Levels:\n- Resistance: $5.30 (R1), $5.58 (R2).\n- Support: $3.87 (S1), $3.75 (S2).\nWith weak bullish momentum and significant resistance at $5.30, Aptos's price movement hinges on market sentiment post-token unlock.\n4. Trading Strategy and Signals\n- Short-Term Strategy: Traders should monitor the $5.30 resistance. A breakout above this level could trigger a rally toward $5.58. Conversely, failure to break $5.30 may lead to a pullback to the $4.70-$4.80 range.\n- Risk Management: Utilize stop-loss orders near the $3.87 support level to mitigate downside risk.\n- Volume Signals: Watch for an uptick in 24-hour trading volume ($42.7M) to confirm any decisive move.\n5. Price Predictions and Outlook\n- Bullish Case: If institutional adoption continues and the market absorbs the 11.31M token unlock, APT could test $5.30, with a potential rally to $5.58 in the coming weeks.\n- Bearish Case: A failure to hold above $4.70, compounded by sell pressure from the token unlock, could see APT revisiting the $3.87-$3.75 range.\nLong-term, Aptos's growing dominance in the RWA sector and strategic partnerships are likely to bolster its value proposition.\n6. Risk Analysis\n- Token Unlock Volatility: The release of 11.31M APT tokens could lead to increased supply and short-term price declines, particularly if demand does not offset sell pressure.\n- Overbought Conditions: Stochastic indicators suggest the asset may face downward correction after recent gains.\n- Market Sentiment: Broader market weakness or negative macroeconomic developments could dampen Aptos's bullish momentum.\n7. Conclusion\nAptos (APT) is making significant strides in institutional adoption and tokenized assets, with its RWA TVL ranking third globally. While the token unlock event could introduce short-term volatility, the network's strong partnerships and expanding ecosystem position it for future growth. Investors should remain cautious around key resistance levels and monitor trading volume for actionable signals.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Sat, 12 Jul 2025 03:36:14 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

Executive Summary\nTRON (TRX) has experienced a robust performance this week, crossing the $0.30 mark for the first time in seven months. With over 13 billion total transactions and $21 billion in weekly USDT transfers, TRON’s network activity now surpasses Ethereum’s. Strategic partnerships, including a collaboration with MicroStrategy, and bullish technical indicators further amplify investor confidence. However, regulatory scrutiny surrounding TRON’s founder, Justin Sun, and exchange delistings present potential risks.\n2. Recent Market Developments\nTRX Price Resilience Amidst Surging Transactions\nTRON’s daily transactions exceeded 8 million, primarily driven by stablecoin transfers in underbanked regions. Despite a 1.7% weekly price increase, regulatory concerns—stemming from a 2023 SEC lawsuit against Justin Sun—continue to cast a shadow.\nTRON Hits $0.30 After Seven Months\nTRX reclaimed the $0.30 level after more than seven months, following a liquidity-driven price surge on June 23. This aligns with the AMD (Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution) theory, reflecting growing market confidence.\nBullish Momentum and DeFi Growth\nTRON announced achieving 6 billion transactions as of July 8, 2025, while its DeFi ecosystem saw a weekly TVL increase of 3.5%, reaching $15.3 billion. TRON’s collaboration with AI projects is also fueling optimism.\nPartnership with MicroStrategy\nThe Tron MSTR initiative, announced on July 9, focuses on institutional crypto adoption. This strategic move has reinforced TRX’s price stability and strengthened its position in the institutional market.\nIntegration of the TRUMP Memecoin\nJustin Sun’s $100M pledge to integrate TRUMP memecoin into TRON’s blockchain highlights its scalability and appeal to politically aligned communities. However, regulatory risks associated with Tether freezing $12.3M in TRON-based assets must be monitored.\nGlobal Expansion and Ecosystem Growth\nTRON DAO continues to drive global adoption, with expanded in-store payment solutions in Southeast Asia and a U.S.-backed stablecoin minting on-chain. These developments underline TRON's utility in real-world financial applications.\n3. Technical Analysis\nAs of July 12, TRX is trading at $0.31, reflecting a 3.66% daily increase. Key technical indicators suggest a strong bullish trend:\n- Moving Averages: All major SMAs and EMAs point to upward momentum, with TRX consistently trading above the 200-day SMA.\n- Momentum Indicators: The RSI is at 75.95, signaling overbought conditions, while the MACD histogram remains positive, indicating continued bullish momentum.\n- Bollinger Bands: TRX is trading above the upper band with a %B of 1.1044, suggesting strong upward price pressure.\n- ATR (14): At $0.01, volatility remains manageable, aligning with the bullish trend.\nKey levels to watch:\n- Resistance: $0.31 (current level)\n- Support: $0.26\n4. Trading Strategy and Signals\nGiven the strong bullish indicators, traders should consider the following strategies:\n- Short-Term: Monitor the $0.31 resistance level. If TRX breaks above this, it could target $0.33 or higher. Tight stop-loss orders near $0.29 are recommended to mitigate downside risks.\n- Medium-Term: Accumulation near the $0.30 pivot point may yield favorable returns, especially if TRX maintains its bullish momentum.\n- Long-Term: Institutional adoption and expanding use cases make TRX an attractive hold, but regulatory developments should be closely watched.\n5. Price Predictions and Outlook\nTRON’s price trajectory remains positive:\n- Short-Term: Consolidation near $0.31 before targeting $0.33.\n- Medium-Term: Sustained growth could push TRX to $0.35, particularly if network activity continues to outpace competitors.\n- Long-Term: Achieving $0.40–$0.43 within 2025 is plausible if TRON secures further institutional adoption and regulatory clarity.\n6. Risk Analysis\nWhile TRON shows strong growth potential, risks remain:\n- Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC lawsuit against Justin Sun and Tether’s freezing of $12.3M in TRON-based assets could dampen investor confidence.\n- Market Volatility: Exchange delistings, such as Bitget’s removal of certain trading pairs, could impact liquidity.\n- Overbought Conditions: Technical indicators suggest TRX may face short-term corrections if profit-taking occurs.\n7. Conclusion\nTRON (TRX) is in a strong position, supported by record-breaking transaction volumes, growing institutional adoption, and bullish technical indicators. While regulatory challenges persist, TRON’s expanding ecosystem and strategic partnerships present significant opportunities for growth. Investors should remain cautious of market volatility but can capitalize on TRX’s upward momentum with well-timed trades.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Sat, 12 Jul 2025 03:30:14 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

Executive Summary\nLitecoin (LTC) has been one of the standout performers in the crypto market this July, driven by positive market sentiment, adoption growth, and speculation regarding a potential ETF approval. Currently trading at $95.12, Litecoin is approaching a critical resistance level at $98.32. With its price mirroring Bitcoin’s rally and boasting strong on-chain metrics, LTC could be poised for a breakout above $100. However, short-term caution is advised as technical indicators suggest overbought conditions.\n2. Recent Market Developments\na. Bitcoin’s Rally Boosts Litecoin\nLitecoin has mirrored 88% of Bitcoin’s price movements, benefiting from Bitcoin’s surge past $120,000. This correlation fosters positive momentum for LTC, with the MACD indicator signaling a bullish trend despite RSI nearing overbought levels.\nb. Growing Transaction Values\nOn July 11, Litecoin’s average transaction size hit $50,000, marking a significant increase from the $3,000–$4,000 range in early 2024. This reflects rising institutional and high-net-worth investor activity.\nc. ETF Speculation Drives Optimism\nThe likelihood of a Litecoin spot ETF approval by October 2025 has surged to 95%. If approved, this could trigger billions in inflows, potentially pushing LTC beyond $150, according to analysts.\nd. Adoption Expands Across Payments and DeFi\nLitecoin’s introduction of a wrapped LTC product for Ethereum and Arbitrum networks has boosted its utility as a bridge between traditional crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi). Furthermore, Litecoin’s halving event has led miners to hold LTC, reducing exchange inflows and tightening supply.\ne. Positive Technical Trends\nA ‘golden cross’ pattern, coupled with consistent network activity and high liquidity, has positioned Litecoin as a top gainer for July. However, some analysts caution that newer utility-first platforms may pose competitive risks in the long term.\n3.

The Bollinger Bands indicate price is trading near the upper range, signaling potential consolidation before a breakout.\n4. Trading Strategy and Signals\nFor Bullish Traders:\n- Watch for a breakout above $98.95 to confirm bullish momentum.\n- Open long positions around $92–$94 if price retraces to these levels, targeting $100–$110.\nFor Bearish Traders:\n- Monitor RSI levels closely. If overbought conditions persist, consider short positions near $98.32 with a target of $88.\nRisk Management:\n- Set stop-loss orders below $89 to mitigate downside risks.\n5. Price Predictions and Outlook\nShort-Term:\nLitecoin is likely to test $100 in the coming days, driven by ETF optimism, institutional adoption, and Bitcoin’s rally. A confirmed break above $98.95 could pave the way for $110.\nMedium-Term:\nIf the ETF is approved by October, Litecoin could ascend to $150+ as institutional inflows accelerate. However, resistance at $137 (52-week high) may require significant momentum to overcome.\nLong-Term:\nLitecoin’s strong fundamentals, consistent adoption, and halving-related supply tightening make it a reliable long-term investment. However, competition from newer, utility-driven cryptocurrencies could pose challenges.\n6. Risk Analysis\nWhile Litecoin demonstrates strong bullish momentum, traders should exercise caution:\n- Overbought Conditions: RSI and stochastic indicators suggest the potential for short-term pullbacks.\n- Market Competition: New platforms with advanced utilities could divert interest away from Litecoin.\n- Regulatory Uncertainty: Although ETF approval odds are high, any delay or rejection could negatively impact LTC’s price.\n7. Conclusion\nLitecoin remains a top contender in the crypto market, supported by its adoption in payments and DeFi, halving-related scarcity, and the potential for ETF-driven inflows. While short-term resistance near $98.95 could lead to consolidation, a breakout above $100 appears imminent.

The SEC’s delay in approving Grayscale’s AVAX-focused ETF and a $42M hack on GMX weighed heavily on market sentiment. However, the launch of the $40M Retro9000 grant program and Blockticity's adoption of Avalanche highlight the platform's potential for long-term growth. With a current price of $20.90 and mixed technical indicators, AVAX's near-term trajectory remains uncertain, but opportunities for growth abound.\nRecent Market Developments\n-\nSEC Delays Grayscale ETF Decision (July 10, 2025)\nThe SEC extended its review of Grayscale’s Avalanche ETF proposal to July 15, 2025, creating uncertainty in the market.

A confirmed breakout above $21.53 may signal a move toward $24.35 (R2). Conversely, a breakdown below $20.32 could lead to retests of $16.26 (S1). -\nLong-Term Strategy\nAccumulation near $20 or lower could prove beneficial for long-term holders, especially if Avalanche’s ecosystem growth continues.\nPrice Predictions and Outlook\n- Short-Term: Volatility may persist as the market digests recent news.

This contributed to a crash to $3.40 earlier this month.\n- Security Issues (July 10–11, 2025): Broader crypto security breaches, including the Plasma Foundation’s hacked X account and Kinto’s $1.55 million exploit, have created negative sentiment, indirectly affecting DOT’s growth potential.\n3. Technical Analysis\nCurrent Price: $3.99\nTrend: Weak Bullish (RSI: 63.19, above the 50 neutral level)\nKey Indicators\n- Moving Averages: DOT trades above the 7-day SMA ($3.66) and 50-day SMA ($3.80), indicating short-term bullish momentum. However, it remains below the 200-day SMA ($4.70), signaling long-term weakness.\n- Momentum Indicators: MACD shows a bullish crossover, with the histogram at 0.0938. Stochastic %K is at 86.19, suggesting the asset is nearing overbought territory.\n- Bollinger Bands: DOT is trading near the upper band ($3.90), indicating potential resistance but aligning with short-term bullish trends.\nSupport and Resistance Levels\n- Resistance 1: $4.11\n- Resistance 2: $4.68\n- Support 1: $3.11\n- Support 2: $3.01\nDespite the recent rally, DOT needs to break above $4.11 for sustained upward momentum.\n4. Trading Strategy and Signals\nBullish Scenario\nTraders can consider long positions if DOT breaks above $4.11 with strong volume, targeting $4.68 and beyond. Short-term momentum indicators favor a bullish outlook, supported by improving investor sentiment and Bitcoin’s rally.\nBearish Scenario\nIf whale sell-offs persist or broader crypto sentiment weakens, DOT could retest support at $3.11. A break below this level may trigger further declines toward $3.01 or lower.\n5. Price Predictions and Outlook\n- Short-Term: DOT is expected to trade within the $4.00–$4.50 range, driven by positive market sentiment and technological upgrades.\n- Medium-Term: Institutional adoption and cross-chain advancements could push DOT toward $6.00 by Q4 2025, provided market conditions remain favorable.\n- Long-Term: As Polkadot strengthens its position as a Web3 leader, the token could reach $15–$20 in the next 12–18 months, assuming continued adoption and innovation.\n6. Risk Analysis\nWhile Polkadot’s long-term prospects remain strong, several risks could impact its price:\n- Security Breaches: Broader crypto hacks, such as the recent Plasma and Kinto incidents, may erode investor confidence.\n- Whale Activity: Large-scale sell-offs could continue to suppress price growth, especially during periods of low volume.\n- Competition: Rival blockchain networks offering similar interoperability features could challenge Polkadot’s market share.\n7.

Technical Analysis\nCardano’s technical indicators currently paint a bullish picture, but key levels must be monitored:\n- Price Movement: Trading at $0.73 with a 5.92% daily gain, ADA remains above critical support levels.\n- Moving Averages: While the 200-day SMA at $0.75 acts as immediate resistance, shorter-term SMAs and EMAs (e.g., SMA_7 at $0.64) indicate strong upward momentum.\n- Momentum Indicators:\n- RSI(14): 70.80 – Overbought but bullish.\n- MACD: Positive histogram at 0.0213 confirms bullish momentum.\n- Stochastic Oscillator: %K at 80.40 and %D at 83.40 suggest potential consolidation or a minor pullback.\n- Bollinger Bands: ADA is trading above the upper band ($0.70), indicating strong bullish sentiment but a risk of overextension.\n- Key Levels:\n- Resistance: $0.76 (200-day SMA) and $0.86.\n- Support: $0.53 and $0.51.\nWith a bullish trend confirmed, ADA’s next test lies in breaking above $0.76 to sustain long-term upward momentum.\n4. Trading Strategy and Signals\nTraders should consider the following actionable insights based on current trends:\n- Entry Points: Buying near $0.68-$0.70 (upper Bollinger Band and recent support) could offer favorable risk-reward ratios.\n- Take-Profit Targets: Gradual exits at $0.76, $0.86, and $1.00 for short-term trades, with $2.80 as a long-term target based on historical patterns.\n- Stop-Loss: Setting stops below $0.60 minimizes downside risk in case of bearish reversals.\n- Momentum Trading: Given the overbought RSI and Bollinger Band breakout, traders should watch for a potential pullback before re-entering.\n5. Price Predictions and Outlook\nCardano’s price trajectory in July 2025 looks promising, with multiple bullish catalysts:\n- Short-Term: A breakout above $0.76 could propel ADA to $0.86 and beyond in the coming weeks.\n- Medium-Term: Analysts predict ADA could hit $1.00-$1.20 by the end of July if bullish momentum continues, with the Cardano Summit acting as a potential trigger.\n- Long-Term: Some forecasts suggest a 383% rally, potentially reaching $2.80 by the end of 2025, driven by Hydra scaling, institutional interest, and DeFi adoption.\n6. Risk Analysis\nDespite the optimism, investors should remain cautious of the following risks:\n- Regulatory Uncertainty: IO Global’s exit from a partnership with El Salvador underscores potential challenges in navigating international regulations.\n- Security Concerns: Past incidents, such as the Cardano Foundation’s X account hack, highlight the importance of vigilance in protecting digital assets.\n- Market Volatility: ADA’s reliance on technical indicators and speculative events makes it vulnerable to sudden market reversals.\nFurthermore, declining development activity and unique transactions suggest a need for sustained ecosystem engagement to maintain investor confidence.\n7. Conclusion\nCardano (ADA) is at a pivotal moment, with strong technical indicators, institutional accumulation, and ecosystem developments aligning to create a bullish outlook. While risks remain, ADA’s potential to break above key resistance levels and reach $1.00 or higher by the end of July makes it a compelling asset for traders and investors alike. As always, prudent risk management and a well-defined strategy are essential in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Sat, 12 Jul 2025 03:04:14 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

Executive Summary\nBinance Coin (BNB) has recently crossed the $700 threshold, fueled by a wave of positive developments and strong technical momentum. Key drivers include the extension of BNB Chain's zero-fee event, institutional adoption through the BNB Treasury Company, technical advancements such as the Maxwell upgrade, and Binance’s 32nd quarterly token burn. With a strong bullish trend, BNB continues to position itself as a critical player in the crypto ecosystem, attracting institutional capital and retail investors alike.\n2. Recent Market Developments\nBNB Price Surpasses $700\nOn July 11, 2025, BNB's price broke a major resistance level, reaching $700 and marking a 6.38% increase over the past week. This milestone reflects growing investor confidence and aligns with broader market optimism around BNB.\nZero-Fee Carnival Extended\nThe BNB Chain extended its \"Zero Fee Carnival\" event until July 31, 2025. This initiative, which eliminates gas fees for USDT and USD1 transactions, has enhanced user engagement and transaction volume, bolstering BNB's utility and adoption.\nInstitutional Adoption Gains Momentum\nThe BNB Treasury Company announced its plans to list on a major U.S. stock exchange, creating a regulated pathway for institutional investors to access the BNB ecosystem. This development, coupled with Nano Labs' $1 billion BNB acquisition plan, underscores growing confidence in BNB as an institutional-grade digital asset.\nTechnical Advancements Strengthen BNB Chain\nThe Maxwell upgrade to the BNB Smart Chain, completed earlier this month, has doubled transaction throughput and reduced block times to 0.75 seconds. These improvements have significantly boosted network efficiency, making the BNB Chain more attractive for dApps and institutional-grade financial instruments.\nStrategic Partnerships\nKraken and Backed Finance partnered with BNB Chain to launch tokenized stocks (xStocks), providing users with access to tokenized versions of U.S.-listed equities and ETFs. This further expands BNB's utility and positions the chain as a hub for real-world asset tokenization.\nBNB Token Burn\nBinance completed its 32nd quarterly token burn, removing over 1.59 million BNB from circulation. This deflationary measure, valued at approximately $1.07 million, enhances scarcity and supports long-term price appreciation.\n3. Technical Analysis\nCurrent Price: $693.11\nBNB is trading just below its recent high of $700, reflecting strong bullish momentum.\nMoving Averages:\n- Short-term SMAs (7, 20, 50) and EMAs (12, 26) indicate a clear upward trend, with all values above $657.\n- The 200-day SMA at $640.52 confirms the long-term bullish sentiment.\nMomentum Indicators:\n- RSI(14): 68.85, nearing overbought territory but indicating strong momentum.\n- MACD: Positive at 9.1789, with a histogram of 4.4166, signaling sustained bullish pressure.\n- Stochastic %K: 92.28, suggesting overbought conditions but no immediate reversal signals.\nBollinger Bands:\n- BNB is trading above its upper Bollinger Band ($689.06), reflecting strong bullish sentiment and a potential breakout.\nSupport and Resistance Levels:\n- Immediate Resistance: $697.24 and $697.73.\n- Key Support Levels: $691.06 (pivot), $615.05, and $601.25.\n4. Trading Strategy and Signals\nShort-Term Strategy:\nTraders can look for a breakout above $697.73 to target the next psychological milestone at $750. Tight stop-loss orders around $686 are advised to manage downside risk.\nLong-Term Strategy:\nWith strong fundamentals and institutional adoption, BNB remains a solid hold for long-term investors. Accumulating positions near support levels ($615-$640) could offer attractive entry points.\nSignals to Watch:\n- Sustained trading volume above $170 million.\n- RSI breaking above 70, indicating further bullish momentum.\n- MACD divergence or weakening histograms could signal a potential correction.\n5. Price Predictions and Outlook\nIn the short term, BNB looks poised to test its 52-week high of $749.72, supported by strong market sentiment and technical indicators. Institutional adoption via the BNB Treasury Company and tokenized stocks on BNB Chain could drive further demand. Over the next 3-6 months, BNB may target $800, provided macroeconomic and regulatory conditions remain favorable.\n6. Risk Analysis\nWhile BNB exhibits strong bullish momentum, several risks remain:\n- Regulatory Scrutiny: Binance's ongoing regulatory challenges could impact market sentiment.\n- Market Volatility: Crypto markets are inherently volatile, and a broader market correction could affect BNB's price.\n- Overbought Conditions: Technical indicators like RSI and Stochastic suggest the possibility of short-term price corrections.\n7. Conclusion\nBNB’s recent surge past $700 highlights its growing prominence in the cryptocurrency market. With robust technical developments, strategic partnerships, and increasing institutional adoption, BNB is well-positioned for continued growth. However, traders and investors should remain cautious and monitor key technical levels and regulatory developments.\nBNB remains a compelling asset for both short-term trading and long-term investment, with a strong outlook heading into the second half of 2025.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Sat, 12 Jul 2025 03:00:14 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

This recent performance reflects a weak bullish trend, supported by favorable short-term moving averages and momentum indicators. However, the broader technical picture remains cautious, with DOT trading significantly below its 200-day SMA of $4.72. This article examines Polkadot’s recent market developments, technical indicators, and provides actionable trading recommendations for investors.\nRecent Market Developments\nOver the past week, Polkadot has caught traders’ attention following a 10% recovery from its 52-week low of $3.15, driven by increased trading volume of $38.3M in the last 24 hours. The recent surge correlates with growing interest in Polkadot’s parachain auctions and ecosystem developments, which continue to expand despite challenging macroeconomic conditions in the crypto market.\nOn-chain metrics also reveal increased activity in DOT staking, signaling investor confidence in the long-term potential of the project. However, broader market sentiment remains cautious, as Polkadot struggles to reclaim its 200-day SMA level of $4.72, which aligns with its long-term bearish trend.\nTechnical Analysis\nKey Metrics Summary:\n- Current Price: $3.93\n- 24h Change: +7.61%\n- 24h High/Low: $4.02 / $3.62\n- 24h Volume: $38,326,008\n- Trend: Weak Bullish\nMoving Averages:\n- Short-Term Strength: The SMA7 ($3.57) and SMA20 ($3.45) indicate strong support for the current price.\n- Medium-Term Weakness: The SMA_50 ($3.81) is slightly below the price, showing potential for continued upward momentum.\n- Long-Term Resistance: The SMA_200 ($4.72) highlights a major obstacle for broader recovery.\nMomentum Indicators:\n- RSI (14): At 61.57, RSI suggests DOT is approaching overbought territory but still has room for upward movement.\n- MACD: The positive histogram (+0.0846) indicates strengthening short-term bullish momentum, but the MACD line remains below the signal, signaling caution.\n- Stochastic Oscillator: With %K at 88.90 and %D at 92.15, DOT is overbought in the short term, increasing the likelihood of a near-term pullback.\nBollinger Bands:\n- DOT is trading above the Bollinger Band upper limit ($3.82), with a %B of 1.1560, indicating overextension and potential resistance at $4.02.\nKey Levels:\n- Resistance 1: $4.02 (short-term target).\n- Resistance 2: $5.12 (long-term breakout level).\n- Support 1: $3.62 (recent low).\n- Support 2: $3.01 (critical 52-week low).\nTrading Strategy and Signals\nBased on the technical indicators and recent price movements, here’s an actionable trading strategy:\nShort-Term (1-7 Days):\n- Buy Opportunities: Accumulate DOT on dips near $3.62, as this level has proven to be a strong support zone.\n- Profit Targets: Target $4.02 in the short term; a breakout above this level could trigger a move toward $4.50.\n- Stop Loss: Set a stop-loss at $3.50 to manage downside risk.\nMedium-Term (1-4 Weeks):\n- Hold Strategy: If DOT sustains above $4.02, consider holding positions for potential gains toward the $5.12 resistance.\n- Caution: Failure to break $4.02 in the coming days could lead to consolidation or a retest of $3.50.\nLong-Term (1-6 Months):\n- Risk Management: DOT remains in a long-term bearish trend, with the SMA_200 at $4.72 acting as a critical resistance level. Avoid heavy accumulation until the price stabilizes above this level.\nPrice Predictions and Outlook\nPolkadot’s weak bullish trend suggests limited upside potential in the near term, barring significant positive news or ecosystem advancements. Here’s an outlook based on current data:\n- Short-Term (Next 7 Days): $3.85 - $4.20 (range-bound with breakout potential).\n- Medium-Term (1-2 Months): $3.50 - $5.00 (dependent on breaking $4.02 resistance).\n- Long-Term (6-12 Months): $3.00 - $6.00, with the possibility of retesting the 52-week low in bearish scenarios.\nRisk Analysis\nWhile Polkadot shows signs of recovery, the overall crypto market remains volatile. Key risks include:\n- Macro Factors: Regulatory developments and interest rate changes could negatively impact crypto sentiment.\n- Resistance Levels: Failure to break $4.02 could lead to a retest of $3.50 or lower.\n- Overbought Indicators: Momentum indicators suggest a short-term pullback is likely before further gains.\nConclusion\nPolkadot’s recent price surge to $3.93 reflects a weak bullish trend supported by short-term technical strength. However, the resistance at $4.02 remains a critical hurdle for sustained upside. Traders should focus on short-term accumulation near $3.62 with tight risk management, while long-term investors should wait for a decisive breakout above $4.72 for confirmation of a trend reversal.\nPolkadot’s ecosystem remains promising, but the broader market conditions warrant caution.

A reading above 70 could trigger selling pressure.\n- MACD: Positive histogram (+0.0181) indicates strengthening bullish momentum, though the MACD line remains close to the signal line.\n- Stochastic Oscillator: %K at 99.88 and %D at 97.34 suggest overbought conditions, cautioning traders to watch for a potential reversal.\nBollinger Bands\n- Upper Band: $0.67\n- Middle Band: $0.59\n- Lower Band: $0.51\n- %B: 1.2629, signaling price is well above the upper band, often a precursor to short-term retracement.\nKey Levels\n- Resistance 1: $0.71 (current price level)\n- Resistance 2: $0.84 (next major obstacle)\n- Support 1: $0.51 (key downside level)\n- Pivot: $0.68\nTrend Analysis\nThe current trend is weak bullish, supported by short-term indicators but limited by the SMA_200 and overbought momentum readings.\nTrading Strategy and Signals\nBullish Scenario\nIf ADA breaks above $0.71 with strong volume, the next target will be $0.84, representing a 17% upside from current levels. Traders should look for confirmation of a breakout with RSI moving above 70 and MACD widening its positive signal.\nActionable Signal: Buy on a confirmed break above $0.71, with a tight stop-loss at $0.67 to manage downside risks.\nBearish Scenario\nIf ADA fails to hold above $0.68, it may retrace to test the $0.64 SMA_50 or even $0.51, which offers strong support. Overbought stochastic levels reinforce the likelihood of a short-term pullback.\nActionable Signal: Sell if ADA closes below $0.68, targeting $0.64 or $0.51, with a stop-loss at $0.72.\nPrice Predictions and Outlook\n- Short-Term: ADA is likely to consolidate between $0.68 and $0.71, with a breakout above $0.71 leading to $0.84.\n- Mid-Term: Sustained bullish momentum could see ADA challenge the SMA_200 at $0.75, a critical threshold for reversing the long-term trend.\n- Long-Term: A break above $0.84 opens the door to $1.00, though failure to maintain upward momentum could see a retest of $0.51.\nRisk Analysis\nWhile ADA's recent rally is encouraging, several risks must be considered:\n1. Overbought Conditions: RSI and stochastic indicators suggest a pullback is likely in the short term.\n2. Low Trading Volumes: Modest volume ($144.5 million) raises questions about the sustainability of the current rally.\n3. Macro Factors: Broader crypto market sentiment remains fragile, with potential regulatory and macroeconomic headwinds.\nTraders should remain cautious and adapt to evolving market conditions, using stop-losses and avoiding overleveraging.\nConclusion\nCardano's recent surge to $0.71 marks a significant milestone, but the path forward is uncertain. Weak bullish momentum, combined with overbought conditions, suggests a delicate balance between further gains and potential retracement. Traders should monitor key levels at $0.71 and $0.68 for actionable signals while keeping an eye on market sentiment and volume.\nFor now, ADA remains a promising asset for short-term traders, but caution is advised as the market could swing either way.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 08:46:29 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

This price action follows a period of consolidation, with LTC now testing key resistance levels. Technical indicators suggest a weak but growing bullish trend, supported by rising momentum and increased trading volume ($60.9M in 24h). This article provides a detailed analysis of Litecoin's price action, technical indicators, and actionable trading strategies for short- and medium-term investors.\nRecent Market Developments\nOver the past week, Litecoin has experienced renewed interest following the broader cryptocurrency market's recovery. Several factors have contributed to LTC's recent upward momentum:\n- Increased Adoption: Litecoin's use as a payment method continues to grow, particularly among merchants seeking fast and low-cost transactions.\n- Halving Event Anticipation: With the next Litecoin halving just weeks away, investor interest is rising in anticipation of reduced LTC supply and potential price appreciation.\n- Market Sentiment: The overall crypto market sentiment has shifted bullish, with Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the charge. This has positively impacted Litecoin, often viewed as a \"silver to Bitcoin's gold.\"\nDespite these positive developments, Litecoin faces stiff resistance at key levels as it attempts to sustain its upward trajectory.\nTechnical Analysis\nCurrent Price and Key Metrics\n- Current Price: $95.11\n- 24h Change: +4.23%\n- 24h High/Low: $96.58 / $90.27\n- 24h Volume: $60,907,910\nMoving Averages\n- Short-Term Momentum: The 7-day SMA ($89.90) and 20-day SMA ($86.99) indicate strong short-term momentum, with LTC trading above these averages.\n- Long-Term Outlook: The 200-day SMA ($97.76) acts as a key resistance level, signaling that a breakout above $97.76 could confirm a medium-term bullish trend.\nMomentum Indicators\n- RSI (14): At 64.99, RSI suggests bullish momentum, though LTC is approaching overbought territory.\n- MACD: The MACD (1.3555) and Signal Line (0.2188) are in bullish alignment, with a positive histogram (1.1366) indicating strong buying pressure.\n- Stochastic Oscillator: With %K at 89.64 and %D at 89.73, LTC is in overbought conditions, signaling a potential short-term pullback.\nBollinger Bands\n- %B: At 1.0910, LTC is trading above the upper Bollinger Band ($93.86), further confirming strong bullish momentum. However, this also suggests a potential retracement as prices consolidate.\nKey Levels\n- Resistance 1: $96.58\n- Resistance 2: $102.94\n- Support 1: $93.99 (Pivot)\n- Support 2: $76.17\nTrading Strategy and Signals\nShort-Term Strategy\n- Bullish Breakout: A sustained close above $96.58 could trigger a move toward the next resistance at $102.94. Traders should consider entering long positions with a stop-loss below $93.99.\n- Potential Pullback: If LTC fails to break the $96.58 resistance, a retracement toward $93.99 or the 7-day SMA ($89.90) is likely. This could offer a buying opportunity for swing traders.\nMedium-Term Strategy\n- Key Resistance at $97.76: A breakout above the 200-day SMA ($97.76) would confirm a medium-term bullish trend, targeting $102.94 and beyond.\n- Risk Management: Traders should monitor the RSI and Stochastic indicators for signs of overbought conditions, which could precede a pullback.\nPrice Predictions and Outlook\nLitecoin’s technical setup suggests a bullish outlook in the short and medium term. If LTC breaks above $96.58 and sustains momentum, it could target $102.94 in the coming weeks. Beyond this, a breakout above the 52-week high of $137.04 would require sustained buying pressure and favorable market conditions.\nHowever, a failure to break key resistance could see LTC consolidate within the $93.99–$96.58 range, or retrace toward the $89.90 support level.\nRisk Analysis\nWhile Litecoin shows signs of bullish momentum, several risks could impact its price trajectory:\n- Market Volatility: The crypto market remains highly volatile, with sudden price swings that could impact LTC’s momentum.\n- Overbought Conditions: Indicators like RSI and Stochastic suggest LTC is nearing overbought territory, increasing the likelihood of a short-term pullback.\n- Macro Factors: Broader economic conditions, including regulatory developments or shifts in investor sentiment, could dampen Litecoin’s performance.\nConclusion\nLitecoin is currently showing promising signs of a bullish breakout, supported by rising momentum and favorable technical indicators. Traders should watch the $96.58 resistance closely, as a breakout could lead to significant upside potential. However, overbought conditions and key resistance levels demand caution. Strategic entries with tight stop-losses are recommended to capitalize on potential gains while minimizing risk.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 08:45:29 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

Key price targets include:\n- Short-Term: $2.75-$2.85 (with strong resistance at $3.00).\n- Medium-Term: $3.10-$3.20, potentially testing the 52-week high of $3.29.\nFactors driving this outlook include Ripple's growing adoption, institutional interest, and broader bullish sentiment in the crypto market.\nRisk Analysis\nWhile XRP's outlook is optimistic, traders should remain cautious of the following risks:\n- Overbought Conditions: RSI and Stochastic indicators suggest the possibility of short-term consolidation or a minor pullback.\n- Macro Risks: Adverse macroeconomic factors, such as interest rate hikes or regulatory uncertainties, could dampen market sentiment.\n- Resistance at $2.60: Failure to break this level could result in a retracement towards $2.40 or lower.\nRisk management strategies, such as stop-loss placement and position sizing, are crucial in navigating market volatility.\nConclusion\nRipple (XRP) is riding a strong bullish wave, with its current price of $2.59 reflecting both market confidence and technical strength.

This surge is fueled by institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, favorable U.S. regulatory developments, and a growing alignment between crypto and tech markets. With technical indicators signaling strong bullish momentum and price predictions suggesting more upside potential, Bitcoin continues to dominate the cryptocurrency landscape.\nRecent Market Developments\n-\nBitcoin Surpasses $118,000\nBitcoin reached a new all-time high on July 11, 2025, driven by substantial institutional inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. This milestone reflects increased confidence in Bitcoin as an investment asset, with prices peaking at $118,856 before slightly retreating. -\nU.S. House of Representatives to Discuss Crypto Bills\nThe U.S. government is debating key legislation, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation and the CLARITY Act for broader cryptocurrency oversight. Positive outcomes could provide regulatory clarity, boosting institutional adoption and long-term price stability. -\nTech-Crypto Supercycle and ETF Inflows\nBitcoin's rally is supported by its growing correlation with tech stocks like Nvidia, alongside optimism about Federal Reserve rate cuts. This \"tech-crypto supercycle\" strengthens Bitcoin's position as a hedge against inflation and a high-growth asset. -\nAnalyst Predicts $168,000 Bitcoin\nTechnical analysis and market momentum suggest Bitcoin could reach $135,000 in the short term and $168,000 within the next 12-18 months.

This policy shift has boosted investor confidence, accelerating Bitcoin's upward trajectory. -\n$1 Billion in Short Liquidations\nBitcoin’s rapid surge led to over $1 billion in liquidations across the crypto market, with $570 million in BTC shorts wiped out. This high liquidation volume reflects strong bullish sentiment and a \"short squeeze\" dynamic, pushing prices higher. -\nSecurity Concerns and Exchange Developments\nDespite Bitcoin’s bullish momentum, the broader blockchain industry remains vulnerable to hacks, with $2.4 billion in losses reported in H1 2025. Additionally, Binance’s delisting of five altcoins highlights the challenges smaller projects face in maintaining liquidity and relevance.\nTechnical Analysis\n- Current Price: $117,851.24\n- 24h Change: +3.88%\n- 24h High/Low: $118,869.98 / $113,385.36\n- 24h Volume: $4.08 billion\nMoving Averages:\n- Short-term (SMA7): $111,383.30 indicates strong upward momentum.\n- Long-term (SMA200): $96,812.63 confirms the bullish trend.\nMomentum Indicators:\n- RSI(14): 73.48 (Overbought but bullish).\n- MACD: 943.32 histogram reflects strengthening bullish momentum.\n- Stochastic Oscillator: %K at 92.60 suggests overbought conditions but no immediate reversal signals.\nBollinger Bands:\n- Bitcoin trades above the upper band ($115,391.10), indicating strong bullish pressure.\nKey Levels:\n- Resistance: $118,869.98 remains a critical level.\n- Support: $98,200.00 provides a strong safety net for retracement.\nTrading Strategy and Signals\n-\nShort-Term Strategy\n- Buy Dips: Traders should consider buying during minor pullbacks toward the $116,000-$117,000 range.\n- Take Profits: Target $120,000 as the next psychological resistance.\n-\nMomentum Trading\n- Utilize the RSI and MACD indicators to confirm bullish momentum.

Traders should prepare for potential dips toward the $100,000-$110,000 range.\nConclusion\nBitcoin's new all-time high of $118,856 showcases its growing appeal as a resilient and high-growth asset. Institutional inflows into ETFs, favorable regulatory developments, and strong technical indicators suggest the rally has more room to run. While risks persist, Bitcoin’s trajectory toward $135,000 and beyond appears increasingly probable, making it a compelling investment for both traders and long-term investors.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 20:43:14 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

With a 24-hour trading volume of $25.55 million and bullish momentum indicators, OP is consolidating near its pivot level of $0.58. This analysis evaluates recent developments, technical signals, and actionable trading strategies to capitalize on potential market movements.\nRecent Market Developments\nOver the past week, Optimism has garnered attention due to its expanding ecosystem and increasing adoption of Layer-2 solutions. The protocol recently announced upgrades aimed at reducing transaction fees and improving scalability, further solidifying its position in the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, the growing adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Optimism has driven increased network activity, contributing to the surge in trading volume.\nInvestor sentiment has been buoyed by the platform’s commitment to enhancing user experience and partnerships with leading DeFi protocols. However, broader market uncertainty and macroeconomic concerns are limiting upside potential in the short term.\nTechnical Analysis\nPrice Overview\n- Current Price: $0.59\n- 24h High/Low: $0.60 / $0.55\n- 24h Change: +6.67%\n- 52-Week Range: $0.49 - $2.67\nMoving Averages\n- Short-Term Averages (SMA7, SMA20, EMA12, EMA26): OP is trading above its short-term moving averages, signaling bullish momentum.\n- Long-Term Averages (SMA50, SMA200): The price remains below the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, reflecting a bearish long-term trend.\nMomentum Indicators\n- RSI(14): 53.49 (neutral, but leaning toward bullish territory).\n- MACD: The histogram shows a positive divergence (+0.0090), suggesting growing bullish momentum.\n- Stochastic Oscillator (%K: 70.19, %D: 55.13): Indicates the asset is nearing overbought territory, warranting caution.\nBollinger Bands\n- Upper Band: $0.60\n- Lower Band: $0.49\n- %B: 0.8886 (price is approaching the upper band, indicating potential resistance at $0.60).\nKey Levels\n- Resistance: $0.62 (R1), $0.84 (R2)\n- Pivot: $0.58\n- Support: $0.55 (S1), $0.46 (S2)\nVolatility\nThe ATR(14) at $0.04 suggests moderate price volatility, providing room for intraday trading opportunities.\nTrading Strategy and Signals\nShort-Term Strategy\n- Bullish Outlook: A breakout above $0.62 could trigger a rally toward $0.84, especially if volume supports the move. Traders can consider entering long positions above $0.62 with a stop-loss at $0.57.\n- Bearish Outlook: A failure to sustain above the pivot level of $0.58 may lead to a retracement toward $0.55 or lower. In this case, short positions can be initiated below $0.57, targeting $0.46.\nIndicators to Watch\n- Monitor RSI for overbought conditions above 60.\n- Keep an eye on MACD divergence for confirmation of bullish or bearish trends.\n- Use Bollinger Bands to assess breakout or reversal potential.\nPrice Predictions and Outlook\nOptimism’s current trend suggests neutral-to-bullish momentum in the short term. If OP breaks past the resistance at $0.62, it could test $0.84 in the coming weeks. However, the long-term downtrend (SMA_200 at $0.99) remains a significant barrier for sustained rallies.\nFor the remainder of July, OP is likely to trade in the range of $0.55 to $0.62 unless a major catalyst shifts market sentiment.\nRisk Analysis\nWhile Optimism shows promising short-term momentum, several risks must be considered: - Macro Risks: Broader market conditions, including potential rate hikes, could dampen bullish sentiment.\n- Technical Risks: Failure to break above $0.62 may lead to a bearish pullback, particularly if trading volume declines.\n- Network Risks: Competition among Layer-2 solutions could impact Optimism’s market share.\nTraders should implement strict risk management strategies, including stop-loss orders and position sizing.\nConclusion\nOptimism (OP) presents an intriguing opportunity for traders, with its current price of $0.59 reflecting strong short-term momentum.

This burn saw the removal of 1,595,599.78 BNB from circulation, including 129.10 BNB from the Pioneer Burn program, valued at approximately $1.024 billion USD. This action brings the remaining total supply to 139,289,513.94 BNB, according to the BNB Chain blog.\nUnderstanding the BNB Burn\nBNB, the native coin of the BNB Chain ecosystem, plays a crucial role in the Web3 environment, facilitating transactions on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC), opBNB L2s, and BNB Greenfield blockchain. Beyond its transactional use, BNB serves as a governance token, enabling holders to participate in the decentralized on-chain governance of the BNB Chain. It also functions as a strategic reserve asset, attracting attention from mainstream financial institutions and driving ecosystem growth.\nSince its transition from the Ethereum Network to the BNB Chain following its mainnet launch on April 18, 2019, BNB has embraced the philosophy of \"Build and Build.\" The Auto-Burn system is a key feature, designed to gradually decrease BNB's total supply to 100,000,000, with adjustments based on BNB's price and the number of blocks generated on BSC each quarter.\nMechanics of the BNB Auto Burn\nThe BNB Auto-Burn is an independently auditable process, with figures reported quarterly, independent of the Binance centralized exchange. This quarter's burn and future burns will occur directly on BSC due to the BNB Chain Fusion, with the burned BNB sent to a \"blackhole\" address: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD.\nRecent upgrades, namely the Lorentz and Maxwell Upgrades, have increased the frequency of block production on BSC, necessitating adjustments to the Auto Burn formula to maintain its intended spirit and function.\nReal-time and Pioneer Burn Programs\nIn addition to the quarterly burns, BNB employs a real-time burning mechanism based on gas fees. BSC validators determine the ratio of gas fees collected in each block, which is then burned at a fixed rate. Since the introduction of BEP95, this mechanism has resulted in the burning of approximately 265,000 BNB.\nThe Pioneer Burn Program further supports the ecosystem by helping users recover lost BNB and pegged tokens due to honest mistakes, integrating these recoveries into the quarterly burn events.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 01:05:29 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Sees Supply Tightening Amid Accumulation and Volatility Trends", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/bitcoin-btc-supply-tightening-accumulation-volatility-trends", "text": "Bitcoin's market dynamics are currently shaped by strong accumulation pressures and a tightening supply side, according to the latest insights from Glassnode. As investors increasingly favor holding over selling, the market is experiencing a subtle yet significant build-up in volatility, both on-chain and in derivatives markets.\nAccumulation Trends and Supply Dynamics\nInvestors are showing a marked preference for accumulation, with Long-Term Holder (LTH) supply reaching new highs. Notably, small to mid-sized investors, categorized as Shrimp (<1 BTC), Crabs (1–10 BTC), and Fish (10–100 BTC), are collectively acquiring over 19.3k BTC per month. This rate significantly surpasses the monthly issuance of 13.4k BTC, indicating a tightening in Bitcoin's supply.\nAccording to Glassnode, this behavior suggests a strong belief among investors in the value proposition of Bitcoin at current price levels, encouraging them to hold rather than distribute their holdings. This trend is further evidenced by the growing LTH supply, which is outpacing the new coin issuance rate, signaling a general tightening of the supply-side dynamics.\nVolatility Indications Across Markets\nDespite a relatively stable price range, volatility expectations are increasingly compressing, suggesting potential for future price swings. Realized Volatility metrics show a contraction across multiple timeframes, indicating that the market is coiling within a narrow consolidation range. Historically, such compressions have preceded significant market movements.\nAdditionally, At-the-Money Implied Volatility (ATM IV) in options markets has declined, suggesting that traders are not anticipating immediate high volatility. However, past patterns indicate that subdued volatility expectations can often precede sharp market moves, serving as a contrarian signal.\nETF Market Impact\nDespite a recent slowdown in ETF inflows, the total Assets Under Management (AUM) across U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs has reached a new all-time high of $137 billion. BlackRock's IBIT continues to dominate the market, holding 55% of the total AUM, with Fidelity and Grayscale following at 16.2% and 14.7%, respectively. This dominance is partly due to BlackRock's overwhelming lead in the options market.\nThe rising ETF AUM reflects the sustained institutional interest in Bitcoin as a regulated investment vehicle. The increasing share of Bitcoin's market cap held by ETFs underscores the asset's growing integration with traditional financial markets.\nOverall, the combination of tightening supply, accumulation trends, and volatility compression suggests that the Bitcoin market is poised for significant movements. The evolving landscape of institutional investment through ETFs further highlights Bitcoin's maturation as a financial asset.\nFor more detailed insights, the full report is available on Glassnode.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 08:30:29 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

{"title": "AI-Powered Climate Models: Revolutionizing Climate Forecasting with ClimSim-Online", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/ai-powered-climate-models-revolutionizing-climate-forecasting", "text": "In a significant advancement for climate science, NVIDIA, in collaboration with international climate modelers, has unveiled ClimSim-Online, a groundbreaking framework that combines machine learning with traditional climate simulations. This innovative approach promises to enhance the speed and accuracy of climate forecasts, a crucial development in the race to understand and mitigate climate change impacts, according to NVIDIA's blog.\nAdvancing Climate Simulations\nTraditional climate simulators often struggle to capture small-scale processes such as thunderstorms due to computational limits. To overcome this, scientists use cloud-resolving models (CRMs), which, although detailed, are computationally expensive. ClimSim-Online offers a solution by distilling the insights from these detailed simulations into a machine learning model that operates significantly faster without sacrificing fidelity.\nClimSim-Online: A Hybrid Approach\nDeveloped by NVIDIA's Earth 2 and supported by a National Science Foundation-funded center at Columbia University, ClimSim-Online leverages the award-winning ClimSim dataset. This dataset, hosted on the ClimSim Hugging Face repository, was created using the Energy Exascale Earth System Model-Multiscale Modeling Framework (E3SM-MMF). The framework embeds thousands of localized CRMs within a host climate model, reducing assumptions about fine-scale physics.\nMachine Learning Integration\nClimSim-Online enables the integration of machine learning models into climate simulators, offering a reproducible, containerized workflow. This allows scientists to bypass traditional computational barriers, making hybrid climate modeling accessible to a broader audience. Users can deploy their trained ML models on various platforms, including local workstations, HPC clusters, and cloud VMs.\nBreakthrough in Climate Modeling\nThe framework has already facilitated a global Kaggle competition, attracting over 460 teams to develop machine learning solutions using the high-fidelity climate dataset. This collaborative effort has accelerated progress in climate modeling, enabling the development of stable, multi-year hybrid simulations using a U-Net neural network trained on the ClimSim dataset.\nPhysics-Informed Machine Learning\nTo ensure the accuracy and stability of these simulations, NVIDIA incorporated microphysical constraints directly into the neural network architecture. This approach prevents unrealistic cloud behavior and stabilizes simulations, improving cloud climatologies' realism, particularly in the tropics.\nClimSim-Online represents a significant step forward in climate science, lowering the barrier for collaboration between AI researchers and climate scientists. While the framework has demonstrated its potential, ongoing research is needed to further reduce hybrid modeling biases and explore new solutions, such as reinforcement learning, to enhance climate simulation accuracy.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 13:33:29 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

With trading volume surging to $33.66 million and key momentum indicators signaling a weak bullish trend, ARB is showing signs of potential upside in the short term. However, critical resistance levels and broader market conditions will determine whether this move can sustain or reverse.\nRecent Market Developments\nIn the past week, Arbitrum has been the subject of increased investor interest due to its growing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The recent uptick in trading volume (+5.93% in 24 hours) reflects renewed confidence in layer-2 scaling solutions amidst Ethereum’s congestion challenges. Additionally, the token has remained resilient near its key support level of $0.35, indicating strong buyer activity.\nArbitrum's ecosystem growth continues to be a talking point, with new DeFi protocols launching on the network and existing projects migrating to leverage its scalability. This foundational growth has contributed to short-term bullish sentiment, despite ARB's overall weak performance over the past 12 months.\nTechnical Analysis\nPrice Overview:\n- Current Price: $0.36\n- 24h High/Low: $0.36 / $0.34\n- 24h Volume: $33,661,592 (+5.93%)\nMoving Averages:\n- SMA_7: $0.34 (Bullish crossover with price)\n- SMA_20: $0.32 (Price above SMA, signaling upward momentum)\n- SMA_50: $0.34 (Neutral, aligns with short-term trend)\n- SMA_200: $0.44 (Bearish divergence, long-term downtrend persists)\n- EMA_12: $0.34\n- EMA_26: $0.33\nMomentum Indicators:\n- RSI (14): 57.10 (Neutral to slightly bullish, momentum is building but not overbought)\n- MACD Histogram: 0.0048 (Bullish divergence, positive momentum gaining strength)\n- Stochastic %K/%D: 66.23 / 58.55 (Trending upwards, but not yet in overbought territory)\nBollinger Bands:\n- Upper Band: $0.38\n- Middle Band: $0.32\n- Lower Band: $0.27\n- %B: 0.8375 (Price near the upper band, indicating strong upward momentum)\nKey Levels:\n- Resistance 1: $0.39 (Immediate resistance)\n- Resistance 2: $0.44 (Major barrier, aligns with SMA_200)\n- Pivot: $0.35 (Current price above pivot, bullish bias)\n- Support 1 & 2: $0.25 (Strong demand zone)\nTrend Overview:\nThe short-term trend is weak bullish, driven by the recent breakout above the SMA20 and the bullish MACD crossover. However, the long-term trend remains bearish, as the price is still significantly below the SMA200 and its 52-week high of $1.17.\nTrading Strategy and Signals\nShort-Term Strategy:\n- Buy Zone: $0.34–$0.36\n- Take-Profit Levels: $0.39 (Resistance 1), $0.44 (Resistance 2)\n- Stop-Loss: $0.33 (Below EMA_26 and recent lows)\nThe current price action suggests a potential for short-term gains as ARB tests its immediate resistance at $0.39. Traders should consider entering long positions near the $0.34–$0.36 range, targeting $0.39 initially. A breakout above $0.39 could open the door to $0.44, but caution is warranted given the RSI's approach to overbought levels.\nLong-Term Strategy:\nArbitrum’s long-term downtrend remains intact, with the SMA_200 at $0.44 acting as a major resistance barrier. Long-term investors should wait for a decisive move above this level before accumulating positions, as the token’s 52-week range ($0.26–$1.17) indicates significant volatility.\nPrice Predictions and Outlook\n- Bullish Case: If ARB breaks above $0.39 in the coming days, expect a rally toward $0.44, driven by increasing momentum and strong buyer activity.

Bitcoin is up nearly 3% over the past 24 hours, currently trading just above $111,100, briefly touching $12,000 to hit a fresh all-time high.[4] The cryptocurrency is maintaining its position near record highs as institutional adoption continues to accelerate.\nRecent Market Developments\nThe crypto market has been energized by several key developments this week. They've also found favor with traditional finance; spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund net inflows in 2025 have totaled $14.4 billion through July 3[1], indicating sustained institutional interest.\nPolicy Catalysts Driving Momentum\nJuly is shaping up to be a potentially volatile month for bitcoin, driven by Trump administration's policies[7]. Three critical dates are shaping market sentiment:\n- July 9 Tariff Deadline: Another key date looming is the July 9 tariff deadline, which could see more aggressive trade posturing from Trump[7]\n- July 22 Crypto Executive Order: July 22 is the final deadline for action on long-awaited crypto executive order, with potential updates on the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve[7]\n- Budget Bill Impact: The bill, which could widen the U.S. deficit by $3.3 trillion, is seen by some as bullish for scarce assets like BTC[7]\nStrategic Bitcoin Reserve Foundation\nThe establishment of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve continues to provide long-term bullish sentiment. With a fixed supply of 21 million coins, there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The United States currently holds a significant amount of bitcoin but has not maximized its strategic position as a unique store of value in the global financial system[6].\nTechnical Analysis: Strong Bullish Setup\nPrice Action and Key Levels\n- Current Price: $110,988.93\n- 24h Range: $108,503.00 - $111,999.79\n- 24h Volume: $2.08 billion\n- Trend: Strong Bullish\nMoving Average Analysis\nThe moving average structure confirms the bullish momentum: - Price above all major MAs: BTC trades above SMA7 ($109,256), SMA20 ($107,377), and SMA_50 ($106,768) - Golden Cross intact: The 50-day MA remains well above the 200-day MA ($96,673), confirming the long-term uptrend\nMomentum Indicators\n- RSI (14): 61.41 - Healthy bullish momentum without overbought conditions\n- MACD: Bullish with histogram at 323.91, indicating strengthening momentum\n- Stochastic: %K at 85.35 suggests strong buying pressure\nBollinger Bands Assessment\n- Current Position: %B at 0.87 indicates BTC is trading in the upper portion of the band\n- Price: $110,988 vs Upper Band at $112,303 - room for further upside\n- Volatility: ATR at $2,378 suggests moderate volatility\nMarket Structure Analysis\nA steady stream of sales by long-time whales — miners, offshore funds and anonymous wallets — is being met almost one-for-one by demand from institutional players like ETFs, corporates and asset managers. The result: Bitcoin is struggling to break out of its record high around $110,000, volatility is evaporating, and its place in the investment landscape is being reshaped[5].\nThis redistribution from early holders to institutional players represents a maturation of the Bitcoin market, potentially providing a more stable foundation for future growth.\nTrading Recommendations\nBullish Scenario (Primary)\nEntry Range: $109,000 - $110,500 Target 1: $112,000 (Previous ATH) Target 2: $115,000 (Extension level) Stop Loss: $107,800\nRationale: - Strong technical setup with RSI room to run - Institutional buying pressure continues - Policy catalysts provide fundamental support\nRisk Management\n- Position size: 2-3% of portfolio maximum\n- Monitor July 9 and July 22 for volatility spikes\n- This suggests that the price is entering the exhaustion zone, hinting at a potential correction in the shorter term[8]\nAlternative Scenario\nIf BTC breaks below $108,500, expect pullback to $106,000-$107,000 support zone before resuming the uptrend.\nOutlook and Price Targets\nBitcoin price prediction for July 2025 is expected upside target of 2%-5% with a target of $110,500 by mid-July[7]. However, given the current price already exceeds this target, momentum could carry BTC toward $115,000-$120,000 in the near term.\nLong-term projections remain bullish, with By the end of 2025, we expect Bitcoin to have posted another record value of around $150,000, with a potential low of $60,000 acting as key support[1].\nKey Risks to Monitor\n- Seasonal Weakness: July historically being one of the quietest months, accounting for only 6.1% of the annual volume[8]\n- Overbought Conditions: Bitcoin's relative strength index, or RSI, displays near overbought conditions in four out of six timeframes[8]\n- Policy Uncertainty: Tariff decisions and crypto executive order outcomes\nConclusion\nBitcoin's current position at $110,988 represents a healthy consolidation near all-time highs, supported by strong institutional demand and favorable policy developments. The technical setup remains bullish, though traders should prepare for increased volatility around key policy dates. The long-term outlook remains exceptionally positive, with Bitcoin's role as a strategic reserve asset becoming increasingly recognized globally.\nThis analysis is for educational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

{"title": "Aptos (APT) Technical Analysis: Wyoming Stablecoin Partnership Fuels Bullish Momentum at $4.60", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250710-aptos-apt-technical-analysis-wyoming-stablecoin-partnership-fuels-bullish-momentum-at-460", "text": "Aptos (APT) Technical Analysis: Wyoming Stablecoin Partnership Fuels Bullish Momentum at $4.60\nAptos (APT) is capturing significant attention in the cryptocurrency market following its selection as the highest-ranking blockchain for Wyoming's groundbreaking WYST stablecoin project. With the token currently trading at $4.60, showing a modest +1.23% increase in the past 24 hours, traders and investors are closely monitoring whether this fundamental catalyst can drive sustained upward momentum.\nRecent News Analysis: Wyoming Partnership Drives Institutional Adoption\nWyoming's WYST Stablecoin Selection\nThe Wyoming Stable Token Commission has shortlisted Aptos and Sei for its stablecoin pilot program, giving Aptos the highest score among the more than 10 blockchains considered for its forthcoming WYST project. Aptos disclosed Friday that it received the highest marks based on the commission's network testing, scoring 32 points.[3] Solana received an identical score of 32 points, though it was not selected for the pilot phase.[3]\nThis is the first stablecoin backed by the US dollar and issued directly by the state government. Its launch is scheduled for August 20, 2025, coinciding with the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium.[6] This development represents a significant milestone in blockchain adoption by U.S. state governments.\nReal-World Usage at Expo 2025\nIn its first week alone, the Aptos wallet at this event has recorded more than 558,000 transactions and added 133,000 new accounts to the network.[4] This demonstrates Aptos' capability to handle high transaction volumes and drive user adoption in real-world applications.\nStaking Rewards Proposal\nAptos proposal would lower staking rewards from 7% to 3.79% over three months. Authors say lower rewards encourage users to pursue higher-yield, risk-based opportunities on-chain.[7] The proposal, submitted by a community member called MoonSheisty, aims at reducing reward yields from 7% to 3.79% in a three-month period, aligning Aptos staking rewards with other layer-1 blockchains and encouraging capital efficiency.[9]\nTechnical Analysis: Neutral Territory with Bullish Catalysts\nPrice Action and Moving Averages\nAt $4.60, APT is trading precisely at its 20-day SMA, indicating a critical inflection point. The token sits above its 7-day SMA of $4.49 and 12-day EMA of $4.58, suggesting short-term bullish momentum. However, it remains below the 50-day SMA of $4.76 and significantly below the 200-day SMA of $6.00, indicating longer-term bearish pressure.\nMomentum Indicators\nThe RSI reading of 49.01 places APT in neutral territory, neither oversold nor overbought. This suggests room for movement in either direction. The MACD at -0.0521 remains bearish, but the positive histogram of 0.0028 indicates potential momentum reversal.\nThe Stochastic indicators (%K: 31.73, %D: 28.65) suggest the token is approaching oversold conditions, which could present a buying opportunity if broader market sentiment improves.\nBollinger Bands Analysis\nWith a %B value of 0.4982, APT is trading near the middle of its Bollinger Bands, indicating balanced supply and demand. The upper band at $5.16 represents immediate resistance, while the lower band at $4.05 provides support.\nKey Support and Resistance Levels\nImmediate Resistance: $5.30 (R1) Strong Resistance: $5.99 (R2) Current Price: $4.60 (Pivot) Support Level: $3.75 (S1 & S2)\nThe 24-hour range of $4.50-$4.69 shows relatively tight consolidation, suggesting a potential breakout is imminent.\nTrading Recommendations\nFor Short-Term Traders (1-7 days)\nBuy Zone: $4.50-$4.55 Target 1: $5.16 (Bollinger Band upper) Target 2: $5.30 (Key resistance) Stop Loss: $4.35\nThe Wyoming stablecoin news provides fundamental support, while technical indicators suggest neutral to slightly bullish momentum. A break above $4.69 (24h high) could trigger a move toward $5.16.\nFor Medium-Term Investors (1-3 months)\nAccumulation Zone: $4.40-$4.70 Target 1: $6.00 (200-day SMA) Target 2: $7.50-$8.00 (based on historical resistance) Stop Loss: $3.75\nDue to this, the cryptocurrency could trade at an average price of $8.28 in 2025. At the minimum, it might not drop below $3.90, while the maximum Aptos price prediction for 2025 could be $14.46.[8]\nRisk Management\nGiven the 52-week low of $3.93 and high of $14.67, APT shows significant volatility. The ATR of $0.29 indicates moderate daily price swings, requiring careful position sizing.\nRisk Factors: - Potential selling pressure from staking rewards reduction - Broader crypto market uncertainty - Competition from other Layer-1 blockchains\nBullish Catalysts: - Wyoming WYST stablecoin launch in August 2025 - Growing institutional adoption - Strong technical fundamentals and transaction capacity\nMarket Outlook\nAnalysts see potential for SUI and APT to climb to $16 and $22, respectively, by year-end 2025, driven by increasing adoption, network growth, and improving market sentiment.[1] However, According to our Aptos forecast, the price of Aptos will decrease by -25.24% over the next month and reach $ 3.78 by July 10, 2025.[6]\nThe mixed analyst predictions highlight the importance of technical analysis and risk management in APT trading decisions.\nConclusion\nAptos presents a compelling opportunity at current levels, driven by significant institutional validation through Wyoming's stablecoin selection and strong technical fundamentals. The neutral RSI and improving MACD histogram suggest potential for upward movement, while the Wyoming partnership provides fundamental support.\nTraders should monitor the $4.69 resistance level for a potential breakout, while investors may consider accumulating in the $4.40-$4.70 range. The upcoming WYST stablecoin launch in August 2025 could serve as a major catalyst for price appreciation.\nDisclaimer: This analysis is for educational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

{"title": "Sei to Integrate Native USDC and CCTP V2 Enhancing Cross-Chain Liquidity", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/sei-integrates-native-usdc-cctp-v2", "text": "The Sei Development Foundation has announced a significant upgrade to its blockchain infrastructure with the integration of native USDC and CCTP V2. This move is expected to enhance the ecosystem's capability to facilitate seamless cross-chain value flows, according to a recent announcement by Sei.\nWhy This Matters\nSince the launch of Sei V2, the ecosystem has witnessed a remarkable 3691% surge in daily EVM transactions and a 794% increase in Total Value Locked (TVL). The introduction of native USDC is anticipated to propel Sei from a high-performance chain to a cross-chain liquidity hub, further expanding its capabilities.\nThis development is more than just integrating another stablecoin. It introduces significant infrastructure that enables cross-chain transfers across 13 blockchains with 1:1 capital efficiency, direct institutional on-ramps through Circle Mint for eligible users, and frictionless user experiences previously unattainable with bridged assets.\nImplications for Developers\nCurrently, USDC on Sei is available through Noble via IBC, which lacks the ERC-20 composability and regulatory features necessary for next-generation applications. The new upgrade will bring native USDC and CCTP V2 on Sei's EVM, providing access to the world's largest regulated stablecoin, full ERC-20 standard compatibility, and built-in cross-chain transfers via CCTP V2.\nThis integration is set to benefit developers building DeFi protocols, gaming economies, or payment rails, offering a stable foundation for users.\nThe Migration Path\nThe Sei Development Foundation, in collaboration with Circle, plans to facilitate a smooth transition from USDC for Sei via Noble to native USDC. While USDC for Sei via Noble will remain functional post-launch, a migration plan will be developed to gradually shift liquidity to the native USDC on Sei.\nLooking Forward\nSei aims to be more than just the fastest L1; it seeks to be a crucial infrastructure component for cross-chain finance. With features like sub-second finality and parallel execution, the integration of native USDC removes the last barriers between speed and liquidity.\nThe Sei Development Foundation encourages stakeholders to stay tuned for more details on the launch and integration guides. The upcoming changes promise a future where finance is not only fast but also interconnected.\nFor further details, visit the Sei blog.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 13:49:29 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

{"title": "Senate Banking Committee Highlights Regulatory Needs for Digital Assets", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/senate-banking-committee-highlights-regulatory-needs-for-digital-assets", "text": "In a significant session on Capitol Hill, the Senate Banking Committee convened to discuss the future of digital asset regulation. According to Chainalysis, the hearing underscored the growing recognition that while cryptocurrencies are here to stay, the regulatory frameworks governing them require substantial modernization.\nBlockchain's Traceability Highlighted\nSenator Tim Scott opened the hearing by affirming the permanence of blockchain technology, resonating with the insights of Jonathan Levin, Co-Founder and CEO of Chainalysis. Levin emphasized that blockchain is not a black box; rather, it is a transparent ledger that enables the tracing of transactions. He noted that less than 1% of crypto transactions are associated with illicit activities, which compares favorably to traditional financial systems. Chainalysis tools have been instrumental in helping over 350 public agencies to trace and recover approximately $12.4 billion in illicit funds.\nCall for Modern Compliance Frameworks\nLevin advocated for a reimagined oversight model that leverages blockchain's inherent transparency. He urged lawmakers to avoid fitting digital assets into outdated regulatory models and instead adopt frameworks that empower state and local governments with modern tools. This approach would allow regulators to adapt as the technology evolves, positioning the public ledger as a powerful tool for consumer protection.\nResource Needs for Local Agencies\nSenator Cortez Masto raised concerns about the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in tackling crypto crime. Levin responded that many local agencies lack the resources to effectively investigate such activities. However, he highlighted the potential of AI-powered tools and training to bridge this gap. Chainalysis is actively assisting jurisdictions in tracking diverse criminal activities, from scams to terrorist financing, emphasizing the necessity of investing in these capabilities.\nClarity Over Rigid Classifications\nThe hearing consistently echoed the need for a clear, principles-based regulatory approach. Industry leaders like Summer Mersinger, former CFTC Chair, and Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, argued against forcing digital assets into existing rigid frameworks. Timothy Massad, another former CFTC Chair, supported this view, advocating for flexible, coordinated oversight between regulatory bodies like the SEC and CFTC. He stressed that effective regulation must evolve alongside the dynamic nature of the crypto ecosystem.\nEmphasis on Public-Private Collaboration\nLevin concluded by highlighting the critical role of public-private partnerships in combating crypto-related crimes. Chainalysis has collaborated with global agencies to dismantle networks involved in child exploitation, ransomware, and terrorist financing. With smarter regulation and appropriate tools, the U.S. can not only participate in but lead the future of digital finance.\nAs revealed in the hearing, while there are divides in opinion, there is a shared acknowledgment that cryptocurrency has moved beyond the fringe. The pressing task is to craft a regulatory system that matches the innovation and forward-thinking of the technology itself.

{"title": "Comprehensive Guide to Building an AI Agent with LangChain", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/comprehensive-guide-building-ai-agent-langchain", "text": "In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, constructing effective AI agents is a subject of growing interest. According to LangChain, while many companies aspire to develop these agents, fewer have successfully implemented them. This guide outlines a comprehensive approach to building an AI agent, from initial concept to operational deployment.\nDefining the Agent's Role\nThe first step in creating an AI agent is to clearly define its role. LangChain suggests choosing a realistic task that could be taught to a smart intern. This task should be neither too trivial nor overly ambitious, ensuring it is well-scoped. Examples such as prioritizing urgent emails or scheduling meetings can serve as benchmarks for measuring performance.\nDesigning the Operating Procedure\nOnce the task is defined, the next step is to design a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP). This step-by-step guide should mimic how a human would perform the task, surfacing the necessary decisions and tools the agent will require. For an email agent, this might involve analyzing email content, checking calendar availability, and drafting responses.\nBuilding the MVP\nCreating a minimum viable product (MVP) involves focusing on the most critical reasoning tasks, such as classification and decision-making. LangChain emphasizes starting with manual inputs and testing against predefined examples to validate performance. Tools like LangSmith can assist in managing prompt versions and testing across various scenarios.\nConnecting and Orchestrating\nWith a working prompt, the next step is to connect the agent to real data and user inputs. This involves identifying required data, such as email content and calendar availability, and writing orchestration logic to integrate this data into the agent's workflow. For an email agent, integration with APIs like Gmail and Google Calendar is crucial.\nTesting and Iteration\nTesting is a critical phase where the agent's performance is evaluated against initial examples. Manual testing is followed by automated testing to ensure consistency and identify edge cases. Success metrics should be defined to measure the agent's expected behavior, with human review used to catch nuances that metrics might miss.\nDeployment and Scaling\nOnce the MVP is stable, the agent can be deployed and scaled. Real-world usage provides insights into potential improvements and unaddressed use cases. LangChain's platform allows for efficient deployment and monitoring, enabling continuous refinement based on user feedback and emerging patterns.\nBuilding an AI agent is not just about getting it to function but ensuring it is useful and reliable.

This article dives into recent news surrounding Polkadot, a detailed technical analysis, and trading recommendations for both short-term and long-term investors.\nRecent News Analysis (Last 7 Days)\nPolkadot has been making headlines in the past week, with several developments driving market attention:\n-\nPolkadot’s Expansion into Cross-Chain Interoperability: Polkadot recently announced new partnerships with decentralized finance (DeFi) projects aiming to enhance cross-chain liquidity. This development has increased investor confidence in Polkadot’s ecosystem.\n-\nDOT Staking Growth: Recent data shows that staking activity on the Polkadot network has increased by 8% over the past month, as more investors and validators engage with the network, ensuring its security and scalability.\n-\nPositive Sentiment from Institutional Players: A well-known crypto investment firm disclosed an addition of DOT to its portfolio, citing the network's innovative parachain model and long-term scalability potential.\nThese developments have contributed to the boost in DOT’s price and trading volume, evident in its 24-hour volume of $16.56 million.\nTechnical Analysis\nPrice Overview\n- Current Price: $3.62\n- 24h Change: +5.30%\n- 24h High/Low: $3.64 / $3.42\nThe current price of $3.62 is approaching the Resistance 1 level at $3.67, suggesting a potential breakout or retracement depending on trading volume and market sentiment.\nMoving Averages\n- SMA7 ($3.44) and SMA20 ($3.40): DOT is trading above its short-term moving averages, indicating short-term bullish momentum.\n- SMA_50 ($3.84): The price remains below this key medium-term level, which could act as resistance.\n- SMA_200 ($4.75): The long-term trend remains bearish, as DOT trades significantly below its 200-day moving average.\nMomentum Indicators\n- RSI(14): 52.25: The RSI is in the neutral zone, suggesting that DOT is neither overbought nor oversold. There is room for additional upward movement.\n- MACD (-0.0945): The MACD line is below the signal line, but the positive histogram value (+0.0451) indicates a potential bullish crossover in the near term.\n- Stochastic %K (88.44) and %D (55.82): Stochastic indicators show overbought conditions, signaling caution for short-term traders as a pullback could occur.\nBollinger Bands\n- Upper Band ($3.61), Middle Band ($3.40), Lower Band ($3.20): DOT is trading slightly above the upper Bollinger Band (%B = 1.0205), which often indicates overbought conditions. A short-term correction is possible.\nAverage True Range (ATR)\n- ATR(14): $0.19: Moderate volatility is evident, suggesting manageable price swings for traders.\nKey Levels\n- Resistance Levels: $3.67 (short-term), $5.12 (long-term).\n- Support Levels: $3.56 (Pivot), $3.01 (critical support).\n- 52-Week Range: High ($10.67), Low ($3.15).\nDOT’s recent climb puts it near critical resistance at $3.67. A breakout above this level could trigger a rally toward $4.00, while a failure to hold above $3.56 may lead to a retest of $3.01.\nTrading Recommendations\nShort-Term Strategy\n- Buy Zone: $3.40 - $3.56 (near pivot and support levels).\n- Sell Target: $3.67 (Resistance 1) and $4.00 (psychological level).\n- Stop Loss: $3.30 to manage downside risk.\nShort-term traders should monitor RSI and Bollinger Bands for signs of a pullback. If DOT breaks above $3.67 with strong volume, consider holding for further upside.\nLong-Term Strategy\n- Accumulation Zone: Below $3.40, particularly near the 52-week low of $3.15.\n- Target Price: $5.00 - $5.12 (Resistance 2) and beyond, once the broader crypto market recovers.\n- Risk Management: Keep an eye on DOT’s SMA_200 ($4.75) for long-term trend confirmation.\nLong-term investors may find current levels attractive for accumulation, given Polkadot’s robust ecosystem and growing adoption.\nConclusion\nPolkadot (DOT) shows promising signs of recovery, supported by positive news and short-term bullish momentum. However, caution is advised as key resistance levels loom and indicators hint at overbought conditions. Traders should keep a close watch on $3.67 for a potential breakout and $3.56 for strong support.\nAs Polkadot continues to expand its ecosystem and attract institutional interest, its long-term outlook remains optimistic. Both short-term traders and long-term investors should consider DOT as a compelling opportunity in the evolving crypto market.\nDisclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

Accumulate on pullbacks near $146-$150.\nRisk Management\n- Given the weak bullish trend and overbought stochastic readings, partial profit-taking at $159.99 is recommended. Watch for volume confirmation before breakout trades.\nFinal Thoughts\nSolana (SOL) has shown resilience in recent days, supported by bullish technical indicators and favorable market news.

Additionally, new operational tools like Maintenance Mode and bond provider migration were rolled out. These tools aim to enhance network efficiency and security, ensuring a robust infrastructure for future expansions.\nFinancial and Operational Metrics\nTHORChain reported a total USD volume of $10.4 billion for Q2 2025, with the highest daily volume reaching $327.58 million. The network's total liquidity increased from $122 million to $180 million, while swap fees collected amounted to $6.12 million.

These upgrades are designed to improve transaction speed, broaden asset support, and enhance integration across major blockchain ecosystems.\nThe roadmap also outlines plans for TRON integration, which is set to go live in July, and the introduction of enshrined oracles to provide secure, manipulation-resistant pricing. This initiative is expected to benefit the Rujira ecosystem, which will leverage these oracles for improved product offerings.\nRujira Developments\nRujira, a key component of THORChain's ecosystem, saw significant progress with the launch of the Merge, allowing token holders to consolidate their assets into RUJI. The soft launch of RUJI Trade, Pools, and Perps introduced new trading and liquidity options, with plans to expand these offerings further in Q3.\nLooking ahead, Rujira aims to introduce new products such as RUJI AI and RUJI Launchpad, which will enhance user engagement and provide innovative trading solutions. The ecosystem is also set to implement a global referral and affiliate system to drive growth and incentivize participation.\nIn summary, THORChain's Q2 2025 report and Q3 roadmap reflect a period of significant growth and strategic planning.

{"title": "Dr. Owen Vaughan explains why Bitcoin is green technology", "url": "https://coingeek.com/dr-owen-vaughan-explains-why-bitcoin-is-green-technology-video/", "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nDr. Owen Vaughan appeared on the CoinGeek Weekly Livestream this week, where he discussed the launch of BitRoots, a startup offering a way to confirm that bitcoins were mined with green energy. Enjoy this deep dive into Bitcoin mining, sustainability, and related topics!\nWho is Dr. Owen Vaughan?\nDr. Vaughan is a mathematician who initially intended to have a career in academia. However, he quickly realized the lifestyle, requiring lots of travel and accepting positions worldwide, wasn’t conducive to healthy relationships or a balanced life, so he moved into data science.\nIn 2018, a friend encouraged him to get involved in Bitcoin research. He “took a punt” and hasn’t looked back since. It’s a great area for original research, he said, because almost every question is being asked for the first time.\nAfter seven fruitful years at nChain, Dr. Vaughan decided the next step was to launch BitRoots, providing a way to confirm a bitcoin was mined with renewable energy.\nHow supportive have the people in his life been about this pivot? Dr. Vaughan said he was 39 and already had a PhD before he felt he had the right to try. As a recently married man with his first child on the way, he knew it was time to give it a shot.\nIs Bitcoin green tech?\nCritics of proof-of-work (PoW) imagine a dystopian future where Bitcoin mining boils the oceans, poisons the air, and wrecks the environment. However, being a miner himself, Wuckert knows this isn’t true. He asks a simple question: Is Bitcoin green tech?\nDr. Vaughan answers in the affirmative: Bitcoin is completely clean technology. It doesn’t create any emissions in and of itself; it simply consumes power and produces heat.\nNot only can miners use renewable energy to solve hash puzzles, but there are interesting ways to use the heat they produce. For example, in Finland, the heat generated from Bitcoin mining is stored in sand blocks— sand batteries—which are then transported to heat buildings.\nDue to all of this and more, perceptions on Bitcoin mining are slowly changing. Dr. Vaughan hopes his company can play a role in changing the perception of those who still erroneously believe Bitcoin is environmentally harmful.\nWuckert agreed. He has been involved in mining Bitcoin since 2013. He has seen the rise of ASICs and the industrialization of mining, and he has witnessed miners figure out ways to use waste like flare gas on drilling rigs to create revenue. These days, miners can set up at strategic places on the grid, such as load-shedding stations, and turn what would otherwise be wasted into profits.\nWhat would certification with BitRoots look like?Vaughan begins by saying that he’d be very proud to own a Bitcoin that was certifiably mined using renewable energy, and he believes many others would, too. In fact, this is just the sort of thing family offices and ESG-conscious corporations would boast about.\nRegarding Wuckert’s question, BitRoots audits facilities and issues certificates for one year. While there is some challenge with pools, some issue block rewards directly to miners, so they don’t all pose the same problems.\nOrdinals play a role in all of this, too. They can help track every satoshi. BitRoots also has an API that will allow exchanges to offer certifiably clean coins.\nWhat is the average carbon emission per coin? Cambridge University published a paper showing that each coin releases 242 tonnes of CO2. Many look to offset this with carbon credits, but Dr. Vaughan isn’t a big fan of them since they vary significantly in quality and cost. He prefers direct carbon reduction.\nWhat does BitRoots look like in two or three years?\nThe immediate goal is to help interested parties see what’s possible and how BitRoots can help them comply with Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) and other regulations.\nDr. Vaughan points to a mining operation in Ethiopia as an example. Thanks to its massive hydro dam, the Ethiopian government generated approximately $200 million from Bitcoin mining operations. Connecting parties like this with companies that would be proud to own such clean coins is a great first step.\nTo hear more about BitRoots, how Bitcoin mining incentivized renewable energy adoption, and why all of this matters, check out the livestream episode here.\nWatch: Bitcoin mining in 2025: Is it still worth it?", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 13:00:00 +0000", "author": "Gavin Lucas", "source": "https://coingeek.com/feed/"}

Some countries, like South Korea, banned the trading of privacy coins years ago. Australia followed suit, with the European Union set to enforce similar restrictions in 2027.\nSC is also mulling restrictions on memecoins, which have become a $60 billion market. It believes these tokens face “a heightened risk of market volatility and market manipulation.”\nStablecoins and tokens issued by exchanges to be used within their ecosystem also pose unique challenges, and the watchdog wants public feedback on whether it should impose more stringent regulations on them.\nSC doubles down on segregation of assets\nWhile it plans to relax listing rules, the regulator is ramping up its investor protection guidelines on asset segregation and governance.\nUnder the proposed framework, VASPs must hold at least 90% of investor assets in cold wallets for each type of asset they hold. Assets held on hot wallets must be fully collateralized with assets held in the VASP’s own offline wallet.\nMalaysian VASPs that serve other jurisdictions must retain a separation between local and offshore assets, the watchdog adds. This requirement has been implemented in other countries to great success. In Japan, for instance, the segregation of local assets allowed FTX Japan to refund its users when the global parent company went down in late 2022.\nThe regulator also wants VASPs to enhance their governance, starting with regular audits on the segregation of investor assets. The operators must also prove that they maintain direct access to the wallets, free from influence or control by external parties. They must appoint a senior executive who needs to reside in Malaysia to administer this access.\nThese new regulations seek to protect Malaysians from ‘crypto’ scammers who continue to make away with billions of dollars every year. The largest scam in the country, UVKXE, blew up earlier this year, going down with RM33 million ($7 million) in local investors’ funds.\nGlobally, criminals stole $2.3 billion in digital assets according to a report by CertiK, which cited reported on-chain incidents. A separate report by Nefture Security estimated the losses at $8.3 billion in at least 519 incidents.\nThe SC’s public consultation ends on August 11.\nConnecticut bans state agencies from holding ‘crypto’\nWhile dozens of states in the United States rush to set up digital asset reserves to align with President Donald Trump’s initiative, Connecticut has bucked the trend, banning state agencies from holding digital assets.\nGov. Ned Lamont signed House Bill 7082 into law after it sailed through the state’s Senate and House of Representatives with 36 and 148 votes respectively, and zero votes against.\nThe bill “prohibits the state, and political subdivisions of the state, from accepting or requiring payment in the form of virtual currency, or purchasing, holding, investing in or establishing a reserve of virtual currency.”\nThe Constitution State holds just under $9 billion in treasury pools across its short-term investment fund and the budget reserve fund. With a $366 billion economy, it ranks 23rd in the country.\nConnecticut is the first state to push back against the BTC reserve wave that has swept across the U.S. On the opposite end, New Hampshire was the pioneer, passing House Bill 302, which allows its treasurer to allocate up to 5% of the state funds in digital assets.\nWatch | Blockchain Policy Update: Bryan Daugherty on DC and Trump’s Latest Moves", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 09:00:00 +0000", "author": "Steve Kaaru", "source": "https://coingeek.com/feed/"}

The share of the deals nearly doubled from 7.3% in 2023.\nMost impressively, the median deal size for the sector hit $2.8 million, twice the industry median, “reflecting investor willingness to make high-conviction bets even amid risk-off conditions.” However, the average deal size dipped 44% to $4.1 million.\nThe report revealed that investors are shifting from startups developing protocol-level infrastructure to platforms focused on utility. DeFi, data infrastructure providers, and startups offering digital currency-fiat financial services dominated the fundraising.\nThe report also reiterated the rise of stablecoins on the continent.\n“It is probable that within a decade, more Africans will use stablecoins for daily transactions than hold traditional bank accounts,” commented CV VC CEO Matthias Ruch.\nYellow Card, an exchange whose business model now leans overwhelmingly on stablecoins, had the region’s biggest funding round, raising $33 million in October. The round, led by Blockchain Capital, brought its total funding to $88 million, making it Africa’s highest-funded exchange.\nBut while blockchain startups outperformed their peers, Africa’s startups only attracted $122.5 million last year, translating to 1% of the $12.1 billion raised globally, down from 1.8% the year prior. Overall, African startups raised $2.6 billion across 427 deals, a separate report revealed.\n“This is not just an imbalance; it’s an opportunity. An invitation to investors, developers, policymakers and innovators to engage with one of the most promising blockchain frontiers on the planet,” Ruch added.\nThe G20 must focus on blockchain: Absa\nAs blockchain outpaces most other technologies, it must remain a central part of conversations around development in Africa, including at the upcoming G20 Summit, says Rob Downes, Absa’s head of digital assets.\nThe G20 Leaders’ Summit will be held in November in Johannesburg, the first time the event is being held in Africa. It will host the world’s most powerful leaders to discuss pressing global issues, including the digital economy, with AI, data governance, and cybersecurity among the themes.\nWith blockchain outpacing all these sectors in funding growth last year, it must be a key area of focus for the G20 leaders, says Downes.\n“It certainly isn’t farfetched to see a future world where digital money lives on blockchains, with AI tooling monitoring real time activity and patterns to detect and prevent fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing, and money transfers happening seamlessly when pre-agreed conditions are met,” he added.\nBlockchain adoption in Africa has recorded steady growth, unfazed by the funding or the cyclical booms and busts in the digital currency sector. Dozens of startups have developed blockchain solutions addressing challenges around financial inclusion, supply chain management, and intra-African trade, cross-border transfers, document authentication, and more.\nWatch: The next big thing?

{"title": "Tether can’t shake Celsius lawsuit; Bitfinex launches ‘stablechain’", "url": "https://coingeek.com/tether-cant-shake-celsius-lawsuit-bitfinex-launches-stablechain/", "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nTether has lost its bid to dismiss a claim by administrators of the bankrupt Celsius Network looking to claw back billions of dollars’ worth of ‘improperly’ liquidated BTC tokens.\n- Tether loses bid to duck Celsius suit\n- Bitfinex launching USDT-powered ‘stablechain’\n- Tether big in Bolivia\n- Paolo can’t secure Juventus board seat\nJune 30 brought a ruling by Judge Martin Glenn in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in the case pitting Celsius Debtors against Tether, issuer of the market-leading USDT stablecoin. (Comically, the filing declares it to be the “PUNITED STATES” court, which we’ll assume is a typo, but hey, grounds for appeal?)\nFirst, some background. The suit was filed last August based on the Debtors’ belief that Tether had crossed legal lines by selling nearly 40,000 BTC tokens—currently worth ~$4 billion—that Celsius had put up as collateral for USDT-based loans. Celsius went bankrupt in July 2022 in a haze of criminal fraud allegations, for which founder Alex Mashinsky was sentenced to 12 years in prison earlier this year.\nCelsius was effectively a Ponzi scheme from its inception, forcing Mashinsky to be constantly borrowing from one source to pay others. The latter category included Celsius customers, who purchased and staked the platform’s native CEL token based on Mashinsky’s promises of massive returns for doing so.\nTether’s ties to Celsius went beyond merely providing loans that the company couldn’t get from a bank. As Mashinsky’s own emails indicate, Tether was using Celsius to service “all their US clients,” including market-makers Cumberland, Jump, and others.\nBut as 2022’s wave of crypto frauds, bankruptcies, and implosions began, BTC’s price began to fall. This prompted Tether to issue margin calls requiring additional collateral to support the $512 million in USDT that Celsius had borrowed.\nOver a six-week period ending on June 12, 2022, Celsius sent nearly 17,000 additional BTC to Tether. These BTC transfers occurred during the 90-day period preceding Celsius’ filing for bankruptcy, which under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, are eligible to be ‘clawed back’ by bankruptcy administrators.\nCelsius also borrowed another $300 million worth of USDT during this period, for which it transferred another 10,700 BTC to Tether. Over 2,200 of this BTC was excess collateral.\nAs Celsius began to circle the drain, Tether declined to provide further USDT loans to Celsius and liquidated the BTC put up as collateral. This liquidation didn’t honor the 10-hour waiting period following a margin call that was stipulated under the terms of the loans.\nAn amended agreement that the parties signed in January 2022 stipulated that if Tether liquidated the Celsius BTC, any surplus proceeds were to be paid to Celsius. Instead, Tether sold the BTC at what Celsius claims were below-market prices and kept the proceeds for itself, an action that Celsius alleges cost the company $100 million.\nLast November, Tether filed to dismiss the Celsius claim, citing the plaintiffs’ lack of standing, a lack of personal jurisdiction, and the plaintiffs’ failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\nLast week, Judge Glenn rejected most of Tether’s arguments but dismissed Count IV of the complaint, which alleged that Tether had breached a covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (Tether’s home base at the time) by liquidating the BTC. However, Glenn gave Celsius leave to amend their complaint.\nAs of last August, bankruptcy administrators had distributed $2.5 billion to 251,000 Celsius creditors, representing roughly two-thirds of the total number of former customers. Many of the remaining 121,000 creditors had yet to claim their owed funds, some because the amounts were trivial, others for reasons unknown (including the possibility that coming forward would require identifying themselves).\nTether is by no means the only entity in the sights of the Celsius administrators. In March, Celsius sued Chainalysis, accusing the blockchain analytics firm of performing a knowingly fraudulent audit of Celsius’ assets under management in 2020 and of misleading Celsius customers and investors.\nStablecoin-based stablechain is called Stable\nIn other Tether news, the Bitfinex digital asset exchange (which shares ownership with Tether) just announced details of its previously hinted plans to launch Stable, “a dedicated Layer 1 stablechain optimized for payments using USDT.”\nThis ‘stablechain’ aims to reduce transaction fees and speed up settlement times, while making the whole process accessible to everyday users, serving as “rails for the real world.”\nThe official Stable site claims USDT is “the world’s most used asset” (the citation behind this claim appears to be missing), and Bitfinex believes such a popular means of transferring funds “deserves its own chain.”\nLeft unsaid is the likely view that the owners of Bitfinex and Tether deserve their own transaction fees, rather than letting third-party USDT-friendly networks like TRON (where $80.7 billion of USDT currently resides) and Ethereum ($73.8 billion) take their cut.\nStable appears to be part of a trend in which crypto companies launch their networks on which the native token is one under their control. Take Base, the Ethereum layer 2 network launched by Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) exchange, which relies on the USDC stablecoin issued by Circle (NASDAQ: CRCL), in which Coinbase holds an equity stake. The aim appears to be ensuring a stake in all on-chain activities, at least, the revenue-generating kind.\nAccording to Bitfinex, Stable will use USDT as its ‘gas’ token for transaction fees, “eliminating the complexity of holding additional, volatile tokens.” Fees will be “well below a fraction of a cent,” while peer-to-peer USDT transfers will be gas-free. The network will come with its own Stable Wallet, which will feature “social login, debit/credit card integration, and human-readable wallet aliases.”Bitfinex claims its new network will be capable of handling “thousands of transactions per second” while offering institutions “guaranteed blockspace allocation, scalable batch processing, and robust security measures.” Cross-chain bridging will be possible using USDT0 and LayerZero tech, while decentralized app (dApp) developers have been told to go nuts on stablecoin use cases.\nStable’s roadmap is currently in ‘Phase 1,’ which includes launching the StableWallet and implementing StableBFT, aka “a customized PoS [proof of stake] consensus protocol built on CometBFT.” (BFT, if you were wondering, stands for Byzantine fault tolerance.)\nPhase 2 involves enhancing transaction throughput via optimistic parallel execution, launching USDT transfer aggregators, and offering dedicated blockspace to enterprises. The final phase involves those aforementioned dApp tools and a consensus mechanism based on directed acyclic graphs.\nLast month, longtime crypto entrepreneur Gabriel Abed, who was named chairman of the Binance exchange’s first board of directors last year, was identified as a strategic investor in Stable.\nTether: big in Bolivia\nWhile stablecoins appear to be on the cusp of mainstream acceptance as a payment mechanism in North America and Europe, those are markets in which Tether appears unable to participate due to its inability to abide by regulatory constraints.\nIn the European Union, Tether has effectively opted out of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) stablecoin framework due to the requirement for larger issuers to hold the bulk of their fiat reserves in cash in local banks. In America, two different stablecoin bills will allow Tether a lengthy grace period but will also impose requirements that Tether has been unwilling to undertake on its own, including submitting its reserves to a comprehensive third-party audit.\nTether CEO Paolo Ardoino, who praised Stable’s upcoming launch last month and was credited in turn for “advising” the Stable team, has begun publicly declaring the company’s “core mission” to be focused on supporting “emerging markets where access to stable financial infrastructure is urgently needed.”\nLast month, Ardoino tweeted that “[i]n Bolivia, real prices in shops are displayed in USD₮.” The tweet included photos of products for sale in an airport duty free store.\nAnother photo showed explanatory signage reading: “Our products are priced in USDT (Tether), a stable cryptocurrency with a reference price reported daily by the Central Bank of Bolivia, based on the Binance cryptocurrency trading platform. You can pay in Bolivian Bolivianos (BOB) or US Dollars (USD). The conversion will be made based on the daily USDT rate.”\nRecently, Reuters reported that Bolivians were increasingly turning to tokens such as USDT to hedge against the depreciation of the local currency. Last November, Bolivia’s Banco Bisa began offering USDT custody to its banking customers.\nHowever, a former Bolivia central bank executive told Reuters that daily USDT volumes in the country are only around US$600,000. That’s a pittance compared to tradfi volume of $18-$22 million, while cash-based black market sales are around $12-$14 million.\nBolivia’s central bank reported last week that transactions using Electronic Payment Channels and Instruments for Virtual Assets totaled $294 million in the first half of 2025, a 530% rise over the same period last year.\nThe bank said these digital tools “have facilitated access to foreign currency transactions, including remittances, small purchases and payments, benefiting micro and small business owners across various sectors, as well as families nationwide.”\nArdoino finds beautiful game not so beautiful up close\nTether is the unquestioned stablecoin market leader, with USDT’s market cap crossing $158.3 billion on July 2, a new record high. But that doesn’t seem to impress the owners of Juventus FC, a fixture in Italy’s Serie A football league.\nIn February, Tether announced that it had taken an 8.2% stake in Juventus, marking the first investment by a digital asset firm in a major European football club. The following month, Tether announced that its Juventus stake had increased to 10.12%, representing 6.18% of the club’s voting rights. By April, the stake had risen to 10.7%, representing a total outlay of roughly €128 million.\nBut on June 2, Ardoino tweeted that the club—which is majority owned by the Agnelli family’s investment firm Exor NV—hadn’t allowed Tether to participate in a planned capital increase that commenced in April. Ardoino later complained in an interview that Tether had only had “very, very limited” communications with the club and Exor.\nOn June 25, Bloomberg reported that Tether still hadn’t met with Juventus but was pushing the club to allow Tether a seat on its board of directors. Juventus has reportedly said it plans to meet with Tether executives when its current season concludes, after which Exor will ‘evaluate its position’ regarding Tether.\nIt’s almost as if the Agnelli family had some reason to think partnering with Tether might not be the best thing for the club’s image.\nWatch: Teranode is the digital backbone of Bitcoin", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 15:00:00 +0000", "author": "Steven Stradbrooke", "source": "https://coingeek.com/feed/"}
{"title": "Bit Digital shifts from BTC mining to ETH staking", "url": "https://coingeek.com/bit-digital-shifts-from-btc-mining-to-eth-staking/", "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nIn a bold move that signals a significant shift in the block reward mining landscape, Bit Digital, Inc. (NASDAQ: BTBT), a New York-based, Nasdaq-listed crypto firm with a market capitalization of $489 million, announced in May that it is exiting BTC mining entirely to focus on Ethereum (ETH) staking and treasury operations.\nThis strategic pivot, driven by rising BTC mining costs, diminishing returns, and the allure of ETH’s proof-of-stake (PoS) model, reflects broader industry trends toward sustainability and capital efficiency. The announcement, however, triggered a 4-8% drop in Bit Digital’s stock price, highlighting investor uncertainty about the transition.\nAs the company repositions itself, it aims to capitalize on ETH’s growing institutional appeal and long-term yield potential, potentially reshaping its investor base and market position.\nBit Digital’s decision comes at a challenging time for BTC mining. The April 2024 BTC halving slashed block rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, significantly impacting miners’ revenue. Compounding this, BTC mining difficulty reached an all-time high of 126.98 trillion in May 2025, driven by a 14-day average hashrate of 913.54 EH/s. Transaction fees, a critical revenue stream, dropped to just 1.3% of block rewards in May, falling below 1% in June.\nBit Digital’s Q1 2025 financials reflect this squeeze: BTC mining revenue plummeted 64% year-on-year to $7.8 million, with only 83.3 BTC mined, an 80% decline from the previous year. High energy costs and continuous hardware upgrades further eroded margins, making BTC mining increasingly unsustainable for the firm.\n“Our first quarter results were affected by mark-to-market losses on digital assets and lower bitcoin mining revenue, both of which reflect industry-wide headwinds and the strategic rebalancing of our business. We continued to make meaningful progress in scaling our infrastructure platform and diversifying our revenue streams,” the company stated.\nIn contrast, ETH’s PoS mechanism, implemented after the 2022 Merge, offers a compelling alternative. Staking allows firms to lock up ETH to secure the network, earning annual yields of 4-6.5% with significantly lower energy consumption than BTC’s energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) model. Bit Digital began building its ETH staking infrastructure in 2022, and by March 31, 2025, held 24,434.2 ETH valued at $44.6 million and 417.6 BTC worth $34.5 million.The company plans to gradually convert its BTC holdings into ETH, with proceeds from the sale or wind-down of its BTC mining operations—spanning facilities in the United States, Canada, and Iceland—reinvested into ETH staking. Additionally, Bit Digital announced a public offering of ordinary shares, led by B. Riley Securities, to fund further ETH purchases, though the offering’s size and terms remain undisclosed.\nThe pivot aligns with a broader shift in institutional capital toward ETH, driven by its staking yields and the liquidity provided by liquid staking derivatives (LSDs). The Ethereum Shapella upgrade in April 2023 enabled ETH withdrawals, boosting demand for LSDs like stETH, which allow staked assets to be traded or used as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi). This mechanism enhances capital efficiency and lowers staking barriers, making ETH attractive to yield-focused investors. Bit Digital’s move positions it as the third-largest publicly traded ETH holder, behind SharpLink Gaming (NASDAQ: SBET) and Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), with plans to increase its ETH reserves by over 18,000 ETH through BTC conversions.\nHowever, the transition is not without risks. Bit Digital’s stock fell 3.7% on June 25, with an additional 4.3% drop in after-hours trading, reflecting investor concerns about short-term volatility. Legacy BTC mining investors may exit, and the firm’s rapid cash burn, despite 52.44% revenue growth over the past year, raises questions about financial sustainability.\nThe ETH/BTC ratio, down 75% since December 2021, suggests BTC’s recent outperformance, adding uncertainty to Bit Digital’s bet on ETH. Yet, growing interest in ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and staking’s stable returns could attract new institutional investors, particularly those prioritizing Web3-based income strategies.\nBit Digital’s pivot also coincides with its expansion into high-performance computing (HPC). Its subsidiary, WhiteFiber Inc., secured a $43.9 million financing facility from the Royal Bank of Canada to develop a Tier-3 artificial intelligence (AI) data center in Quebec, set for completion by Q4 2025.\nAdditionally, WhiteFiber acquired a North Carolina property for a 24 MW AI data center campus and is preparing for a potential initial public offering (IPO). These moves diversify Bit Digital’s portfolio, leveraging its computational expertise beyond crypto.\n“This financing is a breakthrough for WhiteFiber and our sector,” said Bit Digital CEO Sam Tabar. “No other company operating at the intersection of HPC Cloud and data centers has secured financing of this nature, to our knowledge. We believe that this is a strong endorsement of our business model, the quality of our assets, balance sheet, and ability to execute.”\nAs BTC mining faces mounting pressures, Bit Digital’s shift to ETH staking reflects a strategic response to industry challenges and opportunities. While the transition carries risks, it positions the firm to capitalize on ETH’s growing role in the digital economy, potentially setting a precedent for other miners to follow.\nWatch: Unpacking Bitcoin sustainability at the London Blockchain Conference", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 07:00:00 +0000", "author": "Jacob Rozen", "source": "https://coingeek.com/feed/"}

Is “vlog” still a word? Either way, we’re going with it!\nLet’s walk through the journey.\nThe premise\nIf there’s one thing the BSV economy needs more than anything else, it’s not more Twitterati or hobbyists. It’s more entrepreneurs and more investors: more builders who see Bitcoin not as a speculative asset to HODL until the next cycle, but as a protocol that can actually power real businesses every second of every day forever!\nLast month, I packed my bags and flew to Boulder, Colorado. Because if you’re serious about attracting smart money and serious operators, sometimes you’ve got to get out of your echo chamber. And Boulder has quietly become one of the best places in America to do just that.\nIt’s not just the clean mountain air or the local startup coffee shops (though I’ll admit, both are pretty great). It’s that Boulder, unlike so many cities still clinging to the ghost of the last tech bubble, has evolved into a true ecosystem of practical, product-focused builders. Entrepreneurs there don’t waste time pontificating about the “future of money.” They’re busy solving customer problems, raising capital, and shipping real things.\nThe guru\nAnd no one embodies that ethos better than Brad Feld.\nFeld’s not just another VC in a Patagonia vest chasing the next hype curve. He’s been investing in technology companies for more than 30 years, through multiple crashes, and all the way to today. He co-founded Techstars in Boulder, helped scale the Foundry Group into one of the most respected venture firms in the country, and has backed hundreds of startups. But more than that, he’s built a philosophy around what makes startup communities thrive. It’s simple, deceptively so: give first.\nI saw Feld speak at the launch of his new book, Give First, where he shared stories from decades of building companies and ecosystems. The idea is that the best founders, investors, and local economies succeed when people lead with generosity, not extracting value at every turn, but looking for ways to support others, with no immediate expectation of financial payback.If that sounds quaint, spend five minutes in most blockchain circles today. Memes, speculation, and zero-sum thinking still dominate everything. “Buy this coin so it pumps. Stake it. Dump it. Move on.” Meanwhile, almost no one is focused on what it means to actually build long-term value and create products that serve customers, generate revenue, and justify their existence beyond a white paper and a trading pair.\nThe opportunity\nBSV, more than any other blockchain I’ve ever touched, desperately needs a boost of energy. We have the protocol. We have the scalability. What we don’t have (at least not yet at the scale we should) are investors and entrepreneurs laser-focused on using Bitcoin to solve complex commercial problems. People who care more about margins and business models than about Twitter likes and pumpy charts.\nThat’s why Boulder was refreshing. I had conversations with founders and small business owners who didn’t care much about coin price, but cared about cash flow, paying customers, and how technology could help them do more. It was a reminder that this is who we should be talking to if we want BSV to grow into what it was always meant to be: a robust, unbounded network for global commerce, not just a speculative playground.\nAnd yeah, it was a pretty great time. We shot a highlight video so you can see it yourself: Brad, Boulder, startup chatter, even a little local color from taco joints that accept BSV. If you want to understand the kind of entrepreneurial spirit we should be courting, watch the video. If you’re building on Bitcoin, or thinking about it, I hope it convinces you to think bigger. Think like a founder. Think like Brad Feld.

{"title": "ECB pushes ahead with digital euro amid stalled legislation", "url": "https://coingeek.com/ecb-pushes-ahead-with-digital-euro-amid-stalled-legislation/", "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde has hinted again at the Bank’s preference for launching its long-planned central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital euro, to sit alongside cash.\nIn a June 30 speech at the opening reception of the ECB Forum on Central Banking 2025, Lagarde spoke of uncertainty dominating the current narrative and the impact on inflation of uncontrollable events, such as tariffs and supply disruptions.\nIn her speech, the ECB president said the Bank’s strategy assessment has been an exercise in “evolution, not revolution” and that “even as the world changes around us, we know our purpose. And we will do whatever is necessary to deliver on it – ensuring price stability for the people of Europe.”\nWhile she didn’t specifically mention the digital euro, the language was reminiscent of how Lagarde has previously spoken of the ECB’s mooted CBDC.\nEarlier in June, in an interview with Xinhua News Agency, Lagarde again spoke of uncertainty—her favorite catchphrase of the moment—but also gave the strongest indication that the ECB is hoping to get the necessary support from the European Parliament for the digital euro.\nWhen asked about the ECB’s exploration of a digital euro and whether it could cooperate in the future with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC)—which launched its own CBDC, the digital yuan, in 2022—Lagarde said: “Both the PBOC [People’s Bank of China] and the ECB are working on a digital currency. China was ahead; it started earlier. We started six years ago, and we are getting to the point where, if the legislature supports the proposal, we should be ready to launch.”\nShe added that the ECB wants “to make sure that we have a European offer that is available, so that within the entire euro area there is a means of payment and a solid currency that can help you transact both online, peer-to-peer, business-to-business, and that’s the purpose of the digital euro.”\nLagarde also explained the reasons behind the ECB’s decision to plough ahead with the preparations for a CBDC: “Because of client demand, to put it very simply. Because many Europeans – not all, but many – like to pay electronically, digitally, without cash.”\nHowever, Lagarde did qualify this by stating that “many Europeans still like cash. I like cash. So we will continue to have cash… but we need, as a sovereign expression on the financial stage, to be able to respond to the demand of our customers, Europeans.”\nShe added that “if they want cash, we should be able to print secure banknotes. If they want digital cash, we should be able to offer a digital euro.”\nIn other words, there is a public demand for a digital euro. The ECB has been developing it for many years, and it is now ready to go. In Lagarde’s opinion, it is in the interests of all to launch it. The only missing ingredient is the legislative framework, which the European Parliament must establish.\nAwaiting legislation\nUltimately, the ECB will decide whether to launch a digital euro, and it appears clear which way it is leaning in this regard. However, the decision requires the approval of a regulation establishing a legal framework for a digital euro.\nThus, in 2023, the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, put forward a digital euro package to regulate the main aspects of a digital euro in order to ensure the same rules and conditions are applied throughout the euro area when using it. This package was referred to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) in the European Parliament.On February 9, 2024, a draft report on the package and the ECB’s digital euro investigation phase was tabled, but as yet no vote on this draft report has taken place. Therefore, the ECB remains without the necessary legislative framework to launch the digital euro, no matter how much it wants to.\nThe insistence with which Lagarde extols the merits of the digital euro, along with the ECB’s repeated assertions about its readiness to launch it, could be read as a sign of impatience with the EU parliament dragging its feet on regulation.\nThis was made explicit on April 8, 2025, when Piero Cipollone, Member of the ECB Executive Board, presented to the ECON Committee an update on the developments of the digital euro project, and at the same time urged members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to make progress on the legislative file.\nDigital euro’s development\nIn 2021, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying dramatic drop in physical cash payments, the ECB launched an investigation phase into a Eurozone CBDC to be used by citizens and businesses for retail payments. This lasted for two years, after which the central bank began the digital euro “preparation phase,” in November 2023.\nAfter positive progress, in November 2024, the ECB called for partners to test conditional payments in a CBDC simulation to start in February 2025. When February rolled around, the ECB announced it was expanding the initiative to settle transactions between institutions with a wholesale CBDC payment system.\nA month later, Lagarde reaffirmed the ECB’s commitment to the project, saying that the team behind the digital euro was “focused on accelerating the pace,” as well as highlighting how they were campaigning to get other stakeholders, like the EU Parliament and European Commission, on board.\nLagarde also said that the “testing phase” of the digital euro is scheduled to end this October. After that, the ECB will publish a final report and decide whether to issue a CBD, pending the necessary legislation.\nMore recently, on May 5, the ECB announced that it had established an “innovation platform” with 70 participants to collaborate on testing the digital euro project. According to the central bank, the platform simulates the envisaged digital euro ecosystem, “in which the ECB provides the technical support and infrastructure for European intermediaries to develop innovative digital payment features and services at European level.”\nThis brings us to the current state of limbo, with the ECB continuing tests but apparently already decided and united behind a digital euro, while the necessary regulation—as is often the case—plays catch-up.\nWatch: CBDCs are more than just digital money", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 09:00:00 +0000", "author": "James Field", "source": "https://coingeek.com/feed/"}
{"title": "Thailand, China on alert over illegal ‘crypto’ sites, schemes", "url": "https://coingeek.com/thailand-china-on-alert-over-illegal-crypto-sites-schemes/", "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nAs Thailand advances its digital economy, authorities are grappling with the scourge of rising illegal websites, but a new artificial intelligence (AI)-based solution may be the silver bullet.\nThailand’s government has unveiled WebD, a platform that leverages AI to shut down illegal websites in the country’s cyberspace. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Economy and Society Prasert Jantararuangtong disclosed that WebD aligns with the government’s ambitions to crack down on illegal online content.\nAt its core, the new AI-powered solution utilizes Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to streamline website reviews and evidence collection. Jantararuangtong said WebD automatically collects evidence and submits requests to the courts, sidestepping the traditional paperwork-based processes.\nThe platform also features an AI crawler running 24/7 and a real-time monitoring feature to prevent websites from relaunching after a court-ordered shutdown.\nEarly tests with WebD confirm its ability to process cases 31 times faster than traditional systems. Submitting requests to the courts takes less than five working days, with WebD capable of reviewing over 100,000 websites annually, according to the deputy prime minister.\nPundits predict that the AI-based platform will trigger a surge in the number of blocked URLs by over 70% before the end of the year. Thailand’s residents are currently dealing with the scourge of illicit websites, fleecing unsuspecting victims of millions of dollars.\nAt the top of the pyramid are illegal digital asset investment websites offering triple-digit returns on investment to residents. While the government has launched an offensive against the unregulated platforms, the sheer volume of illicit websites has made policing their operations an uphill climb.\nApart from cracking down on illegal URLs, Thailand is deploying AI across key sectors of its economy. The latest is an agricultural AI application for farmers retrofitted with emerging technologies at its core to track and forecast yield.\nThailand’s digitization efforts surge\nOutside of AI, the Southeast Asian country is hurtling toward full-scale digitalization with emerging technologies. A digital money handout using digital wallets has significantly moved the adoption needle amid the introduction of a national digital ID system.\nFurthermore, a new five-year digital asset tax exemption plan has received plaudits from investors, setting up a potential rivalry with regional first movers. In January, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra announced a digital currency pilot in Phuket, allowing foreign tourists to use digital assets to pay for goods and services.\nChina grapples with stablecoin scam surge\nMeanwhile, as stablecoin scams in China gather steam, authorities have issued a warning to the general public, urging them to remain vigilant of fake investment schemes.\nThe latest attempt to stifle the influence of fake stablecoin fundraisers comes from Shenzhen’s city government task force via an official public alert. According to the advisory, Shenzhen authorities are warning residents to be cautious of entities promoting digital asset investments without official licensing.Authorities said the unregistered entities are preying on the public’s limited knowledge of digital assets to mislead investors. In 2021, China issued a blanket ban on digital assets, prohibiting all mining and speculative investment in digital currencies.\nSince the ban, authorities are recording pockets of illicit activity online, offering avenues for residents to skirt the prohibition and invest in digital currencies. However, Shenzhen authorities reveal that the investment opportunities are fraudulent schemes serving as a front for money laundering, gambling, and pyramid schemes.\nWhile speculative digital asset investment in China is banned, fundraising activities involving fiat are legal, but entities must receive approvals from the relevant regulatory agencies. Under Chinese law, individuals participating in illegal fundraising activities will bear personal liability and will not be reimbursed for financial losses.\nThe unregulated entities rely on the promise of triple-digit returns to rope in potential victims. Citizens are urged to report illegal fundraising activities involving stablecoins to local authorities, the advisory stated.\n“We urge the public to adopt a rational investment mindset, refrain from blindly believing grandiose promises, establish a correct understanding of money and investment, and stay vigilant to avoid being deceived,” read an English translation of the warning.\nThe warning follows a raft of fake stablecoin promotions in Mainland China. E-commerce giant JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) is the hardest hit, with scammers claiming affiliation with the company to launch their fake JD.com stablecoin investment offerings to the public.\nStablecoin interest surges to unseen levels\nInterest in stablecoins has risen in recent months, attracting major traditional finance players, regulatory entities, and retail users. The United States is spearheading the charge with the passage of the GENIUS Act in the Senate, designed to create a legal framework for regulating stablecoins.\nCircle, issuer of USDC, has gone public with its stock surging over the last few weeks. USDT issuer Tether is also angling for top position as the U.S. government eyes stablecoins to maintain the dollar’s dominance as the world’s reserve currency.\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership—allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

{"title": "US Senate talks crypto market structure as Tornado Cash trial looms", "url": "https://coingeek.com/us-senate-talks-crypto-market-structure-as-tornado-cash-trial-looms/", "text": "The U.S. Senate keeps putting the digital asset market structure cart before the horse, the Trump family’s crypto ties get deeper, and Roman Storm’s trial draws ever nearer.\n- Senate holds market structure hearing without a bill\n- Coinbase’s ‘six-figure’ DC ad buy presses/warns Congress\n- A busy week for Trump’s crypto ventures\n- DWF stablecoin depegs\n- Tornado Cash co-founder’s trial looms\n- Roman Storm has deep-pocketed friends in low places\nOn July 9, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee held a hearing titled ‘From Wall Street to Web3: Building Tomorrow’s Digital Asset Markets,’ which focused squarely on digital asset market structure regulation.\nThere’s just one problem: the Senate has yet to introduce a market structure bill, and the expected discussion draft failed to appear ahead of Wednesday’s hearing. This left only the set of ‘principles’ the committee’s GOP leadership issued late last month to guide the proceedings.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), the committee’s ranking member, used her opening statement to declare her own principles. These include ensuring investor protections, enforcing anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and preventing President Donald Trump and his family members from profiting off their growing list of digital asset ventures. But the Dems don’t run this committee, so Warren’s principles aren’t worth much.\nInitially, the invited guests were Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Blockchain Association CEO/former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) commissioner Summer Mersinger, Paradigm partner Dan Robinson, and Jonathan Levin from blockchain analysts Chainalysis.\nHowever, the GOP has been accused of stacking the witness decks with undeniably pro-crypto figures (as above), so at the 11th hour, some crypto critics were hastily summoned. These seats were filled by former CFTC chair Timothy Massad and Richard Painter, a current University of Minnesota Law School professor and a former White House ethics lawyer.\nAt times, it seemed the critics had been invited solely so pro-crypto committee members could abuse them. For example, Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) provoked Painter’s ire by repeatedly claiming the latter thought all politicians were crooks.\nWhen Kennedy directly asked Painter whether he thought pro-crypto Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) was a crook and whether Painter should apologize, Painter retorted that he didn’t want Kennedy to “have to apologize for passing legislation that destroys our economy.”\nSen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH) took some real shots at Massad, quibbling over his definition of ‘native token’ by saying “this is why we need to have this market structure legislation because the idea that we would turn over this industry to some bureaucrat working at some agency is insane … when you have people who are just completely … lacking the fundamental technical base.”\nThe Senate may not have a bill to discuss, but the House of Representatives is advancing its CLARITY Act, which is scheduled for a floor vote next week. That left Senate committee members and witnesses largely discussing what they liked or didn’t like about CLARITY, speaking mainly in general terms, with the pro/con sides mostly living up to their reputations.\nHowever, there were a few unexpected moments, particularly when Kennedy commented on the pro-crypto witnesses all declaring digital assets to be ‘different’ and thus requiring bespoke rules to govern them.\nWhile Kennedy said he largely agreed with this, the request reminded him of how Congress had let the current tech giants “draft their own rules and, uh, frankly … what we got as a result looks like somebody knocked over a urine sample.”\nMuch of the discussion involved CLARITY assigning primary responsibility for digital asset oversight to the CFTC, leaving only a minor role for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nHowever, Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) noted that CLARITY would exempt certain digital assets from SEC oversight if they were deemed to be “collectible or as art or as something that has inherent value or utility.” Smith called this “a loophole you could drive a truck through and I don’t think that is an accident.”\nMassad agreed, saying CLARITY contained an ‘innovation exemption’ for so-called ‘mature’ blockchain systems. The definition is vague and reliant on the principals behind these networks to self-report only their intention to achieve ‘mature’ status, effectively allowing them to embark upon ICO-style fundraising like it was 2017 all over again.\nMost of the Dems on the committee singled out Trump’s crypto ties and the need for clear conflict-of-interest rules. But Sen. Bill Haggerty (R-TN), who helped steer the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act through the Senate last month, dismissed these comments, noting that many Dems made similar pronouncements before ultimately voting in favor of GENIUS.\nCoinbase spends/warns Congress not to screw this up\nGiven the CFTC’s featured role in the looming crypto regulatory landscape, the Senate Agriculture Committee has scheduled its own hearing for July 15. The hearing, titled ‘Stakeholder Perspectives on Federal Oversight of Digital Commodities,’ has yet to release its witness list or other details.\nIn the meantime, crypto operators are ratcheting up their lobbying pressure on Congress. On July 7, the Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) digital asset exchange‘s grassroots/astroturf group, Stand with Crypto, delivered a letter” to the House of Representatives. The letter was “signed by over 65 Crypto Founders representing 6,100+ jobs across 21 states,” all of them urging House members to support CLARITY.\nThe letter struck an ominous tone, claiming that crypto is “approaching a pivotal crossroads” but “[t]here are already signs of U.S. crypto leadership slipping.” A ‘no’ vote on CLARITY will push “talent and businesses to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions abroad,” and “the U.S. risks falling behind unless we adopt pro-crypto policies that fully embrace blockchain technology.”\nOn July 8, Coinbase paid for a full-page ad in the Washington Post claiming that “America voted pro-crypto” and thus it is “time for Congress to act.” (Emphasis in the original.) Similar ads appeared in the Wall Street Journal along with video ads on X and Facebook, as well as physical ads at D.C. bus stops and on billboards.\nThe Hill reported that Coinbase’s ad campaign was a “six-figure” spend and quoted Kara Calvert, Coinbase’s VP of U.S. policy, warning politicians that “crypto voters are watching” to see how they vote on bills during the House’s ‘crypto week.’\nAmong the bills expected to come up for floor votes in the House next week are CLARITY, GENIUS, and the 2025 version of Rep. Tom Emmer’s Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act.\nSome House Dems have already signaled that they won’t vote in favor of CLARITY unless GOP leaders agree to add guardrails to restrict the Trump family from profiting off their burgeoning crypto ventures.\nOn July 8, Politico quoted Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) saying “For me, and I suspect for some other Democrats, if we can satisfy this question of conflict of interest—meaning there’s a prohibition on the president being an issuer — a lot of us can get to ‘yes.'” Himes claimed that GOP leadership was “working in good faith to try to get us to ‘yes.'”\nIt’s worth noting that leaked chat group messages suggest Dems will engage in this kind of performative resistance before they inevitably ‘get to yes,’ because an actual ‘no’ vote might result in big-spending crypto groups targeting them for destruction ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\nTrump family crypto ventures not letting up\nThe reach of Trump-related crypto activity grew a little wider this week on news that Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) had filed an application with the SEC for its third crypto-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) that it hopes to launch “later this year.”\nTMTG’s first ETF focused on BTC, while the second was a mix of BTC (75%) and ETH (25%). This new ‘blue chip ETF’ application is a multi-token affair, comprising BTC (70%), ETH (15%), SOL (8%), CRO (5%), and XRP (2%).\nThe Crypto.com exchange will act as this blue-chip ETF’s “exclusive digital asset custodian and prime execution agent, as well as staking and liquidity provider.” The announcement lit a fire under CRO, the native token of Crypto.com’s Cronos chain. CRO started Tuesday at $0.08, then shot up by one-fifth to just under $0.10, before retreating slightly to $0.096 as of mid-Wednesday.Earlier Wednesday, Thumzup Media Corporation informed the SEC that a certain Donald Trump Jr. now held 350,000 shares in the company worth ~$3.3 million as of Wednesday’s closing price of $9.50. That’s down 23% from Tuesday’s close of $12.36, but still better than their position below $7 on July 1.\nBloomberg reported that Don Jr. acquired the shares “on the recommendation of his investment adviser and has no other involvement with the company.” However, the $6 million private placement of Thumzup shares was handled by Dominari Securities, whose parent company Don Jr. and his brother Eric serve as advisers.\nThumzup is a struggling social media firm that posted revenue of $151 (not a typo) in the first quarter of this year, resulting in a net loss of $2.1 million. On January 7, Thumzup announced it had bought 9.8 BTC worth ~$1 million at the time as part of a previously announced plan to join the crypto treasury hordes. Thumzup announced this week that it now holds 19.1 BTC and will soon add ETH, XRP, SOL, DOGE, and LITE to its treasury.\nWe’re not done recapping all things Trump, as Justin Sun, founder of the TRON network, declared Wednesday that “[w]e are committed to buying $100M of” the president’s $TRUMP memecoin. ‘We’ in this case is likely a reference to TRON, which revealed this week that it would launch $TRUMP (previously available only on Solana) at some point in the not-too-distant future.\nSun has been among the biggest backers of the president’s crypto ventures, having previously purchased over $20 million worth of $TRUMP. That followed Sun purchasing $75 million worth of WLFI, the governance token of the Trump-linked decentralized finance (DeFi) platform World Liberty Finance (WLF). (Sun’s big-spending ways scored him an appointment as a WLF advisor.)\nThat’s still not the end, as the Bybit exchange announced Wednesday that it had officially listed USD1, the WLF stablecoin that made its debut this spring. Bybit joins Binance, Bitget, MEXC, and the Sun-affiliated HTX (formerly Huobi), as well as decentralized exchanges such as PancakeSwap and Sun.io, in making USD1 available to their users.\nBybit is celebrating the launch by giving away $300,000 worth of USD1 to users who make trades with USD1, which is currently paired only with USDT (Tether) and MNT (Mantle), but it’s still in the early days.\nDWF-backed stablecoin depegs\nSpeaking of Trump-linked stables, market-maker DWF Labs is coming under fire after Falcon Labs’ dollar-denominated Falcon USD (USDF) stablecoin abruptly lost its 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar late July 7. The token briefly dipped below $0.98 before regaining some ground but had yet to regain its full 1:1 peg as of late Wednesday.\nThe depeg appears to have been sparked by fresh concerns over USDF’s liquidity and lingering concerns over the soundness of the reserve assets backing the ~$547 million in circulating USDF. Concerns over USDF aren’t new, as ChainArgos recounted the project’s lack of adequate data disclosure back in March.\nOn July 8, DWF/Falcon Finance managing partner Andrei Grachev tweeted “a short summary” of Falcon’s activities in a bid to calm the waters. Grachev claimed USDF’s “reserves are audited,” but Falcon’s transparency page suggests it’s only the protocol’s smart contracts that are audited.\nThe company handling USDF’s reserve reports stresses that “we have not performed any procedures over the control and ownership of the above assets, nor any procedures over whether any security has been placed on these assets.”\nGrachev claimed the transparency page was being updated “next week” to show “a proper assets breakdown, lock BTC, stables, altcoins.” Given Grachev’s previous claims re USDF’s ‘audits,’ only time will tell whether the update meets user expectations.\nIf you’re wondering what this has to do with Trump, DWF recently struck a ‘strategic liquidity partnership’ with the Bitget exchange to promote USD1 adoption. DWF also purchased $25 million worth of WLFI (which might soon be tradable on the open market, pending the results of a governance vote).\nStorm brewing over Tornado Cash founder’s trial\nDuring his Senate committee testimony on Wednesday, Chainalysis CEO Levin was asked about the role that ‘coin mixing’ services like Tornado Cash play in facilitating illicit finance.\nLevin acknowledged mixers’ role in obfuscating the trail of digital assets but claimed “it’s possible to continue to trace through certain types of mixers in certain instances.” Levin also claimed his company has “seen less use of mixers in the context of terrorist financing actually than you would expect.”\nWhile it’s true that obfuscation options aren’t limited to mixers—cross-chain bridges and decentralized exchanges also play a role—terrorists and other criminals do make frequent use of mixers. Last month, the individuals behind the 2023 hack of Singapore’s Bitrue exchange began laundering $22 million in stolen tokens through Tornado Cash.\nNorth Korea’s infamous Lazarus Group of hackers has also patronized mixers like Tornado Cash, leading the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) to file charges of money laundering and sanctions violations against the mixer’s co-founders in 2023. The trial of one of those co-founders, Roman Storm, is set to start on July 14. Last month, Storm tweeted that if he loses his case, “DeFi dies with me.”\nAhead of the trial, there has been the usual flurry of motions to determine what evidence will be permitted, what experts will give testimony, and the like. At a pre-trial hearing this week, U.S. District Court Judge Katherine Polk Failla granted the Storm team’s motion to bar discussion of the sanctions imposed on Tornado Cash by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in August 2022.\nFailla claimed the trial was already too complicated for a jury without including the sanctions discussion, particularly since OFAC’s new management lifted those sanctions in March. However, Failla warned that she might yet allow a “unicorn document” that prosecutors might introduce regarding Storm’s post-sanction activities.\nFailla also won’t allow testimony referring to ‘the Van Loon case,’ a reference to the civil suit filed by several Tornado Cash users who claimed OFAC had no right to apply sanctions on software. Last November, a federal appeals court ruled that OFAC couldn’t sanction Tornado Cash’s smart contracts. The same court later ruled that smart contracts aren’t property and thus they’re beyond OFAC’s ability to sanction.\nWhile Failla’s rulings were a mixed bag for Storm, he likely took heart from the fact that the Treasury Department announced this week that it was dropping its appeal of the November sanctions ruling. Treasury claimed the issue was moot following OFAC’s delisting of Tornado Cash.\nIn another positive development, when the House was advancing the CLARITY Act, it included language excluding “any ‘non-controlling blockchain developer or provider of a blockchain service’ from having to conform to money transmitting rules and regulations.” This language was previously part of a standalone bill called the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act. So perhaps DeFi will survive just fine regardless of Storm’s fate.\nNot helping, guys…\nEarlier this month, Storm gave his first podcast interview since his indictment. Speaking to Crypto in America, Storm offered the standard DeFi defense that all he and his fellow developers did was write code and had no control over how their tools were used.\nThat defense didn’t save Alexey Pertsev, the Tornado Cash developer who was sentenced to 64 months in prison in May 2024 after a Dutch court convicted him of facilitating money laundering. Pertsev was released from pre-trial detention in February as he prepares to appeal his sentence.\nAround the same time, Pertsev received $1.25 million from the Ethereum Foundation to help pay his legal bills. Pertsev received a similar amount from venture capital firm Paradigm the previous month.\nThe Ethereum Foundation also donated $500,000 to Storm’s legal fund, offering to match a further $750,000 in community donations, for which Storm offered “a huge, heartfelt THANK YOU.”\nLess helpful was the $24,000 sent to Storm’s defense fund by the individual(s) who exploited the Cork Protocol in May. Last month, PeckShield reported that the hacker(s) were busy laundering $11 million worth of stolen ETH through Tornado Cash, but apparently felt the need to throw Storm a bone for building such a fine product. Storm later tweeted that he “couldn’t accept such funds” and returned the stolen loot to the Cork team.\nWatch: Bringing the Metanet to life with Teranode", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "author": "Steven Stradbrooke", "source": "https://coingeek.com/feed/"}
{"title": "Congress ‘crypto week’ adds new event; Trump adds new token", "url": "https://coingeek.com/congress-crypto-week-adds-new-event-trump-adds-new-token/", "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nCongress keeps adding more events to ‘Crypto Week,’ while President Trump’s family keeps adding more crypto money-making opportunities.\n- More hearings, more pleas to be included\n- Trump Media’s utility token plans take shape\n- Justin Sun and the phantom UAE fund\n- IRS purges’ DeFi broker’ rule; OCC leader confirmed\n- Stablecoins, T-bills and an uncertain future\nOn July 16, the House of Representatives Committee on Ways & Means’ Oversight subcommittee will hold a hearing titled ‘Making America the Crypto Capital of the World: Ensuring Digital Asset Policy Built for the 21st Century.’\nAccording to Committee Chair Jason Smith (R-MO), the hearing will focus on “the affirmative steps needed to place a tax policy framework on digital assets.” The hearing will be part of a crypto-focused period the House has dubbed ‘crypto week’ that will see floor votes on market structure legislation (the House’s CLARITY Act), stablecoins (the Senate’s GENIUS Act) and Tom Emmer’s revived anti-central bank digital currency (CBDC) legislation.\nThe House has yet to put forward any tax-specific crypto proposals, but Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) recently introduced a bill that addresses multiple angles of crypto taxation. While the House has its own stablecoin bill (STABLE Act), they appear ready to vote on GENIUS as is, so it’s possible that they could adopt Lummis’s tax plan, assuming she can first muscle it through her own chamber.\nWhile the Senate is now rumored to be dropping a market structure discussion draft sometime next week, the chamber could also take up CLARITY without too much revisions. The Senate has yet to introduce a market structure bill of its own, merely a set of ‘principles,’ which rendered Wednesday’s Senate Banking Committee hearing on market structure regulation a rather inconsequential affair.\nThe possibility of the Senate leaning on CLARITY to get market structure done in a timely fashion got a boost on Wednesday from Committee member John Kennedy (R-LA), who told Semafor that “[i]n terms of the Senate starting from scratch drafting a market structure bill, it makes no sense to me.”\nAmidst all this regulatory revamping, state securities regulators are asking Senate leaders not to exclude them from playing a role in crypto oversight. On July 7, the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) sent a letter to Senators Tim Scott (R-SC) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), the chair and ranking member, respectively, of the Senate Banking Committee.\nThe letter asks that, as the Senate ponders market structure legislation, that it “preserve the critical role that state securities regulators play in our capital markets as fighters of fraud, market manipulation, and similar abuses.” Failing to do so “would have net-negative, significant consequences for Americans.”\nThe problem the NASAA faces is that the market structure plan Congress is advancing doesn’t foresee a major role for the federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), instead leaving the bulk of crypto oversight to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), despite the latter agency being rather depleted at present.\nSo NASAA president Leslie Van Buskirk may well feel that she has “no reason to believe our federal partners would come close to making up the difference if my state colleagues and I were denied the opportunity to pursue and address fraud.” It just might not matter much, unfortunately.\nTrump Media offers non-woke token (woken?)\nDemocrats have attempted to amend every crypto bill with language that would restrict the ability of President Trump and his family to profit off crypto ventures. But these efforts have all failed to date, and the Trump crypto empire just keeps growing.\nOn July 9, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) announced that it had begun “public BETA testing the new Truth+ subscription TV streaming plan, the Patriot Package.” Said package is a curated mix of “premium, non-woke news channels” and other goodies, but for our purposes we’ll focus on the news that subscribers “will accumulate [activity-linked] gems on their Truth Social accounts. These will eventually be tied to a utility token on both Truth Social and Truth+.”\nTMTG revealed in April that it was “exploring the introduction of a utility token,” no doubt encouraged by the enthusiastic (and lucrative) reception given to the president’s $TRUMP memecoin and also to WLFI, the governance token of Trump’s decentralized finance (DeFi) platform World Liberty Financial (WLF).\nWhile TMTG has applied for three different crypto-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and raised $2.4 billion to start its BTC-based ‘treasury,’ the company’s flagship product (the Truth Social platform) remains a ghost town.\nThe New York Times reported this week that 80% of Truth Social traffic is people viewing the president’s posts, and the company has struggled to sell advertising, resulting in a net loss of $31 million in the first quarter of 2025. Truth Social has yet to turn a profit since it went public and its shares are down nearly 45% since the year began.\nUnknown unknowns buying Trump tokens\nWednesday’s news that Justin Sun, founder of the TRON network, planned to buy $100 million worth of $TRUMP wasn’t all that surprising, given Sun’s other gestures of fealty towards Trump’s crypto ventures. Sun previously purchased $20 million worth of $TRUMP and $75 million worth of WLFI, the latter purchase earning Sun a role as WLF advisor.\nSpeaking to Coindesk, Sun called $TRUMP “a very important memecoin and a globally-recognized [intellectual property].” TRON recently announced that it was preparing to launch $TRUMP, which was previously available only on the Solana chain. Sun called $TRUMP “the currency of [Trump’s Make America Great Again movement]” and claimed TRON “will make TRUMP token very popular in Asia and in the rest of the world.”Late last month, WLF announced that it had sold $100 million worth of WLFI to the Aqua1 Foundation, a ‘Web3-native fund’ based in the United Arab Emirates. WLF said the two entities shared a goal to “help accelerate the creation of a blockchain-powered financial ecosystem centered on blockchain development, Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, and stablecoin integration.” (The stablecoin in question is likely WLF’s USD1, which launched this spring.)\nBut crypto critic Jacob Silverman just published a report in The Nation detailing his inability to determine who or what comprises Aqua1. Silverman claimed there is “very little evidence that Aqua 1 Foundation exists at all,” including no corporate registration or other official filings in UAE public records.\nSilverman had a similar lack of luck pinning down Aqua1’s purported co-founder Dave Lee, who appears to share Aqua1’s lack of official documentation. Nor did anyone from WLF respond to Silverman’s queries.\nIn June, prior to the $100 million WLFI purchase announcement, WLF’s official crypto wallet sent $800 million worth of the token to a digital wallet labeled aqua1.eth. That wallet then sent $80 million worth of USDT (Tether) back to WLF. The USDT came from an unknown wallet on Bybit, a UAE-based exchange that just announced support for USD1.\nSilverman acknowledged that Aqua1 may indeed be a legit UAE company, although he also notes that “[s]omeone can spin up a website and press release and send $80 million worth of crypto to the US president’s associates without leaving the couch.”\nThe WLFI token is currently used only to vote on WLF governance proposals, but a new proposal was launched this week on whether to lift restrictions on trading WLFI on the open crypto market. On July 9, WLF tweeted that “[a]fter receiving overwhelming support on the forum, it’s clear, the community is ready” to unfetter WLFI.\nTreasury offshoots ditching rules, adding leaders\nIn other U.S. news, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) formally expunged the so-called ‘DeFi broker’ rule from the U.S. tax code on Thursday. The deeply unpopular rule required non-custodial platforms to collect and submit the same level of customer information as traditional brokers.\nFollowing last November’s elections, both chambers of Congress moved swiftly to finalize and approve resolutions that would expunge the DeFi language from the IRS playbook. President Trump signed the legislation into law in April, making Thursday’s announcement something of a formality, but welcome nonetheless.\nThe IRS is an offshoot of the Treasury Department, as is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which formally welcomed their new leader on Thursday. Jonathan Gould, a former chief legal officer at blockchain infrastructure firm Bitfury who once served as OCC deputy counsel, was nominated as the next OCC chief in February and approved by the Senate on Thursday.\nOddly enough, pro-crypto Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) initially signalled she was opposed to confirming Gould. Lummis reportedly wanted to have “further conversations” with Gould regarding his positions on stablecoins “and Federal pre-emption of state banking laws.” Whatever her concerns, Lummis eventually voted to approve Gould.\nStablecoins, T-bills, and an uncertain future\nThe total value of all U.S. Treasury bills held by stablecoin issuers reportedly topped $182 billion this week, which, if the sector was a country, would slot it between Saudi Arabia and Norway. We say ‘reportedly’ because some stablecoin issuers have never allowed respected third parties to verify that the T-bills they claim to hold as their reserve assets actually exist.\nOne of the major drivers of stablecoin legislation in the U.S. is the mantra that their wider adoption in markets outside America will help preserve the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency. Stablecoins are also expected to shore up America’s dodgy finances due to requirements for U.S.-approved issuers to hold their reserves in a narrow range of fiat assets, primarily T-bills.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested issuers would ultimately need to buy $2 trillion worth of T-bills by 2028 and $3.7 trillion by 2030. Less partisan opinions put this range as low as half a trillion.\nThe reality is nobody really knows, but one thing is sure: issuers won’t be buying long-term T-bills (the kind America prefers to sell) due to issuers’ need to be able to meet a large volume of redemptions without delay, just in case. Most issuers opt for T-bills with maturity dates of 90 days or under.\nThat may be why Treasury announced this week that it was increasing its issuance of T-bills, with a focus on four-, six-, and eight-week bills, for a total new issuance of ~$190 billion. The government likes them because they pay lower rates of interest than the five- and 10-year variety, but it also exposes the government to the possibility of pricier financing costs should interest rates suddenly lurch upward.\nTreasury’s focus on short-term T-bills is also a reflection of the rest of the world’s growing unease with the state of America’s finances, specifically, its ability to pay its debts a year from now, let alone five or ten years. Should that worst-case scenario manifest itself, stablecoins’ ability to do anything to save America will be a drop in the ocean. C’mon in, the water’s, uh, warm?\nWatch: Teranode is the digital backbone of Bitcoin", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "author": "Steven Stradbrooke", "source": "https://coingeek.com/feed/"}
{"title": "OCC’s New Chief Could Redefine Crypto-Banking Relations in the U.S.", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/occs-new-chief-could-redefine-crypto-banking-relations-in-the-us", "text": "Jonathan Gould’s appointment as Comptroller of the Currency is expected to shift the regulatory landscape for crypto in U.S. banking, raising both industry hopes and concerns over centralizing federal oversight.\nJonathan Gould Confirmed as New OCC Head\nThe U.S. Senate has confirmed Jonathan Gould as the new Comptroller of the Currency, a pivotal role in the country’s financial regulatory framework. Gould, a former senior executive at blockchain infrastructure firm Bitfury, secured the position following a narrow 50-45 Senate vote, marking another key appointment under President Donald Trump’s administration aimed at reshaping crypto regulation in the United States.\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a bureau within the U.S. Treasury, plays a vital yet often understated role in overseeing national banks and shaping federal policy on financial innovation, including digital assets. Gould’s confirmation is expected to influence how traditional banking institutions interact with cryptocurrencies over the next five years.\nCrypto-Friendly Track Record\nJonathan Gould brings a history of crypto advocacy to the OCC. During his previous tenure at the agency, Gould served as senior deputy comptroller and chief counsel, working under Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks. Brooks, known for his pro-crypto stance, championed regulatory frameworks that opened doors for digital asset firms, including granting Anchorage Digital the first federal crypto bank charter. After Brooks left to head Bitfury, Gould followed, serving as the company’s chief legal officer.\nAt the OCC, Gould had previously supported policies enabling U.S. banks to offer crypto custody services and backed early moves towards integrating digital assets into regulated financial infrastructure. His return could set the stage for further initiatives aimed at expanding banks’ roles in the crypto economy, particularly in areas like stablecoin management and Bitcoin ETF options trading.\nRegulatory Balance and Centralization Concerns\nWhile Gould’s appointment has been welcomed by parts of the crypto industry, it raises concerns about the centralization of authority over digital asset oversight. Critics argue that consolidating power within a single federal agency might sideline state-level initiatives and, depending on political shifts, expose the sector to abrupt regulatory reversals.\nThe previous administration under President Joe Biden took a markedly cautious approach to crypto, with federal regulators including the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issuing stringent guidelines for banks engaging with digital assets. These measures, seen by industry players as restrictive, included accusations of cutting off crypto firms from essential banking services.\nGould’s confirmation could mark a reversal of that strategy, potentially positioning the OCC as a more crypto-friendly agency. However, the risk remains that if political tides turn against digital assets, the same centralized control could make it harder for crypto-friendly states and local regulators to maintain supportive environments.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With a 75 percent spike and Bitcoin eyeing a new all-time high, the BTC Bull price chart is lighting up across Telegram and TradingView. For some, this might feel like 2021 again. For others, it’s a signal to look harder at what’s rising beneath the surface.\nWhile BTC Bull is having a moment, BlockDAG (BDAG) is building a movement. Its presale has already smashed through $336 million, and with over 2 million users already on its X1 mobile mining app, it’s not waiting on hype; it’s creating real traction. And in this market, traction is currency.\nBTC Bull Makes a Move With Price & Prediction Buzz\nIt’s not every day a new meme token jumps 75 percent. But BTC Bull token’s price is on the move, and traders are watching closely. The BTC Bull price chart shows strong short-term volume, and analysts are now dropping bullish takes around a possible parabolic move.\nWhile the market adjusts to Bitcoin’s own push, BTC Bull’s price prediction chatter is picking up speed. Some are calling for 5x moves, others see the pump as a positioning play while Bitcoin retraces. Regardless, the token has broken into the wider conversation, especially as it moves across meme and BTC-maxi communities.\nBut as always in crypto, questions linger. Can BTC Bull maintain this momentum? Or is this a peak-before-plateau scenario? Without a broader ecosystem or roadmap, it’s tough to say what carries this past the hype cycle. Still, for now, eyes are locked on the next leg of the BTC Bull price chart.\nBlockDAG’s X1 App Hits 2M+ Miners as Presale Crushes $336M\nWhile meme tokens are riding waves, BlockDAG is building the beach. Its X1 miner app, which is a tap-to-mine mobile tool that’s already drawn over 2 million users, is turning daily engagement into network power. This isn’t just another crypto app; the X1 miner is built for scale. It lets users mine BDAG directly from their phones with zero hardware, and with over 2 million people already using it, BlockDAG is proving it can onboard at speed while keeping things simple.\nThat traction has helped fuel one of the biggest crypto presales in years. BlockDAG has already raised over $336 million, locking in serious attention from both traders and developers. And with a fixed presale price of $0.0016 until August 11, the entry window is still open. But what’s more important is what’s being built behind the numbers.\nThe app is just one piece of the broader rollout, but it proves a key point. Real utility scales fast when it’s frictionless. BlockDAG isn’t waiting for a CEX listing or influencer pump. It’s onboarding users now, and those users are doing more than speculating; they’re mining, engaging, and positioning for mainnet.\nIn a cycle driven by hype, BlockDAG is executing. The numbers don’t just look good; they represent activity, adoption, and trust in the build.\nFast Charts vs Long-Term Play\nThe BTC Bull token price spike is real, and for short-term traders, that’s enough. The BTC Bull price chart shows volume, heat, and shows that meme energy still lives large in the right pockets of the market.\nBut what happens when the candles fade? A BTC Bull price prediction today might say 10x, but tomorrow’s forecast depends on more than momentum. Without a utility layer or community-driven ecosystem, holding power becomes the question.\nBlockDAG doesn’t live on speculation alone. With over 2 million users on the X1 app and a presale breaking records, its foundation is already working. The engagement isn’t hypothetical; it’s active, measurable, and designed for the long haul. In a side-by-side view, one chart shows hype. The other shows infrastructure.\nWrapping Up\nThe BTC Bull token price is flying, no doubt about it. The buzz, the breakout, and the BTC Bull price chart are turning heads. Even the most cautious are paying attention, and the BTC Bull price prediction crowd is louder than ever.\nBut in a cycle where every breakout is followed by a reset, the projects with utility tend to keep moving while others stall. And BlockDAG is proving exactly what that looks like. With 2 million+ users actively mining through X1 and a $336 million presale continuing to climb, it’s not chasing moments, it’s building continuous momentum with no signs of stopping any time soon.\nTraders might play BTC Bull, but the smart money is watching BlockDAG.\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Forget Complex Rigs - Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Creates Instant Wealth Opportunity", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/how-to-mine-bitcoin-forget-complex-rigs-bitcoin-solaris-mobile-mining-creates-instant-wealth-opportunity", "text": "Ask any newcomer to crypto how to mine Bitcoin and you’ll get one of two reactions: a spark of curiosity or a look of immediate regret. The concept sounds cool until you’re hit with GPU specs, energy bills, and warehouse-level complexity. That dream of becoming a crypto miner suddenly feels more like signing up for a second job.\nBut what if mining didn’t require a machine louder than a jet engine or a monthly electricity bill the size of a mortgage?\nThat’s the opportunity Bitcoin Solaris is opening up. And it’s flipping the idea of mining on its head.\nHow to mine Bitcoin Solaris: One phone, one click, real rewards\nBitcoin Solaris isn’t just creating another token. It’s building a system that makes wealth generation simple, accessible, and instant, even for people with zero mining experience.\nThrough the exciting release of the Solaris Nova App, BTC-S will allow users to mine directly from their smartphones. There’s no need for external hardware, no complex configurations. Just tap and go. That’s it.\nThe app is designed for global accessibility and operates within the dual-consensus architecture of BTC-S, which combines Proof-of-Work with Delegated Proof-of-Stake to balance decentralization with efficiency.\nHere’s how it works:\n-\nYou download the app when it becomes available.\n-\nYou tap once a day to validate presence and earn mining time.\n-\nThe app runs secure micro-processes that simulate contribution, verified through network consensus.\nThe real magic? It’s designed to consume up to 99.95% less energy than traditional mining. You get participation and real rewards without needing anything beyond your phone and an internet connection.\nThe Future of Crypto Doesn’t Wait BTC-S Is Already Moving\nA deeper look into the BTC-S tech edge\nOnce you scratch beneath the surface, you realize BTC-S isn’t just another “convenience coin.” The technical depth behind the project is what gives it real staying power:\n-\n10,000+ transactions per second, backed by an optimized dual-layer architecture.\n-\nValidator rotation system for fairness and increased decentralization.\n-\nSmart contract capabilities that support enterprise, DeFi, and gaming.\n-\nCross-chain compatibility, including seamless Solana bridge integration.\n-\nEnergy efficiency that rivals the greenest solutions in blockchain.\nThis infrastructure is being taken seriously. A full audit has been completed by both Cyberscope and Freshcoins, confirming the system is built to scale and designed to perform.\nEven established influencers are highlighting the project’s potential. One recent review by Crypto League laid out how the BTC-S mobile-first vision could be one of the biggest shifts in blockchain adoption this year. And from the looks of it, the hype isn’t just noise.\nPresale firestorm and the rare rollback moment\nCurrently in phase 11, the Bitcoin Solaris presale is lighting up the charts. At a price of $11, with a launch target of $20, the momentum is backed by over 14,150+ users and more than $6.6 million raised in a matter of weeks.\nBut here’s the twist.\nBitcoin Solaris has activated a rare Price Rollback, allowing new buyers to get in at $5 instead of $11, but only for a very short time. It’s not a discount. It’s a rebalancing move built into the system’s flexibility to allow more early adopters access. For anyone who missed Bitcoin under $100, this rollback might be the closest déjà vu they’ll ever get.\nTo receive your tokens on launch day, wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless delivery. This ensures a smooth handoff once the presale ends on July 31, 2025.\nLiquid staking that doesn’t lock you out\nBTC-S also introduces liquid staking, a model that offers rewards without restricting liquidity. Tokens staked are converted to sBTC-S 1:1, which can still be traded or used in governance and DeFi protocols.\n-\nYou earn while maintaining full access.\n-\nStaking supports the network without traditional lockups.\n-\nFully integrated with the upcoming Solaris Nova App, offering a smooth, automated process.\nThis flexible staking system is explained in depth in their staking overview and aligns with BTC-S’s philosophy of accessibility without compromise.\nFinal verdict: mining made simple, wealth made possible\nMining isn’t dead. It just needed a rebrand. And Bitcoin Solaris may have nailed it. No cables. No overheating GPUs. Just a vision of crypto where anyone can participate in wealth creation directly from their pocket.\nSo next time someone asks how to mine Bitcoin, maybe you don’t need to explain ASICs and air conditioning. Just mention BTC-S. One app. One tap. One opportunity that might not come around again.\nFor more information on Bitcoin Solaris:\nWebsite: https://www.bitcoinsolaris.com/\nTelegram: https://t.me/Bitcoinsolaris\nX: https://x.com/BitcoinSolaris\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

However, with an impressive increase in utility assets, memecoin investors are moving their assets to other crypto channels to maximize their profits. So far, Unilabs Finance has raised nearly $3.5 million and sold over 920 million tokens. Breakout soon?\nDogecoin Price Trend Suggests Accumulation Despite Market Decline\nDogecoin price action is under attention as DOGE is showing impressive gains in the current market environment. DOGE has finally overcome key resistance levels, with bears losing control over price direction. The Dogecoin price has finally cleared the $0.18 zone and is not expected to continue its rise.\nDOGE is currently trading around the $0.18 level and the 100-hour simple moving average. A short-term bullish trend line has formed with support at $0.17 on the hourly chart. If macro market conditions continue to grow, DOGE could face further resistance near the $0.21 mark.\nA close above this resistance could potentially send the price toward the $0.30 resistance level, which aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level.\nUpcoming Dogecoin Price Support Levels and Downside Risks\nAnother decline could begin if DOGE fails to climb above the $0.21 level. Initial support on the downside is positioned near the $0.17 level, with the next major support at $0.17. The main support sits at $0.16. A downside break below this support could trigger further declines toward the $0.15 level or even $0.15 in the near term.\nDOGE has already swept the liquidity cluster at the local low of $0.17, and the price may recheck support at this level once again before a parabolic rally begins. With bullish price action, some on-chain metrics present a similar picture. The Network Value to Transactions Signal (NVTS) currently sits below its May-June 2024 levels, suggesting the meme coin may be undervalued.\nDogecoin Price Surge Adds $500,000 to Unilabs Presale\nWith memecoin traders looking to shift profits towards stable avenues, Unilabs Finance (UNIL) is gaining institutional attention after a memecoin whale moved nearly half a million into its ongoing presale frenzy.\nWhile DOGE consolidates to stay above $0.18 amid profit-taking and macroeconomic factors, Unilabs Finance offers a 25x alternative. This AI-driven passive income platform allows holders to earn consistent rewards regardless of short-term market volatility. This makes it appealing when many traders search for stability and actual returns in their crypto portfolios.\nUnilabs Finance Among Best Altcoins? Potential 60% Spike Inbound\nUnilabs Finance (UNIL) is making noise with its combination of strong features, including dividends, staking rewards, and governance rights, designed to generate passive income while empowering investors. UNIL token holders are rewarded by receiving periodic profit-sharing payouts straight to their wallets, with staking options letting users earn extra yields.\nOn top, the platform gives its community ‘early access’ to exclusive high-potential projects, whitelisted pools, and premium research privileges typically available to institutional investors only. This model offers protection and upside potential in a market weighed down by regulatory uncertainty and inflation fears.\nUnilabs Finance is positioning itself as a future-proof platform against tightening regulations, inflation concerns, and global financial instability. Its tiered system rewards loyalty and scale, offering higher yields and reduced fees to larger holders while ensuring smaller investors still benefit from fair returns and governance participation.\nConclusion:\nFor those looking for more stable growth compared to DOGE and other memecoins, Unilabs Finance represents a smarter choice where technology, community, and real income streams combine to deliver long-term value, even in choppy market conditions.\nDiscover More About Unilabs Finance:\nPresale: https://www.unilabs.finance/\nBuy Presale: https://buy.unilabs.finance/\nTelegram: https://t.me/s/unilabsofficial\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/unilabsofficial\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Analysts highlight the nearest resistance level at $2787, which ETH might test soon. If it breaks through, the next target is $3047, promising a potential rise of about 14% from the current range.\nWith the relative strength index near 68, ETH indicates strong momentum but is not overbought just yet. This suggests room for further growth. However, caution is advised as the nearest support at around $2269 could slow things down. Keep an eye on the trends as Ethereum continues its upward journey.\nXRP Eyes Resistance Levels as Price Holds Steady\nSource: tradingview\nXRP is currently trading between $2.17 and $2.35, showing a positive short-term trend with a 10.56% growth over the past week. The market is watching for XRP to break above the resistance level of $2.43, which could propel the coin to the next target of $2.61. With a relative strength index just under 68, the asset is near the overbought zone, indicating strong buying interest.\nIf momentum continues, XRP could rise significantly from its current range. A move to $2.61 would mark an increase of over 10% from today’s higher price point.

Into this environment steps PUMP, the soon-to-launch native token of Pump.fun, the popular Solana-based meme coin platform.\nThe timing couldn’t be better either. Set to debut on July 12, the PUMP ICO has already caught the eye of traders and enthusiasts who see it as one of the most exciting meme coin launches of the year, marking an inflection point for the sector.\nPUMP Token Launch And How It Could Change the Meme Coin Space\nPump.fun has become a key platform within the Solana ecosystem by offering something few others manage: a place where anyone can create, launch, and trade meme coins with minimal friction. Its interface allows users to issue tokens tied to trending topics, memes, or ideas, and it takes a small share of the transaction flow. This model has led to an explosion in daily token launches, placing Pump.fun at the center of Solana’s meme coin surge since early 2024.\nthe $PUMP public sale is only two days away!\n— pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) July 10, 2025\nto participate, make sure to verify yourself using the link in the next tweet or on one of our participating exchange’s sites\nfor more info 👇🏻 pic.twitter.com/AN1iEsPC2O\nNow, with the launch of its native PUMP token on July 12, the project is taking a step toward expanding its vision. As per the team behind Pump.fun, the project aims to create a decentralized social platform that moves beyond simple engagement numbers and instead links attention to monetary advantages. By distributing 33% of the total token supply through the ICO at $0.004, and keeping all tokens unlocked from day one, the project opens the door to active trading and community participation from the start.\nWelcome to the bull market.\n— Foxi 🦊 (@Foxi_xyz) July 11, 2025\nEven the top losers are all in positive gain.\nETH will head to $4000 soon and you should only do one thing which is picking the right alts. pic.twitter.com/RpFXiWP6Q1\nHowever, what makes the timing significant is the current market backdrop. Bitcoin’s climb to nearly $119,000 and Ethereum’s move past $3,000 have strengthened crypto’s position as a permanent fixture in the financial world, even for the naysayers now.\nIn moments like this, attention often turns to smaller tokens, especially within the meme coin sector, as traders seek newer, high-potential opportunities. The arrival of PUMP during such a period raises the possibility of energy across the meme coin market. Importantly, it also highlights that this is an environment where investors may look not just at hype-driven coins but also at projects with meaningful ideas and design behind them.\nBesides PUMP, These Could Be the Best Crypto to Buy Now\nToken 6900\nToken 6900 operates within its own carefully crafted ecosystem, designed to offer participatory mechanics for degen crypto investors that go far beyond the usual meme coin formula. While most projects today rely solely on speculative bursts, Token 6900 brings its community directly into the evolution of its growth using a degen design element.\nThese kinds of projects were some of the top gainers in the last bull run, and with the current price surge being seen across top cryptos and funds flowing into altcoins as well, it may not be surprising to see this meme coin also record some sharing of these investments. The project has already been endorsed by top crypto YouTubers like ClayBro and many others.\nWith recent market conditions driving increased attention to altcoins, Token 6900 benefits from this growth not because it follows trends but because it offers something structurally different. Where most tokens fade after initial hype, Token 6900 has structured mechanisms that keep engagement continuous and layered.\nIts presence in the current climate, where projects like PUMP are drawing new eyes to meme coin platforms, gives it the opportunity to attract those looking for projects where value does not end at price charts.\nBy combining cultural awareness with technical design, Token 6900 builds a space that is both playful and deeply interactive, marking it as a project that invites long-term exploration rather than short-term speculation.\nBitcoin Hyper\nBitcoin Hyper approaches the challenge of Bitcoin scalability with a clear intent to improve transaction flow while staying rooted in simplicity. Its Layer 2 framework integrates seamlessly with Bitcoin, creating a system where small, rapid transfers become accessible without the cost and delay of mainnet settlements.\nMore than just adding speed, Bitcoin Hyper introduces adaptive rewards for participants who help secure the network’s performance, creating a shared responsibility model that encourages participation at all levels.\nIn a market where Bitcoin’s new record highs are confirming its role as a core asset, Bitcoin Hyper adds a necessary dimension, which is usability. As capital floods into flagship assets, attention inevitably turns to projects that can extend their functionality. Bitcoin Hyper serves this need, offering a direct path for Bitcoin to move beyond long-term holding and into everyday use, from micropayments to decentralized applications.\nWhat makes Bitcoin Hyper even more appealing right now is its relevance to the broader environment. While meme coin platforms like Pump.fun capture cultural momentum, Bitcoin Hyper offers a technical counterpart that reinforces Bitcoin’s presence across both store-of-value and utility-driven segments. This combination of purpose and timing places it among the projects worth watching closely in the months ahead.\nSnorter\nSnorter reimagines the way crypto traders interact with markets by embedding intelligent tools directly within Telegram, the communication channel most familiar to crypto communities. Instead of pushing out raw price feeds or overwhelming data, Snorter focuses on personalized insights, offering users a curated flow of market movements, token patterns, and on-chain activities that align with their specific interests.\nWhat makes it particularly useful is that it does not just report but also helps users act, integrating with select trading platforms to allow immediate execution of trades without leaving the chat.\nAs the market sees rising demand for altcoins and meme coins following the excitement around launches like PUMP, the need for tools that can navigate this pace has grown sharply. Snorter addresses this need with a system that adapts over time, learning from user behavior to refine the kind of intelligence it delivers. This approach cuts through the noise that often overwhelms traders, allowing for faster, clearer decisions in volatile conditions.\nSnorter’s importance lies in its combination of simplicity and function. It brings advanced monitoring, decision support, and action tools together in a space already central to crypto communication. In a market setting where speed and adaptability often define success, Snorter offers something practical with a way to stay informed and responsive without being buried in complexity.\nBest Wallet Token\nBest Wallet Token is the native asset of Best Wallet, a Web3 wallet designed to bring together security, simplicity, and multi-chain access in one place. The project gained popularity in recent weeks for its focus on creating a unified experience across blockchain ecosystems without forcing users to navigate the technical details typically involved in cross-chain transactions.\nWhether holding major assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum or managing tokens on networks like Solana or Polygon, Best Wallet offers a streamlined interface that handles it all in the background.\nThe Best Wallet Token also plays a key role in this system. Holders can access reduced fees, participate in governance, and benefit from reward mechanisms tied to wallet activity. The token is not just a passive asset; it is deeply connected to how the platform evolves. This relationship between token utility and platform development encourages an active community, where users help shape upgrades, new integrations, and the roadmap ahead.\nWith the crypto market completely heating up and meme coin launches like PUMP drawing attention to new segments, infrastructure projects like Best Wallet stand to benefit from increased activity.\nAs more users enter the space looking for practical tools to manage their assets, Best Wallet’s design positions it as a go-to solution. It combines function with accessibility, offering an entry point not only into trading but into a more efficient way of engaging with the crypto landscape as a whole.\nConclusion\nThe crypto market is moving through one of its most charged periods in recent memory, with momentum building across major tokens and smaller projects alike. In this environment, the launch of PUMP stands out as a moment with real weight.\nComing from a platform already deeply rooted in the meme coin space, PUMP brings with it the strength of an engaged community and a concept designed to build something lasting, not just temporary excitement. Its potential for growth is not tied to speculation alone but comes from how it connects user participation with purpose and direction.\nThe current market mood rewards those who look carefully at what lies beneath each project, searching for those that balance creativity with a clear role in the space. The options mentioned above, much like PUMP, seem to share similar characteristics, making them top options to consider alongside PUMP for potentially higher returns this season.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

BTC soared to a new all-time high, just days after crossing $112,000, as it raced to $118,403 before registering a marginal decline and moving to its current level. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 5% in the past 24 hours, trading around $116,617.\nMeanwhile, ETH rallied over 7%, reaching an intraday high of $2,972 before moving to its current level of $2,963. Ripple (XRP) also traded in positive territory, with the price up over 6%, trading around $2.56. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) crossed the crucial $160 mark thanks to the market rally. The altcoin is up almost 5%, trading around $164. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up over 10%, trading around $0.198, while Cardano (ADA) is up almost 11%, trading around $0.685. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Toncoin (TON), Litecoin (LTC), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable gains.\nRemixpoint Raises $215 Million To Expand Bitcoin Holdings\nEnergy company Remixpoint has raised 31.5 billion yen ($215 million) to expand its Bitcoin treasury. The firm will allocate all the raised funds to purchase BTC. Remixpoint raised the funds through its 25th series of stock acquisition rights and a fourth series of unsecured bonds. The series of stock acquisition rights will create over 55 million new shares, and represents a 39.5% share dilution. Remixpoint is currently the 30th largest corporate Bitcoin treasury, holding 1,051 BTC. The firm plans to increase its holdings to 3,000 BTC in the near term.\nThe news comes after Remixpoint announced that CEO Takashi Tashiro will be paid in Bitcoin as part of the company’s efforts to be “in the same boat” as its shareholders. Remixpoint’s board has unanimously approved its Bitcoin investment strategy, highlighting the potential to enhance corporate value from a risk-return perspective while preserving flexibility.\n“We have become even more convinced of Bitcoin’s future, and this decision is the result of extensive discussions. We understand the difference between seizing opportunities and playing it safe, as well as the distinction between a challenge and recklessness.”\nUS Treasury Officially Removes Controversial Biden-era Reporting Rule\nIn a big win for DeFi platform compliance with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the US Treasury Department officially removed the controversial DeFi broker reporting rules. The Biden-era rule required DeFi platforms to issue IRS 1099-DA forms for all user transactions. The repeal was part of an earlier act in which the US Congress repealed the rule. President Donald Trump signed the bill in April. Several DeFi-friendly congressmen viewed the rule as a burden on DeFi platforms. They also believed it went against the principles of decentralization.\nUnder the new reporting rules, DeFi platforms will be exempt from several compliance requirements. These include know your customer (KYC) rules and transaction reporting. Additionally, the Congressional Review Act mechanism also ensures the IRS cannot issue a substantially similar rule in the future unless authorized by Congress. However, the repeal is applicable only to non-custodial DeFi applications, with centralized exchanges still subject to 1099-DA forms.\nBitcoin (BTC) Could Move To $120,000\nPredictions that Bitcoin’s (BTC) latest rally could soar past $120,000 during its latest bull run are on track, with the flagship cryptocurrency crossing $118,000 during the ongoing session and showing no signs of slowing down. While BTC is soaring to record levels, altcoins are emerging as bigger winners, with Ethereum (ETH) crossing the crucial $3,000 mark, and Ripple (XRP) surging past $2.50. ETH is up over 8%, while XRP is up 7%, with buyers firmly in control. BTC broke past $112,000 on Thursday after weeks of trading in range, and continued its uptrend on Friday. Analysts have stated that there is clear evidence of renewed spot demand and conviction buying.\n“Bitcoin’s latest breakout above $112,000 confirms the market has broken out of its ‘indecisive’ phase. There's clear evidence of renewed spot demand and conviction buying.”\nThe flagship cryptocurrency’s market dominance has also reached multi-year highs. Strong ETF demand, exchange outflows, and corporate treasuries are giving significant bullish signals for the Bitcoin market.\nAltcoins Surge\nBitcoin’s (BTC) dominance jumping to multi-year highs has raised questions about altcoins. While BTC is cornering significant capital, altcoins have significant potential for a rally. According to analysts, an altcoin rally could likely come down to macroeconomic factors.\n“Right now, the trend favors Bitcoin. But just beneath it, altcoins are quietly positioning for a late-summer rotation. But if macro shocks hit (a hawkish Fed pivot or geopolitical escalation), Bitcoin could spike in dominance as risk appetite vanishes.”\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\nBitcoin (BTC) has soared to a new all-time high just hours after crossing $112,000 on Thursday. The flagship cryptocurrency’s latest push was powered by strong demand from retail and institutional investors, and the crypto-friendly policies of the Trump administration. According to analysts from Sygnum Bank, BTC’s latest rally is being driven by its growing recognition as a safe-haven asset. Katalin Tischhauser, the head of research at Sygnum Bank, stated that BTC has outperformed and has been decoupling on days when the S&P 500 and broader markets corrected.\n“This has been supported by Bitcoin’s increasing status as a safe haven asset in the face of fiat debasement, also confirmed by the first US state signing a Bitcoin reserve bill into law, following the federal Bitcoin reserve established by Executive Order.”\nBitcoin reserves across centralized exchanges have also been declining since April, a sign of long-term confidence in the asset. Declining reserves could lead to a supply shock-driven rally. The flagship cryptocurrency raced to a new all-time high of $118,403, barely 24 hours after it crossed $112,000. BTC’s jump past $118,000 triggered a wave of liquidations, wiping out over $1 billion in short contracts in 24 hours. According to data from Coinglass, the value of shorts liquidated on July 10 is the single-largest liquidation event this year. Long contracts worth $120 million were also liquidated in the same timeframe, highlighting the market’s renewed bullish momentum. Derivatives exchange Bybit accounted for most of the liquidations, with $291 million in contracts liquidated, 98% of which were shorts. HTX saw $138 million in liquidations while Gate ($71.8 million), OKX ($54.62 million), and Binance ($54.56 million) completed the top 5.\nAnalysts pointed out that the current breakout is far calmer and structurally sound, and highlighted that despite the surge, important indicators suggest the market is not overheated. BTC’s MVRV ratio stands at 2.2, significantly lower than the overheated levels seen during rallies in March and December 2024. There has also been a shift in investor behavior. Analysts noted that during previous bull markets, short-term holders made up around 30% of the market. However, the current rally has seen that number drop to 15%, meaning less volatility and a lower risk of sudden selloffs. Miners have also remained relatively quiet, while retail investors are largely missing.\nBTC has mostly traded positively since last Tuesday’s low of $105,328. The flagship cryptocurrency recovered from this level, rising nearly 3% and settling at $108,845. Buyers retained control on Thursday as BTC crossed $110,000 for the first time since May, reaching an intraday high of $110,583. The price registered a marginal decline from this level and settled at $109,637. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC was back in the red on Friday, dropping 1.41% to $108,097. Price action returned to positive over the weekend as BTC rose 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,231.\nSource: TradingView\nBTC started the current week in the red, dropping almost 1% to $108,273. However, market sentiment began picking up, with the price rising 0.62% on Tuesday and settling at $108,942. Buyers retained control as BTC rose over 2%, briefly crossing $112,000 for the first time before settling at $111,255. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC raced to an intraday high of $116,401 before settling at $115,159. The flagship cryptocurrency soared past $118,000 during the ongoing session, reaching an intraday high of $118,403 before moving to its current level of $117,255, up almost 2%.\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\nEthereum (ETH) is on the verge of reclaiming $3,000, a level the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has not seen since February 2025. ETH is up nearly 7% in the past 24 hours, as the crypto market soars to new highs. The price had lagged behind BTC this cycle, but the narrative has finally turned bullish thanks to growing ETF inflows and tokenization narratives fueling investor confidence. If ETH closes above $3,000, it could trigger another rally, taking it past the $3,500 mark.\nData analytics platform Swissblocks highlighted that the current scenario for ETH is more bullish than Q2, potentially marking the beginning of alt season. ETH inflows have gained momentum, with institutional demand also rising. Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) ETH futures open interest jumped to $3.27 billion, the highest since February 2. The jump suggests increased institutional positioning, indicating a growing appetite among investors to gain exposure to ETH.\nETH registered a sharp drop on Tuesday (July 1), dropping over 3% to $2,407. Despite the bearish sentiment, the price recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 7% to cross the moving averages and settle at $2,572. Buyers retained control on Thursday as ETH rose 0.79%, reaching an intraday high of $2,636 before settling at $2,592. However, it lost momentum on Friday, dropping over 3% and settling at $2,509. ETH recovered over the weekend, rising 0.35% on Saturday and over 2% on Sunday to settle at $2,572.\nSource: TradingView\nDespite the positive weekend, ETH was back in the red on Monday, dropping 1.12% to $2,543. The price rebounded on Tuesday, rising nearly 3% to cross $2,600 and settle at $2,616. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as ETH rose almost 6% to cross $2,700 and settle at $2,770. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price reached an intraday high of $3,001 before settling at $2,950. The current session sees ETH up over 1%, trading around $2,981. If ETH closes above $3,000, it could extend its rally beyond $3,500. The MACD and RSI show strong bullish sentiment, but ETH could see a small correction before resuming its rally.\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\nSolana (SOL) lost momentum during the ongoing session, with the price marginally down after reaching an intraday high of $166. SOL crossed the crucial $160 mark on Thursday when it raced to $165 before closing at $164. The altcoin’s uptick came amid a jump in market activity as 23-hour trading volumes rose 19% to $4.9 billion, indicating that traders could be readying for a potential breakout. Institutional interest in SOL is also picking up, adding weight to an already-bullish scenario as altcoins get dragged higher by BTC’s jump to a new all-time high. Despite SOL’s impressive performance, it remains substantially lower than its January peak of $294. Analysts, including James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, predict that a Solana ETF could be approved by October.\nSOL registered a substantial drop last Tuesday, falling over 5% to $147. Despite the selling pressure, the price recovered on Wednesday, rising almost 4% to reclaim $150 and settle at $152. SOL reached an intraday high of $156 on Thursday but lost momentum after reaching this level and fell back to $152. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as the price dropped over 3%, slipping below $150 and settling at $147. Sellers retained control on Saturday as SOL registered a marginal decline. However, it recovered on Sunday, rising almost 3% to reclaim $150 and settle at $151.\nSource: TradingView\nSOL was back in the red on Monday, dropping almost 2% and settling at $148. Despite the bearish start to the week, the price recovered on Tuesday, rising nearly 2% to reclaim $150 and settle at $151. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as SOL rose 3.54%, crossing the 50-day SMA and settling at $157. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price soared past $160, reaching an intraday high of $165 before settling at $164. The current session sees SOL marginally down as it runs into resistance around the 200-day SMA. A break above this level could see the price reach $200.\nRipple (XRP) Price Analysis\nRipple (XRP) finally broke above the 200-day SMA and the resistance around $2.20, with bulls controlling the momentum. With a clear bullish structure forming, analysts predict a further uptrend, potentially pushing XRP past $2.70. XRP has largely traded below $2.40 since the end of April, except for a surge to $2.65 in mid-May. The token is up almost 6% in the past 24 hours and over 16% in the past week.\nXRP started the previous week in positive territory despite facing selling pressure and volatility.

A new player, AGNT, is turning heads alongside established picks like AVAX and LINK. These altcoins remain largely unnoticed but hold great potential. POL, DOT, and TAO are gaining quiet momentum, hinting at significant future gains as market conditions ripen.\nMeanwhile, an intriguing project, Codename:Pepe, challenges the crypto scene with a community-powered mission. Promising AI-driven insights, it's set to revolutionize meme coin trading. This venture taps into the legacy of PEPE, aiming for comparable success. With the bull run energizing opportunities, these underappreciated altcoins and emerging projects are captivating savvy investors.\nCodename:Pepe (AGNT) Gains Traction After Listing and Supply Burn, Eyes $2.1 Milestone\nCodename:Pepe ($AGNT) has recently made its entrance on Uniswap, opening the floodgates for global trading — and it didn’t come quietly.\nIn a dramatic power move, Codename:Pepe has burned a significant portion of the tokens to tighten the supply and send a clear message: this project plays to win.\n$AGNT token burns mean reducing the supply and boosting scarcity, which may fuel a price surge.\nSource: Codename:Pepe X account\nIf you missed the chance to grab $AGNT at a fraction of a cent during the presale, don’t worry — there’s still time to get in at a bargain price before it targets its next milestone: $2.\nThe team is rallying the community to drive momentum and push the price higher, aligning everyone around a shared goal — collective growth through smart, unified action.\nSource: Codename:Pepe Telegram account\nThe AGNT Outlook: Bullish with AI Fuel\nAnalysts are paying attention — and some are projecting a 30,000% gain before the end of 2025.\nHere’s why:\n-\nAI-Driven Strategy: AGENT A.I. will scan social media and blockchain data to detect trending meme coins before they explode.\n-\nAutomated Trading: The AI engine will be able to execute real-time trades, turning noise into signals and volatility into opportunity.\n-\nDAO Utility: Token holders will gain exclusive access to insider analytics and community voting through the AGNT DAO.\nMomentum is building: the presale sold out early. Now with liquidity, community energy, and a shrinking supply, AGNT is poised to move.\nCodename:Pepe fuses cutting-edge AI with meme market psychology, and it’s already showing signs of breakout potential. With the supply burn and Uniswap launch, AGNT is now positioned to lead the next wave of meme coin dominance.\nPrice Is Rising. Supply Is Shrinking. Buy $AGNT Now\nAvalanche (AVAX): The Rising Star in the Crypto World\nAvalanche (AVAX) is a blockchain network rivaling Ethereum in smart contracts, scalability, and speed. Launched in 2020, it has become popular among developers. Its compatibility with Ethereum's programming language Solidity makes migration easy, fostering innovation and growth on its platform.\nAVAX stands out with impressive technology. It uses subnets to boost transaction throughput, handling up to 6,500 transactions per second. Its proof-of-stake mechanism allows users to participate in governance and validate transactions. Burning transaction fees increases scarcity over time.\nAfter reaching $146.22 in November 2021, AVAX is about 70% lower. Despite this, it has grown 26% over the last year. Its strong fundamentals and continuous network improvements suggest potential for future growth in the evolving crypto market.\nIn the current market cycle, AVAX appears promising. With increased interest in cryptocurrencies and the recent Bitcoin halving boosting sentiment, AVAX may benefit. Its lower fees and higher speeds compared to Ethereum make it attractive for developers and users alike.\nAnalysts predict AVAX could reach around $68.72 by the end of 2025, and potentially higher by 2030. Its capped supply and strong technology underpin its potential for long-term growth. As the crypto market evolves, AVAX stands out as a noteworthy contender.\nChainlink’s Rise: Bridging Smart Contracts and Real-World Data\nChainlink (LINK) connects smart contracts to real-world data through a decentralized network of oracles. These oracles fetch and verify off-chain information, ensuring that contracts execute accurately without relying on a single source. This system enhances security and reliability for blockchain applications that need external data.\nSince 2017, Chainlink has become a leader in oracle solutions, vital for the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi). As DeFi expands, the demand for secure data feeds grows, positioning Chainlink favorably in the market. Its technology acts as a reliable bridge between blockchains and external data sources, using hybrid smart contracts to facilitate this connection.\nHistorically, LINK reached $52.88 in May 2021. Experts predict that by 2030, it could trade between $66 and $137, suggesting strong long-term potential. While predictions vary, many believe LINK could surpass its past highs with continued adoption and innovation in its use cases.\nThe current market shows increased interest in cryptocurrencies, spurred by developments like approved Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds. As the crypto market grows, LINK may benefit from increased investment and attention.\nIn summary, Chainlink's technology and market position make it an attractive option in the evolving crypto space. Its crucial role in connecting smart contracts with real-world data could drive its future growth, making it a coin to watch in the coming years.\nPolygon's Leap Forward: From MATIC to POL and What It Means\nPolygon, formerly known as Matic Network, is preparing for a significant evolution.

The transition reflects Polygon's commitment to innovation and growth in the blockchain space.\nThe planned migration has generated excitement among investors and developers. Early reactions suggest optimism about the network's future. The shift from MATIC to POL is expected to enhance the network's capabilities, improve scalability, and attract more users. However, the long-term impact of this migration remains to be seen.\nPolygon functions as a platform that connects various blockchains, acting as a scaling solution to make transactions faster and more affordable. The POL token will power sidechains linked to the main Polygon network. It rewards participants who validate transactions, promoting network security and decentralization.\nHistorically, the MATIC token experienced significant growth as the platform gained adoption. Price movements have reflected the market's confidence in Polygon's solutions. Looking ahead, some forecasts suggest that the POL token could see substantial appreciation, driven by increased adoption and technological advancements. Long-term predictions point to potential price increases, but as always, the crypto market remains unpredictable.\nPolygon's focus on solving scalability and usability issues without sacrificing decentralization sets it apart. By leveraging the existing developer community, it aims to shape the future of blockchain technology. With its innovative approach and the introduction of the POL token, Polygon might present an attractive opportunity in the current market cycle for those interested in the evolving crypto landscape.\nPolkadot's Journey: Connecting Blockchains for Tomorrow's World\nPolkadot is a network that helps different blockchains talk to each other. It's like a bridge between islands, allowing them to share and exchange information. Created by Gavin Wood, who also co-founded Ethereum, Polkadot aims to make cross-chain transactions easier and more efficient.\nBack in 2021, Polkadot reached an all-time high of $55. However, by 2025, the price had seen ups and downs, reflecting the volatile nature of the crypto market. Despite challenges, the Polkadot community remained active, believing in the project's potential to outpace competitors.\nPolkadot's strength lies in its ability to connect multiple blockchains. This unique feature sets it apart in the crypto space. While some questioned the need for such technology as other blockchains evolved, Polkadot continued to focus on interoperability, aiming to enhance communication among networks.\nSome analysts are bullish on Polkadot's future. John Palmer suggested that by 2027, enthusiasts are targeting a breakthrough of $14.83, with potential for further growth if this barrier is crossed. Others are less optimistic, with predictions as low as $5.13 by 2026 from CoinCodex.\nLooking ahead, forecasts vary. DigitalCoinPrice predicts an average price of $23.75 by 2027, while Changelly anticipates the coin could reach up to $52.31 by 2030. These projections reflect differing views but highlight the ongoing interest in Polkadot's technology and its role in the crypto landscape.\nTAO: Fueling the Future of Decentralized AI\nBittensor is an open-source protocol powering a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network.

Bitcoin Solaris Presale at $11 Offers Similar Growth Trajectory with Token Holder Rewards", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/cant-afford-bitcoin-bitcoin-solaris-presale-at-11-offers-similar-growth-trajectory-with-token-holder-rewards", "text": "There was a time when Bitcoin was just a few dollars. Blink and it shot past $60,000, now? Over $100k is leaving millions with the regret of not acting sooner. For every investor staring at today’s price of Bitcoin thinking, “It’s too late,” a new opportunity has quietly stepped onto the stage, and this one’s making serious noise. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is positioning itself as the affordable gateway to the next big crypto leap, blending old-school trust with next-gen innovation.\nBitcoin’s Legacy Is Untouchable, but Its Accessibility Is Not\nBitcoin remains the gold standard, the OG of crypto. Its decentralized model, capped supply, and historical growth have set the benchmark for every digital asset. But for most newcomers, owning even a fraction feels like chasing a dream in reverse. The real problem? Bitcoin’s early accessibility is now gone, while its speed and scalability still struggle in today’s DeFi and gaming ecosystems.\nThat’s where Bitcoin Solaris begins to shine, by making wealth creation simple, fast, and inclusive.\nEnter Bitcoin Solaris: Power, Speed, and Real-World Value\nBitcoin Solaris isn’t just another fork or clone. It’s a technological reinvention. Built on a dual-layer architecture, it combines the raw security of Proof of Work with the high-speed performance of Delegated Proof of Stake. This means it can push over 10,000 transactions per second, with 2-second finality and 99.95 percent less energy consumption than Bitcoin.\nWhat’s even more appealing is that you don’t need a mining rig or a warehouse full of GPUs to earn. Thanks to the upcoming Solaris Nova app, anyone can mine BTC-S straight from their phone. Through this exciting release, the mining model becomes mobile-first, inclusive, and adaptive to modern lifestyles.\n-\nThe dual-consensus model ensures both security and scalability.\n-\nValidator rotation keeps the system decentralized and transparent.\n-\nSmart contracts enable powerful DeFi applications and cross-chain operations.\n-\nThe system is optimized for on-chain governance and zero-knowledge proof integrations.\nIn short, BTC-S is what Bitcoin might’ve looked like if it were designed today.\nTokenomics That Fuel Long-Term Wealth\nBitcoin Solaris isn’t just fast and futuristic. Its tokenomics are engineered for sustained value and fairness. With only 21 million BTC-S ever to exist, its scarcity mirrors that of Bitcoin. But its distribution is far more utility-driven.\n-\n66.66 percent allocated for mining over 90 years\n-\n20 percent for presale\n-\n5 percent to liquidity\n-\n2 percent to ecosystem development\n-\n2 percent to community rewards\n-\n2 percent to staking rewards\n-\n2 percent to marketing\n-\n0.33 percent to the team and advisors\nThese figures ensure BTC-S stays in the hands of real users, not just early whales. You can explore the full breakdown at bitcoinsolaris.com/#tokenomics.\nPresale Heating Up with a Rare Rollback Twist\nWe’re now in phase 11 of the Bitcoin Solaris presale. The current price sits at $11, with a launch price of $20 already locked in. Over 14,150 users have joined, and $6.6 million has been raised. It’s one of the shortest, fastest-moving presales in recent memory.\nAnd here’s the kicker: Bitcoin Solaris just announced a Price Rollback. For a very limited time, buyers can get in at $5 instead of $11. It’s not a discount. It’s a rare chance to access high-potential tokens at early-stage pricing, and it will not last.\nWallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless token delivery after launch.\n-\nOnly around 3 weeks left in the presale window\n-\nRollback to $5 is a limited-time move\n-\nOver 14K investors have already confirmed\nThis kind of growth trajectory is hard to find, and even harder to catch mid-air.\nBuilt for the Next Decade, Not Just the Next Pump BTC-S\nBlockchain Gaming: BTC-S Rewards That Make HODLing Fun\nPassive holding just got an upgrade. With its Blockchain Gaming utility, Bitcoin Solaris turns every wallet into a potential reward machine.\n-\nDaily free spins for all BTC-S holders, no spending required\n-\nAdditional spin tiers for purchases over $250, $500, $1000, and $2500\n-\nTop-tier prizes include up to 0.5 BTC\n-\nNo token lockups, no staking needed\nIt’s not just gamified hype. It’s a genuine reward structure designed for community participation, where every spin is another reason to stay involved. This layer of fun and strategic earning is fast becoming a central part of the BTC-S ecosystem.\nAudits, Social Presence, and Growing Buzz\nSecurity is key, and Bitcoin Solaris has passed both the Cyberscope audit and the Freshcoins audit, putting it on the radar of institutional and retail investors alike.\n-\nA lot of influencers are talking about BTC-S. A detailed review by Token Empire highlights why this project is not to be ignored.\n-\nThe Telegram community is growing fast and active with presale updates and dev insights.\n-\nAnd the official X channel offers transparent communication and feature reveals.\nFinal Verdict: You Can Still Catch the Next Bitcoin, This Time at $5\nBTC-S is not trying to replace Bitcoin in spirit. It’s simply offering what Bitcoin can no longer offer: early access, technical edge, mobile scalability, and rich reward systems. For anyone tired of watching from the sidelines, this is your signal.\nFor more information on Bitcoin Solaris:\nWebsite: https://www.bitcoinsolaris.com/\nTelegram: https://t.me/Bitcoinsolaris\nX: https://x.com/BitcoinSolaris\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

This growth comes after a month where the price decreased by 6.34%.\nDespite the recent weekly increase, Dogecoin's price is still down 45.68% over the past six months. This shows that while there is short-term momentum, the coin has experienced significant declines over a longer period.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Dogecoin is 65.23. This suggests that the coin is gaining strength but is not yet overbought. The nearest resistance level is at $0.1883, about 11% higher than the current price. The nearest support level is at $0.1477, roughly 13% lower.\nBased on this data, Dogecoin may rise towards the resistance level, potentially gaining around 11%. If the price moves downward, it could reach the support level, a decrease of about 13%. The short-term upward trend indicates growing interest, but the overall six-month decline may affect future growth.\nConclusion\nThe crypto market is entering a bullish phase, opening doors for new opportunities. Established coins like DOGE may offer less potential in the short term, prompting investors to look elsewhere for significant gains.\nCodename:Pepe crypto emerges as a standout contender by leveraging true artificial intelligence to maximize profits. It aims to navigate the volatile meme coin landscape with precision, providing smart trading signals and access to a secret DAO.

This listing could ensure instant liquidity and price discovery, which are often subject to sharp rises when demand is maintained. The upside potential at the current price gives a possible 200x on a target price of $1 by 2025.\nWhat Sets Ozak AI Apart\nOne reason Ozak AI is gaining so much attention is its timing. Ozak AI combines the benefits of blockchain transparency and scalability with real-time utility based on AI.\nThe coin has also been listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. The listing is further exposing the project to the crypto community. These milestones indicate that Ozak AI is not only generating hype but is also establishing a solid groundwork as well.\nConclusion\nEarly venture capital wallets often serve as an indicator of where smart money is positioning itself. At the moment, they are all stockpiling Ozak AI. This AI coin may be the next coin to explode in 2025 due to its practical functionality, robust presale numbers, and increased attention by both retail and institutional investors.\nFor more information about Ozak AI, visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

So far the price has been as high as $118,400. This may well be surpassed on Friday. Just how high can this rocketship go?\nS&P 500 about to break back into the long-term ascending channel?\nSource: TradingView\nAt the same time that Bitcoin is bursting higher, the US stock market is paving the way. The best way to view this is via the S&P 500. After the big dip caused by the Trump tariffs, the v-shaped recovery has been nothing short of sensational. It might be today, or it could be next week, but the index looks as though it can climb back into the ascending channel which has been in force since early 2023. This is good news for $BTC given that a climbing US stock market usually coincides with similar price action for Bitcoin.\nCurrent upside pause just temporary?\nSource: TradingView\nAfter breaking out of the bull flag and faking out the first time, and threatening to do so a second time, the $BTC price suddenly shot skyward and reached and surpassed the all-time high at $112,000. A short period of consolidation followed in the form of a flag pennant. However, this soon broke out, and another $7,000 was soon added to the price as it hit more than $118,000.\nSince then, there has been a slight retracement into the $117,000s, but this does look temporary, and the price could start to spike yet again at some point during Friday. $130,000 is not out of the realms of possibility.\nIt does need to be borne in mind that sooner or later, this upward spike will need to start calming down, and it would be healthy for the price to go sideways and perhaps down for a more extended period of time, giving the momentum indicators time to reset, as they are quite overbought now. At what point this might start to happen is unsure at this stage, and there is the possibility of more upside before gravity begins to take effect.\nPotential downside price targets\nSource: TradingView\nWhile more upside price action is probably favourite right now, it is good to look at the possibilities for potential downside. Drawing in the Fibonacci extension levels for this move, it can be seen that the deepest retracement that could be reasonably expected is to the 0.618 level. This coincides with the top corner of the bull flag, making it a good support level. It can be seen that up to now, the 0.236, the most shallow Fibonacci level, is acting as good support.\nAt the bottom of this daily chart, the RSI indicator line has just crossed into overbought territory above 70.00. That said, it will need to get above 78.60 in order to avoid bearish divergence on this time frame.\nBearish divergence needs to be annulled on weekly time frame\nSource: TradingView\nMore importantly, on the weekly time frame, the indicator line for the RSI can be seen to be approaching the descending trendline (bottom of chart). This looks tricky for the bulls, and could be a rejection point. If it does break through, it will need to confirm, and then get above 88.40 in order to fully annul bearish divergence on this weekly time frame.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This marked the second consecutive week of sizeable transfers from the Himalayan kingdom, signaling an effort to capitalize on current market strength.\nBlockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence confirmed the transaction, which strategically occurred just hours before Bitcoin reached its highest price level in months. The move is part of Bhutan’s broader treasury strategy, which has increasingly leaned on digital assets as a sovereign wealth tool.\nDespite recent sales, Bhutan maintains a substantial Bitcoin reserve of 11,711 BTC, estimated at $1.3 billion at current valuations, positioning it as one of the most crypto-forward governments globally.\nBitcoin Climbs After Weeks of Consolidation\nThe sale comes as Bitcoin broke past the $112,000 mark this week after spending nearly two months fluctuating between $105,000 and $111,000. Data from Coingecko recorded over $60 billion in global trading volume within a 24-hour window as the world’s largest cryptocurrency surged amid growing market optimism and institutional interest.\nThis bullish momentum, largely fueled by persistent inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and sustained support from institutional investors, has created sharp contrasts in the approaches of government-backed crypto holders.\nGermany’s Mistimed Sell-Off Highlights Bhutan’s Prudence\nIn stark contrast, the German government offloaded 49,858 BTC between June 19 and July 12, 2024, at an average price of $57,600 per coin. The total liquidation netted $2.87 billion, but the decision proved costly as Bitcoin’s value more than doubled shortly after the sell-off.\nAt current market rates, the same Bitcoin stockpile would be worth approximately $5.54 billion, representing $2.67 billion in missed unrealized gains. Germany’s poorly timed exit, executed just before the market’s significant rally, has sparked criticism over its asset management strategy.\nGrowing Portfolio and Modest Altcoin Gains\nArkham’s data revealed that Bhutan’s overall crypto holdings increased to $1.304 billion as of July 10, a notable rise from $1.26 billion the previous week. The bulk of this $38.4 million gain stemmed from Bitcoin’s upward trajectory, though smaller assets within the government’s wallet also posted modest gains.\nTokens such as AIKEK and KIBSHI appreciated by approximately 17% and 42%, respectively, while BOBO, a memecoin holding of 69 million units, added a marginal $3.60 in value.\nThese incremental increases, though minor compared to Bitcoin’s performance, reflect Bhutan’s diversified digital asset portfolio strategy, extending beyond just mining and Bitcoin accumulation.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, it appears that the tables have turned. Stocks have made a v-shaped recovery, and Bitcoin is having something akin to a moon launch. Expect Bitcoin to make a new high against gold, and for this outperformance to continue longer term.\nMost of Wall Street still does not know what Bitcoin is\nOne or two of the more traditional analysts have been talking up gold for some while now, saying that not only could it continue to outperform the US stock market, but that it would outperform Bitcoin into the bargain.\nIn fact, Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone went on record several times in the Wolf of All Streets podcast, saying that he expected Bitcoin to go to $10,000. He made the observation that Bitcoin was still below the price of gold in 2021, and that it was now likely to decrease further against the shiny yellow metal.\nCan $BTC take out the 41-ounce gold all-time high?\nSource: TradingView\nThe weekly chart for Bitcoin/Gold reveals that $BTC is still below those 2021 highs. That said, this week’s surge has taken BTC/XAU beyond the tops of the 2021 candle bodies, and it might be expected that not only will those highs be overtaken, but also the 41-ounce all-time high. The measured move of the bull flag is to just below 38 ounces. The bulls will need to keep the price above the resistance band at the end of this week, thereby flipping it into support.\nBullish weekly gold chart\nSource: TradingView\nLooking at the purely gold chart on the weekly time frame, it must be noted that it is very positive indeed. The price has maintained above the ascending channel, which is incredibly bullish.\nThe Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is shaping for a cross up of the blue (fast) line above the orange (slow) line. This will add upside price momentum to gold as it gets above the 20.00 level.\n$BTC price spike not slowing down yet\nSource: TradingView\nThat said, the price chart that looks the best of all is arguably that of $BTC. The spike up over the last three days does not appear to be slowing down yet, and even though $BTC is quite overbought now, there could be enough in the tank via short squeezes and investor hype to take the price to $120,000, or even $130,000 before the next cooling down period.\nBoth Bitcoin and gold are great assets for your portfolio\nBoth Bitcoin and gold are great assets to hold in any portfolio, now and into the future. Yes, $BTC is likely to outperform gold going forward, given its limited supply and the fact that it is a tenth of the size of the market capitalization of gold. That said, they are both hard money assets, and both promise protection from the ravages of government-controlled fiat currencies.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In partnership with Gift of the Givers Foundation, one of Africa's largest disaster response NGOs, Bybit aims to assist with recovery and rebuilding efforts following devastating floods that have resulted in significant loss of life and displacement of thousands.\nThis initiative underscores Bybit’s ongoing commitment to social responsibility and supporting communities in crisis worldwide. The Eastern Cape, with its infrastructure severely damaged and essential services disrupted, faces a challenging path to recovery. Bybit’s contribution will directly bolster Gift of the Givers’ campaign to “Rebuild Flood-Stricken Communities in the Eastern Cape.”\n“At Bybit, we believe our responsibility extends beyond innovation in finance,” said Wilson Ogheneovo, Head of Africa at Bybit. “We are deeply saddened by the tragedy unfolding in Eastern Cape and stand in solidarity with those affected. Through our support of Gift of the Givers, we hope to contribute meaningfully to the relief efforts and help restore dignity and hope to families who’ve lost everything.”\nSince June 9, 2025, the Eastern Cape has experienced torrential rain, floods, and landslides, leaving entire communities submerged and stretching rescue operations due to limited resources.

Built on the Polygon blockchain, XYZVerse leverages the viral appeal of meme coins while offering more than just laughs.\nUnlike many memecoins that rely solely on hype, XYZVerse has undergone smart contract and KYC audits, lending it credibility among investors. Its tokenomics include a capped supply of 100 billion XYZ tokens, with deflationary burns built into the design.\nOver $14 million has already been raised in its presale, and the project plans to list XYZ at $0.10—indicating strong early momentum.\nXYZVerse is positioning itself as a meme token with utility, tapping into trends in sports betting, gaming, and Web3 engagement. As investors become more selective, meme coins like XYZ that offer entertainment and function may be better equipped to thrive in an evolving market. For those looking beyond simple jokes, XYZVerse could represent a more sustainable path for memecoin innovation.\nFrom Meme to Mainstream: The Rise and Potential of Dogecoin\nDogecoin started in 2013 as a light-hearted take on cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant to be a fun alternative to the serious world of crypto. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant, with no maximum cap and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially viewed as a joke or \"memecoin,\" Dogecoin took the world by surprise in 2021. Fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from personalities like Elon Musk, its value skyrocketed, propelling it into the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market cap exceeding $50 billion.\nDogecoin’s technology is based on Litecoin, offering faster transaction times and lower fees compared to Bitcoin. Its community-driven approach has fostered a loyal following, contributing to charitable causes and sponsorships. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin's appeal lies in its simplicity and the backing of a vibrant community. While other cryptocurrencies focus on complex technologies and use cases, Dogecoin remains accessible to newcomers. Market trends show a growing interest in decentralized finance and meme coins, suggesting that Dogecoin could continue to gain traction. However, its unlimited supply may affect long-term value. Investors looking for potential gains might find Dogecoin attractive, but should consider the volatility and do their research.\nShiba Inu Coin: The Dogecoin Rival Making Waves on Ethereum\nShiba Inu (SHIB) began as a meme coin inspired by Dogecoin, but it's forging its own path. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator named Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This lets it tap into Ethereum's vast network of apps and tools. With an initial supply of one quadrillion tokens, SHIB grabbed attention when half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. He donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and \"burned\" 40% of the total supply. These moves boosted SHIB's profile and showed commitment to the community.\nUnlike Dogecoin, SHIB is building real-world uses. It's developing ShibaSwap, a trading platform without middlemen. Plans include an NFT platform and a system where holders can vote on decisions. In the current market, SHIB's link to Ethereum could give it an edge. While meme coins often fade, SHIB's focus on useful features might help it stand out. As the crypto market changes, SHIB could become more than a meme—it might turn into a serious player.\nIs BONK the Next Big Memecoin? Solana's Shiba Inu Takes Off\nBONK is a new memecoin built on the Solana blockchain, featuring a playful Shiba Inu mascot. It's catching attention by aiming to empower the Solana community. Instead of favoring big investors, BONK is giving back to everyday users. Half of its total supply was airdropped to people involved in Solana's NFTs and DeFi projects. After being listed on Coinbase, BONK's price surged by over 100%, showing strong interest from traders and the crypto community.\nDespite the buzz, BONK faces challenges common to memecoins. It has a high total supply, which can affect its price growth. Memecoins are also known for being volatile. However, BONK is becoming part of Solana's expanding ecosystem of decentralized apps. It's even launching its own exchange called BonkSwap. This involvement might give it more staying power than other memecoins. In the current market, where community-driven projects are gaining popularity, BONK could be an interesting option. But like with any investment, especially in volatile markets, it's important to do thorough research.\nFrom Meme to Metaverse: How Floki Is Shaping the Crypto Landscape\nIn June 2021, Elon Musk tweeted about naming his Shiba Inu puppy \"Floki,\" sparking the creation of the Floki Inu coin. What started as a meme coin has evolved into Floki, a cryptocurrency with real-world utility and philanthropic ambitions. Floki isn't just a digital token; it's a movement aiming to make a positive impact. The team behind Floki is building schools in less developed countries like Laos and Nigeria, showing a commitment to charity and global development.\nFloki stands out with a range of projects that extend its utility. The NFT metaverse game Valhalla allows users to play and earn within a virtual world. Its DeFi platform, FlokiFi, offers decentralized financial services. Partnerships with NOWPayments and the prepaid Floki Card enable holders to use FLOKI tokens for everyday transactions. As the crypto market evolves, investors seek projects with real utility and social impact. Floki's expansion into NFTs, DeFi, and practical use cases sets it apart from other meme coins that lack substance. While the market remains volatile, Floki's focus on innovation and social good may resonate with those seeking more than just memes.\nDogwifhat: The New Meme Coin Making Waves on Solana\nDogwifhat (WIF) is the latest dog-themed meme coin catching everyone's eye. Inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme, this coin is built on the Solana blockchain. Meme coins like WIF are known for their fun and community-driven vibe. They often spring from internet memes or pop culture hits. Dog-themed tokens, in particular, have a special place in the crypto world, and WIF is the newest pup in the pack.\nWIF aims to create a lively community and spread smiles among its holders. Being on Solana means it enjoys fast transactions and low fees. In today's market, meme coins are getting a lot of attention again. Coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have shown how a strong community can boost a coin's popularity. WIF might appeal to those looking for the next big thing in the meme coin scene. With its cheerful theme and solid technology, it's a coin that's worth keeping an eye on.\nConclusion\nMemecoins like DOGE, SHIB, BONK, and FLOKI thrive in the 2025 bull run. XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges as the pioneering all-sport memecoin, uniting sports fans and aiming for massive growth.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Outset PR Turns a Single Headline Into 3 Billion Impressions: How Data-Driven PR Strategy Works for Web3 Projects", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/outset-pr-turns-a-single-headline-into-3-billion-impressions-how-data-driven-pr-strategy-works-for-web3-projects", "text": "In crypto PR, the story doesn’t end when it hits the wire. That’s when it starts to move.\nFor Web3 founders looking to break through the noise, a well-placed article isn’t just a credibility stamp—it’s a launchpad. But most agencies stop short at the first publication. Outset PR doesn’t. It builds visibility by engineering what comes next: syndication.\nWhat Syndication Means in Crypto PR\nA story published on Cointelegraph can land on CoinMarketCap the next day. From there, it might hit Binance Square, Yahoo Finance, or dozens of other aggregators, community feeds, and news networks. No extra spend. No second pitch. Just engineered momentum.\nThis ripple effect is what Outset calls a “tail”—a republication that echoes the original article across new surfaces. Some tails reprint the piece in full. Others offer a snippet, a headline, or even a rewrite that spins the original into fresh editorial. Each variant plays a role in how the story scales.\nTypes of Syndicated Coverage (Tails)\n|\nTail Type |\nDescription |\n|\nFull-copy republications |\nComplete article reprints on other outlets; deliver maximum SEO impact. |\n|\nLead-and-link snippets |\nShow an intro or lead paragraph with a link to the original; drive direct traffic. |\n|\nHeadline-only pickups |\nDisplay only the title and a link; dominate aggregator feeds, great for visibility. |\n|\nRewrites |\nNew articles inspired by the original; extend narrative and attract fresh audiences. |\nTogether, they multiply reach, stretch exposure across new audiences, and drive far more impact than the original story ever could alone.\nInside the Metrics: How Outset PR Tracks the Spread\nTracking this isn’t easy. There’s no out-of-the-box software that reliably detects tails, especially in the fragmented, multilingual crypto media landscape. So Outset built its own system. Their analytics team manually monitors aggregators, community portals, Google index updates, and low-profile crypto blogs to classify republications by type, traffic potential, and syndication value.\n“We don’t treat media hits as finish lines,” says Maximilian Fondé, who leads analytics at Outset PR. “We treat them as data points—signals that show us how the story travels, who picks it up, and where it converts.”\nNot all republications are equal. Some surface on high-authority destinations like CoinGecko or Binance Square—places that can nudge a token into retail consciousness. Others appear on tier-two wires or SEO-optimized crypto hubs. A long tail of low-tier pickups rounds out the spread, sometimes helping with search visibility, sometimes not. Outset scores each one and uses the data to guide future placements.\nThis methodology is measurable. During a campaign for StealthEX, a single article placement triggered 92 republications across high-impact surfaces, reaching an estimated 3 billion views.\nIn another case, an article placed for ChangeNOW around the OFFICIAL TRUMP meme coin launch was rewritten by a leading Turkish outlet, becoming the editorial lead in a politically charged news cycle just days before the 2025 inauguration. The original quote remained intact. The visibility surged.\nThe Tail Map: Predicting What Happens After Publication\nWhat makes this approach work is Outset’s “tail map”—an internal tool that plots which media outlets generate the most syndication, and where that syndication flows next. The team doesn’t guess where to pitch. It checks the map. If a client wants exposure on CoinMarketCap, the answer isn’t “Let’s try.” It’s “Here’s how.”\nThis is where PR merges with performance. Republication tracking turns visibility into a metric, not a mystery. It shows how one article can outperform five, simply by triggering the right chain reaction. It reveals that $200 spent on syndication-friendly media can go further than $2,000 burned on a one-off vanity hit that no aggregator pulls from.\nFinal Word\nMost stories fade within a day. Syndication keeps them alive.\nFor founders in the Web3 space where attention windows are narrow and credibility is hard-won this matters. The approach taken by Outset PR offers what crypto-native projects need most: exposure that scales, spending that performs, and results that show up not just in headlines, but in traction.\nReady to turn one media hit into unstoppable visibility?\nTalk to Outset PR about crypto media syndication\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Various chains are emerging with the idea of easing the obstacles that exist for both users and developers in the industry. One such chain that has recently experienced a significant increase in usage is Viction.\nAlthough launched in 2017 as TomoChain, it was rebranded in 2023 as Viction, and it aims to remove many of the common Web3 obstacles and create a better experience for all users. With the increase in usage and interest from users, Bitunix exchange listed VIC coin on the spot market on July 7th.\nWhat is Viction (VIC) Coin?\nViction is a layer-1 blockchain that makes Web3 simple, fast, and safe for everyone. It offers zero-gas transactions, which means users can make transfers and interact with apps without paying high fees. It also uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system run by 150 masternodes, which helps keep the network fast and secure.\nOne of Viction’s top goals is to provide strong security. It utilizes features such as double validation and smart contract staking to safeguard users and maintain the chain's security. It’s also EVM-compatible, so developers can use tools and smart contracts made for Ethereum.\nViction supports cross-chain token transfers. This makes it easier for users and apps to connect with other blockchains. The network also helps builders with tools, funding, and support to grow new projects. Viction provides resources, strategic funding, and network connections to support developers and projects building on the platform. Overall, Viction is built to remove many of the common Web3 barriers and create a smooth, secure experience for all users.\nWhy is VIC Coin Listed on Bitunix?\nRecently, Viction chain experienced a significant increase in usage as data from multichain AI analytics platform Nansen showed that Viction saw a massive spike in transaction fee revenue of +4,272%, leaving behind chains like TON, Ronin, Algorand, Fantom, etc.\nTop chains by fee growth this week:1️⃣ Viction +4,272%2️⃣ Ton +696%3️⃣ Goat +155%4️⃣ Ronin +90%5️⃣ HyperEVM +78%Massive spikes in usage or just hype? Either way, you might want to keep them on your radar. pic.twitter.com/xGpQ25NXgF\n— Nansen 🧭 (@nansen_ai) July 8, 2025\nConsidering this increase in usage and interest from users, Bitunix exchange listed VIC coin on the spot market on July 7th. The VIC token is the native coin of the Viction ecosystem. It can be used for staking, paying fees, governance, buying NFTs, and more.\nViction (VIC) Coin Price Analysis\nViction (VIC) Coin has been showing some strong price movements recently. Below is a breakdown of important levels to watch and possible trading ideas for the short, mid, and long term.\nShort-Term Trading Strategy\nAt the time of writing, Viction (VIC) coin price stands at $0.291. Investors can look for long opportunities on pullbacks within the $0.290–$0.295 range. Risk management is crucial. Investors should avoid chasing prices into the $0.350–$0.366 zone, which could likely be a trap for over-leveraged longs and an area with heavy sell pressure.\nMid-Term Strategy\nPrice should be watched if it stabilizes in the $0.250–$0.265 support zone, which may indicate institutional accumulation. If this level is broken, a potential further decline toward the $0.210–$0.230 range could occur.\nLong-Term Positioning\nInvestors should consider scaling into shorts near the $0.350–$0.366 resistance area, but they should beware of potential false breakouts above $0.360. Weakening long-term momentum could lead to a deeper correction.\nIf price breaks below $0.290, a quick drop toward $0.265 or lower may occur. Also, liquidation clusters and open interest changes must be closely monitored for early reversal signals.\nWhere to Buy Viction (VIC) Coin?\nViction (VIC) Coin is available to buy on Bitunix exchange, which listed it on the spot market on July 9th. Bitunix offers over 800 trading pairs and is the fastest-growing cryptocurrency exchange.\nFounded in 2021, Bitunix prioritizes transparency and security for its users, which is why it constantly updates its Proof of Reserves.

However, VC-based models often present significant barriers for early-stage founders, including the need to give up equity, cede creative control, and navigate highly selective investor networks.\nMake Brand challenges this approach by introducing an open, permissionless funding model where early supporters can directly back brand creators and benefit from their long-term success.\n“We believe that the next wave of iconic brands will be built in collaboration with their communities, not in boardrooms,” said Charles, CMO, Make Brand. “Make Brand empowers creators to raise capital, validate ideas, and build loyal audiences through a fair and transparent Web3 ecosystem.”\nHow Make Brand Works\nMake Brand operates through a tokenized system called Token DPA (Debt Payable by Assets), a smart contract that facilitates revenue sharing between brand creators and token holders. Investors participate using the platform’s native $BRAND token, which serves both as an investment vehicle and a governance tool.\nKey features of the platform include:\n- Smart contract–based funding agreements with automatic distribution of returns\n- Investor dashboards with real-time ROI tracking and settlement forecasts\n- Curation models for evaluating brand credibility and potential\n- No KYC requirement for participation; global access via wallet connection\nBrand creators can choose from reward-based, return-based, or hybrid funding models depending on their needs, while contributors are able to select participation structures that align with their goals.\nA Web3 Alternative to Traditional Models\nUnlike traditional crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter or Indiegogo, Make Brand offers contributors the opportunity to receive long-term returns based on actual project performance. Contributions are recorded on-chain and settled automatically using Solana smart contracts, ensuring transparency and accountability.\nMake Brand also differs from equity platforms like Republic by removing geographic and regulatory barriers to participation. With no borders and minimal entry requirements, the platform creates a level playing field for investors and creators worldwide.\nRoadmap and Outlook\nMake Brand is currently preparing for the public beta launch of its platform, scheduled for Q3 2025. The initial phase will include onboarding brand creators in sectors such as fashion, beauty, and lifestyle, and activating the first wave of funding campaigns.\nFuture development plans include:\n- NFT-linked products and creator rewards\n- Secondary brand equity trading infrastructure\n- DAO-based governance modules for long-term sustainability\nAbout Make Brand\nMake Brand is a decentralized brand crowdfunding platform built on Solana. The project allows global users to participate in early-stage brand funding through transparent, token-based contracts. With features designed to support both creators and investors, Make Brand introduces a new model for building and owning brands in the Web3 era.\nContact\nCMOCharles\n[email protected]\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

The platform’s builder-first strategy includes a $150,000 grant pool already active, funding developers working on tools, explorers, and dApps powered by the AIVM. Incentives extend to meme creators via the live Launchpad, which pairs liquidity support with smart contract automation.\nLightchain’s tokenomics reinforce this structure—40% allocated to presale, 28.5% for staking, 15% for liquidity, and reallocation of the original 5% Team Allocation directly into development and grants.\nWith DeFi partnerships onboarding and decentralized nodes preparing for mainnet, Lightchain AI offers a complete on-chain environment ready for scalable, intelligent applications. From technical tools to transparent governance, every layer is built to support real usage and sustained adoption.\nFrom Code to Crowd — How Lightchain AI Is Redefining the Game\nLightchain AI is making waves by combining artificial intelligence with blockchain in a practical, innovative way. With features like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), it’s redefining efficient AI computations on the blockchain. Lightchain AI addresses real challenges by improving scalability, security, and cross-chain integration.\nWhat sets this platform apart is its focus on real-world impact. From transforming healthcare diagnostics to optimizing supply chains and revolutionizing financial analytics, Lightchain AI is more than just a concept—it’s a tool for change. Backed by a strong community and an impressive $21 million presale, the project is gaining serious momentum.\nWith the mainnet launch set for July 2025, Lightchain AI is making waves at the intersection of AI and blockchain. Purposeful design, bold vision, and a commitment to real-world solutions make this a project to watch.

However, many are seeking similar prospects in emerging digital assets. RENDER’s rise captured attention across the crypto sector. Ozak AI is also gaining interest from crypto investors posing to be the next RENDER.\nIts native OZ token is currently progressing through presale stages with a steady increase in value, while the growing engagement around Ozak AI suggests a rising level of investor activity. With listings already secured on tracking platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, the project is expanding its visibility and is planning to be listed on major trading platforms after its presale.\nOverview of Ozak AI and Its Core Technologies\nOzak AI operates as an advanced infrastructure integrating artificial intelligence, blockchain, and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs). Its platform enables autonomous systems to function in real time, drawing on smart contracts and Internet of Things (IoT) technology.\nA key element within its ecosystem, DePIN, utilizes blockchain and IPFS protocols to enhance data security and decentralization. It also allows for consistent performance across distributed nodes, avoiding single points of failure. The network scales efficiently by adding nodes as needed, ensuring reliable access to data. The project’s mission centers around deploying secure, responsive, and adaptable systems that meet user needs across various industries.\nThrough its OSN (Ozak Stream Network), it ensures trustless and tamper-proof data aggregation for enterprise use. These technologies are designed to process real-time financial data, generate predictive models, and perform analytics for financial markets. The Ozak Prediction Agent furthers these capabilities. Analyzing internal and external datasets and enhancing informed decision-making is the strength of the platform.\nPresale Progress, Listing Milestones, and Token Distribution\nOzak AI’s OZ token presale has moved through four pricing stages to date. The initial price was $0.001 during the first stage. In stage two, the price rose to $0.002, followed by $0.003 in the third stage. The fourth stage currently lists OZ at $0.005. The upcoming fifth stage will double this to $0.01. The project targets a final price of $1 post-presale, with structured growth and scaling plans already in place.\nSource: Ozak AI\nAs of the current reporting period, 23.18 million OZ tokens have been sold. The current presale has generated $1.31 million in funding. A total of 10 billion OZ tokens exist, with 3 billion allocated for presale. The remaining supply is distributed across reserves, community, liquidity, and team allocations.\nOzak AI also announced a $1 million giveaway open to presale participants, where individuals holding at least $100 worth of OZ tokens are eligible. A hundred winners will share the prize pool, and participants gain additional entries by referring others.\nUse Cases and Differentiating Factors\nThe Ozak AI operating framework can be used in multiple real-time, high-accuracy areas. To take an example, its system provides financial market analytics and allows modeling with automated anticipation of market behaviors. It provides a high availability and fault tolerance through OSN and DePIN making the system more responsive.\nThe data will travel through the shared nodes and will be checked by the smart contracts, thus, eliminating the centralized control. This forms a strong framework of financial analysis and decision-making and OSN also offers security of the data by sourcing out of multiple networks in a safe way.\nFor more information about Ozak AI, visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Solana Succeeds Despite On-Chain Challenges", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/solana-succeeds-despite-on-chain-challenges", "text": "Solana’s price has remained within the $150 range from the weekend of July 4, 2025 and beyond. This is despite a slump in on-chain activity and also thanks to use cases in non-blockchain activities, as well as corporate support.\nAll these show that the Ethereum Killer has created a healthy base of use cases and should continue to succeed well into the future.\nThe Many Uses of Solana\nAs one of the most famous tokens in the world, Solana has created a healthy selection of use cases, even in industries you might not have expected. For example, the Solana token has seen a lot of use in the gambling space. This can be put down to its speed, scalability, and attractive fee structure, as well as its impressive price predictions. As such, gambling with Solana means fast transactions and the chance for profit.\nConsumers have certainly caught on to this and are wagering the token in droves. As gambling writer Alex Hoffmann explains, Solana casino sites are more widely used than ever before, and this shows no signs of stopping.\nAnother source of demand for the token can be credited to institutional interest. Recently, for example, DeFi Development Corporation made an impressive purchase of 17,760 SOL, which brings its total SOL token holdings to 640,585 SOL. With this, it retains its place in a growing list of corporations holding Solana as a reserve asset.\nFinally, there was the launch of its staking ETF, which saw immense support from investors. It debuted with $33 million in trading volume on its first day, showing the hunger for SOL-related products. This also comes as Solana is believed to be on its way to its own spot ETFin the same vein as Bitcoin and Ether.\nThese developments show that on an individual and institutional level, there is a lot of faith in Solana. As such, even the challenges it faced in May 2025 have not deterred its upward trajectory.\nMay 2025 Brings Challenges For Solana\nAs per data from Blockworks Research, Solana’s network activity saw a slump in June. Its REV declined by 48% to $63 million in the space of a month. Its app revenue did not fare any better, with a 38% dip from May to June 2025.\nBut despite this, Solana is still one of the biggest tokens and ecosystems around today. It represented 31% of on-chain transactions for the entire blockchain space, even putting it ahead of the likes of Ethereum. It also claimed 35% of app revenue across blockchains.\nThis is perhaps why the value of the token has held so well. The weekend of July 5, 2025, saw its price sit at $150, a level it still maintains as of July 8, 2025. All things considered, Solana as a project continues to enjoy a positive reputation in the crypto sector. And while, like all tokens, it has faced its periods of decline and challenges, it has a solid base of individual and institutional support to help it bounce back.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

But the buzz isn’t just about numbers—it’s about consistency, infrastructure, and strategic visibility.\nFrom developer grants to its AI-native Virtual Machine, Lightchain AI is earning its spot not through hype, but through traction. As Aptos slips from the radar, Lightchain is rising—steadily building trust among high-value wallets and reminding the market what real growth looks like.\nAptos Loses Visibility Among High-Value Wallets and Analysts\nAptos (APT) is experiencing a decline in visibility among high-value wallets and analysts, reflecting a shift in investor sentiment. After unlocking over $65 million worth of tokens, Aptos faced selling pressure, briefly pushing prices below the key $6 mark. This drop of nearly 10.5% to $5.50 was accompanied by a surge in trading volume to $374 million, the highest in a month, indicating that while the token remains on the radar, its appeal is waning.\nAnalyst coverage has also diminished, with fewer reports and lower engagement, leading to increased volatility and reduced liquidity. This trend suggests that Aptos may face challenges in regaining momentum without renewed institutional interest and clearer strategic direction.\nAs of May 30, 2025, Aptos (APT) is trading at $4.95, reflecting a 0.85% decline from the previous close.\nLightchain AI Completes 15 Presale Stages With Consistent Buyer Momentum\nLightchain AI has completed all 15 stages of its presale with remarkable consistency in buyer momentum, raising over $21 million and moving into a fixed-price Bonus Round. This traction isn’t fueled by hype—it’s driven by substance.\nLightchain’s technical architecture includes sharding, enabling parallel processing to handle high-throughput AI workloads without compromising speed or security. As mainnet launch nears, public GitHub repositories will open, giving developers full access to core protocol code, smart contracts, and infrastructure.\nTo further streamline onboarding, the Developer Portal provides detailed technical documentation, APIs, and sandbox environments for immediate engagement. Lightchain AI’s progress reflects a clear path from funding to functionality, attracting builders and buyers alike with every milestone delivered.\nWhy Lightchain AI is New Darling of Crypto Whales\nLightchain AI is turning heads among crypto whales—and for good reason. Its cutting-edge architecture and real-world utility make it a game-changer. Imagine gas fees that adjust to task complexity, keeping costs low even for massive AI workloads. With Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), you get top-notch privacy without sacrificing verification.\nPlus, its powerful cross-chain infrastructure ensures seamless interactions with other blockchains. It’s no wonder big players are quietly snapping it up. This isn’t just hype—it’s a bold, calculated move.\nhttps://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf\nhttps://t.me/LightchainProtocol\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Lightchain AI has exceeded expectations, completing 15 presale phases with remarkable momentum. With all presale stages finalized and a Bonus Round now live at a fixed price of $0.007, Lightchain AI has already raised an impressive $21.1 million. In contrast, Polygon, once a pioneer in the blockchain space, faces growing challenges in maintaining its significant market capitalization amidst increasing competition.\nThis blog explores the factors driving Lightchain AI’s rapid ascent and examines whether Polygon’s dominance in the crypto world is as secure as it appears. Join us for an in-depth analysis of two projects on divergent paths. Which one will shape the future?\nPolygon Struggles to Validate Its Market Valuation Amid Slowing Growth\nPolygon (POL), previously MATIC, is struggling to keep up with its market capitalization, slowing growth and growing competition. As of June 2025, POL has a trading price of around $0.21, which is a sharp fall from its ATH of $2.92 in December 2021. The coin had a five-year low of $0.196 in March 2025, bearing more bearish fruit on long-term supportive trendlines.\nA 3.5% decrease in POL's price in a single day followed in May 2025 after co-founder Mihailo Bjelic resigned from the company. That being said, many analysts think POL could be worth somewhere between $0.192 and $0.225 in 2025, which is quite a turnaround. But the token’s rebound depends on returning investing enthusiasm and the success of strategies to promote adoption and use within the Polygon network.\nLightchain AI Successfully Completes 15 Presale Stages With Strong Momentum\nLightchain AI has successfully completed all 15 presale stages, raising over $21.1 million and attracting more than 150,000 participants. The presale began with token prices at $0.002 and concluded at $0.007125, showcasing growing investor confidence in its AI-integrated blockchain platform.\nThe architecture of Lightchain AI is designed to support real-time AI execution and efficient data processing. Key components include the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), which enables the deployment of AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps). The platform also utilizes a Proof-of-Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, validating transactions through AI computations to enhance scalability and security. Additionally, the Transparent AI Framework ensures auditable and explainable AI decision-making processes. Together, these components create a seamless, scalable, and intelligent network.\nAs the project moves toward its mainnet launch in July 2025, Lightchain AI is finalizing its infrastructure, onboarding validators, and activating developer incentive programs. The Bonus Round provides the final opportunity for participants to acquire LCAI tokens at presale prices before the network becomes fully operational.\nFrom Questions to Action — Lightchain AI Leads Where Others Lag Behind\nLightchain AI isn’t just making promises—it’s delivering results. With 15 presale stages completed and a massive $21.1 million raised, we’re proving our commitment to innovation. Our tested staking mechanisms and builder-focused tokenomics are built to empower creators, while low-latency AI execution and upcoming public repositories ensure full transparency. As validator nodes gear up for launch, the path to mainnet is clearer than ever.\nEarly curiosity is transforming into real progress—and you can be part of it. Don’t just watch the future of decentralized intelligence unfold—help shape it.

But growing numbers of holders are selling memecoins for what analysts characterize as an XRP rival with real-world potential.\nMemecoins Fail to Sustain Investor Interest\nShiba Inu has a market cap of $7.09 billion with trading volume up by 10.14%. DOGE is higher with a cap of $25.95 billion, but there's a fall over 1.99% in trading volume.\nWhile the figures show stability, growth has stopped for the majority of it. Investors are finally catching on to the fact that memecoins, while wonderful as short-term pumps, rarely ever help with long-term gains.\nWith no long-term fundamentals or meaningful upgrades in the pipeline, everyone is asking: what's the next meme wonder?\nThe strange case of an XRP rival in 2025\nAs the memecoins hype wanes, attention shifts to Remittix, a PayFi project being compared to XRP for its utility in cross-border payments.\nRemittix (RTX) allows users to exchange crypto like BTC, ETH and DOGE for fiat in an instant no exchanges, no fuss, no complicated process.

The price jump will see the HINU token’s value rise from $0.00018686 to $0.00018741.\nThe jump is the latest in a series of price increases that have taken place since the pre-launch phase began on April 1. The project’s presale and pre-launch phases have helped the project raise over $800,000 so far.\nHusky Inu (HINU) Set For Price Increase\nHusky Inu (HINU) is gearing up for its next price increase, which takes place in just over 10 hours as its pre-launch phase continues. The latest price increase will see the HINU token rise from its current value of $0.00018686 to $0.00018741. The project’s regular price increases are part of its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The HINU token’s value was $0.00015000 at the beginning of the pre-launch phase. Since then, it has registered several price increases by utilizing a dynamic pricing system. The pre-launch picked up where the presale ended, helping empower the fledgling Husky Inu community and allowing the project to continue its fundraising efforts. It is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion.\nHow Does Husky Inu’s Pre-Launch Phase Work?\nThe Husky Inu team describes the pre-launch phases as a progressive token pricing strategy designed to reward early adopters while promoting transparent growth. With the pre-launch phases underway, token prices will steadily increase every two days, following a compounded growth model, and will continue rising until all tokens are sold out. The pre-launch phase is designed to empower the Husky Inu community and ensure those joining the project at the start can benefit from favorable pricing.\nLet’s understand how the pre-launch phase will work. The starting price of the HINU token at the beginning of the pre-launch phase was $0.00015000. This price will increase every two days until all HINU tokens sell out. The longer the presale lasts, the higher the token price rises. The pre-launch phase ends immediately once the HINU tokens sell out.\nBitcoin (BTC) Soars To New All-Time High\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) soared past $112,000 on Wednesday as bullish sentiment returned to the crypto market.

Emirates Deputy President and Chief Commercial Officer Adnan Kazim stated,\n“Partnering with Crypto.com to integrate cryptocurrency into our digital payments system reflects Emirates’ commitment to meeting evolving customer preferences, in addition to tapping into younger, tech-savvy customer segments who prefer digital currencies.”\nCrypto.com’s popular payments business feature allows merchants to accept over 20 settlement options, including BTC and ETH, and fiat currencies, including USD and EUR. The feature is currently used by over 4,000 merchants. Crypto.com’s President and COO Eric Anziani stated,\n“As we continue to expand the everyday use case for crypto, integration with exceptional partners such as Emirates will bring real momentum to the digital asset industry and enable both companies to offer genuine innovative finance solutions for our customers.”\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\nBitcoin (BTC) decisively broke above $110,000 on Wednesday as it surged to a new all-time high on Coinbase. The flagship cryptocurrency started the week in the red, dropping 0.88% to $108,273. The price fell to a low of $107,446 on Tuesday but recovered to register an increase of 0.62% and settle at $108,942. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as the price rallied to a new all-time high before retreating and settling at $111,255.\nAnalysts believe several factors pushed BTC to a new all-time high on Wednesday. Institutional adoption and ETF inflows have continued, driving positive market sentiment. Bitcoin ETFs have registered over $14 billion in net inflows for the year. Additionally, public companies like Strategy have continued accumulating BTC, driving up demand for the asset. The Trump administration’s pro-crypto outlook has also fueled bullish sentiment. Trump’s push for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, formalized by an executive order, proposes acquiring up to 200,000 BTC annually over the next five years. The US Senate is also advancing a crucial stablecoin regulatory framework, with Coinbase’s inclusion in the S&P 500 further pushing crypto into the mainstream.\nBTC’s rally also came as markets returned to a “risk-on” mode, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rising to a record close. Tech stocks rallied on Wednesday after Nvidia became the first company to hit $4 trillion in market capitalization. Investors largely ignored the latest developments around Trump’s tariffs, driving the Nasdaq Composite to record levels. Institutions have largely accepted BTC’s “digital gold” narrative, with the asset’s price largely rising and falling alongside stocks, depending on investor sentiment. Analysts expect BTC to reach new highs in the second half of the year as corporate entities accelerate their buying sprees, adding more of the asset to their treasuries. The passage of crypto regulation is also expected to boost prices.\n“With crypto week on the horizon next week in DC, and a likely flood of positive momentum heading into the dog days of summer, bullish sentiment and thinner trading volumes could see prices gap up to $120,000 or higher by the end of next week. How far we rally through the summer is anyone’s guess, but open call interest outweighs puts, which normally reveals traders are bullish and expect upward price momentum to continue.”\nBTC ended the previous weekend in positive territory, rising nearly 1% on Sunday (June 29) and settling at $108,350. The price was back in the red on Monday, dropping 1.09% to $107,168. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as BTC fell 1.33%, slipping below $106,000 to $105,740. The price recovered on Wednesday, surging nearly 3% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,845. Buyers retained control on Thursday as BTC rose 0.73%, briefly crossing $110,000 before settling at $109,637. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.41% to settle at $108,097.\nSource: TradingView\nThe flagship cryptocurrency recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday before rising almost 1% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,231.

The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $2,824 during the ongoing session before declining to current levels. The broader market rally has seen bullish sentiment around ETH return, as it soared past key levels. ETH’s robust performance this week indicates growing confidence in the DeFi ecosystem and a renewed interest in the Ethereum network. Several catalysts could push ETH higher in July, including rising demand for Ethereum ETFs on Wall Street. Data also shows that Ethereum demand has surged in recent weeks, with exchange supply dropping considerably over the past few months.\nETH registered a notable increase on Sunday (June 29), rising 2.57% to $2,500. However, it lost momentum on Monday after facing selling pressure and volatility, and fell 0.55% to $2,486. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as the price dropped over 3% and settled at $2,407.

It briefly crossed $2,800 during the ongoing session, reaching an intraday high of $2,824 before moving to its current level of $2,788.\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\nSolana (SOL) registered a substantial rally on Wednesday as risk-on sentiment returned. The altcoin extended its gains for a third consecutive day, finally clearing the resistance around $152-$153. Despite the positive sentiment, SOL faces a significant hurdle at $160, a level at which it has faced rejection. If SOL fails to clear this level, it could start a fresh decline, pushing the price towards $150. A break below this level could drive SOL towards $140. On the other hand, a break above $160 could drive the price towards $180.\nSOL ended the previous weekend on a positive note, rising nearly 2% to $153.

Questions are swirling around NEAR Protocol as it faces new scrutiny amid this dramatic rise. This article delves into the shifting dynamics and explores which coins could be on the brink of significant growth.\nThis content is powered by Outset PR, where crypto-native communication meets data-driven intelligence. Outset PR equips web3 projects with the tools to shape conversations, seize moments of opportunity, and drive sustained market relevance.\nNEAR Protocol Eyes Resistance with Short-Term Surge\nSource: tradingview\nThe NEAR Protocol is currently showing some positive momentum, with its price ranging between just over two dollars and about two dollars and thirty-six cents. It has climbed over eleven percent in the past week, hinting at some short-term strength. The nearest resistance it could face is around two dollars and fifty-three cents. Breaking this level may push NEAR to approach the next resistance near two dollars and eighty-seven cents, marking potential gains of roughly twenty-one percent from its current position. However, it's important to note that the coin has seen a drop of over fifty-four percent in the last six months, indicating ongoing volatility.\nHyperliquid Shows Bullish Trends, Poised for Potential Growth\nSource: tradingview\nHyperliquid (HYPE) is experiencing positive movement, trading between $37.38 and $41.76. It recently climbed by nearly 6% in a week and almost 12% over the past month. The coin's value skyrocketed by about 93% in the last six months. The nearest resistance level is around $43.68, suggesting potential growth. If it breaks this, the next target is about $48.06. This momentum indicates a possible further rise of approximately 15% to 20% from its current range, continuing its strong upward trend, while traders eye support levels at $34.92.\nPR with C-Level Clarity: Outset PR’s Proprietary Techniques Deliver Tangible Results\nIf PR has ever felt like trying to navigate a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data.

As Litecoin and Ethereum move around major price zones, BlockDAG is turning heads with an approach focused on active community buying.\nA clear LTC price target has gained attention as Litecoin moves past key resistance, while the newest ETH price update shows Ethereum nearing a critical barrier. But this week’s action goes beyond charts and support lines.\nCommunity-focused moves like BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles and the upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release show how fresh strategies in presale design can boost traction, offering something different alongside more established coins.\nLitecoin Moves Toward $97.10 After Breaking Resistance\nLitecoin has broken through its long-standing descending resistance, giving traders a reason to focus on a new LTC price target. The latest price action has pushed LTC closer to the $97.10 mark, which is now seen as a near-term goal by many analysts.\nIf the current buying pace continues, experts believe the LTC price target could stretch toward $100 in the short run. This breakout, combined with rising trade volume, supports the idea that positive sentiment is picking up. Litecoin’s latest move has renewed hopes for stronger upward momentum and possible new highs.\nETH Price Update Shows Price Stalling Below Key Resistance\nEthereum is hovering near $2,578 today, posting a slight 0.70% increase in the past day, as shown in the current ETH price update. Even with the gain, ETH remains locked between support at $2,185 and resistance near $2,750, showing limited direction. While whale activity stays consistent, retail participation remains low.\nOn the blockchain, whales are staking nearly 60,000 ETH weekly, pushing the total staked amount to 36 million. This points to steady long-term support, even as retail interest slows down. A clean move past $2,600 is being watched as a confirmation signal. Based on this ETH price update, ETH may continue ranging unless retail engagement picks up.\nBuyer Battles Turn BlockDAG’s Presale Into a Competitive Strategy\nBlockDAG’s Buyer Battles are turning its presale into a daily contest, helping it stand out among this year’s top crypto gainers. Each day, 50M BDAG coins are released for purchase, but there’s a twist. Unsold coins go directly to the day’s highest buyer, giving every participant a real chance to collect extra holdings without added cost. This twist adds a competitive edge to each transaction.\nThe $0.0016 entry price is still active until BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11, giving buyers a clear reason to act quickly. Participants use the Buyer Battles to increase their holdings while competing for leaderboard spots and bonus rewards. Many see this as a sharp way to accumulate before BDAG’s launch price of $0.05 goes live.\nSo far, BlockDAG has raised $335 million and sold over 23.7 billion coins across 29 batches. The ongoing buzz around Buyer Battles plays a big role in keeping daily momentum high. This approach helps BlockDAG rank among the top crypto gainers, even without relying on heavy ad campaigns.\nInstead, the project’s growth is being fueled by its own users. Leaderboard placements, referral incentives, and active sharing help maintain interest. This community-based model shows how consistent, organic support can power strong results, making BlockDAG a clear one to watch as its GLOBAL LAUNCH release nears.\nLooking Forward\nThe latest LTC price target and ETH price update both highlight how traders remain cautious, waiting for decisive moves before shifting positions. With Litecoin now aiming for $100 and Ethereum testing key resistance, timing and patience are essential.\nMeanwhile, BlockDAG’s community-powered Buyer Battles and GLOBAL LAUNCH release are creating new interest daily. For anyone tracking top crypto gainers this year, watching how the LTC price develops, reviewing the ETH price update, and monitoring BlockDAG’s presale could lead to smart decisions in the weeks ahead.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

This has resulted in analysts touting it as the best crypto presale in 2025 by far. Let’s dive in.\nXRP’s Surprise Comeback: BNY Mellon Ignites The Fire\nXRP is back in the headlines after a long stretch of uncertainty. This week, BNY Mellon confirmed it has started using XRP in its internal payment systems for international settlements.\nThat news alone pushed XRP’s price up 17% in 24 hours with the price now $2.37 a juicy 5% gain in 24 hours at the time of writing. XRP is now holding firm in the top 10, and market watchers are already predicting more upside.\nAnalysts are saying that if this adoption expands globally, XRP could cross the $3 mark before the end of Q3. A few even think it could challenge Ethereum’s number-two position if Ethereum doesn't deliver stronger network upgrades soon.\nEthereum Holds Its Ground But Faces Pressure\nEthereum hasn’t had a bad week, but it also hasn’t done much to steal the spotlight. ETH is trading around $2,670, with sideways movement reflecting uncertainty in the broader market.\nIts latest upgrade brought improvements, but gas fees are still an issue for small users. Ethereum's roadmap includes another update in Q4, but that feels too far off for some.\nMany investors are wondering whether Ethereum’s slow scaling and high fees could make room for leaner competitors.\nEven with strong developer backing and a massive investor base in the likes of CME, the network feels sluggish. Price predictions vary, but if Ethereum doesn't break above $2,800 soon, bulls could lose steam.\nRemittix Stands Out As 2025’s Best Crypto Presale With Real-World Use And Smart Tools\nWhile the headlines focus on XRP and Ethereum, Remittix is quietly building something stronger. The upcoming Remittix wallet, expected to launch in Q3, is built for instant crypto-to-fiat swaps, cross-border payments, and direct wallet-to-wallet settlements.\nThe Payfi project runs on clean infrastructure that allows users to accept and spend digital assets like regular money. It’s smooth, fast, and already turning heads in the business space.\nWhat puts Remittix ahead is how it solves the real problems that XRP and Ethereum still struggle with. No high gas fees. No complicated contracts. Just clear solutions. The community is active, and more merchants are testing its payment tools.\nIf you're tired of waiting for big coins to catch up to modern needs, now’s a smart time to watch Remittix. It’s not built on hype, it’s built on something you can actually use.\nDiscover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their presale here:\nWebsite: https://remittix.io/\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/remittix\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Ondo's Tokenized Treasury Fund Debuts on XRP Ledger, Lifting ONDO Price Outlook", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/ondos-tokenized-treasury-fund-debuts-on-xrp-ledger-lifting-ondo-price-outlook", "text": "Ondo Finance has expanded its real-world asset footprint with the deployment of its tokenized U.S. Treasuries product, OUSG, on the XRP Ledger. The move marks a notable shift in the tokenization landscape, aligning decentralized finance infrastructure with the scale and compliance expectations of traditional capital markets.\nThe market has responded favorably. ONDO, the governance token underpinning Ondo’s ecosystem, rose more than 5% in the hours following the announcement, trading around $0.81 as of Tuesday afternoon. Analysts view the XRP Ledger integration as a strategic accelerant for ONDO’s value proposition, potentially positioning it as a bellwether asset in the emerging RWA (real-world asset) sector.\nWhat is OUSG?\nOUSG—short for Ondo Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries—is a tokenized fund backed by ultra-short duration U.S. Treasury instruments. Originally launched on Ethereum, the fund has been adopted by DeFi users seeking stable, yield-generating products tied to real-world government debt.\nNow, its expansion to the XRP Ledger introduces new technical advantages: low transaction fees, sub-second settlement, and native compliance primitives like decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and on-chain credentialing.\nInstitutional Rails: RLUSD and Liquidity Pathways\nThe XRPL deployment coincides with deeper integration into Ripple’s newly launched stablecoin, RLUSD. Institutional clients can now mint and redeem OUSG around the clock using RLUSD, streamlining access to tokenized Treasuries while maintaining a regulatory-compliant footprint.\nTogether, the launch forms a vertically integrated asset pathway—from fiat-backed stablecoins to government bond exposure—all secured within a blockchain-native framework. Market observers suggest the model could appeal to asset managers, hedge funds, and family offices seeking automated access to conservative yield without the frictions of legacy custodianship.\nPrice Implications for ONDO\nThe expansion is widely viewed as constructive for ONDO’s medium-term outlook. The token, which serves governance and utility functions across Ondo’s suite of products, may see increasing demand as more users onboard into the ecosystem through OUSG. As institutional flows build, so too may ONDO’s strategic relevance.\nSource: TradingView\nAccording to market data, ONDO is currently trading in the $0.75–$0.83 range, showing a modest 1.57% gain over the past week. However, zooming out reveals a more cautious picture: the token is down 6.55% over the past month and has declined 40.39% over the last six months.\nThe coin is currently in consolidation, with technical indicators offering a mixed outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 50.15, signaling neutral sentiment. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages converge at $0.78, reinforcing the idea of range-bound trading. Meanwhile, the Stochastic Oscillator at 72.69 is approaching overbought levels, suggesting that a short-term reversal is possible.\nONDO faces immediate resistance at $0.86. A clean break above that level could open the door to a secondary target of $0.94, implying an upside of approximately 13% from current levels. On the downside, support sits at $0.70, with a break below potentially dragging the price down to $0.62, a drop of nearly 17%.\nThese levels may serve as important inflection points for traders assessing ONDO’s response to OUSG’s integration and the broader RWA narrative.\nNarrative Engineering: Visibility That Fits the Market\nAs ONDO attempts to position itself at the intersection of DeFi and traditional finance, visibility and timing will be just as critical as product development. In a market crowded with copycat narratives and overhyped rollouts, firms like Outset PR have emerged as a strategic partner for growth-stage crypto projects aiming to control the story behind the valuation.\nUnlike conventional agencies that offer templated campaigns and mass-blast outreach, Outset PR combines real-time media analytics with proprietary content distribution technique, delivering measurable visibility across high-discovery surfaces like Google Discover. Their campaigns are tied to performance benchmarks and informed by live audience behavior.\nOutset’s in-house user acquisition tech has helped projects like ChangeNOW achieve a 40% sustained boost in visibility, while their tailored selection of outlets has enabled Step App to outperform engagement benchmarks in key geographies. By turning public relations into a data-backed function rather than a soft narrative exercise, Outset is increasingly shaping how crypto projects enter mainstream attention.\nAs institutional adoption grows, PR strategies anchored in C-level clarity and predictive analytics may become indispensable to separating signal from noise.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe OUSG-XRPL deployment is more than a cross-chain milestone—it reflects the growing convergence between regulated finance and decentralized markets. For ONDO, the integration could bolster long-term value through increased token utility, ecosystem reach, and institutional alignment.\nHowever, without clear narrative execution and targeted visibility, even high-potential tokens risk being lost in the noise. Visibility drives valuation, and valuation, in this market, still hinges on who tells the story—when, where, and how.\nYou can find more information about Outset PR here:\nWebsite: outsetpr.io\nTelegram: t.me/outsetpr\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

A high-profile trader who successfully predicted early breakouts in Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has just made a wild but calculated forecast: Little Pepe (LILPEPE), currently in presale for under $0.0015, is primed to explode to $0.30 before Cardano (ADA) reaches the $3 mark again. For those who know what this means, it’s a potential 230x move, and traders aren’t wasting time.\nLILPEPE’s Presale Is Almost Gone—And That’s Fueling the Frenzy\nWhat started as another meme coin idea is now shaping up to become a full-scale meme-layer blockchain revolution. LILPEPE is currently in Stage 4 of its presale, with the token priced at $0.0013. According to the official site, over 3.39 billion tokens have already been sold, raising $4,013,905 out of the $4.475 million hard cap.

Once the presale ends, LILPEPE will list at $0.003, giving Stage 4 buyers an instant 130.76% gain before the real rally even begins. And that’s just the appetizer—if the token hits it's forecasted $0.30, investors who invested at $0.0013 would be sitting on a 22,946% gain.\nWhy the $0.30 Prediction Isn’t Just Meme Hype\nThe bold price forecast comes from a veteran trader who made millions from SHIB and DOGE. He believes LILPEPE is a “next-gen meme coin” with actual infrastructure to support it. LILPEPE isn’t just riding vibes—it’s building a Layer-2 blockchain specifically optimized for meme tokens, ultra-fast transactions, zero trading tax, and sniper-bot protection. In a report by IndiaTimes, analysts argue that LILPEPE is “stealing the spotlight from Shiba Inu and Pepe” and could become the central hub for meme coin launches in 2025. That narrative alone has drawn serious attention from whales—and they’re not hesitating.\nDeep-Pocket Investors Are Rushing In\nEarly data from blockchain watchers suggests that deep-pocketed buyers have been accumulating LILPEPE since Stage 3 when the price was just $0.0010. Those investors are already sitting on 30% gains—and they’re still buying more in Stage 4. A feature on GlobeNewswire highlighted that the overwhelming presale demand and rapid sellouts indicate extreme FOMO among both large investors and retail buyers. And it’s not just about price action. LILPEPE is running a $770,000 giveaway to attract even more traction. Ten lucky winners will each receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens, further increasing community engagement ahead of its exchange listing.\nMeanwhile, Cardano (ADA) Is Crawling Toward $3\nNow, let’s talk about Cardano. ADA has bounced from its lows and is showing a stable structure. However, even optimistic analysts don’t expect it to break $3 again anytime soon. A recent prediction by InvestingHaven suggests that ADA could reach $2.36 by late 2025, while others, such as Changelly and XT.com, envision a more gradual climb. ADA remains one of the most respected and fundamentally sound crypto projects, but it’s built for slow, calculated growth. That’s great for traditional investors—but not enough to satisfy high-risk, high-return seekers.\n230x Gains Before Q3 2025? The Math Adds Up\nLILPEPE’s forecasted $0.30 price target would deliver a 230x return from the current $0.0013 presale price. With whales accumulating, massive presale demand, and a viral community strategy, including its headline-grabbing giveaway, the stars are aligning. In less than five days, Stage 4 went from launch to nearly complete, and it’s only a matter of time before the price hikes to $0.0014. If you’re buying at this level, you’re not just buying tokens—you’re buying into the LILPEPE movement before it becomes a full-blown breakout.\nFinal Take: The Slow Path vs. The Fast Lane\nCardano will likely reach $3 again. But it will take time—possibly well into 2026. LILPEPE, on the other hand, is like catching Ethereum at $5. The runway is shorter, and the volatility is higher, but the payoff? Monumental. For investors who missed Dogecoin, ignored Shiba Inu, or doubted PEPE’s ascent, this is your redemption arc. $0.0013 today could become $0.30 in 2025. The math is there. The hype is real. The window? Closing fast. If you’re hunting for that once-in-a-cycle shot at 200x+ returns, this might just be your moment.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Every Burn Has a Narrative: What’s the Impact of FUNToken’s Over-Time Supply Cuts", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/every-burn-has-a-narrative-whats-the-impact-of-funtokens-over-time-supply-cuts", "text": "Most tokens in the Web3 space launch with aggressive promises about scarcity and deflation, yet very few sustain them beyond the first months of hype. FUNToken has emerged as a notable exception. Its burn events are not simply symbolic marketing moments but are structurally tied to the project’s revenue and designed to create a compounding effect on long-term value.\nEach burn tells a story. It is a data point proving that utility and adoption are feeding directly into a transparent reduction in circulating supply. In a sector often criticized for opaque tokenomics and questionable inflation practices, FUNToken’s steady sequence of burns has become a foundation for trust and a narrative that sets it apart.\nToday, FUNToken trades around $0.01106, with daily volumes exceeding $60 million, and a total market capitalization near $119 million.\nThe figures are significant because they reflect a project where the token’s value is influenced by measurable fundamentals rather than speculative cycles alone.\nBurn Events as a Reflection of Ecosystem Health\nEvery time FUNToken executes a burn, it is not simply reducing supply. It is sending a signal to both new users and long-term holders that adoption and transaction volume are real and verifiable.\nThe most recent burn, completed on June 24, 2025, permanently removed 25 million FUN from circulation. Unlike many burn announcements that rely on pre-mined reserves or treasury reallocations, this event was funded entirely by platform revenue. This is an important distinction. It means that each quarter, the protocol is using half of its income to buy back tokens and eliminate them, rather than simply moving tokens between wallets.\nThis commitment creates a direct economic connection between community participation and scarcity. As engagement increases across the Telegram AI $FUN bot, gaming transactions, and staking, the burn pool naturally grows. Each burn becomes a transparent checkpoint that quantifies progress and reinforces the deflationary story.\nImmediate Price Impact and Market Signals\nBurn events have consistently produced measurable effects on FUNToken’s price. The June 24 burn was no exception. In the 24 hours following the announcement, the token surged from around $0.0045 to approximately $0.0064, reflecting a 41 percent gain.\nWhile prices later stabilized, this immediate response highlighted a recurring pattern in FUNToken’s performance. Investors respond to burns not because they are surprised but because each event confirms that the token’s supply mechanics remain intact.\nLong-Term Impact on Supply Dynamics\nThe impact of over-time supply cuts goes beyond short-term price action. By systematically reducing circulating tokens, FUNToken is slowly compressing available supply in a way that benefits holders over extended horizons.\nHere are some key factors that make this deflationary approach credible:\nThis model contrasts with projects that inflate supply through incentives while promising deflation “eventually.” FUNToken’s schedule means that each quarter includes a new milestone of supply compression, which compounds over time.\nThe Role of CertiK in Reinforcing Trust\nSecurity has become a defining characteristic of whether a burn narrative holds credibility. In the case of FUNToken, a full CertiK audit has verified that the contract is immutable. There are no minting backdoors, no privileged addresses able to issue additional tokens, and no centralized levers to manipulate supply.\nCertiK Skynet continues to monitor the contract 24/7. This level of transparency is critical because it prevents any discrepancy between announced burns and actual supply reductions. For users crossing over from Web2 and accustomed to visible ledgers and receipts, this audit trail feels familiar and reassuring.\nThe Telegram AI Bot as a Deflationary Engine\nWhile burn events reflect the outcomes, the source of the revenue is equally important. FUNToken’s AI-powered Telegram bot is a central driver of that income. By incentivizing users to participate in chats, quizzes, and daily reward spins, the bot captures consistent activity that translates into volume and revenue.\nThis design is crucial because it links free-to-play onboarding directly to token velocity. As participation grows, the burn pool expands, making each reduction in supply more meaningful.\nRoadmap Milestones That Sustain the Narrative\nFor a burn story to remain credible, it must be supported by a roadmap that shows how adoption will keep growing. FUNToken’s 2025–2026 roadmap outlines this progression clearly:\nQ3–Q4 2025 will see the launch of a dedicated mobile wallet, designed to operate seamlessly within a familiar app environment, offering staking, swaps, and real-time balance tracking\nBy the end of 2025, the team plans to roll out more than 30 new play-to-earn games that will integrate directly with the FUNToken reward system\nIn Q1 2026, the project is targeting a milestone of more than 1 million active wallets\nEach of these milestones directly supports revenue growth, creating a larger and more sustainable burn pool over time.\nWhy Each Burn Builds Narrative Strength\nUnlike sporadic token reductions, FUNToken’s quarterly burns create a rhythm that reinforces trust. Every time a burn is executed:\nOver time, this repetition builds narrative strength. New users entering the ecosystem do not have to rely on promises of future deflation—they can look back at a history of verifiable burns that have incrementally reduced supply.\nConclusion\nIn the crowded landscape of Web3 projects, many tokens speak of deflation but fail to deliver consistent proof. FUNToken has established itself as a rare example where every burn is a documented step in a long-term strategy.\nEach supply cut is more than a reduction in numbers. It is a story of adoption converting into measurable scarcity, of user participation driving revenue that funds buybacks, and of transparent governance underpinned by CertiK verification.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The exploit, which occurred early Wednesday, prompted the exchange to halt trading and disable minting and redemption of GLP tokens on both the Arbitrum and Avalanche networks as a precautionary measure.\nAccording to an official statement, the attack impacted only GMX V1 and its GLP pool. The platform confirmed that its GMX V2 markets, liquidity pools, and native GMX token remained unaffected by the breach.\nExploit Method and On-Chain Activity\nInitial on-chain analysis revealed that the attacker systematically drained funds from the GLP pool, converting assets from USDC to ETH and subsequently to DAI. Additional assets stolen included millions worth of FRAX, wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), wrapped Ether (WETH), and other cryptocurrencies.\nBlockchain security firm PeckShieldAlert highlighted a message sent to the attacker via an on-chain transaction, offering a 10% bounty for the safe return of the stolen funds. GMX further stated that no legal action would be pursued if the assets were returned within 48 hours. Data from Arkham Intelligence indicated that a wallet linked to the hacker currently holds nearly $44 million in digital assets.\nVulnerability Linked to Design Flaw\nCybersecurity firm SlowMist later identified a critical design flaw in GMX V1 as the root cause of the exploit. According to their analysis, the issue stems from how GMX V1 handles short position operations. Specifically, the system’s architecture allowed the immediate update of global short average prices, creating an opportunity for price manipulation and enabling the attacker to systematically drain liquidity.\nOn an X post, SlowMist claimed,\n“The root cause of this attack stems from GMX V1's design flaw where short position operations immediately update the global short average prices.”\nEmergency Measures and Community Response\nIn response to the incident, GMX suspended GLP-related functionalities across Arbitrum and Avalanche to prevent further exploits. Platform users were advised to disable leverage and adjust their settings to halt GLP minting temporarily.\nThe team reiterated that GMX V2 remains fully operational and secure, with no vulnerabilities detected in its updated infrastructure. Industry observers noted the swift action taken by GMX in mitigating the situation, though concerns over the lasting impact on user trust and decentralized finance security remain.\nAs of the latest updates, no public response has been recorded from the attacker. The crypto community continues to monitor the wallet activity closely, while GMX and its partners investigate the breach and assess long-term protocol adjustments.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Shiba Inu Trending Again as SHIB Token Burns Skyrocket, but This Token Under $0.0015 Could Steal the Spotlight With 11937% Bullish Surge by Q4", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/shiba-inu-trending-again-as-shib-token-burns-skyrocket-but-this-token-under-00015-could-steal-the-spotlight-with-11937-bullish-surge-by-q4", "text": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) has returned to headlines as its token burn rate saw a dramatic increase and more than 9.5 million SHIB tokens were permanently removed from circulation in a recent 24-hour period. The SHIB burn mechanism aims to reduce the total supply of the coin, potentially boosting its value by increasing scarcity. Despite this aggressive reduction in supply, the token's price has remained relatively stable. According to market data, SHIB opened and closed at $0.00001181, showing little immediate response to the burn event. This indicates that while supply is decreasing, investor demand has yet to react significantly in the short term. The latest burn was one of the highest daily figures seen recently, according to data from Shibburn, the official SHIB token burn tracker. The Shiba Inu ecosystem views this strategy as a long-term approach to support price appreciation. Still, many holders remain cautious, with a large portion of wallets currently holding unrealized losses. Traders and analysts note that the SHIB price showed a brief uptick following the burn announcement. However, the overall sentiment remains mixed, as technical indicators reflect consolidation rather than strong upward movement. The MACD signal of the Shiba Inu chart confirms that while bullish momentum briefly returned, it was followed by a phase of market indecision.\nLittle Pepe Emerges as a Challenger Under $0.0015\nWhile SHIB continues to dominate the news with its burn strategy, another token has started drawing attention. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE), a meme-based project on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Layer 2 network, has gained traction with investors looking for higher returns. Currently priced at $0.0013, this token has already raised over $4 million out of a $4.475 million target. The project offers a staged token sale with the next pricing stage set at $0.0014, indicating a dynamic increase in value as tokens are sold. Nearly 3.4 billion tokens have been sold, representing over 92% of the total sale allocation. This sales structure creates an incentive for early participation, as the price will rise with each completed stage. Little Pepe markets itself as a next-generation meme token with real utility on a low-fee, high-speed Layer 2 chain. The team emphasizes decentralization, no taxes, and a meme-rich community environment. Its $777K giveaway is another attractive promotional feature that is increasing investor participation in the Little Pepe presale. These features aim to position $LILPEPE as a legitimate contender in the meme coin space, moving beyond pure speculation to offer transactional benefits. Importantly, Little Pepe accepts ETH, USDT, and card payments, making the LILPEPE purchase available to both crypto-native and traditional investors. This flexibility, paired with an aggressive marketing campaign, has fueled speculation that the token could deliver exponential growth in Q4 2025. Some projections suggest a potential surge of up to 11,937% if momentum continues.\nMarket Indicators Highlight Diverging Paths for SHIB and LILPEPE\nThe SHIB/USD intraday chart shows a price that remained flat for most of the session before a sharp breakout near 08:00. The price spiked and entered a consolidation phase with high volatility.\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator reflected a bullish crossover for Shiba Inu, followed by a brief decline and a late-session recovery. This suggests that while SHIB experienced a short-term rally, traders may still be awaiting stronger catalysts for long-term price movement. In contrast, Little Pepe’s presale momentum continues to build. The campaign’s progress bar shows over 92% completion, and the consistent buying pressure suggests high investor engagement. As SHIB focuses on reducing supply through burns, $LILPEPE is leveraging scarcity and strategic pricing to create upward price pressure even before launch. Both of the tokens are under observation in the market and thanks to its great community and established presence, Shiba Inu retains its leading position in the segment of meme coins. But there is competitive pressure through the entry of new tokens such as Little Pepe, taking the best of both worlds: the meme culture and scalable technology. The market might experience further separation during the course of Q4. Further burns and ecosystem developments would benefit Shiba Inu. In the meantime, the persistent sale and fast development of the Little Pepe might make it qualify as one of the tokens that make the breakthrough in the below-0.0015 tier. The crypto world does not stand still, and meme coins are still obvious. Shiba Inu has found some focus through its new token burns, though its performance remains lackluster. Little Pepe presale, on the contrary, demonstrates swift adoption, its investor base is growing, and there is a well-planned way to achieve more significant valuations. In this case, as both the tokens move into the next quarter, it is possible that the difference in the approach to achieving their goals between taking supply down and adopting them in an aggressive approach will ultimately be what dictates which one puts the spotlight on.\nFor More Details About Little PEPE, Visit The Below Link:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Four altcoins, Pepe, XRP, Solana and Ethereum, show setups that could pop before the summer heat breaks. Yet many large wallets are also whispering about Remittix (RTX), a brand-new payment token that some early buyers claim could bring plenty of gain.\nPEPE: Whales Move, Charts Hint at a Bounce\nPepe’s meme charm hasn’t faded, even after plunging 40 % from its May high to about $0.000010. On-chain tracker Nansen says whale holdings rose 4.1 % over the past month to 7.6 trillion tokens. One huge wallet even dropped 500 billion PEPE, worth roughly $3.85 million, onto Binance.\nTechnically, Pepe hugs the key 0.618 Fibonacci level and has tapped a bullish order block that once acted as resistance. Many chart readers think that creates a “higher low,” often the first step in a rebound. If the price can hold this support and volume ticks up, a run back toward May’s highs isn’t off the table.\nsource: tradingview\nXRP: Legal Clouds Part, Breakout Talk Swirls\nRipple’s long legal fight may end soon. The company has dropped its cross-appeal, and traders now watch to see if the SEC pulls its own. A final ruling could land within weeks, giving XRP the clarity it’s lacked since 2020.\nCommunity voices like Abdullah “Abs” Nassif argue that becoming an “XRP millionaire” might not take crazy gains. Current price trades near $2.38, but many analysts target $3–$4. With legal fog lifting, it could set the stage for XRP’s next wave.\nsource: tradingview\nSolana: Big Exchange Backs a Network Push\nCentralized exchange Bullish just announced it will settle trades and custody assets on Solana’schain, pushing more business onto the network. Price recently bounced from a swing low near $130 and now wrestles with heavy resistance around $176.\nsource: tradingview\nVolume remains the tie-breaker. If SOL closes above the range high at $154 with strong buying, the next target sits near that $176–$187 pocket. Fail there, and the market may revisit support around $131. Either way, daily fees passed $1.2 million and there were 14.6 million active addresses in a single day.\nEthereum: Derivatives Tell a New Story\nFor the first time in ages, ETH’s 24-hour derivatives volume, about $59 billion, eclipsed others. Pro trader DonAlt points to $2,200 as the key line on high-timeframe charts. Hold that level and Ethereum could reclaim the stronger uptrend it paused in June.\nsource: @CryptoDonAlt on X\nETH benefits from fresh talk of Layer-2 upgrades and real-world tokenization pilots. More big funds now list Ether alongside Bitcoin in “blue-chip” ETF filings, signaling mainstream comfort. If macro mood stays calm, ETH may be ready to play catch-up before year-end.\nWhy Investors Are Calling Remittix the #1 Presale This Year\nBig caps grab headlines, but whales quietly hunt earlier plays with fatter upside. That’s where Remittix comes in. The team raised $15.9 million, selling over 549 million RTX tokens at $0.0811. They call this last stretch “The Sprint to $18 M” and they’re close.\nThe upcoming RTX Wallet promises swaps into dozens of national currencies in ten seconds. Pilot payment lanes in West Africa and Southeast Asia go live before fall, aiming to undercut remittance fees that still average six percent. Because Remittix’s market cap starts low, even modest daily volume could trigger the kind of rally established coins only dream about.\nFinal Take\nPepe, XRP, Solana and Ethereum each show a clear reason to shine in the next market push. But if quick, high-percentage moves are the goal, the low-profile Remittix presale may offer the most compelling risk-reward. As always, do your own research and stay safe, yet remember: the biggest winners often hide where the crowd isn’t looking.\nDiscover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their presale here:\nWebsite: https://remittix.io/\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/remittix\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

And so it stands to reason that despite their current ubiquity, dominant operating systems like Windows and macOS have a natural expiration date. And AI operating systems may be about to call time on their hegemony.\nWhile traditional operating systems rely on predefined rules, forcing users to wrestle with syntax or sift through settings like digital archaeologists, their AI-powered descendents promise to turn clunkiness into cruise control. With large language models (LLMs) embedded at their core, AI OSes let users simply say what they want, whereafter their commands are executed. In short, they’re analogous to brainy computing butlers.\nWe often hear that AI is coming for our jobs, evoking images from I, Robot and countless other dystopian flicks about the dangers of tech. It’s more accurate, though, to say that AI will automate and optimize, happily handling the mundane manual tasks we all despise. While autonomous agents take care of the grunt work, a dedicated AI OS will be the beating heart of the system, coordinating the efforts of thousands – even millions – of enterprising drones.\nFrom Rigid Rules to Fluid Intelligence\nTraditional OSes are like old-school librarians – they’ll get you the book you want, providing you know the exact call number. An AI OS, though, doesn’t need structured commands: it can understand your voice, anticipate your needs, and spring into action straightaway.\nThe best way to think about the two is that regular operating systems execute, while their AI counterparts intuit. The former has no autonomy, its architecture based on compliance with strict rulesets, while the latter enables agents to prioritize tasks, manage resources, and streamline even complex workflows.\nNegative takes on AI abound, but a positive case is just as easy to make. By automating routine processes – scheduling, data sorting, inventory management, payroll – AI frees up budgets for innovation, empowering the strategists and big brains to devote their time to more dynamic matters.\nIn a sense, AI represents a lifeline for businesses toiling to stay on top of their daily operational workload.\nThe AI OS in Action\nAI-powered operating systems aren’t some far-fetched idea; they already exist in the wild, and they’re worth studying to determine just how soon we might be saying Adios to the likes of Windows and macOS. Case in point Steve, the internal AI OS of Walturn, a firm specializing in Product Engineering as a Service (PEaaS).\nDeveloped to help Walturn’s engineers coordinate client projects, allocate resources, and reduce manual effort, Steve has been a runaway success, with CEO Hashim Hayat crediting it with achieving “marked improvements in client satisfaction as a result of faster delivery times and enhanced solution accuracy.” Hayat added that such hearty feedback encouraged Walturn to “scale AI OS adoption throughout our broader operational structure.”\nWeb3 project SpoonOS is another excellent example. Described as an Agentic Operating System, it establishes an environment in which autonomous agents can perceive, reason, and execute an assortment of tasks – including those leveraging smart contracts like DeFi dApps. It also provides a convenient framework for those seeking to create, deploy, and manage such agents.\nPowered by the open-source Neo blockchain, SpoonOS’s architecture includes privacy-preserving tools, multi-agent coordination, and vector storage, as well as an orchestration engine that lets developers create agent-based apps with built-in fault tolerance and automatic recovery. The project also stores all agent data permanently on-chain, meaning there’s an auditable trail to every AI decision.\nThe AI x blockchain segment is red-hot right now. Since January, AI-related on-chain activity has surged by 86%, hitting 4.5 million daily unique active wallets. That amounts to 19% of Web3’s total – putting it neck-and-neck with gaming at 20%. AI agent projects have also raised $1.39B so far this year, up 9.4% on the total 2024 figure.\nWorkflows Rewritten, Future Unlocked\nThe emergence of AI OS isn’t about replacing long-established software, it’s about redefining work as we know it. By embedding human-like intelligence at the system level, these operating systems let small enterprises motor through their manual tasks and focus on sharpening their strategy.\nDone right, AI OS represents computing’s next frontier – predictive, human-friendly, and unstoppable. As for Windows and macOS, let’s enjoy them while they’re here.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

AGNT is making waves, surpassing well-known names. The crypto market is on a fast rise, sparking curiosity about these digital assets' potential.\nNEAR, FET, and RENDER are generating headlines. TAO also adds to the excitement. But the real intrigue lies with a unique project. Codename:Pepe offers a blend of humor and ambition. It's a mission to navigate and profit from meme coins. This project promises AI-powered insights and a community-driven approach. Codename:Pepe shows promise amidst the AI crypto surge.\nCodename:Pepe (AGNT) Gains Traction After Listing and Supply Burn, Eyes $2.1 Milestone\nCodename:Pepe ($AGNT) has recently made its entrance on Uniswap, opening the floodgates for global trading — and it didn’t come quietly.\nIn a dramatic power move, Codename:Pepe has burned a significant portion of the tokens to tighten the supply and send a clear message: this project plays to win.\n$AGNT token burns mean reducing the supply and boosting scarcity, which may fuel a price surge.\nSource: Codename:Pepe X account\nIf you missed the chance to grab $AGNT at a fraction of a cent during the presale, don’t worry — there’s still time to get in at a bargain price before it targets its next milestone: $2.\nThe team is rallying the community to drive momentum and push the price higher, aligning everyone around a shared goal — collective growth through smart, unified action.\nSource: Codename:Pepe Telegram account\nThe AGNT Outlook: Bullish with AI Fuel\nAnalysts are paying attention — and some are projecting a 30,000% gain before the end of 2025.\nHere’s why:\n-\nAI-Driven Strategy: AGENT A.I. will scan social media and blockchain data to detect trending meme coins before they explode.\n-\nAutomated Trading: The AI engine will be able to execute real-time trades, turning noise into signals and volatility into opportunity.\n-\nDAO Utility: Token holders will gain exclusive access to insider analytics and community voting through the AGNT DAO.\nMomentum is building: the presale sold out early. Now with liquidity, community energy, and a shrinking supply, AGNT is poised to move.\nCodename:Pepe fuses cutting-edge AI with meme market psychology, and it’s already showing signs of breakout potential. With the supply burn and Uniswap launch, AGNT is now positioned to lead the next wave of meme coin dominance.\nPrice Is Rising. Supply Is Shrinking. Buy $AGNT Now\nNEAR Protocol climbs 10% in a week: Will the uptrend continue?\nNEAR Protocol has seen a price increase of 10.18% over the past week. The current price ranges between $2.01 and $2.36. This recent gain suggests growing interest in the coin.\nDespite the weekly rise, NEAR's price has decreased by 7.35% over the past month and dropped 54.88% over six months. These figures indicate that the coin has faced significant volatility.\nThe nearest resistance level is $2.53, while support lies at $1.85. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 62.51, showing that the coin is approaching overbought conditions but still has room for growth.\nIf the price breaks above the resistance at $2.53, NEAR could see further gains. A move above this level might signal a potential rise of around 7%. However, if the price falls below the support at $1.85, it could decline by about 20%. Traders should watch these levels to anticipate NEAR's next move.\nFET Coin Sees Small Gains: Is a Rally Ahead?\nThe FET coin from Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is trading between $0.64 and $0.74. Despite market ups and downs, it has edged up by nearly half a percent over the past week. This slight increase has caught the attention of traders watching for signs of growth.\nIn the last month, FET experienced a drop of almost 10%, reflecting challenges in the market. Over six months, the coin's value has fallen by nearly half. These declines highlight the coin's volatility. Yet, the recent weekly gain could indicate a turning point.\nFET is nearing its resistance level at $0.80. If it can break through this barrier, further gains may follow. The support level is at $0.59, which could help prevent sharp falls. The RSI is at 48.04, suggesting the coin is in a neutral zone—not overbought or oversold.\nBased on the data, FET might see a modest rise. Breaking past the $0.80 resistance could start a bullish trend. However, considering the previous declines over the past months, it's uncertain if the upward movement will continue. The small weekly gain may hint at recovery, but it's early to predict a strong rally.\nRENDER Targets $3.62 Resistance After Weekly Bounce\nRender (RENDER) is trading between $3.03 and $3.42. Over the past week, the price increased by 4.40%, showing short-term upward movement. However, it fell by 16.74% over the past month and dropped 54.36% over six months, indicating longer-term declines.\nThe RSI is at 55.70, slightly above 50. This suggests mild bullish momentum, implying the price might continue to rise. The RSI indicates RENDER is not overbought, providing potential for further growth.\nNearest resistance is at $3.62. Breaking above this could signal a stronger uptrend. Nearest support lies at $2.84. Falling below this might lead to further declines. These levels are crucial for traders to watch.\nConsidering the recent weekly gain and RSI, RENDER may have potential to rise. If it surpasses the $3.62 resistance, it could see significant percentage gains. But given the monthly and six-month declines, there's still caution. Failure to break resistance might lead to testing support levels again.\nTAO Aims for $362 Resistance Amid Modest Recovery\nBittensor (TAO) is currently trading between $312 and $344.60. Over the past week, its price has increased by 1.13%. In contrast, the price has dropped by 16.05% in the past month and 25.62% over six months. This shows a recent slight recovery amid a longer-term downward trend.\nThe nearest resistance level for TAO is at $362. If the price rises, it may face difficulty pushing beyond this point. On the other hand, the nearest support is at $297.30. If the price falls, this level might prevent further decline.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 53.51. An RSI above 50 suggests that buying pressure is slightly stronger than selling pressure. This could indicate a potential for the price to rise in the short term.\nBased on this data, TAO might experience a modest increase. If it surpasses the $362 resistance, it could gain an additional 5% to 10%. However, if it drops below the $297.30 support, it might decrease by a similar percentage. The recent weekly gain and RSI suggest a possible upward movement.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, while AI cryptos like NEAR, FET, RENDER, and TAO have shown promise, their short-term potential appears limited. The current market favors assets that can deliver immediate and substantial returns, which these projects may not provide in the near future.\nCodename:Pepe crypto distinguishes itself by unleashing true intelligence for maximum profits.

It’s not really all that surprising given that South Korea is home to its fair share of titans of the Web3 industry.\nNow, the who’s who of Korea’s thriving crypto industry are coming together to discuss the next steps to take the country another step forward in Web3 adoption and innovation. Bringing the major players in TradFi, tech, and policymaking, #Hashed, the Korean VC, is hosting a summit in Seoul this September that aims to set the tone for the country’s future in Web3 and finance.\nEastPoint:Seoul 2025, a high-level, invite-only summit hosted by leading blockchain investor Hashed, Bloomingbit, and the Korea Economic Daily, is shaping up to be a convergence of national policymakers, traditional financial institutions, global tech players, and Web3 infrastructure providers — all under one roof, for discussions and forward-looking policy dialogue.\nInstitutions Take the Lead\nNormally crypto events are light on traditional finance players, but Hashed is flipping the script by bringing a long list of major financial fire power. The list of confirmed participants reads like a roll call of Korea’s financial powerhouses: KB Kookmin Bank, Shinhan Bank, Hana Bank, Woori Bank, along with top securities firms like NH Investment & Securities, Hana Securities, and Meritz Securities.\nAdd to that the presence of institutional investors such as Hanwha Asset Management, NH Venture Investment, Kakao Ventures, and Lotte Ventures, and you get a sense of just how seriously Korea’s financial sector is taking this next phase of digital asset development.\nJoining them are global names like Temasek (Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund), SMBC Nikko Securities from Japan, and major tech companies including Google Cloud, LG CNS, LINE NEXT, and NCSoft, clearing displaying the summit’s cross-industry ambition — and its reach far beyond the crypto-native crowd.\nA Policy Moment for Korea\nPerhaps most significantly, members of Korea’s National Assembly from across the political spectrum will participate in a joint policy panel and regulatory roundtables. Lawmakers from three major parties will join the event, including Min Byung-deok (Democratic Party), Kim Jae-seop (People Power Party), and Lee Jun-seok (Reform Party) — making EastPoint a truly bipartisan forum.\nTheir presence comes at a pivotal time, as Korea inches closer to implementing its Digital Asset Basic Act, which could pave the way for KRW-backed stablecoins, spot crypto ETFs, and tokenized securities to enter the mainstream financial system.\nBridging TradFi and Web3\nOf course, the Web3 world will also be well represented. Binance is set to join, along with all five of Korea’s licensed crypto exchanges: Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and GOPAX. The convergence of these Korean firms is no accident. They understand the stakes to join and help shape real policy discussion for the region and have a hand in working side-by-side with serious financial institutional players.\nWhat’s Next?\nThe full focus of EastPoint will touch on programmable finance, regulatory architecture, and how tokenization could redefine Korean capital markets. As only the first wave of speakers and participating institutions was released, we can expect to see more major players from tech, policy, finance, to Web3 jump on the bandwagon to have a stake in what may be one of the most influential crypto events in Asia.\nBut for now, EastPoint’s strongest message is its institutional signal: Korea is preparing to lead on digital asset integration — and it’s inviting the world’s financial and tech leaders to help shape the path.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The initiative, aimed at enhancing user engagement and loyalty, will integrate cryptocurrency-based rewards directly into the platform’s operations, positioning Truth Social among a growing number of social media networks experimenting with blockchain-based incentives.\nUtility Token to Power Loyalty Rewards Program\nIn its latest announcement, Truth Social confirmed it will introduce a utility token linked to its new loyalty rewards scheme for subscribers of its Patriot Package. Currently priced at $9.99 per month, the Patriot Package grants users premium access to the platform and soon, an opportunity to earn rewards based on their activity.\nSubscribers will accumulate digital 'gems' through platform engagement, which will later be converted into a utility token usable across Truth Social and its upcoming streaming service, Truth+. This marks a significant step in the platform’s digital asset strategy, integrating blockchain technology not just for speculation, but for practical, in-platform utility.\nFrom Meme Tokens to Practical Digital Assets\nTruth Social’s planned token stands apart from conventional meme coins, often driven by speculative trading. Instead, the company aims to create a sustainable, utility-focused asset that provides tangible benefits to its subscriber base. The token is expected to facilitate payments for subscription services and potentially expand to other products and features within the Truth Social ecosystem.\nThis measured approach signals a broader ambition to build a stable, value-driven digital environment for its users, offering practical applications for cryptocurrency rather than purely speculative appeal.\nOngoing Crypto Ambitions at Trump Media\nThe utility token initiative forms part of a wider digital asset strategy under Trump Media & Technology Group. The parent company has consistently signaled interest in blockchain ventures, most recently filing for a crypto blue-chip ETF featuring established digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cronos.\nAdding to this momentum, Donald Trump Jr. recently acquired $4 million worth of shares in Thumzup Media, a firm with crypto-focused growth plans and holdings in Ethereum, Solana, Ripple, Dogecoin, and Litecoin. This acquisition underlines the Trump family’s active involvement in the sector and signals a commitment to expanding their digital asset footprint.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

More and more investors are shifting from high-risk trading to passive income strategies, and cloud mining is rapidly becoming the preferred choice.\nThe key advantage of cloud mining lies in its accessibility—users don’t need to purchase mining machines or have any technical background. With a simple registration, they can start receiving daily mining income. This article provides an in-depth review of 8 of the most trusted cloud mining platforms worldwide, enabling users to earn up to $6,312 per day in passive income without bearing excessive risk.\n1. MiningToken – Swiss-Regulated Platform with Daily Earnings Up to $6,312\nHeadquartered in Switzerland, MiningToken is a cloud mining platform committed to green energy solutions.

ECOS supports payments via credit cards and cryptocurrencies.\n3. Binance Cloud Mining – Integrated with the World’s Largest Crypto Exchange\nBinance’s cloud mining integrates directly with the Binance exchange ecosystem. Users can mine using their on-platform assets—no setup needed.\nExample: a $10,000 contract over 3 days can earn up to $280 per day, totaling around $840 (annualized ROI: ~102%). Binance also offers floating interest rates, hashrate multipliers, and trading fee discounts. Earnings can be instantly reinvested into the Binance ecosystem.\n4.

A typical 90-day contract returns 2.5% daily, or $675 profit on a $1,000 investment. Principal is refunded after term completion. Supports BTC and USDT withdrawals.\n5. NiceHash – Flexible Market-Based Hashpower Trading\nNiceHash allows users to buy or sell hashpower on an open market. For instance, renting 1 TH/s of Bitcoin hashpower costs ~$0.60/day and may yield ~$0.68/day, yielding ~10% daily net profit.\nIt’s ideal for technically-savvy users seeking arbitrage or custom mining strategies.

Payments accepted via PayPal and cryptocurrencies. Great for low-risk, multi-coin portfolio experimentation.\n7. ViaBTC Cloud Mining – Backed by a Leading Global Mining Pool\nViaBTC combines a well-known mining pool with cloud contract services. It offers both PPS+ and PPLNS payment models.\nExample: A $1,000, 10-day contract earns $26/day or $260 total (annual ROI ~95%). Hourly payout accuracy, transparent fees, and traceable hashrate sources make it ideal for mid-size miners. Supports BTC, LTC, and BCH.\n8. StormGain – Discontinued Mining, Now Trading-Focused\nPreviously offering \"free cloud mining with leverage trading,\" StormGain provided ~0.0318 BTC daily to logged-in users. However, as of January 2025, mining operations have ceased, and services have shifted to the YouHodler platform.\nExisting users can still claim residual balances, but new contracts are no longer supported.\nBeginner’s Guide to Cloud Mining in 2025\nFor those new to cloud mining, follow these essential tips:\n-\nStart with Free Trials: Use trial offers (e.g., MiningToken) to learn platform features with zero risk.\n-\nUnderstand Contract Duration & ROI: Shorter, transparent plans help you monitor capital flow and profit structure.\n-\nBegin Small and Scale Gradually: Test with $100–$300 before committing larger sums.\n-\nPrefer Daily Payouts: Platforms offering daily settlements improve liquidity and financial control.\n-\nCheck Compliance and Reviews: Choose platforms with regulatory backing and positive user feedback.\nMastering these fundamentals empowers investors to confidently navigate and optimize cloud mining opportunities.\nConclusion & Expert Recommendations\nBased on this professional assessment, the following conclusions are drawn:\n-\nBest High-Yield Option: MiningToken leads with returns up to $6,312/day.

New Reward System Launches as Crypto Presale Nears End", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/could-bitcoin-solaris-token-holders-really-earn-05-btc-new-reward-system-launches-as-crypto-presale-nears-end", "text": "It might sound like crypto folklore, but no, Bitcoin Solaris is not promising Lambos for everyone. What it’s doing, however, is launching one of the most inventive blockchain reward systems of 2025. Between mini-games, real BTC prizes, and a rapidly closing presale, the momentum behind BTC-S is turning heads across the market.\nAnd as that July 31 launch date inches closer, this question keeps popping up in communities: “Is this one of the last fair shots at serious gains?” Let’s find out.\nThe Surprise Hit of the Alt Season\nBitcoin Solaris isn’t trying to imitate the past; it’s rewriting the playbook. Built on a hybrid dual-layer model that combines Proof-of-Work with Delegated Proof-of-Stake, it merges Bitcoin-grade security with real-world usability. While Bitcoin focused on being money, BTC-S wants to be value, movement, and utility, all wrapped in one chain.\nWhat’s turning heads is not just speed, but infrastructure:\n-\nThe Base Layer, powered by SHA-256, remains compatible with standard Bitcoin mining hardware.\n-\nThe Solaris Layer runs with blazing 15-second blocks and dynamic scalability up to 100,000 TPS.\n-\nValidators rotate daily with slashing mechanisms for performance failures.\n-\nA unique dual-consensus sync ensures state accuracy and seamless transitions across layers.\nAnd yet, despite all this power under the hood, BTC-S remains focused on one thing: helping retail users build actual wealth. That starts with rewards.\nThe Reward System That Feels Like a Game\nBitcoin Solaris introduces a gamified experience that could reward holders with up to 0.5 BTC. The twist? It’s all done through a simple daily login system.\nHere’s how it works:\n-\nEvery BTC-S holder gets one daily free spin. No strings attached.\n-\nSpending more unlocks more spins. A $250 buy-in allows up to 5% extra tokens.\n-\nGo higher and hit 13% with $1,000. Or go all in at $2,500 for a shot at 0.5 BTC.\n-\nSpins are instant and fully integrated. No need to stake or lock your funds.\nThis is more than just rewards, it’s retention, excitement, and strategy baked into the holder experience. By merging gaming mechanics with real returns, BTC-S creates what few coins manage: fun and financial upside in one place.\nSay Goodbye to Slow Chains BTC-S Moves at 10,000 TPS\nStronger Audits. Stronger Trust.\nSecurity is non-negotiable. That’s why Bitcoin Solaris completed not one but two independent smart contract audits. Both Cyberscope and Freshcoins reviewed the protocol and published their findings, reinforcing the project’s credibility early on. You can read more about the reviews in the Cyberscope audit and the Freshcoins audit, both available on their GitHub pages.\n-\nDetailed community reviews were recently published by major YouTube names like Token Galaxy and Crypto Vlog, further breaking down why BTC-S is rising fast.\n-\nWith over 14,000 users now participating, this isn’t some stealth microcap. It’s becoming a serious movement.\nPresale Ending Soon: A Price Rollback Makes Waves\nThe Bitcoin Solaris presale is already in phase 11. With a current and next phase price of $11 and a public launch target of $20, early participants are staring at a possible 150% return. But it gets better.\nFor a limited time only, Bitcoin Solaris has introduced something rare in crypto: a Price Rollback. That’s right. The current rate has dropped from $11 to $5 for a short window. This is not a bonus or a discount; it’s a deliberate move to open the door one last time before the market explodes.\nSome facts:\n-\nOver $6.6 million has already been raised.\n-\nThe launch date is set for July 31.\n-\nMore than 14,150 users are already in.\n-\nWallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for receiving tokens on launch day.\nNo buzzwords. No fancy jargon. Just numbers and momentum.\nMobile Mining and the Upcoming Solaris Nova App\nLet’s talk accessibility. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users will be able to mine BTC-S using their smartphones. This isn’t a gimmick. It’s powered by real-time contribution scoring and time-weighted payouts.\n-\nCalculations factor in device type and uptime.\n-\nBlock rewards are distributed transparently and efficiently.\n-\nYou can preview your earnings using the mining calculator.\nMining is no longer a gate-kept privilege. It’s going mobile. It’s going mainstream.\nFinal Verdict: 2025’s Rich List Might Just Begin Here\nBitcoin Solaris isn’t chasing Bitcoin. It’s building on what Bitcoin lacked: speed, scalability, and access. From the upcoming LBank listing to its community-driven validator system and real BTC prizes, BTC-S is blending performance with possibilities.\nAnd while everyone is waiting for “the next bull run,” Bitcoin Solaris is creating its own.\nFor more information on Bitcoin Solaris:\nWebsite: https://www.bitcoinsolaris.com/\nTelegram: https://t.me/Bitcoinsolaris\nX: https://x.com/BitcoinSolaris\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Best Crypto to Buy Now With New SEC Guidelines On Cryptocurrency ETPs", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/best-crypto-to-buy-now-with-new-sec-guidelines-on-cryptocurrency-etps", "text": "For years, the idea of government regulation in crypto sparked heated debates. Many saw it as a threat to the decentralized spirit that gave birth to Bitcoin and altcoins. But as the space matured, and as major institutions, banks, and even governments began stepping in, the conversation changed.\nRegulation, once viewed with suspicion, is increasingly seen as a necessary framework to help crypto scale responsibly. The SEC’s latest guidelines reflect this narrative too. Rather than stifling innovation, they aim to give crypto a defined place within the broader financial system, offering clarity on risks, custody, and disclosures. This moment could mark a turning point, one where crypto is no longer just an outsider asset, but a recognized player with vast potential ahead.\nSEC’s New Guidelines and What They Mean for Crypto\nThe SEC’s recent release of detailed guidance for crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) marks one of the clearest regulatory moves in recent memory. After months of watching crypto ETFs flourish with little uniformity, the Commission has now outlined specific areas issuers must address.\nChief among these are disclosures on price volatility, custodial practices, hacking risks, and market manipulation safeguards. Issuers are expected to break down exactly how they handle private key security and whether they use cold, warm, or hot storage solutions.\n🚨NEW: The SEC’s Corp Fin division has issued fresh guidance on disclosure expectations for crypto ETPs.\n— Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) July 1, 2025\nIt gives a detailed outline of what issuers need to include in filings — from how they calculate NAV and select benchmarks to custody practices, service provider… pic.twitter.com/s5rvTbq2dE\nImportantly, the SEC is also asking for transparency around incidental rights like forks, airdrops, or other network events that can impact coin supply and value. Another key point is clarifying how fees erode the underlying crypto per share over time. For investors, these guidelines create a more transparent landscape, helping advisors and clients alike better understand the products they engage with.\nFor the crypto industry, it sets the stage for faster, clearer approvals and signals that regulators are taking digital assets seriously, not to restrain them, but to integrate them meaningfully into financial markets.\nIn parallel, Bitcoin has once again broken past the $112,000 all-time high, a milestone that coincides with this regulatory progress. Whether coincidence or correlation, demand for crypto appears to be surging, making this an unusually compelling time to evaluate entry into Bitcoin and altcoins as both adoption and legitimacy accelerate.\nBest Crypto to Buy Now As Altcoin Demand Starts Increasing\nBest Wallet Token\nBest Wallet Token serves as the native token of Best Wallet, a multi-chain Web3 wallet built to simplify crypto management for users without reducing functionality. It handles cross-chain transactions, decentralized finance activities, NFT storage, and portfolio tracking within a single, unified system. The token plays several roles: it reduces transaction fees inside the wallet, grants access to advanced features, and gives holders a say in how the platform develops over time.\nHaving raised more than $13 million already, one of the main features that the project offers is its transaction batching mechanism, which allows multiple actions to be combined into a single on-chain approval. This reduces both time and gas costs, creating a smoother user experience. In addition, token holders can participate in staking, receiving rewards while helping secure the wallet’s operations.\n🔥 Over $13M Raised and Counting! 🔥\n— Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025\nBest Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:\n✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app\n✅ Buy and bridge across chains in one place\n✅ Full portfolio control, no clutter\nDownload… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v\nWith the SEC’s recent guidelines offering more structure around crypto products, tools like Best Wallet are well placed to meet the needs of a growing user base seeking both simplicity and transparency.\nAs crypto shifts from an experimental niche to part of mainstream finance, having a wallet that meets technical demands while aligning with clearer regulatory expectations becomes more valuable. Best Wallet Token, through its practical functions and governance layer, fits into this changing environment, offering users an integrated approach to managing digital assets with greater confidence.\nSUBBD\nSUBBD offers a decentralized platform designed for digital creators to engage with their audiences without the limitations often imposed by traditional platforms. Through SUBBD, creators can monetize their work directly using subscriptions, one-time tips, and collaborative projects, bypassing the commissions and algorithm-driven exposure models common elsewhere.\nThe SUBBD token enables payments, governs platform decisions, and supports creator-led initiatives, creating a more balanced relationship between creators and their supporters.\nOne of its most practical features is the automated subscription model powered by smart contracts. Fans can subscribe using micro-payments that renew automatically on-chain, ensuring creators receive support without middlemen. Creators can also issue access tokens for premium content or exclusive updates, providing tailored experiences for their communities.\nWith the SEC’s recent push for better disclosure and clarity in crypto projects, platforms like SUBBD gain relevance. Clearer regulatory frameworks help define how tokenized creator economies can operate without legal uncertainty. For creators, this reduces risks tied to sudden platform changes or revenue disruptions.\nFor audiences, it offers more transparency in how they support the voices they care about. As digital economies evolve alongside regulatory improvements, SUBBD reflects how crypto can reshape industries beyond finance and introduce fairer models for creative work.\nBitcoin Hyper\nBitcoin Hyper is a Layer 2 network developed to increase Bitcoin’s scalability and functionality by processing transactions off-chain while anchoring final settlement to Bitcoin’s main network. This approach allows for higher transaction throughput and the use of smart contracts without modifying Bitcoin’s core design, effectively expanding what can be built around it.\nA central feature is the use of rollup technology combined with zero-knowledge proofs, which compress large sets of transactions before they are finalized on-chain. This reduces network congestion and opens space for decentralized applications such as exchanges, lending markets, and NFT platforms that rely on faster, more efficient infrastructure.\nThe timing of Bitcoin Hyper’s progress coincides with the SEC’s new guidelines, which offer clearer rules for custody, transparency, and market safeguards. While these guidelines apply broadly, they set a more predictable backdrop for projects that connect to major assets like Bitcoin.\nThe project has already gained recognition, thanks to multiple media posts and YouTube videos, especially on high-reach channels like 99Bitcoins and more. Recently, Bitcoin crossed the $112,000 level again, a milestone reflecting renewed demand across the crypto market. Projects like Bitcoin Hyper benefit from this momentum by offering the infrastructure that supports further use cases and adoption, making the broader crypto space more accessible and capable.\nToken 6900\nToken 6900 takes an unconventional approach in a space crowded with projects that often chase trends without offering substance. Built around community participation and self-aware design, Token 6900 operates as both a social experiment and a functional ecosystem. It creates an economy where holders shape the narrative and direction, not through vague promises but through clear, rule-based interactions coded directly into its smart contracts.\nOne example is how the token uses event-triggered mechanisms. When certain milestones are hit; for example, a specified number of transfers or liquidity events, then the contract executes predefined actions, such as adjusting supply or redistributing a portion of the pool back to active holders. This creates a dynamic environment where engagement is not just cosmetic but has measurable impact on the token’s state.\nThe SEC’s recent emphasis on transparency and disclosure indirectly benefits projects like Token 6900. While it thrives on unpredictability within its own ecosystem, the framework within which it operates becomes clearer when regulators define how risks, rewards, and mechanics must be communicated to the public.\nTOKEN6900 full of raisins. $250k mfers. pic.twitter.com/bczl1mencT\n— Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 9, 2025\nThis helps filter out projects relying on ambiguity or hype alone, giving space for those that have real structure behind their ideas. As interest in alternative tokens grows alongside broader crypto momentum, Token 6900 presents itself as a case study in how creative ecosystems can function with purpose in an increasingly mature digital market.\nSnorter\nSnorter is a Telegram-integrated bot that blends artificial intelligence with crypto utility, offering users a way to interact with blockchain features directly from their chat interface. Rather than requiring external platforms or complex steps, Snorter lets users execute functions like price tracking, wallet management, token swaps, and on-chain queries within Telegram itself. This makes crypto activity feel closer to everyday communication, lowering the barrier to entry for a wide range of users.\nA particularly useful feature is Snorter’s ability to automate trades based on predefined triggers. For instance, users can set instructions for the bot to execute swaps if certain market conditions are met, creating an experience that merges accessibility with real-time action. Additionally, Snorter supports community management tools for projects, enabling token distribution, announcements, and community analytics within a familiar environment.\nWith the SEC’s new guidelines pushing for clearer communication around how crypto tools operate, bots like Snorter stand to benefit. Users will increasingly look for services that explain their functions, risks, and limitations in straightforward terms.\nSnorter’s mix of convenience and transparency aligns with this shift, offering a service that is both practical and accountable. As the market continues to draw in new participants, especially following Bitcoin’s surge past $112,000, tools that simplify crypto interactions without compromising clarity will likely see heightened demand.\nConclusion\nThe SEC’s recent move creates a market environment where serious projects can thrive, and where both investors and developers gain more confidence in the stability of the space. It is not about eliminating risk, but about understanding the framework in which risk operates.\nCombined with Bitcoin’s recent surge past previous highs and the visible increase in altcoin demand, the stage appears set for a new phase of activity. Projects, like the ones mentioned above, stand to gain heavily from such developments, making it one of the best times to start accumulating for high returns in the coming months.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Its philanthropic initiative focuses on environmental protection, cultural heritage preservation, and support for individuals living with Asperger's syndrome, now understood as a high-functioning form of autism spectrum disorder or ASD, which an estimated 2.0-2.5% of the world's population suffers from.\nKoloc is leveraging her status to spread awareness and raise funds for the foundation, which has already secured funding of $290,000. $100,000 came from Gleec Exchange, another $100,000 from Mandala Exchange, and her personal contribution amounted to $90,000. The foundation is on a mission to bridge action, art, and empathy worldwide, with deep personal roots and a global board of trustees.\nFOUNDATION 29 will announce its first series of projects across the three pillars in the immediate future. As its reach expands, regular updates will follow, and the projects will benefit from expert guidance from the trustees and support from an international network.\nA story of resilience – and many national flags\nThe launch event, hosted by CNN journalist Jiří Šlégl from the Czech Republic, welcomed cultural leaders, international trustees, and supporters to introduce an initiative that's shaped by a global vision and personal experience at the same time. Koloc reflected on her experience of living with Asperger's and her multicultural background in her keynote speech, revealing how hers is a story of \"many flags, a mosaic of identities\" fueling her desire to connect individuals worldwide through action, art, and empathy.\nShe was born in Dubai to a Seychellois-Sudanese mother and a Czech father with Vanuatuan roots. Her diverse heritage helped shape her personality: vision from Dubai, resilience from the Czech Republic, strength from Sudan, peace in simplicity from the Seychelles, and ancestral wisdom from Vanuatu.\nShe was diagnosed with Asperger's in her early teens, and social interactions didn't come easily to her. She overcame that challenge through motorsport, a team sport that involves working with mechanics, engineers, media, etc. She learned to communicate by practicing public speaking and regularly stepping out of her comfort zone.\nRefusing to let the diagnosis define her, Koloc won first place in the 2022 FIA Middle East Cup for Cross-Country Bajas - T3 series, first place in the 2024 24H Series - GT4 (in progress), and third place in 24H GT Series - GT4 (2023).\nChampioning cultural preservation, environmental protection, and neuroinclusion\nA trustee with the relevant perspective and experience leads each of FOUNDATION 29's three pillars, and each trustee has received $80,000 to launch pillar-specific projects. Te Moli Venaos Goiset, a Vanuatuan philanthropist and tribal chief, will help preserve endangered artistic expressions, from the spiritual legacy of Pacific tribal cultures to Renaissance masterpieces. He hopes that FOUNDATION 29 will be able to restore the values that Europe has lost by reconnecting people with their ancestral truths, art, and nature.\nHugues de Jaillon, a world-renowned public figure and philanthropic strategist, has been entrusted with initiatives to protect ecosystems, especially in Asia and the Pacific. He believes Koloc's FOUNDATION 29 will play a pivotal role in environmental initiatives, especially in Asia, as Koloc's racing is bringing her closer and closer to this region.\nSyed Nusrat Ahmed, a specialist in autism and long-time supporter of Koloc's career, will assist in tailoring programs to give young people with this form of ASD the opportunities and tools they need to survive and thrive. He pledges an unwavering commitment to supporting programs in underserved regions and respects Koloc's drive to help others, which stems from her own experience with the condition.\n29 was Koloc's first race number; her father was born on July 29, and she and her twin sister should have been born on July 29 as well, but they were early. It was her 21st birthday on July 1. The number 29 reminds her not only of where she wants to go, but also of where she has been. She remains committed to expanding the reach of FOUNDATION 29 alongside her career as her racing season continues with a GT race in Most, Czech Republic, and further rallies this fall. She commented:\n\"This foundation is not about charity. It is about commitment. It belongs to all who want to honor the past, uplift the present, and protect the future. To our trustees, to our supporters: Thank you for walking with me.\"\nThe future of crypto-powered cultural preservation\nKoloc says she has always loved discovering new ideas and has learned a great deal about crypto and blockchain since starting to work with Raphael Coin (RAPH), which is supported by Gleec's blockchain infrastructure. RAPH enables fractional ownership of \"Recto: Study for the Battle of the Milvian Bridge,\" a preparatory drawing by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael.\nShe loves art and finds its connection with technology fascinating. Anyone can help preserve cultural heritage through fractional ownership. The launch of FOUNDATION 29 is part of a dynamic that extends beyond racing, encompassing responsibility, identity, and the future of crypto-powered cultural preservation.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

(POPMART) and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil (USOIL). These additions further extend BTCC’s portfolio of real-world asset trading options.\nWith the inclusion of POPMART and USOIL, BTCC now offers access to over 370 tokenized futures contracts. Since launching in June, the platform’s newest offerings have collectively exceeded $1 million in trading volume, reflecting growing interest in diversified asset exposure among its users.\nIn tandem with the expansion, BTCC has integrated TradingView’s technical analysis tools into its web platform. The integration equips traders with a comprehensive suite of tools, including support for a wide array of technical indicators. Notable features include the ability to set Take Profit and Stop Loss levels directly on charts, multi-chart viewing (split screen), and the combination of indicators such as Fibonacci retracement levels with Bollinger Bands.\nBTCC’s tokenized futures now cover 49 traditional market assets across four primary categories, all traded against USDT. These categories include:\n-\nStocks: Including companies like Tesla, Apple, and Microsoft, with leverage up to 50x.\n-\nCommodities: Such as gold and silver, with leverage up to 150x.\n-\nForex: Including currency pairs like EUR/USD and GBP/USD, with leverage up to 200x.\n-\nIndices: Such as the S&P 500 and Dow Jones.\n“As one of the first crypto platforms to offer tokenized futures, we were quick to identify the potential for blockchain technology to transform access to traditional markets.

On the heels of a series of newsworthy failures, authorities are pointing to Remittix — an under-the-radar but fierce competitor that's already making waves in the crypto space.\nThe Splashy Presale Isn't Always the Greatest\nSome of the most newsworthy presales in recent years have failed to materialize. Projects earlier hyped by influencers or overly hyped have suffered token dumps, liquidity issues, or the worst-case scenario — total abandonment. That's why investors are looking to real utility over hype when seeking the best crypto presale.\nRemittix offers just that — a PayFi infrastructure with real use, steady investor demand, and a growing presale success story.\nRemittix's Quiet Rise Looks Very Familiar\nRemittix (RTX) is also being pre-funded because of its fiat-crypto bridge, which allows users to send crypto like BTC, ETH, or XRP directly into a bank account in just a few minutes.\nIt was such a focus on utility that most believe it allowed early versions of Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM) to explode on adoption. And now that Remittix has already raised over $16 million and sold 550 million tokens, the similarities are hard to ignore.\nAdd to that its Q3 wallet launch and PayFi roadmap, and analysts are certain that RTX is headed to breakout land.\nWhy Analysts Think That This Could Be 2025's Breakout Token\nThe primary reason Remittix could be the best crypto presale of 2025 is that it addresses issues that can actually be solved in the real world.\nWhether it's entrepreneurs who need to receive payments internationally or everyday consumers wishing to cash out crypto without delay, Remittix has a convenient solution.\nIts new wallet will allow users to store tokens, withdraw to fiat, and make crypto payments directly — all in one app.\nAnd right now, the Remittix presale boasts a 50% bonus for early buyers on tokens, with the team aiming for an $18 million softcap.\nRemittix May Be the Presale This Market Has Been Waiting For\nAt a token price of $0.0811, supported investor appetite, and a tangible real-world utility, Remittix is ticking all the boxes that other failed presales simply didn't.\nWith adoption growing at this pace, analysts foresee RTX becoming a top 50 contender in a year's time and competing with established players in the payments space.\nWhile yet more projects vanish into the darkness, Remittix is gaining traction by simply doing something beautifully simple: offering value.\nAnd that's exactly what could make it the greatest crypto presale of 2025.\nDiscover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their presale here:\nWebsite: https://remittix.io/\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/remittix\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The project has gained traction in the crypto community for its unique blend of scalability and utility within the meme coin segment. Market watchers have projected that this Shiba Inu killer under $0.002 is positioned to soar 23,957% and knock SHIB out of the top two meme coins in market cap. The token is priced at $0.0013 in its current presale phase and continues to attract interest from both retail and institutional investors. Built as a Layer 2 blockchain infrastructure on Ethereum, Little Pepe is introducing a performance-focused environment optimized for meme coins, DApps, and DeFi development. Its compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ensures seamless integration for developers and provides a low-cost, high-speed alternative to Layer 1 networks.\nPresale Momentum and Layer 2 Infrastructure Development\nLittle Pepe has completed three rapid presale stages, signaling growing demand and investor confidence. Now in Stage 4, the project continues to gain momentum, having already sold over 3.23 billion tokens out of the 3.750 billion allocated, marking 86.13% completion of this phase. The presale has now surpassed $3.80 million in total funds raised, steadily progressing toward its $4.475 million Stage 4 target and reflecting strong upward growth across each round. The core of Little Pepe’s appeal lies in its Layer 2 architecture, which allows for significantly reduced gas fees and faster transaction processing. These features provide a reliable infrastructure for developers looking to deploy smart contracts and applications within a cost-efficient ecosystem. The project also introduces an anti-sniper bot protocol, aiming to reduce unfair trading during high-demand launches.\nUtility Ecosystem and Exchange Strategy\nThe $LILPEPE token functions as the primary utility asset of the Little Pepe ecosystem. Its use spans across staking, governance, transaction settlements, and DApp operations. Additionally, the platform is developing a meme coin-focused Launchpad intended to support new token launches. This positions Little Pepe as a utility-driven protocol rather than a speculative asset. Multiple exchange listings have also contributed to the project’s exposure. Two centralized exchanges (CEXs) supported $LILPEPE early on, and further listings are reportedly in progress. While the name of a top tier exchange is being withheld, the team has indicated that negotiations are underway. This strategic move is expected to provide the liquidity required for broader adoption.\nGrowing Community and Market Sentiment\nLittle Pepe is rapidly gaining traction across social media platforms like Telegram and X (formerly Twitter), attracting increasing attention from both retail and high-net-worth crypto investors. The project’s community continues to expand alongside growing presale demand. To further boost engagement, the team has launched a massive $777,000 giveaway during the presale. As part of this initiative, ten lucky winners will each receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens, making it one of the most rewarding community campaigns in the meme coin space. Experts have not ceased to keep an eye on the project in its development, with the possibility of LILPEPE entering a market cap of more than $1 billion in case of projections. Being a Shiba Inu killer with a price of less than 0.002 dollars with an anticipated growth of 23,957% and expanding the meme coin space, second in market cap after SHIB, Little Pepe is now being followed as one of the leading tokens in the meme coin market.\nFor More Details About Little PEPE, Visit The Below Link:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Amid this momentum, a new player, XYZVerse, emerges with ambitious goals. Its presale is targeting significant returns, and there's talk of a potential listing at $0.10. This development raises questions about the next big opportunity in the crypto market. As established coins rally, will this newcomer deliver on its promise of substantial gains?\nXYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin?\nThe buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch.\nThe current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price.\nBullish Mood on $XYZ\nXYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow.\nXYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster, who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.”\nMore Than Just a Meme Coin\nUnlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value.\nRight now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention.\nStill Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends\nBeyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time.\nA Community-Driven Project With Big Plans\nOne thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility.\nThe recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use.\nAs part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem.\nBy bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement.\nCould XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin?\nWith a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look.\nJoin XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity\nXRP: The Borderless Cryptocurrency Aiming to Simplify Global Payments\nXRP is a digital currency built to move money as quickly as information. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it offers fast, low-cost transactions across borders without the need for a bank account. With no central authority controlling it, XRP transactions are secure and irreversible. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP launched with 100 billion coins, and 80 billion were gifted to Ripple to support its development. Ripple, originally called OpenCoin Inc., has placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to release them in a controlled way.\nDerived from \"ripple credits,\" XRP aims to make transferring payments between different currencies seamless. Its technology enables quick and cheap transactions, setting it apart from other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. In today's market, XRP may attract attention as more people look for efficient ways to send money globally. While the crypto market has its ups and downs, XRP's focus on real-world use could make it appealing to those interested in the future of digital payments.\nSolana's SOL Coin: Speeding Ahead in the Crypto Race\nSolana is a rising star in the world of blockchain platforms. It focuses on scalability, offering a base for decentralized applications (dapps). Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana sets itself apart with its speedy transactions and flexible development options. At the heart of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana's native cryptocurrency. SOL powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network.\nThe potential of Solana lies in its high-capacity network that doesn't rely on sharding or second-layer solutions. This makes it appealing for developers looking to build high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, SOL looks attractive due to its technological advantages and growing adoption. While Ethereum struggles with high fees and slower speeds, Solana offers a faster and more cost-effective alternative. As more projects and investors turn to Solana, SOL could continue to gain value, making it a coin to watch in the evolving crypto landscape.\nCardano’s ADA: A Green Revolution in the Crypto World\nCardano is changing the cryptocurrency scene with fresh ideas. It's a platform for creating smart contracts—digital deals that work on their own. What sets Cardano apart is its use of Ouroboros, a system that saves energy and is kind to the environment. The blockchain is split into two layers: one for handling money transfers and another for smart contracts. This design makes it faster and more efficient, potentially handling up to a million transactions per second. ADA is Cardano's own coin, much like Ethereum's ETH. People can use ADA to save, spend, or earn more by supporting the network.\nIn today's market, ADA looks promising. Its focus on sustainability sets it apart from coins that use lots of energy, like Bitcoin. With the ability to process many transactions quickly, Cardano could become a strong player as more people use cryptocurrencies. The introduction of native tokens in 2021 made smart contracts on Cardano secure and low-cost. This might attract developers and users looking for efficient solutions. Compared to other coins, ADA offers speed, eco-friendliness, and flexibility. As the crypto market grows, ADA's unique features could make it an attractive choice for many.\nConclusion\nWhile XRP, SOL, and ADA continue to perform well, XYZVerse's innovative sports-meme ecosystem positions $XYZ for unprecedented growth in the current bull run.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In this assessment, we look at two very exceptional properties—PEPE Coin, a meme-pushed token inspired by the internet way of life, and Ozak AI, a presale-stage project grounded in artificial intelligence and decentralized analytics. The debate in 2025 facilities around which of these tokens offers the more potent upside in both returns and relevance.\nPEPE Coin: Viral Momentum and Meme Appeal\nPEPE Coin has quickly come to be one of the most recognizable meme coins, riding the success of projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. It thrives on the internet way of life, rapid-fire trading, and a community-first technique. Priced in fractions of a cent, PEPE keeps to draw speculative buyers hoping to copy past meme coin success memories. In preceding cycles, cash like PEPE noticed exponential gains in brief durations—largely because of viral tweets, influencer mentions, and short-term hype.\nHowever, the number one venture for PEPE in 2025 lies in its lack of a stable utility base. It stays in basic terms driven by using sentiment. While this can bring about speedy rallies, it often results in similarly sharp crashes. Its long-term boom capability depends heavily on whether the meme narrative can live applicable and whether or not the community can preserve momentum in an unexpectedly evolving crypto market. The coin may additionally hit higher short-term price goals like $0.00001, but sustaining those levels may be hard without real use cases.\nOzak AI: Real-World Utility Meets AI Technology\nOzak AI, on the other hand, represents a new breed of crypto projects that combine artificial intelligence with blockchain infrastructure. At its core, Ozak AI aims to disrupt data analytics in decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional sectors by offering real-time predictive tools, AI-powered agents, and secure data processing through decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN). Still in Ozak AI presale phase at $0.005, the project has already gained attention for its forward-looking roadmap and focus on solving real-world problems.\nWhat sets Ozak AI apart is the fact that it isn’t built on hype—it’s built on innovation. With features like Ozak Stream Network for low-latency processing and customizable AI Forecast Agents, the platform positions itself as more than a token. It’s an ecosystem. If it can successfully transition from presale to mainstream adoption, its $1 target price represents a massive 200x upside. For investors seeking long-term value over short-term thrill, Ozak AI provides a compelling narrative.\nWhile PEPE Coin may continue to excite traders with short-term meme hype, its future remains tied to market sentiment. Ozak AI, in contrast, offers a structured path toward adoption and scalability. For those aiming to maximize gains in the next crypto cycle, the smarter bet may lie in AI-driven utility over viral unpredictability.\nIn the battle between meme power and AI utility, Ozak AI may not just win—it could redefine what success looks like in 2025.\nAbout Ozak AI\nOzak AI is a blockchain-based crypto task that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.\nFor more, visit:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nTwitter : https://x.com/ozakagi\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

However, they have hit strong resistance, and are in overbought territory. What’s next for both?\n$BTC breaking down? Will altcoins do the same?\nBitcoin is the daddy of the cryptocurrencies and of that there is absolutely no doubt. For the altcoins to run, Bitcoin will need to run first.\nCurrently, things are on a knife edge for Bitcoin as to whether Wednesday’s $3,000 surge to a new all-time high will continue, or whether this move is about to break down, given the oversold nature of the king of the cryptocurrencies right now.\n$ETH meets with solid rejection at $2,800\nSource: TradingView\nLooking on the short-term time frame for the $ETH price it can be seen that the price is now nicely above the major 2,500 horizontal level. However, the recent attempt to surpass the $2,800 horizontal resistance has been met with a solid rejection by the bears.\nGiven how overbought $ETH is on practically every time frame, even up to the weekly, a continuation of this rejection is probably the only game in town right now.\nA period of sideways and down price action for $ETH?\nSource: TradingView\nThe weekly view for $ETH shows how important the current horizontal resistance level is. The price structure above this level builds on the firm structure underneath. Once the price gets above and confirms, this would turn into very strong support, enabling the $ETH price to be let loose.\nAll this said, it does not look like it will happen this time. In order for the Stochastic RSIs to reset, the price will need to go sideways and down for a period of time. The bulls will hope to hold the price at the major $2,500 horizontal support level, with perhaps the ascending trendline also offering some support.\nA $SOL rejection from resistance inevitable?\nSource: TradingView\nThe 4-hour chart for $SOL shows a similar rejection as for the $ETH price. This is a strong resistance level, and with $SOL being overbought on most time frames, a rejection seems inevitable.\nWeekly chart shows there could still be upside for $SOL\nSource: TradingView\nHowever, on the weekly time frame, it would appear that there is still hope for further upside for $SOL. The Stochastic RSI indicators have crossed back up, the MACD is also showing a positive cross, and green histogram bars are starting to build higher. On the RSI, the indicator line is above the yellow moving average line, and is angled slightly upward.\nCan $SOL still keep moving higher with $BTC perhaps losing momentum? This remains to be seen.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It was just a matter of time. Since then, the $BTC price has been consolidating into what looks like a continuation pattern. Is a more explosive move about to take place?\n$BTC makes new high\nIt wasn’t until 18:00 GMT on Wednesday, but once the powerful move began there was no stopping it. Around 2.68%, and nearly $3,000 later, the bulls managed to push the price just above the last all-time high. A new high has been made, so what next for the king of the cryptocurrencies?\nPennant forms on hourly time frame\nSource: TradingView\nAfter breaking out of the small descending trendline, the $BTC price arrowed upward and the bulls were just able to set a new all-time high. As can be seen by zooming into the very short time frame of the 1-hour chart, the price has been consolidating just below the high and looks to have formed a pennant. The price has recently broken out of this to the upside, and it just remains to be seen if the breakout will be confirmed. If it is, the measured move for the pennant is to around $114,000.\n$BTC heading higher after testing breakout?\nSource: TradingView\nA short time later, moving out slightly into the 4-hour chart, but still very much in the short-term time frame, it can be seen that the price retraced below the 0.236, which is the shallowest of the Fibonacci levels, but since then the price has been bouncing from this level.\nThe retest after the breakout has taken place, and it seems that the bulls are trying to drag the price higher. The main issue will be that short to medium time frame indicators are now showing as overbought, but that said, the price could probably still keep rising for a while given the momentum behind this surge.\nCan $BTC climb above $130,000 next?\nSource: TradingView\nOn the weekly time frame, the breakout is looking strong. The measured move for the bull flag would put the price well above $130,000.\nAt the very bottom of the chart, the MACD is showing good separation of the two indicator lines and both are continuing to be angled upward. At the same time, the green histogram bars are gradually getting bigger.\nMoving up to the Stochastic RSI, the indicator lines are heading back to the top once more. If price keeps climbing, these indicator lines can continue to bounce along the top of the 80.00 level, signalling constant upside price momentum.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It's not magic—it's math.\nChainAware.ai's groundbreaking innovation, Portfolio Creation MCP, democratizes these mathematical advantages, empowering every Web3 investor with professionally optimized crypto portfolios.\nThe Math Behind Successful Web3 Investing\nTraditionally, crafting a truly optimized crypto portfolio required access to sophisticated financial analytics, often available only to Ultra-High-Net-Worth individuals or institutional investors.

Superior risk-adjusted returns, significantly outperforming portfolios built using traditional rebalancing methods.\nWhy Traditional Auto-Rebalancing Isn't Enough\nMost portfolio management tools rely on frequent adjustments or \"auto-rebalancing\" to correct initial suboptimal allocations. Imagine starting a journey in the wrong direction and constantly needing to recalibrate your route. It's inefficient, costly, and ultimately less effective.\nPortfolio Creation MCP takes a fundamentally different approach. By starting with a mathematically optimal allocation from the beginning, it minimizes costly transactions and maximizes long-term performance.

By combining linguistic intelligence with precise mathematical computations, the potential applications in AI-driven finance become virtually limitless.\nStrengthening DeFAI Protocols\nDecentralized Finance Artificial Intelligence (DeFAI) protocols also benefit enormously. ChainAware.ai’s MCP provides robust foundational portfolios, streamlining investment processes, enhancing efficiency, and boosting overall protocol performance.\nThe ability to quickly integrate mathematically optimized portfolios positions protocols to attract and retain sophisticated users more effectively.\nTransforming Risk Management in Crypto Investing\nIn the volatile world of cryptocurrency, risk management is crucial. Portfolio Creation MCP offers a mathematically precise solution, significantly lowering investment risks through algorithmic multi-chain diversification. By analyzing liquidity, volatility, and inter-asset correlations, it generates portfolios explicitly tailored to withstand market turbulence.\nInvestors no longer have to worry about their crypto assets in the middle of the night. With MCP, strategic diversification isn't guesswork; it's precise, reliable, and consistently effective.\nFinal Thoughts: Experience Portfolio Optimization Firsthand\nChainAware.ai's Portfolio Creation MCP isn't merely another portfolio management tool; it's a transformative solution reshaping Web3 investment strategies.

At a $140.54 billion market capitalization, the question on every investor's mind is straightforward: can $10,000 in XRP still become $1,000,000 down the line?\nThis is amidst news of a new altcoin called Remittix (RTX) gradually taking the centre stage in the cryptocurrency market.\nXRP Price Prediction: Million-Dollar Dream or Pipe Dream?\nTo reach that million-dollar target, XRP would have to provide a 100x return. At its present value of $2.37, that would place XRP at $237 per token. As crazy as that may seem, several analysts believe the XRP price prediction isn't speculation — it's a function of Ripple's growing role in global finance.\nRipple's partnerships with banks and cross-border payment network partnerships continue to expand, pushing long-term projections higher.\nWhat Needs to Occur for XRP to 100x?\nFor XRP to reach $237, the total market cap would need to be more than $9 trillion, which would put it above gold in value.\nSome experts think that this could be possible if blockchain fully facilitates global remittance and interbank settlement. That would likely require regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and a massive overhaul of traditional finance, however.\nThat's why XRP price prediction is so reliant on macro trends and Ripple legal clarity — both of which are slowly but surely improving.\nWhy Investors Are Diversifying Into Presales Like Remittix\nWhile XRP is a good long-term hold, newer investors are also considering fast-growth alternatives like Remittix, a new PayFi platform built for real-world payments.\nRemittix allows sending crypto directly to bank accounts, including XRP, using its seamless fiat bridge. As more adoption comes, some believe it has what it takes to be a top 10 altcoin in the next bull run.\nRemittix has already raised over $16 million, sold over 550 million tokens, and is offering a 50% bonus on its way to its $18M softcap. The Remittix wallet also debuts in Q3 to allow users to conduct token and fiat transactions in one place.\nCurrently priced at $0.0811 in presale, some investors are comparing it to early XRP — with faster real-world use and instant functionality.\nIs Remittix the Hidden Gem Crypto Presale Everyone Will Regret Missing?\nThe truth is, XRP still has long-term promise, but a 100x return might be wishful thinking unless there are seismic shifts on the horizon for global finance.\nThat's why the majority of traders are combining safer bets like XRP with early positions in strong projects like Remittix. Real-world use and getting in early are what the market of today is all about.\nWhether or not XRP reaches $1,000,000 on a $10K investment, smart diversification may be your best play in the evolving crypto market, especially with emerging stars like Remittix, which is being called the best crypto presale on the horizon.\nDiscover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their presale here:\nWebsite: https://remittix.io/\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/remittix\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

While SHIB struggles to regain investor trust, many are already rotating into assets with stronger fundamentals.\nCardano is showing signs of recovery, and Remittix (RTX) is winning praise for its real-world utility. As meme hype fades, smarter bets are leading the charge this cycle.\nMeme Coin Fatigue Grows as Shiba Inu Stalls in 2025\nShiba Inu’s momentum has fizzled in 2025, and the numbers don’t lie. More than 66% of SHIB holders are sitting on losses, a stark shift from the bullish highs of last year. Each time SHIB tries to rally, profit-taking kicks in fast, draining any real upside.\nThe token remains stuck below key resistance levels, and its lack of evolving use cases isn’t helping its case. SHIB is down 46% year-to-date, and hopes for a bounce to $0.0003 look increasingly out of touch with current market sentiment.\nAs the Shiba Inu price prediction loses steam, even long-time supporters are looking for alternatives with better fundamentals. That’s why many are shifting into ADA for its DeFi network strength and RTX for its payment-focused real-world use.\nCardano Builds Momentum as Buyers Target $1\nCardano is quietly staging a technical comeback, and traders are taking notice. ADA has climbed back above the $0.60 mark, bouncing off support levels with increasing volume and forming higher lows. Chart watchers point to strong Fibonacci confluence and key EMAs acting as springboards, especially near $0.605.\nIf ADA clears $0.623 with conviction, upside targets could stretch toward $0.70 and beyond. While SHIB holders face stalled momentum, many are rotating into ADA, drawn by its improving setup and long-term strength. It’s not hype driving this move—it’s structure.\nThe $1 mark may still be distant, but ADA’s price action suggests it’s preparing for a serious attempt. When meme coins fizzle, smart traders follow the candles, and ADA is lighting the way.\nRemittix Is Gaining Momentum as the Most Promising Crypto Presale of 2025\nWhile Shiba Inu holders watch charts with growing frustration, a different kind of project is quietly pulling ahead—Remittix. Built for real-world payments, not internet memes, Remittix just launched a wallet that supports over 40 top cryptocurrencies and enables instant fiat transfers across borders. No delays, no hidden fees.\nWhether you're sending money to loved ones or settling global invoices, Remittix delivers. Its PayFi network bridges crypto to bank accounts using smart contracts, not hype. Backed by rising adoption, whale interest, and a Q3 rollout, investors are betting on RTX—not just for the next pump, but for actual utility.\nAs Shiba Inu price prediction stalls without a clear narrative, many are rotating into tokens that actually solve problems. Remittix is leading that shift as the best crypto presale.\nDiscover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their presale here:\nWebsite: https://remittix.io/\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/remittix\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Experts Tip Both to Have Record-Breaking Runs", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/do-shiba-inu-and-pepe-still-have-huge-upside-potential-experts-tip-both-to-have-record-breaking-runs", "text": "Memecoin fever just won’t quit, and analysts argue that Shiba Inu (SHIB) and PEPE may not be done printing eye-popping rallies. With gas fees on Ethereum surging again and Robinhood reporting a 27 % jump in meme-token volumes last month, traders say the stage is set for another melt-up, if risk appetite stays alive.\nShiba Inu: Layer-2 Catalyst and Supply Burn\nThe live SHIB price is hovering near $0.000012 while daily volume holds around $136 million. Two drivers underpin bullish calls. First, Shibarium’s on-chain stats reveal that the Layer-2 now processes more than 820,000 transactions a day—double April’s pace. Second, the community burn address has retired over 6.4 billion SHIB in the past five weeks, pushing the burn rate back into triple-digit territory. According to DeFi researcher Luc L on X, “Every time Shibarium fees spike, we get an outsized burn event; that reflex loop wasn’t present in 2021.” If Shibarium usage climbs with the broader Ethereum revival, some technicians target the May 2024 high at $0.000017 as the next stop.\nPEPE: Whale Stacking and High-Beta Liquidity\nPEPE trades at $0.000010 with a massive $605 million in 24-hour turnover. Whale-tracking platform Lookonchain flagged three fresh wallets scooping 9 trillion PEPE (~$90 million) in late June, the largest single-day buy since launch. On top of that, Bybit funding flipped positive for the first time since March, signaling leveraged longs are back. Historical market-cap data shows that when PEPE’s share of total meme-liquidity climbs above 30 %, smaller meme tokens tend to lag, giving PEPE outsized catch-up potential if the cohort rotates upward. Chart analysts eye a move toward the February peak at $0.000014 if Bitcoin and Ethereum keep pushing higher.\nSource: Tradingview\nWhy Both Could Break Records Together\nThe backdrop is turning risk-on again: traders now put the odds of a September U.S. rate cut above 65 %, and talk of a spot ETH ETF is back on the front burner. Ironically, pricier gas fees make Shibarium look good by comparison, sidestepping the congestion on Ethereum’s main chain. PEPE, meanwhile, thrives on the fresh meme liquidity that usually pours in during ETH rallies. Should Ethereum take another swing at $5,000, both tokens could ride the same reflexive volume burst that powered their big moves in 2023 and early 2024.\nA Quiet Payments Play Gaining Traction\nAway from meme headlines, Remittix (RTX) is drawing consistent whale attention for solving an everyday pain point: expensive cross-border payments. By routing tokens through multiple chains and settling in local cash within minutes, Remittix cuts traditional wire fees by up to 90 %. Recent test corridors in Lagos and Manila clock average settlement times under five minutes, and on-chain data shows more than 65 % of circulating RTX locked in long-term wallets. With a deflationary burn on every transaction and no reliance on centralized banking partners, analysts say RTX offers a utility-driven hedge alongside high-beta meme exposure.\nDiscover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their presale here:\nWebsite: https://remittix.io/\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/remittix\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Best Crypto to Buy As Ethereum Accumulation Rises - Altcoin Season Next?", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/best-crypto-to-buy-as-ethereum-accumulation-rises-altcoin-season-next", "text": "Ethereum has been unusually quiet, and that silence is starting to look deliberate. For several weeks now, ETH has hovered around the $2500 mark with little deviation, absorbing volatility while volumes steadily rise.\nThat kind of stability, especially in a token known for wide swings, signals preparation rather than hesitation. Institutional activity has picked up considerably. Spot transactions are growing heavier, and on-chain metrics point to a steady surge in interest, not just from retail but from long-term allocators as well. The market seems to be watching ETH with a kind of controlled anticipation, and that attention has a direction.\nEthereum’s Shift from Store to Engine and What That Means for the Rest of the Market\nIn the last few weeks, two publicly listed companies have made massive moves into ETH. Bit Digital, a Nasdaq-traded firm, sold off its Bitcoin reserves and converted over $200 million into ETH, stating openly that Ethereum’s yield structure and long-term financial utility aligned better with its strategy.\nThey swapped all of their BTC for ETH 😮\n— FOMO HOUR (@fomohour) July 8, 2025\nThis makes @BitDigital_BTBT the 3rd largest ETH holder as a publicly traded company ($250M+ worth). pic.twitter.com/fBmjqYS21u\nAround the same time, SharpLink Gaming added over 200,000 ETH to its treasury and staked the entire amount. Both firms raised additional capital from public markets specifically to increase their Ethereum holdings. These are not minor portfolio shifts. They reflect a structural bet on ETH as a productive, programmable asset rather than a speculative one.\n⚡️BIG: SharpLink Gaming has purchased 7,689 $ETH worth $19.2 million, increasing its total Ethereum holdings to 205,634 $ETH.\n— Crypto Coin Show (@CryptoCoinShow) July 9, 2025\nThis makes @SharpLinkGaming (NASDAQ: $SBET) the largest publicly traded $ETH holder and shows its aggressive buying strategy as institutional demand… pic.twitter.com/Wf794A2OSU\nWhat makes this more significant is the timing. Ethereum has remained steady around the $2500 level while trading volume continues to rise. Liquidity has also returned in the form of ERC-20 stablecoins, which just hit a record $121 billion in supply. These are conditions that typically set the floor for a wider altcoin breakout.\nEthereum’s consolidation, coupled with rising participation and large-scale repositioning by major players, is laying the groundwork. And when ETH becomes the magnet, altcoins do not need to ask for attention, they just need to be close enough to catch the spillover. That season is not here yet, but the air has changed. The capital is waiting, and the rotation could begin the moment ETH makes its next real move.\nBest Crypto to Buy Now - Tokens That Could Pump As the Altcoin Season Approaches\nSnorter\nSnorter is built for how crypto is actually used, not how it is marketed. Its core utility lies in its deep integration with Telegram, which remains the most active layer of crypto communication today. Rather than forcing users to adopt a new interface or switch platforms,\nSnorter embeds an entire analytical and executional framework within a space traders and community members already trust. It handles everything from wallet scanning to sentiment tracking to trade execution, all through conversational prompts inside Telegram chats.\nThis kind of embedded design does not just reduce friction. It changes the speed of action. Users no longer need to move between tools, copy-paste data, or rely on third-party dashboards. Everything flows in real time, inside the conversation. The bot is fast, adaptable, and transparent in its logic, which matters more as noise returns to the market.\nSNORT was also dubbed to be one of the highest potential presales to consider investing in by top creators and YouTubers like ClayBro and many others, further adding to its popularity.\nIf Ethereum’s current steadiness does lead to a renewed rotation into altcoins, the attention will not be quiet. Snorter is made for that kind of environment. It does not rely on a token pump or abstract hype. Its appeal lies in clarity and control, which become more valuable when volatility returns. As users re-engage, they are likely to choose tools that keep them rooted in the places they already operate from. Snorter sits exactly in that pocket.\nBitcoin Hyper\nBitcoin Hyper exists to serve a different demand; one grounded in Bitcoin’s base layer but unhindered by its limitations. Built as a Layer 2 network specifically for Bitcoin, Hyper enables smart contracts, low-fee transactions, and application-level programmability without moving away from Bitcoin’s core security and settlement structure. This makes it a functional extension rather than a departure.\nThe logic behind it is straightforward. Bitcoin is often framed as digital gold, but gold cannot process a microtransaction, power a decentralized app, or offer smart execution conditions. Hyper introduces that missing logic while keeping BTC at the center. It is not trying to compete on ecosystem size. It is building a parallel utility set that speaks to Bitcoin’s own user base.\nThe timing is relevant. As Ethereum continues to attract institutional holders and redefine itself as a foundational financial asset, capital is likely to look for complementary systems rather than pure alternatives. Bitcoin Hyper fits into that landscape precisely because it does not ask users to abandon BTC.\nIt simply gives them a way to do more with it. If liquidity begins to flow more widely, protocols that offer this kind of practical expansion will likely stand out, not because they promise more, but because they unlock what was previously restricted.\nSUBBD\nSUBBD is structured around creators, not tokens. It does not depend on speculative traction or narrative cycles. Instead, it offers a model where content ownership, discovery, and monetization are built into the system itself. Unlike traditional platforms that control reach and revenue through opaque algorithms, SUBBD allows creators to embed access rules, membership layers, and monetization logic directly into their work using smart contracts.\nThis approach turns each creator into their own ecosystem. Whether it is video, writing, audio, or niche community content, the rules are written by the creator and enforced by the platform’s underlying protocol.\nThis creates consistency in experience and revenue without forcing users or creators into subscription silos or ad-based engagement loops. SUBBD is not trying to rebuild social media. It is building a content economy from the creator upward.\nMeet your new favorite group chat 😏📲\n— SUBBD (@SUBBDofficial) June 26, 2025\nJoin SUBBDExclusives on Telegram, where the hottest creators and the most loyal fans connect in real time.\n🔥 Chat. React. Repeat.\nBecause the feed’s hot, but the group chat is on fire.\n📲 Search SUBBDExclusives on Telegram now. pic.twitter.com/WdzsXqB9K9\nAs Ethereum strengthens its role in programmable finance, and as liquidity trickles outward, platforms like SUBBD become more relevant. They provide application-level proof of what on-chain logic can do outside of finance.\nIf an altcoin cycle begins to take shape, the market will likely reward projects that demonstrate actual embedded utility and content remains one of the most defensible and scalable categories for that kind of use. SUBBD operates there with precision.\nBest Wallet\nBest Wallet is not built for speculation. It is designed for everyday crypto use, and that distinction changes how it functions. At its core, it is a multi-chain Web3 wallet that handles asset storage, transaction execution, token discovery, and dApp access in one continuous interface.\nThe layout is clean, but more importantly, the experience is intentional. Navigation feels immediate. Tasks that are typically segmented- like bridging assets, interacting with staking pools, or participating in presales are streamlined into processes that feel native.\nThe strength of Best Wallet lies in its architecture. It does not treat networks like compartments. It allows users to move across Ethereum, Solana, and other major ecosystems without technical barriers. For those entering the market now, that kind of flexibility is essential. The focus has shifted from holding assets to interacting with them, and wallets need to reflect that shift.\nAs Ethereum consolidates and altcoin attention begins to re-emerge, users will need tools that make participation seamless. That includes managing multiple assets, navigating early-stage launches, and verifying smart contract permissions without relying on clunky workarounds. Best Wallet meets that need with actual infrastructure, not marketing features.\nIf a new cycle builds from the base Ethereum is laying down, the tools that manage and extend that access will play a central role. Best Wallet positions itself there; not as a gateway, but as a full system for interaction. That positioning may prove valuable as user activity returns.\nConclusion\nAs Ethereum continues to consolidate and institutional alignment grows stronger, the market is beginning to shift its posture. What was once a scattered field of speculation is becoming a more focused search for function. If this trend continues and an altcoin season does unfold, it will not reward noise; it will reward readiness.\nThe assets discussed above each reflect a different layer of that logic. Some enhance user access, some extend existing networks, and others introduce entirely new models of interaction. What unites them is timing. They are not waiting for a trend. They are built for the conditions that may arrive once the next phase begins. That alone makes them worth watching now.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Listings on BitMart, LBank, and xT have now gone live, setting the stage for its real test. With an aggressive $30 target listing price promising 14,700% upside, market watchers are tracking volume and price movement closely.\nMeanwhile, BlockDAG is building differently. Its live infrastructure, testnet traction, and real-time development tools give it a functional lead. The project has already surpassed $334 million in presale funding and maintains momentum with a community-first strategy and tech that speaks to both devs and users.\nWhile Kaanch banks on post-listing momentum, BlockDAG is laying groundwork that’s already visible.\nKaanch Network Post-Presale: Listing Reaction in Focus\nWith the Kaanch Network presale now closed and live listings confirmed across major CEXs, the market is watching to see if the hype converts to staying power. Final presale pricing locked at $0.64, with over $3.1 million raised.\nWhile Kaanch’s Layer 1 platform boasts 1.4 million TPS, 0.8s finality, and zero gas fees, with a validator count exceeding 3,600. Its ambitious $30 listing goal, which represents a 14,700% leap, has traders treading cautiously.\nThe roadmap promises asset tokenization, identity integration through .knch domains, and institutional partnerships. But that value still needs to materialize in user activity, not just pitch decks.\nEarly price action will reveal whether Kaanch can sustain momentum or if it faces post-launch fade. Currently live staking rewards of 30% APY offer a hold incentive, but confidence will hinge on network adoption. With its listing now live, Kaanch’s future isn’t just down to potential, it’s performance.\nBlockDAG’s Ecosystem Momentum Builds Beyond the Hype\nBlockDAG isn’t waiting for launch day to prove itself. The network has already raised $334 million in presale funding at a current price of $0.0016, with 2660% ROI since batch 1. Behind the numbers is a live testnet running over a million transactions and 100 active nodes, proving the tech is more than slideware.\nBlockDAG’s low-code smart contract suite is up and running, giving teams the tools to drag, drop, and deploy without getting lost in backend bloat. Pre-built APIs and real-time scaffolding cut down dev time from weeks to hours. It’s optimized for builders, not just believers.\nSecurity isn’t just layered at BlockDAG, it’s proactive. With internal bounties, predictive threat analytics, and support for Solidity, Rust, Python, and Vyper, BlockDAG is ready to scale in every direction.\nWhat’s often overlooked is the community that’s backing it. BlockDAG isn’t building alone. Its growing base of developers and token holders actively engage across platforms, contributing to feature proposals, stress-testing systems, and building dApps in parallel with the core team. This isn’t passive investment, it’s network participation.\nAnd that matters, because infrastructure alone doesn’t create movement, people do. With a roadmap that includes full mainnet deployment, additional CEX listings post batch 45, and deeper dApp toolkits, BlockDAG is proving it’s not just ready for growth. It’s already building it.\nKaanch vs BlockDAG: Final Days or Long Game?\nKaanch and BlockDAG are both making moves, but they’re playing different games. Kaanch has closed its presale with explosive short-term expectations. BlockDAG, meanwhile, is stacking layers for a long-term takeover.\nPresale Metrics\n-\nKaanch Network presale closed with $3.1M raised at $0.64\n-\nBlockDAG surpasses $334M raised with 2660% ROI since batch 1\nTech Strength\n-\nKaanch boasts 1.4M TPS, 0.8s finality, and near-zero gas\n-\nBlockDAG runs live infrastructure, mobile mining, and multi-language smart contracts\nUser Strategy\n-\nKaanch targets rapid gains from early listing\n-\nBlockDAG drives user engagement through its live ecosystem and developer integration\nOne is closing a chapter, the other is opening a new one. Which lane you're in depends on your risk window.\nConclusion\nKaanch Network’s listing day has come, and so has the moment of truth. The $0.64 presale price and $30 target set a high bar for the project. If token activity, adoption, and delivery don’t keep pace, early hype could cool off fast.\nOn the flipside, BlockDAG offers a contrast that’s hard to ignore. With a live ecosystem, testnet activity, and a community that’s helping shape the product roadmap, it’s not selling a dream, it’s scaling a network.\nWhether you’re chasing rapid gains or staking your bet on ecosystem resilience, the Kaanch vs BlockDAG split shows what different kinds of “potential” really look like in crypto.\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

This exclusion barred them from tapping into the country’s robust startup support ecosystem.\nThe classification had tangible financial consequences for major players in the market. Dunamu, the parent company of leading exchange Upbit, saw its venture status revoked in 2018, resulting in an $18 million increase in corporate taxes. The firm contested the penalty in court but failed to overturn the decision. The Ministry now concedes the need to modernize its framework in line with South Korea’s evolving digital economy.\nA Strategic Bid to Strengthen the Digital Economy\nThe reclassification effort is part of a broader government initiative to solidify South Korea’s leadership in digital innovation. The country already boasts one of the world’s most advanced digital infrastructures, with nationwide 5G coverage and highly integrated financial services, providing fertile ground for emerging fintech and blockchain ventures.\nThe policy shift also reflects the crypto-friendly stance of newly elected President Lee Jae Myung. Lee has pledged regulatory reforms designed to institutionalize the country’s crypto sector, including a push for won-based stablecoins and efforts to lift bans on crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). His administration has moved quickly, with ruling party lawmakers drafting fresh legislation to address regulatory gaps and expand digital asset oversight.\nIndustry Momentum and Legislative Backing\nSince Lee’s election last month, major financial institutions and payment services firms in South Korea have begun trademarking stablecoin ticker symbols in anticipation of regulatory clarity. Simultaneously, the Financial Services Commission, South Korea’s primary financial regulator, is reportedly working to ease existing restrictions on institutional crypto trading.\nBy granting crypto businesses access to government incentives, the administration aims to foster a more dynamic and competitive virtual asset market while attracting greater venture capital investment into the sector.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This marks a major milestone for Ethereum scalability and sustainability as Status Network introduces a radically different revenue model: eliminating transaction fees entirely while funding builders and liquidity providers through bridged yield and native app fees. Users can follow Status for updates: https://x.com/StatusL2\nAs transaction costs across L2s are currently trending towards zero, Status Network breaks from sequencer fee dependence and instead earns revenue from yield-bearing bridged assets and native application activity.\n“We designed Status Network so developers can ship games, seamless social experiences, and DeFi protocols without forcing users to preload gas or builders to manage paymaster contracts,” said Cyprien Grau, Lead at Status Network. “By rehypothecating yield-bearing TVL and sharing every cent of net yield with the community, we’re aligning incentives for all L2 stakeholders: builders get funding, LPs get sustainable returns, and users get a true free-to-play blockchain.”\nStatus Network carries forward the founding principles of the original Status app: privacy, sovereignty, and open access. It’s designed as a seamless, high-performance platform where communities can exchange, build, and govern freely. Users can learn more about Status Network: https://status.network/\nA Business Model Built for the Next Decade\nYield, not gas: Bridged ETH and stablecoins are converted into yield-bearing equivalents (e.g., stETH, sDAI). The protocol captures that yield along with fees from native apps rather than relying on sequencer revenues.\nSustainable flywheel: Gasless UX and organic yield attract more users, deposits, and app usage, generating a higher native L2 yield, attracting yet more users. And, pending governance approval, part of that native yield can be used to fuel SNT buy-backs and burns, further aligning the Status community with the success of the network.\nThe ongoing development of Status L2 follows the vision laid out in the original Status whitepaper and was initiated through a community vote by SNT holders, alongside the SNT staking initiative.\nEthereum Alignment\nThrough its built-in public funding pool, Status Network will fund open-source protocols and public goods building on Ethereum. As Linea’s first external collaborator, Status is co-developing the bridged yield feature, which will soon be available to all Linea-based L2s, further contributing to the zkEVM stack’s long-term sustainability. Status will also play a crucial role in both the Linea and broader Ethereum ecosystems; further details will be disclosed soon.\n“We’re proud to see Status Network launch the first gasless Layer 2 powered by the Linea zkEVM technology stack,” said Declan Fox, Head of Linea. “We aim to build better economics and governance, in alignment with Ethereum’s core values. Status supports builders and public goods while providing free transactions at scale - exactly the kind of mission-driven approach we aim to empower. With the Linea stack’s high throughput, low latency, and fast finality, we’re enabling the performance needed for apps to grow, thrive, and get funded, whilst anchoring into the same root of trust: Ethereum.”\nBuilt for Games, Social & DeFi - With Better Privacy\nWith fees replaced by native yield, users can interact with apps without needing to bridge tokens or top up gas, creating a frictionless experience. Games can finally deliver true free-to-play mechanics and support non-financial onchain actions without maintaining gas-sponsoring infrastructure. Social apps benefit from streamlined user onboarding and Web2-like UX, and DeFi protocols tap into yield-boosted liquidity from day one. Early builders include mobile fishing RPG Cats Fishing, free onchain gacha PonziHero from Spla Labs, and metaverse casino Hash Vegas. Native DeFi apps will be announced in the coming weeks.\nAs anyone can get started without a wallet balance or history, gasless transactions strongly enhance account anonymity, enabling better privacy for transfers and applications.\nAvailability & Roadmap\nStatus Network’s public testnet v1 is now live with fully gasless transactions. Testnet v2, featuring RLN-based spam protection and native yield routing, launches in October 2025, alongside a pre-deposit campaign to kickstart the bridged yield. Mainnet launch is targeted for Q1 2026. Developers can start building today at https://statusnetwork.typeform.com/partner\nAbout Status Network\nStatus Network is the first Ethereum L2 with gas-free transactions at scale. Funded by native yield and app fees, it redistributes 100% of net revenues to its community, powering sustainable liquidity incentives, a public funding pool, and SNT buy-backs. Built on the Linea zkEVM stack, it enables frictionless onboarding for games, social apps, and DeFi while remaining fully aligned with Ethereum security and values.\nContact\nPublic RelationsLaura Guzik\nIFT - Status\n[email protected]\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

With the Bitcoin Solaris Nova App launch live, a listing on LBank confirmed, and its presale phase 9 hitting final-stage hype, the project is positioning itself for a July breakout.\nBut while Bitcoin Solaris leans on app excitement and last-minute presale heat, BlockDAG has already scaled the mobile mining mountain. Its X1 Miner has crossed 2 million active users, driven by a presale that has now raised $334 million at a current price of $0.0016, giving early buyers an ROI of 2,660%, and the momentum hasn’t slowed.\nBitcoin Solaris Heats Up with Nova App & Final Presale Phase\nThe Bitcoin Solaris Nova App launch has grabbed attention with its mobile-first push and tap-to-mine functionality. It’s a slick move aimed at crypto newcomers who want an easier on-ramp. Tied in with Bitcoin Solaris listed on LBank and nearing the end of presale phase 9, it’s crafted a well-timed story of accessibility meets opportunity.\nTo drive urgency, the project added a 72-hour price rollback to $5, designed to mimic early presale returns. Throw in bold claims of 150% potential ROI and 100,000+ transactions processed, and it’s clear this isn’t just another quiet app rollout. They’re aiming to close the presale strong.\nBut traction isn’t the same as adoption. Launching a mobile app in crypto is step one. Keeping users engaged and building utility is what separates trend from traction. The final push of presale phase 9 will show whether users are here for the hype, or for the long haul.\nOver 2 Million Users Are Already Mining With BlockDAG\nWhile Bitcoin Solaris leans on app launch hype, BlockDAG’s X1 mobile miner is already setting the standard, and it’s not even close. With over 2 million users already mining from their phones, the X1 app is leading the mobile-first charge in crypto. It’s simple to use, doesn’t drain battery or data, and actually ties user activity to BDAG token rewards. It’s not vaporware, this is a functioning product rolled out ahead of mainnet.\nWhat sets the X1 apart is that it’s not just onboarding users, it’s activating them. From the moment someone starts mining, they’re participating in the larger BlockDAG ecosystem. It builds habit, loyalty, and it’s backed by a $334M presale, full CertiK and Halborn audits, and a roadmap that goes way beyond just mobile. We’re talking about a live DeFi suite, low-code dApp builder, NFT integrations, and 10K+ TPS performance on testnet.\nBlockDAG also isn’t shy about marketing firepower. The brand has partnered with Major League Cricket’s Seattle Orcas, and Major League Rugby’s Seattle Seawolves which gives it a real-world presence that boosts credibility and reach. When a project is scaling in product, user base, capital, and culture all at once, traders don’t just pay attention, they get in.\nWhile Bitcoin Solaris is announcing launches, BlockDAG is stacking wins. And users are showing up.\nHype vs Head Start\nThe Bitcoin Solaris Nova App launch signals serious intent. Paired with its final presale phase 9 and a timely Bitcoin Solaris listing, the project is trying to engineer a breakout moment. They’ve built a strong narrative, from the rollback promo to mobile-first positioning, and it’s catching attention.\nBut here’s where things separate. BlockDAG already has the receipts. Its X1 mobile miner app isn’t a promise, it’s in people’s hands, running daily, earning BDAG, and creating real utility. It’s not about who launched first, it’s about who’s delivering now.\nBitcoin Solaris listed on LBank is a good start. But listings don’t equal loyalty. The Nova App is sleek, but it’s untested at scale. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is onboarding millions, integrating DeFi, and driving ecosystem usage, all before its mainnet is even live. That’s not future potential, that’s execution in real time\nThe Bottom Line\nBitcoin Solaris is playing it smart. The Nova App launch, final presale phase 9, and fresh Bitcoin Solaris listing all land at the right time. It’s got attention, momentum, and a slick mobile angle that resonates with a crowd ready to mine from their phones.\nBut while Solaris is preparing to launch, BlockDAG is already running laps around it. The X1 mobile miner has over 2 million users live and earning, and it’s just one part of a broader $334M-fueled ecosystem. DeFi tools, smart partnerships, and a verified presale give it more than hype, it has muscle.\nSo while Bitcoin Solaris is still warming up, BlockDAG is already out front setting the pace. And when it comes to real traction in mobile mining, the market’s already made its move.\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE Raise $8M Series A to Launch Integrated Bitcoin Capital Markets Ecosystem", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/nexbridge-and-nexplace-raise-8m-series-a-to-launch-integrated-bitcoin-capital-markets-ecosystem", "text": "San Salvador, El Salvador, July 9th, 2025, Chainwire\nThe raise will accelerate the development of a dual infrastructure: NEXBRIDGE, a regulated issuer of asset-backed digital assets, and NEXPLACE, a next-generation trading platform.\nNEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE today announced the closing of a $8 million Series A funding round led by Fulgur Ventures. The capital will fast-track the expansion of a Bitcoin-native financial infrastructure that merges regulated issuance with seamless trading for retail and institutional clients worldwide.\nEarly access to NEXPLACE is now available — users can join the waitlist here.\nNEXBRIDGE will use the proceeds to launch new digital assets and pursue additional listings across licensed exchanges. NEXPLACE will accelerate development and go-to-market execution ahead of its H2 2025 launch, while advancing further licensing efforts in key jurisdictions.\nNEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE currently operate as separate entities, but share the same shareholder group and strategic roadmap— with plans to consolidate under a single holding once the necessary corporate and jurisdictional steps are completed.\n“Our vision for BitcoinFi is simple: bring the safeguards of traditional capital markets onto Bitcoin rails and make digital assets accessible with 24/7 efficiency— through compliant, global infrastructure,” said Michele Crivelli, Founder & CEO of both companies. Today we focus on secure access to familiar exposures like bonds or equities—made available through NEXPLACE and other licensed venues, with our own platform built to evolve and unlock advanced features over time. Tomorrow, we’ll enable businesses to raise capital on-chain through native, regulated digital instruments designed to move funds directly to the issuer, without traditional intermediaries.”\nA new on-chain market architecture\nNEXBRIDGE issues regulated digital assets backed by real underlying value, offering both familiar exposures and new formats for accessing them. In November 2024, NEXBRIDGE launched USTBL—the first public, regulated digital asset backed by U.S. Treasury Bills and issued on Bitcoin infrastructure via the Liquid Network. Initially listed on Bitfinex Securities, USTBL is now preparing to expand across additional licensed exchanges.\nFollowing this, El Salvador’s digital‑asset regulator (CNAD) approved a broader range of products—spanning from single-stock exposures to multi-asset strategies—set to launch on NEXPLACE and other licensed venues, including through NEXBRIDGE’s own OTC desk.\nNEXPLACE, licensed as a Digital Asset Service Provider, offers a unified venue for trading a wide range of digital assets—from native cryptocurrencies and utility tokens to asset-linked instruments. Advanced features—such as using eligible tokenized assets as collateral for derivatives—will be gradually rolled out following launch.\nUnlike models where tokenized assets are mere digital wrappers of off-chain products, NEXBRIDGE issues digital assets that are regulated at the token level. Each issuance is formally approved by CNAD, receives a unique instrument identifier, and includes public disclosures such as proof-of-reserve attestations and a dedicated termsheet detailing key information. In this model, transparency and regulatory oversight apply directly to the digital asset users hold and trade—not just to the structure behind it.\nWhile initial distribution will occur primarily via NEXPLACE, the infrastructure is designed for openness. NEXBRIDGE’s regulatory architecture allows its assets to be listed on other licensed trading venues—ensuring portability.\nThis dual model bridges two worlds: providing secure, regulated access to digital markets for global users—especially those in fast-growing emerging economies—while giving institutions a simplified interface to manage both crypto and asset-linked positions with full transparency.\n“This raise helps us unlock a new generation of asset-linked digital products—especially for users in markets where access to dollar-based exposure has been limited,” Crivelli added. “Each token we issue is directly regulated, with its own public termsheet, governance, and oversight—rather than being a passive mirror of an off-chain asset. That’s a structural shift - and a foundation we can build on.”\nStrategic alignment and investor support\nFulgur Ventures, the lead investor, supports Bitcoin‑native infrastructure with real‑world applications.\n“Bitcoin continues to establish itself as a unique, scarce digital asset—now increasingly relevant to institutional finance,” said Oleg Mikhalsky, Partner at Fulgur Ventures. “Traditional financial institutions are beginning to recognize Bitcoin not only as a store of value but also as a settlement layer for both monetary transactions and tokenized instruments. NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE demonstrate a meaningful, real-world use case enabled by the Liquid Network that reinforces Bitcoin’s role in capital markets—a development Fulgur is proud to support.”\nBlockstream — the Bitcoin infrastructure firm behind the Liquid Network layer-2 that powers asset issuance and settlement — emphasized the partnership’s strategic potential.\n“By powering NEXBRIDGE’s digital asset issuance and NEXPLACE’s trading platform with the Liquid Network, we’re helping shape a new generation of capital markets—anchored to Bitcoin’s security, built for global scale, said Adam Back, Co‑founder & CEO of Blockstream.\nEarly access to NEXPLACE is now available — users can join the waitlist here.\nAbout NEXBRIDGE\nNEXBRIDGE Digital Financial Solutions is a regulated issuer headquartered in El Salvador. It creates and offers asset-linked digital assets under the country’s Digital Asset Issuance Law, with settlement secured through the Bitcoin-based Liquid Network.\nAbout NEXPLACE\nNEXPLACE is a next-generation digital asset exchange set to launch publicly in the second half of 2025. It enables seamless trading across cryptocurrencies and regulated digital assets—within a unified venue designed to evolve with market needs.\nAbout Fulgur Ventures\nFulgur Ventures is a Bitcoin native investment firm focused on infrastructure and applications that unlock Bitcoin’s role in global financial systems.\nContacts\nPress Contact Marketing & Communication DepartmentNEXBRIDGE\n[email protected]\nPress Contact Marketing & Communication Department\nNEXPLACE\n[email protected]\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

What’s more, the price has also just broken through the resistance at $2.35, and looks to have flipped this level into support with a recent confirmation of the break.\nThe next target for the bulls is the last local high at $2.66.

Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Toncoin (TON), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable increases.\nUS Stocks Missed As Markets Navigate Trade Tensions\nUS stocks were mixed on Tuesday as renewed trade tensions and tariffs weighed down market sentiment. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 108 points due to investor concerns about new tariffs. However, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite registered marginal gains, rising 0.08% and 0.18% respectively. Banking and consumer-facing firms were hit hard, with JP Morgan dropping 3.5% and Amazon falling 1.26%. Walmart also fell nearly 2% due to its exposure to the Chinese market. Meanwhile, crypto markets were largely unchanged, with Bitcoin (BTC) registering a marginal increase over the past 24 hours.\nMarkets are keeping a watchful eye on shifting trade dynamics. President Trump extended the July 9 deadline for reinstating tariffs to April 1. However, tensions escalated as President Trump threatened South Korea and Japan with new tariffs, while China warned against any implementation of new tariffs.\nUS Sanctions North Korean IT Worker\nThe US Treasury sanctioned a North Korean and a Russian individual, along with four entities connected to what it called a North Korean-run IT worker ring that infiltrates crypto companies operating in the US. The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) introduced sanctions against North Korea-based Song Kum Hyok for stealing the personal data of US citizens. OFAC also sanctioned a Russian national, Gary Asatryan, for using his companies to employ North Korean IT workers. Treasury Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender stated,\n“Treasury remains committed to using all available tools to disrupt the Kim regime’s efforts to circumvent sanctions through its digital asset theft, attempted impersonation of Americans, and malicious cyberattacks.”\nAccording to the Treasury Department, North Korea uses the revenue generated through large-scale hacks to fund its nuclear and ballistic missile program, deploying thousands of skilled IT workers around the globe.\n“Today, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control is taking action to stop individuals and entities that are enabling the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) IT worker schemes. The DPRK generates significant revenue for its WMD and ballistic missile programs by deploying thousands of highly skilled IT workers around the world, who then hack and exploit internal systems.”\nJapanese Company Aligns CEO With Bitcoin Strategy\nTokyo-based energy company Remixpoint has announced that new CEO Takashi Tashiro will be paid in Bitcoin (BTC) as part of efforts to “be in the same boat” as the company’s shareholders. The company stated that it will calculate Tashiro’s salary and taxes, purchase the equivalent amount in BTC, and send it to the CEO’s chosen crypto wallet. According to the company, the move is part of a “shareholder-oriented management.” Remixpoint released a statement, stating,\n“The remuneration in this case will be paid in Japanese yen in format based on the appropriate organization of the Company Act and taxation. On top of that, we plan to acquire Bitcoin (BTC) equivalent to the same amount at the market price with Japanese yen, which is equivalent to the full amount of the payment, and deliver it to the crypto asset wallet designated by the President and CEO.”\nCoreWeave Stock Dips As Analysts Cast Doubt On Core Scientific Acquisition\nCoreWeave (CRWV) shares opened lower on Tuesday as analysts raised doubts on whether its acquisition of Core Scientific CORZ) would contribute to its bottom line. CRWV fell 3.6% as markets opened, falling to $153.87. Despite the substantial decline, CoreWeave holds a market capitalization of $288 billion. Selling pressure on CRWV stock increased after D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria raised concerns about CoreWeave’s $9 billion all-share deal to acquire Core Scientific, announced on Monday. Luria stated,\n“Core Scientific’s purchase doesn’t add any profits to CRWV. All they’re doing is ensuring CORZ doesn’t give its capacity to somebody else.”\nMizuho analysts downgraded CoreWeave shares from “outperform” to “neutral,” stating that CRWV’s risk-reward profile appears balanced, indicating the stock may take a breather after a near-300% rally. However, they acknowledged the potential benefits of the acquisition.\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\nBitcoin (BTC) is marginally down during the ongoing session, struggling to build momentum and push towards $110,000. The flagship cryptocurrency ended the weekend in positive territory, rising nearly 1% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,229. However, it lost momentum on Monday, dropping 0.87% to $108,283. BTC fell to an intraday low of $107,446 on Tuesday but recovered to register an increase of 0.60% and settle at $108,938 before declining during the ongoing session.\nDespite sluggish price action, crypto traders are getting increasingly bullish about BTC’s chances of reclaiming $110,000. However, blockchain analytics platform Santiment believes optimism isn’t always a good sign. Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan stated,\n“It’s pretty clear that the crowd is starting to salivate over a potential $110K+ Bitcoin market value.”\nSantiment data reveals that for every bearish BTC comment, there are 1.51 bullish comments, the highest ratio in the past three weeks. Santiment used data from several sources, including X, Reddit, Telegram, 4Chan, BitcoinTalk, and Farcaster. However, Quinlivan cautioned that similar spikes in optimism were followed by substantial price drops on June 11 and July 7.\n“As we know, prices move in the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations, as retail perpetually loses money from overly emotional decisions. We saw clear signs that retail was buying into the rising momentum of Bitcoin's price.”\nSantiment believes BTC will experience a pullback before breaking through its all-time high of $111,970, set on May 22. Santiment analysts also highlighted that Bitcoin whale wallets have shown little activity in recent sessions, indicating caution.\n“For now, these wallets have been somewhat suspiciously flat. When they accumulate, prices often follow closely. When they dump or even just temporarily stop accumulating, it often signals that market values across crypto may see some declines.”\nMeanwhile, CryptoQuant data suggests markets are confident about the long-term prospects of BTC, with on-chain data showing considerable dominance of outflows over inflows. The monthly outflow/inflow ratio has fallen to 0.9%, a level not seen since the end of the 2022 bear market.\nBTC ended the previous weekend in positive territory, rising nearly 1% to $108,350. However, it lost momentum on Monday, dropping 1.09% to $107,167. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as BTC fell 1.33% and settled at $105,742. Despite the selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,845. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price reached an intraday high of $110,583 before settling at $109,650, ultimately registering an increase of 0.74%. Price action was back in bearish territory on Friday, dropping 1.42% to $108,097.\nSource: TradingView\nBTC recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday and rising nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,229.

Buyers returned to the market on Tuesday as ETH rose nearly 3% to cross $2,600 and settle at $2,616. ETH’s price action has been relatively subdued since May, with the price pinned down below $2,700.The price fell to a low of $2,119 on June 22 before recovering and reclaiming $2,500. However, Tesseract CEO James Harris is bullish on ETH, predicting a 160% increase from current price levels. Harris stated,\n“We forecast ETH at $6,500 by end-2025, assuming continued growth in ETH staking participation, higher gas consumption from layer 2 applications, and no significant regulatory headwinds specific to Ethereum. Ethereum is one of our top conviction picks among large-caps.”\nHarris highlighted the over $1 billion in inflows to spot Ethereum ETFs and the Pectra hard fork as key drivers of the price increase.\n“The Pectra upgrade has improved layer 2 scaling solutions, fueling ecosystem growth. With healthy institutional inflows and status as the most staked and utilised digital asset, Ethereum is on track for a run in H2.”\nHowever, 10x Research’s Markus Thielen predicted a different perspective, stating,\n“At 10x Research, we hold a moderately bullish outlook for crypto this month, driven largely by strong post-July 4 seasonality that could lift Ethereum toward $2,800 in the short term. However, we believe the ongoing lack of user activity remains a structural overhang for ETH, and the case for treasury adoption is far weaker than it is for Bitcoin.”\nETH registered a sharp increase on Sunday, rising nearly 3% to end the previous weekend at $2,500. However, it lost momentum on Monday, dropping 0.55% and settling at $2,486. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as the price fell over 3% to $2,407.

Gox Bitcoin Wallet Through Blockchain Messages", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/phishing-scam-targets-87bn-mt-gox-bitcoin-wallet-through-blockchain-messages", "text": "Hackers attempt to deceive the owner of a dormant Mt. Gox-linked Bitcoin wallet by embedding phishing messages in blockchain transactions.\nPhishing Attempt on Dormant Mt. Gox Wallet\nHackers have launched a targeted phishing attack against a Bitcoin wallet linked to the notorious 2014 Mt. Gox exchange hack. The address, holding 79,956 BTC, currently valued at approximately $8.7 billion, was the recipient of deceptive blockchain transactions designed to trick the wallet's owner into revealing personal information.\nAccording to findings from BitMEX Research, the attackers exploited Bitcoin’s OP_RETURN function to deliver fraudulent messages embedded within a transaction sent to the wallet. The message directed the wallet owner to a malicious website posing as a legitimate financial institution.\nA New Twist on OP_RETURN Exploitation\nThe OP_RETURN opcode allows Bitcoin users to store small pieces of data directly on the blockchain, a feature often used for verifying information or recording timestamps. However, this same mechanism has become a tool for bad actors seeking to distribute phishing links in an immutable, decentralized environment.\nIn this incident, the scam message embedded in the transaction directed users to a fake website impersonating Salomon Brothers. This once-prominent Wall Street investment bank ceased operations years ago.\nThe phishing page falsely claimed,\n\"This digital wallet appears to be lost or abandoned. Our client has taken constructive possession of it and seeks to determine if there is a bona fide owner.\"\nSecurity researchers immediately flagged the site as a scam, warning that it was specifically designed to harvest sensitive data from anyone attempting to claim ownership of the wallet.\nDormant Wallets Remain Prime Targets\nThe wallet under attack is one of several long-dormant Bitcoin addresses associated with the collapse of Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. In total, around 850,000 BTC were stolen in the 2014 breach, an amount now worth over $92 billion. While authorities have since recovered roughly 140,000 BTC, the remaining coins have remained untouched for over a decade.\nThese dormant addresses continue to attract scammers, who capitalize on the hope that some rightful owners might attempt to access their lost holdings. BitMEX Research noted that similar phishing attempts targeting legacy wallets have surfaced in recent years.\nOngoing Security Risks in an Evolving Market\nThis latest incident underscores the persistent security challenges facing the cryptocurrency sector, particularly for wallets holding large, inactive balances. The creative misuse of blockchain functions, like OP_RETURN for phishing campaigns, reflects the evolving tactics of cybercriminals.\nAs the industry continues to mature, cybersecurity experts stress the importance of vigilance and public awareness. Dormant wallet holders, in particular, are advised to exercise extreme caution when approached by unsolicited messages or transaction data embedded with external links.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

How Trump’s Trade War Could Unleash a Bitcoin Sell-Off", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/crypto-market-doomed-how-trumps-trade-war-could-unleash-a-bitcoin-sell-off", "text": "Key Highlights:\n-\nTrump’s Tariff Blitz Shakes Markets: Fresh threats of up to 40% tariffs on multiple countries spooked global markets, sending Bitcoin tumbling below $108,000 amid rising trade war fears.\n-\nBitcoin’s Risk-Asset Status Exposed: As equities slid, Bitcoin mirrored the decline—signaling investors are treating it more like a speculative asset than a safe haven in times of geopolitical tension.\n-\nAll Eyes on August 1 Deadline: With Trump’s trade strategy in flux and a key tariff decision looming, crypto traders brace for volatility as Bitcoin hovers near critical support levels.\nGlobal financial markets were rocked Monday as President Donald Trump reignited fears of a global trade war, delivering a blow that spilled swiftly into the crypto world. Bitcoin, which had been building bullish momentum in recent weeks, plummeted below $108,000 in response to a cascade of tariff threats aimed at key U.S. trading partners.\nA Familiar Shock: Markets Recoil as Trump Resurrects Trade War Tactics\nTrump’s move, framed as an extension of his hardline “Liberation Day” agenda, came via letters issued to Japan and South Korea, warning of imminent 25% tariffs. The accusations were unfair trade practices and transshipping tactics used to dodge U.S. duties. While markets were still digesting this shock, the White House doubled down.\nBy the end of the day, new tariff plans were unveiled: up to 40% on Laos and Myanmar, 30% on South Africa, and 25% on Malaysia and Kazakhstan. Trump even floated the idea of an extra 10% levy on any country aligning with BRICS—a clear swipe at Brazil, Russia, India, and China.\nThis flurry of aggressive trade threats, coupled with legal questions surrounding Trump’s invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), sent investors scrambling. Risk appetite vanished, and Bitcoin—a supposed hedge against inflation and centralized disruption—was caught in the crossfire.\nBitcoin Takes a Hit: Correlation with Risk Assets Tightens\nJust days after flirting with an all-time high of $111,814, Bitcoin (BTC) lost traction. By Monday afternoon, it slipped 0.74% to $107,936.08, echoing the broader market slide.\nSource: TradingView\nAnalysts point to a concerning trend: Bitcoin, once heralded as digital gold, is behaving more like a tech stock—sensitive to macroeconomic stress and geopolitical shocks. The synchronous decline in equities and BTC suggests that in times of uncertainty, even the most resilient digital assets are being treated as risk-on plays.\nTechnical Fragility: Bitcoin Faces Crucial Support Zones\nWhile Bitcoin’s recent dip appears modest on the surface, underlying price action paints a fragile picture. BTC currently trades near $108,000, but multiple bounces from the $107,300 area have formed a cluster of equal lows—a magnet for liquidity sweeps.\nA decisive break below this level could trigger a cascade of stop-loss orders, potentially dragging Bitcoin into a “fair value gap” between $107,000 and $106,300. In that case, analysts warn of a sharp drop toward $105,000 unless buyers step in swiftly.\nOn the upside, Bitcoin remains above the 200-day EMA on the one-hour chart, keeping hopes of a bullish reversal alive. A strong recovery from below $107K—especially a clean break above the $109,500 resistance—could invalidate the bearish scenario and pave the way for a rally toward $112,000.\nNavigating Chaos Requires Strategy—That’s Where Outset PR Comes In\nIn a climate where macroeconomic chaos bleeds into crypto valuations, narrative clarity and timely exposure have never been more critical. That’s why more Web3 projects are turning to Outset PR—a performance-first crypto PR agency engineered for precision and results.\nIf PR has ever felt like trying to navigate a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data.\nUnlike firms that rely on mass outreach and templated packages, Outset PR offers tailored PR campaigns, crafted to fit a project's market stage, goals, and budget. Backed by retrospective and real-time metrics, every campaign is tied to perfect timing, product-market fit messaging, and smart media selection.\nOutset’s proprietary content distribution tech helps clients dominate high-discovery surfaces. Take ChangeNOW, for example: after partnering with Outset, they achieved a sustained 40% boost in reach, amplified by a Google Discover-powered editorial campaign.\nOutset PR facilitates insight-driven execution. Its in-house analytics desk spots trends before they hit mainstream radar. By evaluating media outlet visibility, domain activity, and traffic sources, Outset helps clients fine-tune their strategy for high-engagement regions like the US and UK.\nIn a time when even Bitcoin can’t escape trade policy shockwaves, Outset PR ensures your message lands where it matters most.\nConclusion\nThe road ahead remains unclear. If Trump proceeds with full-scale tariffs on August 1, we could see renewed sell pressure across risk assets—including crypto. But if negotiations yield softer terms, a relief rally may follow.\nWhat’s certain is that Bitcoin’s price is no longer driven purely by crypto-native factors. Macroeconomic policy, international trade dynamics, and media narratives now play a bigger role than ever.\nIn this unpredictable landscape, projects that position their brand proactively—through smart storytelling, strong media targeting, and strategic timing—are far more likely to weather the storm. And with a partner like Outset PR, navigating this storm just got a whole lot easier.\nYou can find more information about Outset PR here:\nWebsite: outsetpr.io\nTelegram: t.me/outsetpr\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

That said, holding firm rewards those who are patient.\nIt’s just a matter of time\nFor those investors who are worried about their Bitcoin positions, it must be borne in mind that just about every box has been ticked on the bullish check sheet. Yes, the price is still not moving in any major way since emerging out of a 6-week long bull flag, but it’s really just a matter of time.\n$BTC breakout on short-term time frame\nSource: TradingView\nIn fact, looking at the short-term time frame, it can be seen that the $BTC price has just broken through the descending trendline formed by the tops of the previous two attempts to leave the bull flag. If this current surge can get above $110,600 it will take out the previous local high, made at the mid-point of the bull flag. From there, it would be expected for the price to go on and surpass the all-time high.\nCould the all-time high be threatened today?\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily time frame puts things even more into perspective. The current candle has its base on the descending trendline and is driving higher. Depending on the price action through the rest of Wednesday, and perhaps some good news on the US trade tariffs front, the all-time high could even go today.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) illustrates that the indicator line has crossed back above the moving average (yellow line). Getting above the 60.00 level is the next target, and then a higher high at 64.00 would open the way to moving above 70.00 and into overbought territory.\nBullish weekly chart for $BTC\nSource: TradingView\nThe weekly chart is nothing but good news for $BTC. The breakout of the small bull flag has taken place, the confirmation of the breakout has happened, and now a decent upside move is expected.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator has bounced nicely off the yellow moving average. If the indicator line can continue to climb all the way up and get above the last high at 79.00, this would negate bearish divergence, and could allow a huge price increase.\nAt the very bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI is perfectly positioned, with the blue fast line back above the orange slow line, signalling strong upside price momentum.\nBe patient, it’s just a matter of time …\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Yet, while it garners praise, a fresh competitor like Remittix is gaining steam among investors. With real-world crypto-to-fiat solutions, it’s starting to turn heads away from meme coins.\nShiba Inu’s Climb Toward Market Maturity\nWith a market cap near $7 billion, Shiba Inu is now firmly in the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally. Analysts credit this to the growth of Shibarium, token burns, and consistent community engagement.\nProjects like ShibaSwap have helped SHIB break away from its meme roots. According toCoinCodex, technical indicators suggest potential for another bull rally.\nThe token recently passed 1 billion transactions on its L2 network, showing it still holds traction in a fast-changing market.\nWill SHIB Hit New Highs in 2025?\nPrice forecasts vary, but most analysts expect SHIB to trade between $0.0000133 and $0.0000326 this year, per Changelly and BraveNewCoin.\nSource: TradingView\nSome bullish predictions like Benzinga’s suggest SHIB could see its biggest moves early in the year. Others, like SwapSpace, temper expectations, saying $0.01 remains unlikely without a massive burn campaign.\nStill, with SHIB’s expanding DeFi use cases and NFT ambitions, moderate long-term growth appears attainable.\nRemittix: The Real-World Use Case Winner\nWhile Shiba Inu rides momentum, Remittix (RTX) is building on function. At $0.0811, it’s raised over $15.9 million by offering instant crypto-to-bank transfers via its upcoming RTX Wallet. Unlike meme coins, its value stems from solving practical problems.\nFor example, a student in Argentina can now receive BTC from family in the U.S. and get pesos deposited into their bank account in minutes. This feature bypasses exchanges, reduces fees, and adds usability to crypto.\nWith institutional pilots planned and a fully private, non-custodial design, Remittix is quietly becoming a top contender in PayFi.\nConclusion\nSHIB may continue to grow, especially if token burns accelerate and Shibarium expands. But projects like Remittix are setting a new standard—one where real-world use trumps memes.\nIn 2025, the race isn't just about top 10 status. It's about which project delivers on function, privacy, and global utility. For many, that’s where Remittix is beginning to shine.\nDiscover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their presale here:\nWebsite: https://remittix.io/\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/remittix\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE are at the forefront of this trend. Each one has its unique charm and potential growth. This article will dive into these quirky coins and explore which ones might be poised for a breakout.\nThis analysis is brought to you by Outset PR — a crypto-native public relations agency rooted in data, trend insights, and market dynamics. Outset PR partners with Web3 leaders to turn fleeting opportunities into sustained visibility and long-term growth.\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Shows Promise as Price Hovers in Higher Range\nSource: tradingview\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading between $0.00001122 and $0.00001228. This places it close to a recent peak and just below a key resistance level of $0.00001274. The coin's recent weekly gain of almost 4% hints at potential upward momentum. If SHIB breaks past the first resistance, its next target could be $0.00001380, which would signify a roughly 12% increase from its current top level. With a 6-month slide of over 40%, any recovery could be significant, but traders see hope as the RSI and Stochastic indicators suggest it's not yet overbought. Despite the challenges, SHIB seems geared for potential growth.\nDogecoin on the Rise: What's Next for the Popular Meme Coin?\nSource: tradingview\nDogecoin's price is hovering between sixteen and eighteen cents. The coin is currently seeing mild growth with a nearly three percent rise over the past week. It's still down considerably from its peak, with a drop of fifty percent over six months. The next push could test a resistance level at nineteen cents, showing potential for a six to nineteen percent increase if it breaks through. If momentum picks up, Dogecoin might aim for just over twenty cents next. However, a dip could see it fall to as low as twelve cents. Investors are watching closely, hoping for more upward movement.\nPepe Coin Shows Signs of Recovery Amid Market Volatility\nSource: tradingview\nPepe Coin (PEPE) is currently trading between $0.000009203 and $0.00001081. It has shown a slight increase of over 3% in the past week. The nearest wall for its rise sits at $0.00001160. If Pepe can break through this, it might aim for the next challenge at $0.00001321, driving an increase of around 21% from the current top end of its range. Despite a 12.48% drop over the past month and a larger fall of 43.48% in the last six months, its relative strength at just below 60 suggests potential for upward movement. With market support at $0.00000838, Pepe could rebound if momentum stays positive.\nOutset PR Crafts Communications Like a Workshop, Powered by Data\nFounded by renowned crypto PR expert Mike Ermolaev, Outset PR operates like a hands-on workshop, building every campaign with market fit in mind.\nInstead of offering random placements or templated packages, Outset PR carefully weaves a client’s story into the market context, showcasing what organic PR looks like:\n-\nMedia outlets are selected based on metrics like discoverability, domain authority, conversion rates, and viral potential\n-\nPitches are tailored to fit each platform’s voice and audience\n-\nTiming is mapped to let the story unfold naturally and build trust organically\nOutset PR occupies a unique niche as the only data-driven agency with a boutique-level approach.

Within the first few weeks, thousands of users enrolled in various contributor campaigns.\nSui’s campaign has led Starboard’s activity, with approximately 8,140 active participants tracked on its leaderboard. Other early adopters include 0G Labs with around 2,237 contributors and Plume with approximately 1,086.\nEach campaign is supported by a public leaderboard that updates in real-time. These project-specific rankings are further aggregated into the global leaderboard. Together, these tools provide a transparent system for surfacing top contributors and incentivizing sustained user participation.\nCommenting on Starboard’s initial growth, Galxe’s co-founder Charles Wayn, said: “More than visibility, the huge user engagement our 20+ registered projects are seeing indicates a significant volume of users actively engaging with projects via Starboard to promote their products and services in a meaningful way”.\n“It’s a real testament to the power and value of the emerging InfoFi sector and data driven user analytics that are allowing projects to advance and refine their growth strategies.”\nStarboard’s off-chain and on-chain data points are affording projects unique insights into their communities. Among these are the prominence of long-term contributors deeply engaged with specific ecosystems. For example, top contributors in the Plume Starboard are mostly RWA-focused users, and many of the active accounts in 0G have usernames that include “0G,” signaling strong community alignment.\nMessari’s full report available at www.messari.io\nAbout Galxe\nGalxe is web3’s leading growth platform, trusted by over 34 million users and more than 7,000 brands globally.

{"title": "FunToken Makes Web3 Attractive and That’s Exactly Why Web2 Users Are Entering the Web3 Ecosystem", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/funtoken-makes-web3-attractive-and-thats-exactly-why-web2-users-are-entering-the-web3-ecosystem", "text": "For years, the gap between Web2 gaming and Web3 utility tokens has felt almost impossible to bridge. On one side, Web2 offered billions of players fast, accessible, and entertaining experiences without needing wallets, seed phrases, or technical jargon. On the other side, Web3 promised ownership, deflationary assets, and decentralized economies, but often at the cost of user experience and trust.\nFUNToken is quietly dismantling this divide. By introducing an onboarding process that mirrors the frictionless, free-to-play models proven in Web2 gaming and combining it with a transparent, revenue-backed deflationary framework, FUNToken is redefining how everyday users can step into Web3 without intimidation or confusion.\nThis strategy is not just theory. It is already being validated by measurable adoption, strong price performance, and visible community traction. As of writing this article, FUNToken trades around $0.0100, with a market capitalization of approximately $109 million and daily trading volumes consistently exceeding $12 million.\nFor a token that once struggled to break mainstream awareness, these numbers reflect a shift that goes beyond speculation and points to real engagement from new users who previously ignored crypto altogether.\nBelow, we look at how FUNToken’s approach is working, why it appeals to Web2 audiences, and what it signals about the broader evolution of Web3 onboarding.\nThe Familiar Appeal of Free-to-Play Dynamics\nOne of the reasons Web2 gaming has been so effective at scaling to billions of players is the simple concept of free-to-play. No upfront payment is required to try the experience. Players can jump in, experiment, and feel progress without risking money. Over time, engagement monetizes through microtransactions, season passes, and cosmetic upgrades.\nFUNToken borrows heavily from this template. Instead of requiring new users to buy tokens or install complicated wallets before they can participate, the project offers immediate, no-cost interaction through its AI-powered Telegram bot. Anyone can join the bot chat, complete basic actions like answering questions or participating in quizzes, and see tokens credited to their in-app balance.\nThis initial experience requires no crypto knowledge. It feels like any other chat-based app game or rewards program, a familiar environment for the billions of users who have grown up with mobile-first experiences.\nOver time, the simplicity of earning tokens with no upfront risk helps create habit loops. New participants don’t feel pressured to learn advanced staking mechanics or understand smart contracts on day one. They simply show up, interact, and watch their balance grow.\nWhen people see tangible value in their accounts from the very first day, they are more willing to take the next steps into Web3 ecosystems. This is the same behavioral funnel that made Web2 gaming successful and addictive. FUNToken is effectively proving that the same funnel works for onboarding a new generation of crypto participants.\nImmediate Rewards as a Trust Catalyst\nWeb3 has often struggled with skepticism. For many Web2 users, blockchain still feels speculative or untrustworthy. FUNToken addresses this by ensuring that every interaction produces instant, verifiable rewards.\nThe Telegram AI bot is designed to distribute real $FUN tokens automatically. These tokens are not fictional points but on-chain assets users can verify. As soon as they claim a reward, it becomes visible in their transaction history and contributes to their balance, building trust in the system’s fairness and transparency.\nThis dynamic creates a powerful psychological incentive. People are far more likely to stay engaged when rewards are concrete and timely. Unlike traditional referral programs that promise future benefits or conditional payouts, FUNToken’s system provides immediate positive reinforcement.\nThese instant rewards serve as proof that participation has value, encouraging even skeptical users to continue exploring. Over time, this repeated validation helps to erode the perception that Web3 is only for speculators or insiders.\nClear Progression That Mirrors Gaming Milestones\nWhile many blockchain projects present a steep learning curve, FUNToken takes a layered approach that feels familiar to anyone who has played a progression-based game.\nUsers start with simple tasks: joining the Telegram group, answering trivia, or posting messages. As they build confidence and collect small rewards, the platform gradually introduces new layers of engagement. Eventually, users can transition to staking tokens and preparing for deeper participation in the gaming ecosystem that is planned in the roadmap for late 2025.\nThis progression-based design is significant. In Web2 gaming, progression is one of the most effective methods for improving retention. It provides structure and a sense of achievement. FUNToken’s model replicates this, letting users level up their involvement naturally rather than pushing them into advanced DeFi concepts immediately.\nRevenue-Backed Deflation Builds Confidence in Long-Term Value\nEven as users engage for free, they want to know that their earned tokens will hold value over time. This is where FUNToken’s deflationary mechanics become critical.\nIn June 2025, FUNToken executed a burn of 25 million tokens, funded directly from platform revenue rather than treasury reserves. This reduction represented about 0.23 percent of total supply. It is important because it demonstrates that FUNToken’s model is sustainable: as user participation grows, revenue increases, and a portion of that revenue is used to remove tokens from circulation.\nFor Web2 gamers accustomed to currencies that inflate without limit, the idea that their earnings become scarcer over time is appealing. It signals that the ecosystem values their contributions and that holding tokens is not simply a gamble.\nCertiK Audit and Continuous Monitoring Reinforce Trust\nOnboarding Web2 users also requires addressing fears about security and hidden risks. Many non-crypto participants have heard stories of smart contract exploits, hidden mint functions, or rug pulls.\nFUNToken has responded to these concerns by completing a comprehensive CertiK audit, which verified that the smart contract is immutable and contains no minting backdoors. CertiK Skynet monitoring further ensures that all contract activity is continuously audited in real time.\nFor new users, this assurance creates a more comfortable environment. They can participate knowing the platform has been professionally audited and is subject to continuous oversight.\nRoadmap Alignment and Future Growth\nThe success of FUNToken’s onboarding strategy is not an accident. It is closely tied to a clear and transparent roadmap that lays out how user engagement today connects to future value.\nThe roadmap outlines the Q3 and Q4 2025 launch of a mobile wallet that will integrate staking and in-app transactions. These features are designed to transform the onboarding process from an introduction to a fully functional economic ecosystem.\nLater in Q4, the expansion to 30 games will create further opportunities for users to apply their tokens, while the Q1 2026 milestone of scaling to over one million wallets demonstrates the ambition to serve a truly mainstream audience.\nConclusion\nFUNToken is emerging as a disruptive example of how Web3 projects can attract and retain Web2 audiences.\nBy blending proven free-to-play mechanics with transparent tokenomics and clear progression, the project is creating a bridge that feels accessible, rewarding, and secure.\nImmediate rewards, structured engagement, and credible deflationary practices ensure that new users are not only comfortable but motivated to keep participating.\nCertiK’s audit and continuous monitoring further reinforce this confidence, establishing FUNToken as a trustworthy option in an often unpredictable sector.\nAs more players discover that entering Web3 can be as simple as joining a Telegram group and answering a few questions, the gap between gaming entertainment and decentralized economies will continue to narrow.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Smart Investors Are Choosing These 5 Coins Over Ethereum (ETH) in 2025", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/smart-investors-are-choosing-these-5-coins-over-ethereum-eth-in-2025", "text": "Ethereum has long been the poster child for smart contracts, DeFi innovation, and NFT trails. In 2025, ETH stands strong, with analyst forecasts suggesting a breakout toward $10,000. Cointelegraph’s recent coverage pointed to a potential surge beyond its current rally as the Ethereum reboot gains traction. Even more, SEC approval for Ethereum ETFs continues to build institutional confidence.\nYet, amid this optimism, forward-thinking investors are quietly rebalancing. They’re funneling resources into projects that promise faster utility, stronger scalability, or alternative narratives poised for breakout. The headline question becomes: which tokens will carry momentum when Ethereum takes a pause?\nBelow are five trending altcoins—one actively preselling—that offer compelling reasons to be part of your 2025 strategy.\n-\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE)\nLittle Pepe is the only coin here still in presale—and it's a standout for a reason. LILPEPE isn’t just another frog meme; it’s debuting as a purpose-built Layer‑2 chain tailored for meme-age, backed by real products. With the presale now in its fourth stage at $0.0013, the first three phases sold out so swiftly that today’s participants are still early believers. The presale has raised more than $3.3 million in total.\nWhat sets this apart is the combination of speed, zero fees, bot protection, and a token model engineered for real engagement. Airdropped tokens for holders, zero taxes, and a roadmap that moves from birth to growth—complete with CEX listings and meme launchpads—make for both substance and community-hype. If the presale trajectory holds, LILPEPE could become one of the most buzz-worthy and user-first meme ecosystems in 2025.\n-\nSolana (SOL)\nSolana’s reputation for blistering speed and ultra-low transaction costs has sharpened its appeal. Worth noting: the first U.S.-listed Solana-focused ETF, SSK (Solana + Staking), has already launched on Cboe. With Solana likely to benefit from both ETF allocation and staking-driven returns, the network’s ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly. Developer activity is climbing, DeFi use is accelerating, and Solana is once again delivering functionality at scale. For investors seeking activity outside of Ethereum, SOL offers both momentum and established credentials.\n-\nRipple (XRP)\nRipple has quietly advanced in its mission to transform international finance. Regulatory headwinds may have slowed its pace in years past, but optimism surrounding XRP’s place in CBDCs and cross-border remittances is brewing. With Bitcoin and Ethereum gaining inclusion in U.S. strategic reserves, speculators wonder whether XRP may be next. Its ledger’s speed and low cost already make it a go-to for payment rails, but renewed institutional adoption could redefine its trajectory. Ripple’s team has made it clear: this isn’t just a token, it’s infrastructure.\n-\nChainlink (LINK)\nThe world’s largest aggregator of decentralized oracles, Chainlink, is quietly underpinning global smart contracts. As Ethereum’s go-to oracle in 2025, LINK remains indispensable. Recent advances in Chainlink 2.0, including staking and hybrid on‑ and off‑chain computation, have solidified its role. Whether DeFi, NFTs, or tokenized real-world assets are your focus, Chainlink continues to serve as the connective tissue, tracking external events, rates, sports scores, and beyond. Its value proposition goes well beyond Ethereum, positioning LINK as a DeFi staple with long-term relevance.\n-\nStellar (XLM)\nFor its pedigree of utility, Stellar is relatively undervalued. It has built practical use cases by focusing on cross-border payments and stablecoins. Its network is lightweight, efficient, and already integrated with banks and fintech firms. XLM’s strong presence in emerging markets aligns with the big-picture rollout of stablecoins and CBDCs in digital finance. While Ethereum remains dominant in DeFi, Stellar excels at moving value globally with minimal friction. As stablecoin adoption grows, XLM could be the next token riding that wave—this time beyond the Ethereum paradigm.\nStrong Bull Case for Spreading Bets\nThis story isn’t hypothetical. Experts like Alphractal’s Joao Wedson highlight that altcoins flourish when Ethereum establishes new highs. Fingers crossed, ETH keeps climbing. But a smart investor doesn’t wait to ride Ethereum alone—they distribute across scalable ecosystems, real-world rails, infrastructure tokens, and even meme bridges with purpose.\nThe presence of a meme coin with a robust purpose, like Little Pepe, illustrates this mindset shift. Investors can allocate a small portion to high-risk, high-upside presale tokens while backing established networks that solve tangible problems.\nFinal Take\nSavvy managers understand their portfolio’s returns won’t ride solely on Ethereum’s shoulders. As the market evolves, smart investors are casting their nets across carefully selected alternatives.\nIn 2025, coins that solve specific problems such as faster bridges, payment rails, oracle arbitration, and Layer‑2 utility will shine brightest. While Ethereum primes itself for institutional growth, these five tokens might just race ahead when altseason accelerates.\nThe era of “only ETH” is fading. Welcome to 2025, where smart money says yes to progress—and yes to the path Ethereum paved.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

While Tron (TRX) has long been a notable player, many seasoned investors are now redirecting their focus toward Ruvi AI (RUVI). Thanks to a transparent foundation, strong early momentum, and real-world utility, Ruvi AI is set up to become a breakout success story this year. Analysts suggest that Ruvi AI’s strategic growth and audited security measures put it ahead of Tron as a lucrative and safer investment option.\nReliable Foundations Backed by Successful Audit\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrency investments, security and transparency are top concerns. Ruvi AI addresses these by undergoing a thorough third-party audit conducted by CyberScope, a globally recognized blockchain auditing firm. The audit certified Ruvi AI’s smart contracts as secure and free of risks, providing a robust guarantee that the token is built on a solid foundation.\nFurthermore, Ruvi AI partnered with WEEX Exchange, securing post-presale liquidity. This strategic move assures investors of seamless trading opportunities as soon as Ruvi AI goes live on public markets. These measures not only eliminate much of the uncertainty surrounding emerging tokens but also highlight Ruvi AI’s commitment to creating a safe and trustworthy ecosystem.\nImpressive Presale Numbers Highlight Investor Confidence\nInvestor enthusiasm for Ruvi AI is evident from the overwhelming success of its presale. Key milestones include:\n- More than $2.2 million raised in funding.\n- Over 180 million tokens sold, showcasing strong demand.\n- A community of 2,000+ investors, reflecting widespread interest in the project.\nRuvi AI’s current Phase 2 presale price stands at just $0.015 per token, offering incredible affordability and value. By the end of the presale, the price will rise to $0.07, delivering an almost 5x ROI for early backers. Further predictions estimate the token could hit $1 post-launch, meaning a 66x ROI for those who enter early.\nReal-World Applications Drive Long-Term Value\nWhat makes Ruvi AI a standout choice is not just its incredible growth potential but its utility-driven approach. By combining blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI), Ruvi AI introduces solutions with tangible applications across high-demand industries. Here’s how it creates scalable value across sectors:\nRevolutionizing Marketing\nRuvi AI empowers businesses to refine digital advertising campaigns with AI-powered tools designed to enhance targeting and reduce inefficiencies. This results in higher marketing ROI, making Ruvi AI an invaluable asset to companies looking to increase ad effectiveness.\nEnhancing the Entertainment Space\nFor content creators, Ruvi AI brings fairness and transparency to payments through blockchain-backed systems. Additionally, its AI-driven audience analytics help creators improve engagement and unlock monetization opportunities, fostering stronger connections with their fans.\nInnovating Financial Systems\nRuvi AI addresses inefficiencies in finance by introducing AI-powered fraud detection and secure blockchain payment protocols. These innovations enhance trust and streamline operations, setting the stage for widespread adoption.\nThe strategic alignment of Ruvi AI’s technology with practical industry needs positions the token as a long-term driver of value, setting it apart from speculative cryptocurrencies like Tron.\nAmplify Returns With VIP Investment Tiers\nTo reward its early backers, Ruvi AI offers VIP investment tiers during its presale, allowing participants to magnify returns through generous bonuses. Here’s an overview:\n- VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus):\n- Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus).\n- Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900.\n- Value at $1 per token: $70,000.\n- VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus):\n- Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus).\n- Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680.\n- Value at $1 per token: $224,000.\n- VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus):\n- Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double allocation).\n- Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600.\n- Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000.\nThese tiers not only enhance earnings but also provide investors with a unique opportunity to capitalize on Ruvi AI’s early-stage success.\nWhy Ruvi AI Is Set for Explosive Gains\nTron has attracted attention for its blockchain for content creators, but it lacks the innovative edge and scalability of Ruvi AI. By integrating cutting-edge AI functionality into blockchain systems, Ruvi AI addresses critical industry challenges with versatile, scalable solutions.\nFor investors prioritizing security, transparency, and real-world utility, Ruvi AI checks every box. Priced at just $0.015 per token, Ruvi AI presents an unrivaled opportunity for exponential returns backed by a solid, trusted foundation.\nWith predictions pointing to a 66x ROI and a $1 valuation post-listing, there’s no better time to join Ruvi AI’s presale and secure your stake in this high-potential project. Ruvi AI isn’t just a better alternative to Tron, it’s a game-changer for the blockchain and AI industries.\nLearn More\nBuy RUVI: https://presale.ruvi.io\nWebsite: https://ruvi.io\nWhitepaper: https://docs.ruvi.io\nTelegram: https://t.me/ruviofficial\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/RuviAI\nTry RUVI AI: https://web.ruvi.io/register\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Now, in the midst of a turbulent yet promising 2025, that same investor has gone public with six meme coins they believe are poised to dominate this year’s altseason, with one newcomer, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE), leading the charge with potential gains of up to 3,000%. Let’s break down why this prediction might not be as wild as it sounds—and which meme coins are heating up under the radar.\nLittle Pepe ($LILPEPE)—The Meme Chain Revolution Begins\nMove over, Layer-1s; Little Pepe isn’t just another frog with a funny name—it’s building its own Layer-2 blockchain, powered entirely by $LILPEPE. What makes it special? Zero taxes, ultra-fast transactions, and a no-nonsense presale approach that has already raised over $3.74 million at $0.0013. With nearly 3.2 billion tokens sold, investor interest is white-hot. Unlike most meme coins that rely solely on hype, Little Pepe combines technical ambition with meme virality—a rare blend. The team has built an Ethereum-based ecosystem optimized for lightning-speed and low-cost transactions, tapping into both DeFi power users and meme lovers. With a $777,000 giveaway live now and major exchange listings on the horizon, $LILPEPE is drawing comparisons to the early days of PEPE and SHIB. Analysts close to the investor predict a 3,000% breakout post-launch, especially if the project can deliver on its “Meme Chain” promise.\nDogecoin (DOGE)—The Comeback OG\nIt’s not done yet. After slumping 38% from May highs, DOGE is flashing a massive double-bottom pattern—a classic technical indicator of bullish reversal. If it breaches resistance at $0.2596, analysts expect a run toward $0.3753, a potential 125% upside. Speculation surrounding the delayed 21Shares DOGE ETF, combined with Elon Musk’s persistent (if chaotic) endorsements, keeps DOGE very much alive. If ETF approval lands, DOGE could make one final leap toward the $1 dream—and possibly beyond.\nPudgy Penguins (PENGU)—Where NFTs Meet Wall Street\nThe Solana-based PENGU token, tied to the beloved Pudgy Penguins NFT brand, is experiencing explosive growth. A proposed PENGU-Pudgy ETF, filed with the SEC, has already pushed the price up 64% this week alone. The ETF structure, which blends meme tokens with digital collectibles, may be the first of its kind, and it’s resonating. Technically, PENGU is printing an ascending triangle, a bullish continuation pattern that could send it toward $0.040 soon, with a long-term market cap target of $4–5 billion.\nPEPE—Coiling Up for Another Breakout\nWhile many thought the frog meme narrative peaked in 2023, PEPE has returned with a vengeance. A cup-and-handle pattern validated on the charts has pushed PEPE through resistance at $0.000009. Analysts are now targeting the $0.0000145–$0.000015 range, representing a 60–80% move from current levels. More intriguing is the Fibonacci 38.2% retracement zone near $0.0000133 that has attracted heavy accumulation, potentially from whales. Why it’s bullish: With PEPE’s all-time high now in sight and bullish momentum returning, another 100–150% rally is on the table.\nSPX6900 (SPX)—The Meme Index Fund of Crypto\nSPX6900 isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a movement. Soaring from $0.25 to $1.70 earlier this year, SPX is a cultural homage to Wall Street’s S&P 500, wrapped in Gen-Z humor and crypto irreverence. A Binance Futures listing has added significant liquidity and attracted whales, as retail sentiment becomes increasingly bullish. Now stabilizing above the key $1 level, analysts forecast a potential climb toward $5, making it one of the best-positioned meme coins to benefit from a full-blown altseason breakout.\nKET (KET)—The Quiet Blue-Chip of Meme Coins\nFlying under the radar but gaining momentum, KET is positioning itself as the “stablecoin” of meme tokens. After a recent 11.7% surge from $0.35 to $0.391, analysts believe KET could rally toward $0.50, and possibly $0.30–$0.50 by year-end if momentum holds. With a fixed 1 billion token supply and a nearly $400M fully diluted valuation, KET is winning over institutional investors and veteran holders seeking exposure to meme culture without the typical volatility.\nFinal Thoughts: Meme Season 2.0 Is Here—But Smarter\nFOMO, spontaneity, and numerous questionable projects characterized the 2021 meme coin frenzy. But 2025’s meme coin market is different. We’re now seeing serious infrastructure (Little Pepe), institutional interest (PENGU, DOGE), and consistent technical signals (PEPE, KET). Little Pepe may be the new frog on the block, but its blend of tech, tokenomics, and meme appeal gives it the kind of launchpad few meme coins enjoy. With the presale nearly sold out and a whopping $777K giveaway still running, the window to enter before liftoff is closing fast. As always, crypto rewards the bold—but in 2025, it’s rewarding those who bet early and smart.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

However, a rising star, Ruvi AI (RUVI), is making waves as a promising new contender, with analysts suggesting it has the potential to follow, or even surpass, Ethereum’s groundbreaking trajectory. With $2.2 million raised, over 180 million tokens sold, and more than 2,000 holders, Ruvi AI is off to a strong start.\nCombining blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), Ruvi AI is more than just another token; it’s a platform designed to solve real-world problems in industries like marketing, entertainment, and finance. Here’s why this emerging project could be the next big thing.\nA Utility-Driven Approach That Sets Ruvi AI Apart\nWhile Ethereum pioneered decentralized smart contracts and dApps, Ruvi AI takes that legacy further by addressing practical challenges faced by industries. Instead of relying solely on speculation or hype, Ruvi AI’s value comes from its real-world applications, which help businesses operate more efficiently and securely.\nReal-World Applications that Drive Long-Term Growth\nRuvi AI’s focus on solving tangible problems positions it as a long-term player in the crypto space. Here’s how it’s making an impact:\n-\nMarketing: With AI-powered analytics, Ruvi AI enables businesses to improve ad targeting, streamline campaigns, and maximize ROI, reducing wasted advertising spend.\n-\nEntertainment: Content creators benefit from blockchain-backed payment systems and AI-driven audience insights, ensuring transparent and scalable revenue while enhancing user engagement.\n-\nFinance: Ruvi AI provides robust fraud detection tools, secure blockchain-based transactions, and transparent financial processes, making it an invaluable resource for financial institutions.\nThese solutions ensure continuous demand for Ruvi AI tokens, giving it staying power in the competitive cryptocurrency market.\nPresale Success Highlights Ruvi AI’s Traction\nRuvi AI’s early accomplishments underline its potential for exponential growth. Its presale phase has been a massive success, with key milestones including:\n-\n$2.2 million raised, proving strong investor confidence in its concept and execution.\n-\nOver 180 million tokens sold, showing high demand across the market.\n-\nA growing community of more than 2,000 holders, reflecting widespread adoption and trust during the project’s infancy.\nSuch early momentum is rarely seen in new projects, establishing Ruvi AI as one to watch closely.\nA Roadmap to $1 and 66x Returns\nOne of Ruvi AI’s standout features is its structured and transparent growth plan, which assures investors of predictable returns. Currently priced at just $0.015 during Phase 2 of its presale, Ruvi AI offers a highly accessible entry point. When the presale concludes, the token’s value is guaranteed to increase to $0.07, delivering an almost 5x ROI upfront.\nBut the real potential lies in the long-term. Analysts project Ruvi AI could reach $1 per token post-listing, translating to a 66x ROI from today’s price. With such enormous upside, Ruvi AI offers investors a rare opportunity to achieve life-changing gains.\nAmplify Returns with VIP Investment Tiers\nRuvi AI rewards early supporters through its VIP investment tiers, offering substantial token bonuses. Here’s how they compare:\n-\nVIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus):\n-\nTotal tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus).\n-\nValue at $0.07 per token: $4,900.\n-\nValue at $1 per token: $70,000.\n-\nVIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus):\n-\nTotal tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus).\n-\nValue at $0.07 per token: $15,680.\n-\nValue at $1 per token: $224,000.\n-\nVIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus):\n-\nTotal tokens received: 1,280,000 (double allocation).\n-\nValue at $0.07 per token: $89,600.\n-\nValue at $1 per token: $1,280,000.\nThese tiers provide investors with an attractive way to maximize their returns while generating even greater excitement surrounding Ruvi AI.\nTransparency and Security Attract Investors\nRuvi AI has cemented its reputation for trustworthiness by focusing on transparency and safety. The project underwent a third-party audit by CyberScope, ensuring that its smart contracts are secure and reliable.\nAdditionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with the WEEX Exchange, guaranteeing post-presale liquidity for token holders. This ensures that investors can expect smooth trading and a stable post-listing environment, positioning the token for widespread adoption.\nIs Ruvi AI the Next Ethereum?\nEthereum revolutionized the cryptocurrency world by introducing smart contracts and decentralized applications. Ruvi AI is continuing that revolution by seamlessly blending blockchain with artificial intelligence. Backed by $2.2 million in funding, over 180 million tokens sold, and a passionate base of 2,000+ holders, Ruvi AI is already proving it has the potential to generate returns that rival Ethereum’s early days.\nWith a presale price of $0.015, a guaranteed valuation of $0.07, and analyst projections of $1 post-listing, Ruvi AI offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for crypto enthusiasts and seasoned investors alike.

The analysis revealed a convoluted valuation picture that challenges traditional pricing logic while highlighting the company's unprecedented position in the BTC ecosystem.\nThe report suggests investors “disregard the company’s legacy software operations” and examine its true value as a high-beta proxy for its underlying asset, BTC. Holding over half a million BTC at about 2.8% of BTC’s total supply, Strategy is currently trading at a 68% premium to the net value of its BTC treasury at $107 billion market cap.\nKey Findings:\n- Quantitative Data Suggests Undervaluation: A statistical analysis of the historical relationship between BTC and MSTR performance indicates, on paper, a potential fair value of $468 per share, suggesting the stock may be undervalued by approximately 17.9% at current trading levels of $384.\n- Conservative Leverage Management: Despite its aggressive BTC accumulation, Strategy maintains a prudent loan-to-value ratio of just 11.46%, providing a substantial cushion against market volatility and default risk. However, the company has yet to face a real stress test in the case of a major unexpected BTC correction.\n- Strategy as a Non-Replicable Strategy: The analysis cautioned that Strategy's valuation premium is likely unique and inimitable, stemming from its first-mover advantage and singular focus on BTC accumulation versus other corporate holders who maintain crypto as non-core treasury assets.\nThe report notes that Strategy's transformation has created an entirely new asset class in equity markets, providing value in institutional BTC exposure instead of sales revenue. The analysis also suggests that while the company presents significant upside potential in favorable BTC markets, its leveraged structure equally amplifies downside risk.\nThe complete analysis is available on Bybit Learn.\nDisclaimer: Past performance does not guarantee future results.

In September 2024, G-Knot’s technology, developed by eTunnel, secured a prestigious contract with the United Nations’ International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to deploy biometric smart cards across UN organizations. Today, G-Knot is the only provider of commercial finger vein biometric solutions in the world.\n“Kaplan’s proven track record in scaling innovative financial tech makes him the ideal leader to bring eTunnel’s technology to market,” said Youngkuk Kim the CEO of eTunnel. “As eTunnel continues to advance biometric research, G-Knot, under Wes’s leadership, will leverage the gold standard of biometric technology to deliver enterprise-grade and consumer-focused products that address the growing security needs of an increasingly digital world.”\nKaplan is a seasoned technology leader with deep experience across fintech, digital assets, and traditional finance. He has held executive roles at top firms including Cointelegraph, AscendEX, and Tradewind Markets, and began his career at J.P. Morgan and BNY Mellon. Most recently, Wes served as CEO of Cointelegraph, a premier global cryptocurrency media organization. His appointment signals G-Knot’s ambition to bridge the gap between cutting-edge biometrics and DeFi to create new and more secure opportunities for retail and institutional adoption.\nAbout G-Knot\nG-Knot is a pioneering biometric technology company redefining security and identity management for the digital age. G-knot was established to commercialize over a decade’s worth of biometrics development and innovation from its parent company, eTunnel Inc., a leading biometrics research and development firm based in Seoul, South Korea.

SHIB, trading at $0.00001165 with a $6.8 billion market cap, aims for a $0.00005 target, a 330% gain. However, three rival meme coins—Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU)—are poised to deliver 10x returns before SHIB breaks its $0.00005 resistance. LILPEPE, at $0.0013 in its Stage 4 presale on littlepepe.com, leads with a $3.6 million raise and a $777,000 giveaway (10 winners get $77,000 in tokens). Here’s why these rivals could outpace SHIB in 2025.\nShiba Inu (SHIB): Pippen’s Pick Faces Resistance\nSHIB has surged 24% in 90 days, driven by Shibarium’s $1 billion TVL and a 1,068% burn rate spike, removing 51.7 million tokens. Analysts predict $0.00005 by Q4, requiring a break past the $0.00003 resistance wall, where whales hold 1.2 trillion SHIB.\nPippen’s hype, alongside 1.5 million community members and ETF rumors, boosts sentiment, but SHIB’s 589 trillion token supply and whale dumps (10 billion SHIB sold recently) cap explosive gains. Its $6.8 billion market cap, ranking it 19th, requires a $35 billion cap to reach $0.00005, a challenging climb. While SHIB’s DeFi and NFT push adds utility, its upside lags behind the 10x potential of LILPEPE, BONK, and PENGU.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The 10x Meme Coin Rocket\nLILPEPE, a frog-themed ERC-20 token at $0.0013, is the top contender to outshine SHIB, raising $3.6 million in its presale with a $777,000 giveaway fueling the retail frenzy. Set to list at $0.003 for a 131% gain, analysts forecast a 10x surge to $0.013 by Q4, with some eyeing $0.15 (11,438% from presale) for a $1.5 billion cap. A $1,000 investment buys 769,230 tokens, worth $10,000 at $0.013. Its Layer 2 chain offers instant, near-zero-fee trades, outpacing SHIB’s Shibarium costs ($0.05–$0.10).\nThe “Frog Firepad” launchpad, with anti-scam locks, sparks viral token launches, while anti-bot tech ensures fair presales. Backed by memecoin experts, LILPEPE’s Binance bid and two exchange listings position it to steal SHIB’s market share, making it a prime 10x pick.\nBONK: Solana’s Most Popular Meme Coin\nBonk, at $0.00004026 with a $3.19 billion market cap, is Solana’s memecoin star, up 128.69% this month. Analysts see $0.00084 by Q4, a 2000% jump, driven by Solana’s 66.9 million daily transactions. BONK’s 1.69 trillion token burn in 2024 cut supply to 90.97 trillion, boosting scarcity. Integrated into Solana’s DeFi and NFT ecosystems, tools like BonkSwap and BonkBot add utility beyond SHIB’s speculative hype. Despite a 19% weekly decline, an oversold RSI suggests a potential rebound is on the horizon. BONK’s community and Solana’s ETF buzz position it for massive gains in 2025’s bull market.\nThat said, BONK doesn’t offer the same infrastructure or ecosystem-building that LILPEPE does, which is why many new investors are starting to diversify into both, using BONK as a way to gain exposure to the Solana meme space while viewing LILPEPE as a long-term high-upside bet.\nPudgy Penguins (PENGU): Community Meets Culture\nPudgy Penguins, at $0.0095 with a $598.8 million market cap, are tied to 8,888 Ethereum-based NFTs. Its Pudgy World launch on zkSync, blending toys and on-chain assets, drives mainstream appeal. Analysts expect $0.10 by Q4, representing a 952% gain, as NFT interest surges. PENGU’s merchandise and licensing deals expand its reach, offering more than BONK’s pure meme play. Its low price and cultural pull make it a 2025 breakout candidate, with NFT utility fueling long-term value.\nConclusion\nScottie Pippen’s Shiba Inu (SHIB) pick eyes $0.00005, but its 330% gain is outpaced by Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), each with 10x potential. LILPEPE’s $0.0013 presale, with $3.6 million raised and a $777,000 giveaway target $0.013. BONK aims for $0.00084, and PENGU $0.1. Their low-cap agility and meme-driven tech could turn $400 into $4,000 before SHIB breaks $0.00005. Grab LILPEPE’s presale and add BONK and PENGU for 2025’s bull run riches!\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Solana and XRP Jump During Crypto Bull Pulse—Why Ozak AI’s Utility Chain Could Outshine Them", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/solana-and-xrp-jump-during-crypto-bull-pulse-why-ozak-ais-utility-chain-could-outshine-them", "text": "The cryptocurrency market is experiencing an exciting bull run, with notable jumps from significant assets like Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP). These tokens have made substantial strides in price, capitalizing on the current surge in digital assets. A new rival, Ozak AI, is entering the market with a novel strategy: it uses blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to build a decentralized, incredibly effective ecosystem. This utility chain has a number of features that might eventually surpass those of Solana and XRP.\nSolana and XRP: Riding the Bull Wave\nSolana, a high-performance blockchain, has gained significant attention due to its scalability and lower transaction costs compared to Ethereum. As the market experiences renewed interest in fast and affordable blockchain solutions, Solana's token has surged in value, attracting investors looking for cost-effective alternatives in decentralized finance (DeFi) and other applications.\nSimilarly, XRP has also seen a significant price jump, partly fueled by ongoing legal developments. XRP's ability to facilitate fast and cheap cross-border payments has made it a popular choice in the cryptocurrency space. Its utility in the remittance and finance sectors has positioned XRP as a leader in payment-oriented blockchain networks.\nThese projects are riding high on the current market momentum. However, as the crypto landscape matures, other solutions that integrate AI and blockchain may offer more comprehensive and future-proof systems. Enter Ozak AI, a platform that aims to combine predictive analytics, AI-driven decision-making, and blockchain technology to provide more innovative financial management and improved market performance.\nOzak AI’s Utility Chain: A Strong Competitor\nOzak AI is not just another blockchain-based platform. By combining the power of AI with decentralized finance (DeFi), it seeks to solve some of the significant issues facing traditional blockchain systems. The platform is designed to help traders and investors by providing market forecasting and predictive analytics that can help them make better decisions in erratic markets. The machine learning process is used by such a chain of utilities to accurately predict the majority of things and maintain constant competitiveness in a rapidly evolving environment.\nThe Ozak AI utility chain will be built on the prediction of the intelligent market, risk mitigation, and improved security, as opposed to Solana and XRP, which are primarily focused on speed and transaction cost reduction. It applies sophisticated algorithms to forecast the market trends with regard to past data and real-time information. This AI can analyze large data sets and, as such, enable other users to make better trading decisions that are less uncertain and can guarantee greater profit.\nOzak AI presale is currently in its fourth phase offering OZ tokens at $0.005, which will increase to $0.01 in the next phase. The presale has already raised over $1.28 million by selling more than 17.5 million tokens out of the available supply of 200 million. Another reason that is attracting users to participate in the presale is its massive $1M giveaway to the top 100 winners.\nThe decentralized architecture of Ozak AI is also unwavering in its dedication to security and transparency. The platform uses Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) to remove vulnerabilities that are commonly present in centralized systems. Ozak AI's decentralized architecture has several benefits, including improved availability, tamper resistance, and data redundancy. This guarantees the platform as safe and efficient even in cases of cyberattacks or system crashes.\nFuture of the Ozak AI in the Crypto World\nIn addition to claiming sizable niches in the cryptocurrency market, Solana and XRP might both lack the innovation necessary to approach predictive analytics and make informed decisions. Ozak AI's utility chain has the potential to lead the way in creating more inventive and effective blockchain ecosystems as automation and AI's acceptance in the financial sector grow.\nAn investor in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market may find the platform's real-time market adaptation based on its machine learning connection to be beneficial. Ozak AI's ability to sift through massive amounts of data and predict market trends could be revolutionary for traders whose businesses depend on timely information to maximize investments. AI-enhanced risk management, predictive analytics, and auto decision-making are all features that Ozak AI promises to offer the degree of sophistication that Solana and XRP could not yet hope to meet.\nBesides, the Arbitrum Orbit, a layer-2 scaling solution, has been incorporated into the platform, which facilitates the cost-effective and swift execution of smart contracts. In terms of performance and optimality, it could compete with both Solana and XRP since it drastically reduces transaction fees and increases platform scalability.\nFor more information about Ozak AI, visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

But since its explosive run, SHIB has entered a maturity phase — one that still holds potential but no longer promises the wild 10,000%+ moves of its past. Today, a crypto billionaire who made wild gains from SHIB is putting 78% of his crypto portfolio into two new tokens dubbed “Shiba Inu killers.” And according to ChatGPT, one of them is poised for a staggering 18,000% rally.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin With Real Infrastructure\nThere’s a reason Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is leading conversations on crypto Telegrams, Reddit, and presale trackers. It isn’t just another frog-themed meme coin. It’s being built as the successor to PEPE, but with a major twist: it’s not just a token—it’s the fuel of a whole meme Layer‑2 blockchain built on Ethereum. This positions Little Pepe as the first of its kind: a meme-focused Layer‑2 chain. And like Ethereum was to ICOs, LILPEPE could become the go-to infrastructure for creating meme tokens. The Little Pepe's presale has shown investors' large appetite for LILPEPE. In less than a month, three stages have sold out, and the fourth is 80% sold out. This has brought the amount raised to $3.6 million, with 3.13 million tokens sold. It's not just about the potential upside. Little Pepe is bringing a lot to the table, and investors can't wait to be a part of it:\n-\nLayer‑2 Architecture: Built for ultra-low gas fees, lightning-fast trades, and zero-tax transactions. It directly solves the pain points meme token traders face on congested Ethereum.\n-\nPepe’s Pump Pad: A native launchpad built into the chain where new meme coins can launch with liquidity locks and anti-sniper tech.\n-\nMassive Hype: The team launched a $777,000 giveaway, where ten winners will receive $ 77,000 each. This has sent virality into overdrive, drawing attention from TikTok, YouTube, and X influencers.\n-\nLegacy Narrative: As the \"spiritual successor\" to PEPE, Little Pepe embraces the viral energy of its predecessor while embedding utility and infrastructure. This is a combination the original lacked.\nLILPEPE looks ready to leave most meme legends behind in the coming bull run, including SHIB. With the platform offering a future for meme coins, adoption could skyrocket its value. The exchange listing is coming up soon, and analysts expect a massive rally post-launch that will leave early investors in mind-blowing wealth.\nFloki Inu: The Meme Coin Evolving Into a Utility Powerhouse\nFloki Inu’s Valhalla mainnet launch on June 30 triggered an 11% intraday rally. This rally pushed FLOKI to approximately $0.000078, fueled by a dramatic 64% surge in trading volume. This explosion wasn’t just momentum—it unlocked a $50 million ecosystem fund that supports development, marketing, and token burns.\nFLOKI/USD 1D Price Chart|Source: TradingView\nFlokiFi Locker, a multi-chain token-locking protocol, has amassed over $150 million in TVL. It enables users to lock fungible tokens, NFTs, and LP assets while triggering automatic FLOKI buybacks and burns. This mechanism injects deflationary pressure and enhances utility. Additionally, an aggressive marketing blitz preceded Valhalla’s debut. This included a U.S.-focused sports advertising campaign spanning 2.25 million impressions across mobile games like Candy Crush and partnerships with Nottingham Forest’s community initiatives. Floki’s presence extended to Times Square and Twitch, amplifying visibility and brand recognition.\nSince its viral beginnings, it has evolved into a full ecosystem that includes:\n-\nValhalla: A play-to-earn metaverse game built on Unreal Engine.\n-\nFlokiFi: A DeFi suite that provides staking and farming solutions.\n-\nEducation: Its Crypto University, University of Floki, aims to onboard the next generation of users.\nAs blockchain gaming captures global interest, with metaverse gaming markets projected to exceed $400 billion by 2025, Floki is strategically positioned at the intersection of meme culture and utility. It stands out as a meme coin that could replace Shiba Inu this year.\nChatGPT Predicts: One Will Soar 18,000%\nWhile both Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) are strong contenders in the next meme coin wave, ChatGPT’s analysis highlights Little Pepe as the one with the highest upside. According to pattern recognition and historical comparisons, LILPEPE could rally up to 18,000%. This is very likely if it delivers on its roadmap as the first Layer‑2 chain built entirely for meme tokens. LILPEPE offers infrastructure, real token utility, and a built-in launchpad that benefits from every new token launched on its chain. FLOKI, while powerful and expanding, focuses more on the metaverse and gaming. But LILPEPE’s early-stage pricing, viral energy, and first-mover advantage give it a stronger breakout profile. ChatGPT’s verdict? Both are solid. However, LILPEPE has the edge for investors seeking exponential returns with ground-floor access.\nFinal Take: Early Entry, Big Reward\nThis crypto billionaire’s choice to load up on Little Pepe and Floki Inu is a bet not just on meme culture, but on how meme tokens will evolve in 2025. With utility now front and center, these two tokens could offer the kind of asymmetric upside that made early SHIB and DOGE millionaires in the first place. Meanwhile, LILPEPE has a higher position, making it the best pick. The presale is still in Stage 4. Grab your tokens at littlepepe.com before the price rockets. This frog might just leap over the entire meme coin sector.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Best Crypto to Buy Now As Bitcoin ETF Inflows Skyrocket Again", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-bitcoin-etf-inflows-skyrocket-again", "text": "Bitcoin ETF inflows have surged once more, and the effect on the crypto market has been immediate. In the past month alone, over 50,000 BTC has poured into institutional products, marking a clear return of appetite from funds that had previously stepped back.\nThis resurgence has reignited speculative interest, pulling the market out of its post-correction slump. Sentiment, which had hovered near neutral for weeks, has quickly turned bullish again. With liquidity returning and risk appetite building, market structure looks ready to shift into a more aggressive phase.\nBitcoin Dominance Slips as Altcoins Eye Breakout Territory\nWhile ETF inflows continue to support Bitcoin’s trajectory, a more nuanced trend is playing out beneath the surface. Bitcoin dominance, which refers to the percentage of total market capitalization held by Bitcoin, has faced multiple rejections at the 65 percent level and is now in retreat once again. This metric is often overlooked during bullish periods, but historically, its decline has been a strong precursor to altcoin rallies.\nWhen dominance falls, it signals that capital is rotating out of Bitcoin and into smaller-cap assets, often in search of higher returns as market confidence grows.\nThat environment appears to be forming now. With Ecoinometrics projecting a potential Bitcoin price target of 117,000 dollars based on ETF inflow momentum, the overarching sentiment remains bullish. Yet as more traders begin to position themselves ahead of that move, the appetite for altcoins is naturally picking up.\nBitcoin ETF flows are lining up behind a breakout.\n— ecoinometrics (@ecoinometrics) July 6, 2025\nWith rolling 30-day inflows nearing 50K BTC and rising, you’d expect more upside for Bitcoin’s price.\nOur ETF flow-to-price model suggests an expected target of $117,000. pic.twitter.com/d2NW3yZYRM\nDominance breakouts typically require multiple attempts before giving way, but the current chart structure suggests weakening support. If Bitcoin dominance drops below key levels in the coming days, the market could quickly pivot into what many consider the early phase of altseason.\nAltcoin activity has already shown early signs of life across several segments, from mid-cap infrastructure plays to smaller ecosystem tokens. Volume is returning. New narratives are being tested. And perhaps most importantly, traders are starting to shift away from defensive positions. In that context, a breakdown in dominance may act less as a warning sign and more as a green light. If it plays out, the broader crypto market could be in for a strong leg up.\nBest Crypto to Buy Now – Altcoins With High Growth Potential and Low Price Tags\nBitcoin Hyper\nNot all Layer 2s are built to echo the architecture of their base chain. Bitcoin Hyper leans into the idea that Bitcoin’s strength lies not only in its scarcity but also in the consistency of its economic rhythm. While most Layer 2s chase modularity or scaling throughput, Bitcoin Hyper focuses on how network activity can sync with market psychology. Its design does not simply add speed or reduce costs. It translates Bitcoin’s value language into something developers and token ecosystems can build on.\nThe reason this matters now is because capital is looking to spread out again. The ETF narrative has created gravitational pull around Bitcoin, but it has also opened the door for infrastructure built around it. Bitcoin Hyper exists exactly in that space. It inherits security assumptions from Bitcoin without diluting them, and more importantly, it enables value and interaction layers to emerge without altering the base chain.\nThe project has already received praise from top crypto content creators like ClayBro, who have noted its utility and potential adoptability through posts or videos on platforms such as YouTube.\nThere is also a clarity in its roadmap that helps distinguish it from the rest. Rather than promising ambiguous integrations or questionable partnerships, Bitcoin Hyper focuses on one mission: making Bitcoin programmable without friction.\nIn a time when traders are watching dominance metrics closely and waiting for altcoin momentum, Bitcoin Hyper represents a rare project that aligns with both conviction and timing. It is not trying to ride Bitcoin’s coattails. It is trying to be the rails for what comes next.\nSnorter\nThe crypto market has always been a breeding ground for experimentation, but few projects lean into that reality as deliberately as Snorter. It is a Telegram-native bot that runs on AI logic, turning real-time chat activity into an actionable layer for trading and research. That may sound technical, but its utility is straightforward: it is a plug-and-play engine for information efficiency inside Telegram, a platform already central to crypto community activity.\nWhat makes Snorter feel unusually well-timed is how it intersects with a broader market that is starting to move again. As ETFs bring capital back into the space, information speed becomes more valuable.\nBeing first to a narrative, first to volume, or even first to sudden token movement can be the difference between 20 percent upside and 200 percent. Snorter enables this through microsecond-level alerts, AI-generated call summaries, whale transaction monitors, and sentiment sweeps, all within the app that people are already using.\nThere is also something deeper happening. As altcoins start to heat up again, the ability to analyze token-specific momentum without flipping between ten different dashboards is not just convenient, it is competitive. Snorter strips away noise and makes opportunity feel visible.\nIn a sense, Snorter feels like a response to how cluttered and fragmented crypto has become. Instead of building another analytics terminal, it embeds intelligence directly into the places traders already live. For a cycle that is beginning to demand more agility, that is exactly where utility belongs.\nSUBBD\nSUBBD is not trying to reinvent the creator economy. It is attempting to repair it. This is a platform where content creators; not advertisers, not platforms or algorithms are the actual axis of value. At a glance, it may look like just another decentralized content network, but its mechanics suggest otherwise. On SUBBD, influence is not farmed. It is staked, backed, and sustained by a model where creators are partners in protocol growth, not just passengers.\nThe relevance of SUBBD in this current market climate is not abstract. With ETF-driven inflows reshaping investor confidence, crypto users are beginning to look beyond coins and into ecosystems. SUBBD offers one of the few clear examples where user-generated value becomes protocol-level currency. The more creators produce, the more the protocol expands. That is not a metaphor. It is how the system is designed.\nThere is also real traction being built. Creator DAOs are starting to form, allowing groups of influencers or educators to launch tokenized portfolios based on collective visibility. These are not performance gimmicks. They are functional economies.\nAs attention begins to drift away from the majors and into altcoin stories, platforms like SUBBD become more than just use cases. They become reflections of what this cycle could reward not just fast money, but durable networks with real participant loops. It is one thing to watch crypto markets rise. It is another to watch communities rise alongside them. SUBBD, quietly and precisely, is built for that purpose.\nBest Wallet Token\nSome wallets exist purely as storage. Best Wallet is the opposite. It functions as a digital command center not just holding assets but shaping how users interact with the broader Web3 universe. The Best Wallet Token powers that ecosystem, threading through layers of access, rewards, governance, and embedded functionality.\nWhat makes this more than just another tokenized app is how deliberately it has been built. Rather than overextending into buzzwords, Best Wallet focuses on core principles: speed, clarity, and control. It compresses the chaos of DeFi, NFTs, token swaps, and staking into a format that actually feels navigable. The interface is clean. The UX choices are intentional. And the token is not just ornamental; it is embedded into the platform’s DNA.\nWith ETF inflows signaling a new wave of institutional validation, a rising number of everyday users are re-entering the market. These are not developers or deep technical users. They are people who need intuitive gateways that do not compromise on power. Best Wallet fits that moment with precision.\n🔥 Over $13M Raised and Counting! 🔥\n— Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025\nBest Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:\n✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app\n✅ Buy and bridge across chains in one place\n✅ Full portfolio control, no clutter\nDownload… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v\nHaving raised over 13 million dollars already, what further sets it apart is the modular utility of the token. It is used for fee discounts, early feature access, community decision-making, and vault participation. In a market where tools often feel either overbuilt or underpowered, Best Wallet strikes a rare middle ground.\nAs altcoin appetite builds, infrastructure tokens that enable onboarding, simplify interaction, and reward usage will likely be first in line. Best Wallet Token has positioned itself to be one of those access points; not merely as a layer, but as the welcome mat to the ecosystem itself.\nConclusion\nWith Bitcoin ETF momentum rekindling market optimism, crypto appears to be entering a new expansionary phase. Altcoin sentiment is strengthening, dominance is faltering, and capital is beginning to rotate outward in search of growth. The projects highlighted above each align with this shift in different but complementary ways ranging from infrastructure to innovation, and from utility to accessibility.\nThese are not just tokens riding a trend. They are active participants in reshaping how value is stored, shared, and scaled across the crypto space. In a market preparing for its next leg up, these may very well be the kinds of assets worth watching closely.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

With prices fluctuating and trends shifting rapidly, now may be the perfect time to capitalise on strong opportunities before the next big wave hits. Some coins are already showing signs of momentum, and those paying attention early could benefit the most.\nBlockDAG, Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Solana are gaining attention for all the right reasons. Each offers a unique chance to grow wealth as the market picks up speed. Whether you're new or experienced, these names stand out as some of the best cryptos to buy right now, before prices move out of reach.\n1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Tech-Driven Growth and a $2M Raffle Prize\nBlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly drawing attention for its strong technology base. With a hybrid blockchain framework that integrates DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) technology, it delivers fast, secure, and scalable performance. This advanced setup positions it among the best cryptos to buy, especially as interest grows in projects with real technical depth.\nAlongside its tech appeal, BlockDAG (BDAG) has launched a Summer Raffle offering major prize opportunities. The raffle features three entry levels: Bronze with a $100 deposit, Silver at $200, and Gold at $400. Each tier increases the chances of winning, with the Gold ticket unlocking access to the $2 million USDT grand prize. More entries mean higher chances, making this event a major opportunity for crypto buyers.\nBlockDAG is currently in Batch 29 of its presale, with over 23.6 billion coins sold and $333 million raised so far. The current price of $0.0016 is locked until August 11, offering a projected 3,025% ROI at the launch price of $0.05. With strong momentum and a high-stakes raffle underway, the potential for long-term gains continues to grow.\n2. Ethereum (ETH): A Market Staple That Moves with the Cycle\nEthereum often follows Bitcoin during market dips, which can give buyers a chance to grab it at lower prices. With its central role in powering Web3, DeFi, and NFTs, ETH stays relevant even when the market cools down. Major platforms like Decentraland and Axie Infinity run on Ethereum, showing that it’s not just another coin; it’s a key player in real blockchain use.\nThe shift to proof-of-stake made Ethereum more energy-efficient, drawing attention from bigger financial players. Though network fees can still be high, future upgrades aim to improve that. Buying during downturns allows users to enter at a discount before the next upswing. For anyone looking to add something solid to their portfolio, Ethereum remains one of the best cryptos to buy, backed by actual usage and long-term development.\n3. Binance Coin (BNB): A Utility-Backed Coin with Built-In Demand\nBNB powers the entire Binance ecosystem, offering benefits like lower trading fees and fueling DeFi applications. This built-in utility helps it stay in demand, even during market corrections. Compared to other altcoins, BNB tends to bounce back faster, as seen after the 2021-22 crash, where it recovered in about half the time it took Bitcoin.\nWhile many altcoins dropped over 90% from their highs, BNB held stronger with a smaller 45% dip by April 2025. Even during a rough mid-year phase, the BNB Chain saw user growth despite a market cap drop. Binance’s regular token burns also help by reducing the supply over time. This consistent activity gives BNB staying power, making it one of the best cryptos to buy for those looking at coins with both utility and resilience.\n4. Solana (SOL): A Fast Mover with Real-World Use and Recovery Strength\nSolana dropped hard during the FTX crash but then made a huge recovery, rising over 2,000% in under two years. That bounce wasn’t just luck; it showed that the network had a strong base of developers and real users. Solana now ranks among the top coins and brings in over $50 million in dApp revenue, proving its value through action.\nThe platform handles fast transactions with nearly zero fees, making it useful for DeFi, gaming, and NFTs. Developer events and upgrades continue to roll out, showing the team’s long-term focus. With big names like Franklin Templeton showing interest, SOL’s growing reputation makes it one of the best cryptos to buy, especially during market dips when prices are more accessible.\nSmart Choices Today Could Shape Big Gains Tomorrow\nIt’s important to have a clear idea of which crypto holds more potential and could boost wealth in the coming years. Let’s start with a quick comparison between the above coins. Ethereum remains a key pillar in the crypto space, with strong developer activity and ongoing upgrades. Binance Coin shows steady resilience and daily utility, keeping it relevant even in shaky markets. Solana, after bouncing back from its past lows, continues to grow with real-world use and active development.\nBlockDAG seems a solid option, seeing such a strong tech background and consistent global traction. It has already raised $333 million across 29 presale stages and continues to gain attention. With its large-scale presale and growing community, BlockDAG shows real potential to generate massive wealth in the coming years. Among the best cryptos to buy, it offers a rare mix of early entry, ongoing rewards, and long-term upside.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Three Tips for Finding a Token Launch Worth Joining", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/three-tips-for-finding-a-token-launch-worth-joining", "text": "There’s a lotta tokens out there with more arriving on the market every week. Despite this plentiful supply, demand for securing an allocation to the hottest new projects remains high. And no wonder: pick the right one and you can make serious money, not to mention participating in all the things that token ownership grants you, be it access to the latest DeFi platform or the ability to operate your own AI agents.\nBut with so many new token projects out there – and token launchpads to choose from – identifying the most promising public sales is anything but simple. It’s a task that calls for diligence, meticulous research, and the ability to juggle a host of variables, from the tokenomics of the project in question to the entry criteria enforced by the IDO platform hosting it. If you’re serious about making money, here are three tricks for identifying token launches that have an outsized chance of success.\n1. Choose a Curated IDO Launchpad\nAll launchpads claim to carefully curate the projects they agree to list, but it’s fair to say that some do a better job of this than others. The leading launchpads don’t struggle for dealflow and so can afford to be more selective about the ones they partner with. Smaller IDO platforms, or those focused on smaller ecosystems, such as a single L2 or a niche onchain vertical, don’t have that luxury.\nIt doesn’t automatically follow that you should gravitate towards the most popular IDO launchpads just because they get their pick of the best token sales. Your decision should also be informed by an analysis of how recent projects have performed on these platforms. Moreover, project vetting isn’t merely the responsibility of the launchpad – it’s yours too. In other words, once you’ve found a launchpad you like, conduct your own research into the projects it features to determine which ones seem likeliest to perform well – and which carry too much risk.\n2. Pick a Platform That Offers Refunds\nAs you know, launchpads can’t guarantee that every project they feature will succeed. Even with the best curation and marketing, some projects prove to be a flop. This means there’s a risk that even when you secure access to a token sale you’re interested in, there’s the potential to lose money almost immediately due to the token trading on the secondary market for less than it was sold at via the IDO.\nSome of the more enterprising IDO platforms have addressed this by offering a refund policy which provides a grace period in which to claim your tokens or request your initial money back. While this doesn’t guarantee that you’ll walk away unscathed, it offers a degree of protection and allows you to study the token’s post-IDO performance before deciding whether to claim. As for what happens to the funds you’ve committed to the sale, if you request a refund they should be returned to you in a timely manner. Pick an IDO platform that pledges this and swerve any that use excuses to hold your funds for any longer.\n3. Avoid Subscription Model Launchpads If Possible\nThe vast majority of launchpads rely on some kind of subscription model that is effectively pay to play. If you want to maximize your chances of securing an allocation on these IDO platforms, you need to pay for the privilege, usually by acquiring and staking the native token for a period of time – generally 30 days or more. Of course, you can sell these tokens once they’ve been unstaked, but since everyone else will be doing the same, there’s a good chance you’ll receive less than you paid for the tokens.\nSince the subscription model is virtually ubiquitous, you’ll struggle to avoid this risk altogether – though there is at least one platform out there that doesn’t utilize this system, which we’ll reveal shortly. If you’re unable to avoid having to pay for some sort of subscription or native token to participate, at the very least study the launchpad token before FOMO’ing in just because there’s a hot sale you want access to. Broadly speaking, the more popular the launchpad, both in terms of users and IDOs, the lower the token volatility is likely to be. Especially if the token has greater utility than simply providing IDO access.\nSo What’s the Verdict?\nIn terms of the first tip we covered – quality of curation – there are a few launchpads that stand out. Chief among them is DAO Maker, Poolz Finance, Polkastarter, and Coin Terminal. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but empirically all of these launchpads have a knack for identifying solid projects that have a chance of making the grade. No launchpad can pick constant winners, but these IDO platforms outperform when it comes to quality control.\nWhen it comes to refund-protected launchpads – those that will let you keep your original funds rather than claiming the tokens if the project goes south – there are two candidates that stand out here. Coin Terminal offers a refund policy that allows users to stick or twist with their purchased tokens, and has recently announced a $15,000 lottery for all refundable sales.\nFinally, we get to the third point on our list: launchpads that don’t enforce a subscription model, which is usually administered via a native token that must be purchased. This is the shortest of shortlists, for it numbers just one: Coin Terminal is the only IDO platform to eschew the “pay to play” model, making it the overall winner across all three benchmarks. That’s not to say it’s the only launchpad worth considering or that every decent token sale will flow through it. But the ones that do are likely to be good quality, optionally refundable, and don’t require a token to enter. It’s the closest thing you’ll find to crypto’s holy grail of a fair launch.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The raise attracted significant backing from industry players, including Animoca Brands, ParaFi Capital, and UTXO Management.\nThe capital injection will primarily support an expansion of DigitalX’s Bitcoin holdings, with approximately $12.9 million earmarked for treasury allocation. The remainder will be directed towards operational expenses, working capital, and transaction-related costs.\nParticipants in the placement received shares at A$0.074 (US$0.048) per unit, with an additional incentive of one warrant for every two shares purchased. These warrants, exercisable at A$0.15 (US$0.10), carry an 18-month expiry.\nKey Industry Figures Join Advisory Board\nAlongside the funding, DigitalX has reinforced its leadership team by establishing a strategic advisory board, naming Animoca Brands Executive Chairman Yat Siu and Web3 investor Hervé Larren as initial appointees. The move reflects the company’s ambition to strengthen its strategic position within the digital asset investment space.\nCommenting on his involvement, Siu noted his longstanding association with DigitalX and highlighted the company’s unique position within Australia’s regulatory environment.\nHe stated,\n\"As the only ASX-listed vehicle actively accumulating Bitcoin, DigitalX provides a rare opportunity for investors — including those with retirement portfolios — to gain exposure to Bitcoin via a regulated public market.\"\nBitcoin as a Strategic Foundation\nDigitalX’s latest capital raise marks a pivotal shift, underscoring Bitcoin’s continued prominence in its long-term strategy. In its announcement, the company stated,\n“This capital raise marks a pivotal moment for the company, reflecting a renewed emphasis on Bitcoin as the ongoing foundation of DigitalX's digital asset strategy.”\nSiu, a vocal advocate for Bitcoin’s role in digital asset portfolios, reiterated that holding Bitcoin serves as both a hedge and an entry point into the broader Web3 economy.\nHe added,\n“Once you have some Bitcoin, directly or indirectly, you begin expanding into other tokens and on-chain assets.”\nBitcoin on Corporate Balance Sheets: A Growing Trend\nThe move by DigitalX follows a rising trend of publicly listed firms incorporating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries. The strategy gained widespread attention when MicroStrategy initiated large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions in 2020, financed largely through convertible debt offerings, followed by Japan’s Metaplanet, which has positioned itself as \"Asia's MicroStrategy,\" with Bitcoin purchases funded by both equity and planned debt raises.\nWhile the strategy has its skeptics, Siu emphasized that the seriousness of such moves ultimately depends on whether companies are committing to the long term or simply capitalizing on market sentiment.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

At just $0.005, the token’s early pricing, paired with a clear real-world use case, has caught the attention of analysts and investors looking ahead to the next bull cycle.\nWith strong demand already pushing its presale past the $1.30 million mark, many are asking if the $OZ token could be the next big crypto breakout. Ozak AI is backed by infrastructure, technology, timing, and tokenomics that solve real problems—not just hype.\nWhy the $OZ Token Is Getting Serious Attention\nThe $OZ token serves as the official token of the Ozak AI platform, and it is not a copycat meme project or a shitcoin. It offers tools designed to help analysts, traders, and institutions get real-time market insights. Founded on advanced tools powered by AI Model training, the protocol’s Prediction Agents (PAs) allow users to build custom AI models for specified trade strategies or sectors.\nAlong with OSN (Ozak Stream Network) and Ozak Data Vaults, the project provides speed, security, and privacy—features crucial to data users today. That creates systems that are functional instead of just offering words.\nEarly Trust in Project Direction Fuels Ozak AI Presale Momentum\nCurrently, the project has raised over $1.30 million towards the presale boosted by confidence in the early stages of development, which suggests some early promise. In its fourth phase of presale at a lucrative price of $0.005, Ozak AI is expected to surge to $0.01 in the next phase. This growth will benefit early adopters while ensuring stable long-term growth.\n10 billion tokens means scarcity will be thrown into play, while Ozak AI aims for structured building based on adoption. The Platform has also announced a mega giveaway of $1 million, for which you just have to participate, engage, refer, and be one of the 100 winners to take the giveaway.\nFeatures of Ozak AI That Set It Apart\nThe platform’s utility makes it stand out in a crowded field. Its core offerings include:\n-\nPrediction Agents for building custom AI models\n-\nEncrypted Data Vaults for private data storage\n-\nLayer 2 compatibility for faster performance\nEach feature brings a layer of usability that meme coins or one-off projects simply lack.\nIs $1 a Realistic Target?\nOzak AI has achieved a more reliable route to getting to $1 than most speculative tokens. The token’s technology and its associated funding streams are gaining traction, as well as their relevance to the AI and crypto worlds. While nothing is certain, the combination of strong fundamentals paired with early momentum makes things more favorable going into 2025.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe next wave of crypto winners may emerge from projects that go beyond merely trying to capture attention and offer genuine utility. Ozak AI appears to be one such project. In the context of OZ token's role in AI's integration with finance and crypto, holding onto it seems reasonable.\nFor more information about Ozak AI, visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "6 Best Crypto Presales to Buy in July 2025", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/6-best-crypto-presales-to-buy-in-july-2025", "text": "The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with excitement, and many savvy investors are considering investing in presales. These presales often offer lower prices and significant growth potential, but they also come with risks, so doing your homework is crucial.\nWith Bitcoin staying strong around $107,000 and big players like BlackRock investing billions into crypto, it’s a great time for new and promising projects to shine.\nIn this guide, we’ve picked six of the best crypto presales to check out this month. These projects stand out due to their strong ideas, growing communities, and real potential to grow fast. From Bitcoin Hyper’s plan to scale Bitcoin, to Snorter’s fun Telegram-based trading bot, these tokens could be the next big thing for investors hoping to multiply their returns.\nBest Crypto Presales to Buy Now - Top 6 List\nHere are the top 6 best crypto presales to buy now:\n-\nBitcoin Hyper - The First Bitcoin Layer 2 Chain\n-\nBest Wallet Token - Best Next Gen Wallet Token\n-\nTOKEN6900 - Bold Anti-Corporate Meme Coin Inspired by SPX6900’s Wild Success\n-\nSUBBD - The No.1 AI Agent Creator Platform\n-\nBTC Bull - Bitcoin’s Best Crypto Presale\n-\nSnorter - The Solana Meme Crypto Trading Bot\n6 Top Crypto Presales to Buy in July - Full Reviews\nIn this section, you can read our full reviews for each of the best crypto presales to buy in July 2025:\nBitcoin Hyper - The First Bitcoin Layer 2 Chain\nBitcoin Hyper is a new project that helps make Bitcoin faster and easier to use. It does this by building a second layer (called Layer-2) on top of Bitcoin using Solana’s powerful technology (SVM). This enables super-fast transactions at a cost of as little as $0.01 while also making it possible to utilize Bitcoin in various applications, including DeFi apps, NFT marketplaces, and online payments.\nCrucially, the project supports DeFi applications, NFT marketplaces, and merchant payments, bridging Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed. Its canonical bridge also allows users to lock BTC and mint HYPER tokens, to facilitate seamless DeFi participation. This crypto presales roadmap includes cross-chain interoperability and a mainnet launch by Q4 2025, positioning it as a top contender for investors eyeing Bitcoin’s evolution.\nLaunched in early 2025, this first Bitcoin layer 2 chain project has already raised over $2 million in its presale, and its token, called $HYPER, is currently priced at $0.012175 per token. For those who want to jump on the bandwagon, it can be bought in exchange for ETH, USDT, or BNB; it can also be bought directly through a debit or credit card. Early investors interested in this crypto can stake their tokens to earn high rewards of over 300% APY.\nThese features convinced many analysts and crypto investors that Bitcoin Hyper might be the next 100x crypto.\nTake note that Bitcoin Hyper’s smart contracts have been audited, and most of the token supply is being sold during the presale, which adds to its credibility. With big companies like BlackRock now investing in Bitcoin, a project like Bitcoin Hyper, which is focused on improving Bitcoin’s speed and usefulness, could be one of the best crypto presales to invest in this month.\nBest Wallet Token - Best Next Gen Wallet Token\nBest Wallet Token ($BEST) is the token behind Best Wallet, a non-custodial Web3 wallet that already has millions of users. This real utility non-custodial crypto wallet is designed to be secure, easy to use, and supports over 60 blockchains. With this wallet, users can swap tokens, bridge assets between chains, and even use a privacy mode to hide their private keys. The project is focused on privacy, and you don’t need to do any KYC (know your customer checks) to use it.\nPresently, $BEST is priced at just $0.025295 in its fifth presale stage, and it has already raised over $13.7 million, which makes it among the top crypto presales of the year. $BEST token holders get real benefits, like lower trading fees, staking rewards, early access to new token presales, and a say in the project’s future through voting. A beta version of the app is expected to launch after it lists on major exchanges like MEXC.\nThe team behind Best Wallet has worked at top tech companies, and the project has been audited by CertiK, making it more trustworthy. It’s also certified by WalletConnect, which adds to its credibility. Looking ahead, if Best Wallet delivers its promised features on time, $BEST could be a great long-term investment, especially for mobile users, making it one of the best crypto presales to buy now.\nTOKEN6900 - Bold Anti-Corporate Meme Coin Inspired by SPX6900’s Wild Success\nTOKEN6900 ($T6900) is a fun, meme-based new crypto project. $T6900 was inspired by the wild success of SPX6900 in 2024, and it was built to make fun of traditional finance and big corporations. This crypto project has no serious roadmap or complicated plan, just community hype, humor, and a strong meme culture. The project has already raised over $207,000 in its presale, with tokens selling for $0.006475. 80% of the total supply is available to the public, and the hard cap is set at $5 million.\nUnlike utility-driven projects, TOKEN6900 leans into “vibe liquidity,” offering no roadmap but audited contracts and a developer’s 6,900-token “moonbag” which will be locked for five years to build trust. There’s also a staking feature called the “Brain Rot Vault” that offers a high percentage of over 200% APY, and over 20.7 million tokens have already been staked.\nInvestors can purchase $T6900 using ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, or directly through credit cards via the Best Wallet platform, with tokens distributed post-presale. While its transparency and staking rewards are strengths, the absence of real-world use cases means success depends on market sentiment and meme coin trends. So, for investors interested in high-risk, high-reward cryptos, TOKEN6900 is certainly a good investment choice to buy in July 2025.\nSUBBD - The No.1 AI Agent Creator Platform\nSUBBD ($SUBBD) is an AI-powered Web3 platform that helps content creators use AI to make and share content like voice notes, videos, and personal profiles. Over 3,500 creators with a combined audience of 310 million people are already involved and using the platform. The project is built to help creators connect more deeply with their fans and earn rewards for doing so. Its token, $SUBBD, powers the platform and is now available through an ongoing presale at a discounted price of $0.05585 per token. To date, the project has raised over $754,000.\nHolders of the $SUBBD token get access to special perks like staking rewards (20% APY), early access to new features, and platform discounts. To help keep the token price steady, SUBBD uses anti-dumping measures such as gradual token releases. The project also plans to fully launch in Q3 2025 and is working with well-known creators to grow its reach. The team includes people with experience at top companies like OpenAI and Google, which helps build trust.\nOverall, SUBBD stands out because it solves a real problem in the creator space and has a huge potential audience. However, building all of its AI tools might take time. If you’re thinking about investing, it’s a good idea to read their whitepaper and follow SUBBD on Telegram and X (Twitter) for updates on recent developments, and visit the official SUBBD page below.\nBTC Bull - Bitcoin’s Best Crypto Presale\nBTC Bull provides investors with a token that offers leveraged exposure to Bitcoin's price movements, aiming to amplify gains during bullish trends. Essentially, BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is a meme token designed to follow Bitcoin’s price movements, giving investors an excellent way to take advantage of the BTC bullish uptrend. It rewards holders with real Bitcoin airdrops when Bitcoin reaches big milestones like $150K, $200K, and $250K.\nThe token is currently in its final presale stage, having raised over $8.3 million to date. One $BTCBULL is currently priced at $0.002585 per token, and it can be bought in exchange for crypto or through a bank card on the BTC Bull official page. Much like Bitcoin, the total supply is 21 billion tokens, and to keep the token valuable, the team plans to burn 15% of the supply when Bitcoin hits $125K, $175K, and $225K.\nThe token is built on Ethereum (ERC-20), so it works with most wallets and DeFi platforms. You can also earn a passive income of over 50% APY through staking. This crypto presale, whose success heavily depends on Bitcoin’s performance, ends on July 7, 2025, at 2 PM UTC. Also, BTC Bull’s smart contracts have been audited, and its token plan is clear, which helps reduce the risk of scam, making it an excellent crypto to buy right now\nSnorter - The Solana Meme Crypto Trading Bot\nSnorter Token powers a Telegram-native bot for sniping meme coins, with multi-chain support and high staking rewards. This exciting crypto project fuels a Telegram-based trading bot for sniping meme coins on Solana and Ethereum, with plans to expand to BNB, Polygon, and Base. The token is currently priced at $0.0973 in its presale, and the team has already raised over $1.4 million so far.\nSnorter offers cool features like automated sniping, a tool that detects rug pulls with 85% success (based on beta testing), and low trading fees of just 0.85%. Stakers can earn over 700% APY, and token holders get unlimited snipes plus voting power on future updates. As a result, price expectations for this token are huge, with some analysts predicting a significant increase by the end of the year.\nWith over 5,000 users on Telegram and exchange listings planned after the bot launches in Q3 2025, Snorter aims to become a top tool for meme coin traders, making it one of the best crypto presales to consider in July 2025.\nHow Can You Buy a Crypto Presale?\nHere’s a step-by-step procedure on how you can buy a crypto presale;\n1. Research: Start by visiting the project’s official website and then proceed to read the whitepaper to understand what the project is about, its goals, token supply, and how it plans to grow. You should also check their social media, like X (Twitter) and Telegram, to see what the community is saying and how active the team is.\n2. Set Up a Wallet: You’ll need a crypto wallet that works with the blockchain the project is built on. For example, use MetaMask for Ethereum-based tokens like $BTCBULL, or Phantom for Solana-based tokens like $HYPER. Some projects also support Best Wallet, particularly for presales that utilize multiple payment options.\n3. Fund Your Wallet: Buy the cryptocurrency you’ll need to invest using popular cryptos like ETH, BNB, SOL, USDT, or USDC. You can buy crypto on trusted exchanges like Coinbase or Binance, or even use a credit or debit card directly through some presale sites.\n4. Connect and Purchase: Connect your wallet to the presale platform and follow the instructions to buy tokens.\n5. Confirm and Secure Tokens: After you approve the transaction, you may need to wait for the tokens to be delivered because some projects send them after the presale ends. Furthermore, always keep your wallet’s recovery phrase (seed phrase) safe and never share it with anyone. This is because this phrase gives full access to your wallet, so store it offline in a secure place.\nWhat Should You Check Before Investing in a Crypto Presale\nThe following are some of the things you should check before investing in a crypto presale;\nWhitepaper\nThe whitepaper is like the project’s blueprint. It explains what the project is trying to do, how it works, how the token will be used, and what the future plans are. So, one of the first things you should do before investing in a crypto presale is to read the project’s white paper.\nTeam Credibility\nAnother thing you should check/do before investing in a crypto presale is to verify the team’s experience via LinkedIn or public profiles. For example, SUBBD’s team includes people with backgrounds at OpenAI and Google, which adds trust to the project. On the other hand, if the team is anonymous, be extra cautious and avoid investing.\nSmart Contract Audits\nEnsure contracts are audited by firms like CertiK or Hacken, as seen with BTC Bull and Snorter, to reduce rug-pull risks.\nCommunity Engagement\nA strong, active community is a good sign. So, before you invest, look at how many people are following the project on X (Twitter), Telegram, or Discord.\nTokenomics and Vesting\nTokenomics means how the tokens are created, distributed, and used. Look at how many tokens will exist, who gets them, and how they’re released over time before you invest in any crypto presale.\nMarket Fit and Utility\nIs the project actually useful, or just hype? Bitcoin Hyper solves Bitcoin’s speed issues, and SUBBD helps content creators use AI. These real-world uses give the project more staying power compared to purely speculative meme coins.\nLook at the Presale’s Performance\nCheck how much money the project has raised and how much attention it’s getting online. A presale that raises millions and builds buzz on social media often shows strong investor interest. You can also follow updates on sites like CoinMarketCap, ICOBench, or crypto news platforms.\nFinal Word\nIn summary, crypto presales in July 2025 offer a diverse mix of exciting new projects, catering to investors with varying interests. Whether you’re interested in serious utility projects like Bitcoin Hyper and SUBBD or high-risk, high-reward meme tokens like TOKEN6900 and BTC Bull, there’s something for every type of investor. However, it’s essential to remember that presales also come with risks, as prices can fluctuate rapidly, and not all projects will ultimately succeed.\nThat’s why doing your own research is very important. Always read the whitepaper, check if the smart contracts are audited, and look at how active the community is. If you take time to understand the project and only invest what you can afford to lose, presales can be a great way to get in early and see big rewards.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Investors brace for potential impacts on prices. What does this mean for Pi and its holders? This article explores the outlook and identifies other tokens poised for growth amidst the impending shake-up.\nThis analysis is supported by Outset PR, a performance-first communications partner for crypto projects, using media intelligence, narrative strategy, and traffic-driving outreach to boost attention where it counts.\nMassive PI Token Unlock & Supply Surge\nStarting July 4, Pi Network began releasing approximately 304.7 million PI tokens over a 30-day period, with the largest single-day unlock of 19.39 million tokens occurring on the first day . This influx represents the highest monthly unlock. Such a significant increase in circulating supply can lead to heightened selling pressure, especially if demand doesn't match the new supply.\nSource: piscan\nPi Network Price Struggles, but Growth Potential Remains\nSource: tradingview\nThe current price of Pi Network hovers between a low forty cents and just over fifty cents. It faces resistance at just over fifty-five cents, with stronger resistance anticipated around sixty-five cents. Support is around thirty-nine cents, with a firmer floor nearby at thirty cents. Despite a recent 13% dip in one week and a drop of nearly 35% over the past six months, the coin's potential remains.\nShould it break resistance, it could rise by over a quarter from current levels. With low momentum and a 10-day average slightly below its 100-day figure, Pi needs significant movement to entice investors and initiate a strong upward trajectory.\nOutset PR Crafts Communications Like a Workshop, Powered by Data\nFounded by renowned crypto PR expert Mike Ermolaev, Outset PR operates like a hands-on workshop, building every campaign with market fit in mind.\nInstead of offering random placements or templated packages, Outset PR carefully weaves a client’s story into the market context, showcasing what organic PR looks like:\n-\nMedia outlets are selected based on metrics like discoverability, domain authority, conversion rates, and viral potential\n-\nPitches are tailored to fit each platform’s voice and audience\n-\nTiming is mapped to let the story unfold naturally and build trust organically\nOutset PR occupies a unique niche as the only data-driven agency with a boutique-level approach.

Designed for early-stage projects, these campaigns boost search visibility by securing coverage in media that trigger syndication across major crypto newsfeeds — laying the groundwork for scalable or highly targeted PR efforts.\nLet Outset PR Tell Your Story With Verifiable Impact\nConclusion\nAs Pi Network navigates its largest token unlock to date, investors are left to weigh its long-term vision against short-term volatility. The surge of over 300 million PI tokens into circulation this July introduces undeniable pressure on price, and the early signs suggest a cautious road ahead.\nIn a market shaped by rapid shifts and sentiment-driven trading, positioning and perception can matter as much as product. That’s where Outset PR proves invaluable. For crypto projects poised to rise during turbulent market phases, strategic, data-backed communications can define who breaks out and who fades into the noise.\nYou can find more information about Outset PR here:\nWebsite: outsetpr.io\nTelegram: t.me/outsetpr\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Ripple CEO to Testify Before U.S. Senate Ahead of Crypto Week", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/ripple-ceo-to-testify-before-us-senate-ahead-of-crypto-week", "text": "Brad Garlinghouse will address the Senate Banking Committee this week, urging lawmakers to expedite crypto market structure reforms as legislative efforts intensify in Washington.\nRipple Chief Set to Testify on Crypto Policy\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has confirmed that he will testify before the United States Senate Banking Committee this Wednesday, marking a pivotal moment for the digital asset industry as lawmakers weigh critical market structure reforms. His appearance comes ahead of the House of Representatives’ highly anticipated ‘Crypto Week’ set for next week, with momentum building around digital asset regulation in Washington.\nTaking to the social media platform X, Garlinghouse stated,\n“I am honored to be invited to testify in front of the Senate Banking Committee this Wednesday on the need for passing crypto market structure legislation.”\nSenate Hearing to Focus on Digital Asset Markets\nThe hearing, titled “From Wall Street to Web3: Building Tomorrow’s Digital Asset Markets,” will be led by Senate Banking Committee GOP Chairman Tim Scott, alongside Senators Cynthia Lummis and Ruben Gallego, who head the Subcommittee for Digital Assets. The session will examine proposed legislation aimed at modernizing the regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States.\nGarlinghouse extended his appreciation to the committee, remarking,\n“Your leadership – both with this hearing and over the years in championing the crypto industry – has been critical to getting us to this important moment.”\nThe hearing follows the recent release of draft rules by the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets. These principles are intended to guide discussions with industry stakeholders, with Garlinghouse’s testimony expected to be a central component of those deliberations.\nKey Industry Voices Join Senate Panel\nGarlinghouse won’t be the only notable figure addressing the committee. Joining him will be Summer Mersinger of the Blockchain Association, Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin, and Paradigm researcher Dan Robinson. Together, they will present the industry’s concerns over fragmented and ambiguous regulations that, according to advocates, hinder U.S. innovation and weaken its competitive position in the global digital asset market.\nRobinson is anticipated to provide technical insight into how current regulatory uncertainties impact blockchain development and the broader Web3 ecosystem.\nThe Senate hearing will also consider key legislative proposals, including the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, designed to define regulatory responsibilities across federal agencies and establish clear standards for digital asset classification and oversight. Lawmakers aim to gather feedback from industry leaders before finalizing a market structure bill for the sector.\nRipple’s Legal Troubles Linger\nFor Ripple, the timing is significant. The company is working with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to settle their years-long legal dispute. Therefore, progress on Capitol Hill could bolster Ripple’s long-term prospects. A clearer legal framework would not only provide regulatory certainty for Ripple’s operations but also reshape how federal agencies oversee the digital asset industry at large.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "$ZEUS Token Listed on KuCoin on July 7, 2025 — Are You In Yet?", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/zeus-token-listed-on-kucoin-on-july-7-2025-are-you-in-yet", "text": "We're thrilled to announce that Pepe's Dog ($ZEUS) was listed on KuCoin on July 7, 2025, at 10:00 UTC. Trading began under the trading pair ZEUSCC8/USDT on KuCoin's spot trading platform. This is the first listing of $ZEUS, the official memecoin project of Pepe's Dog, on a centralized exchange.ze\nThe on-chain ticker name as defined in the smart contract is ZEUS, with contract address https://etherscan.io/address/0x0f7dC5D02CC1E1f5Ee47854d534D332A1081cCC8. However, KuCoin is using ZEUSCC8 due to a ticker duplicate issue.\nProject overview\nZeus is a key character in Matt Furie's Boy's Club comics, the dog of the now-ubiquitous Pepe the Frog. The memecoin project's mission is to allow community members to experience the roots of meme culture. As you can see, $ZEUS' smart contract ends in CC8 in a nod to CZ's dog and other memecoin legends, tokens that went viral due to the grassroots, community-first nature of their launch.\nNot only is $ZEUS deeply rooted in meme culture, but it also enjoys the support of ND Haus, the original artist of Zeus the Dog, Jon \"Jagged\" Eyrick, who owns the actual dog, and Furie himself. The Zeus project has officially secured IP rights and trademark protection over the $ZEUS name and visual identity, a major milestone in ensuring a legally compliant foundation.\nThe KuCoin listing is the most recent in a series of achievements that comprise the token's roadmap. The token itself launched without venture capital or insiders on May 21, 2025, kicking off with a meme blitz across X and Telegram and listings on DEX tools and trackers.\nThe team obtained the original Zeus NFT and bought the original ND Haus artwork on June 4. A dog charity campaign began on June 16, with proceeds from future merchandise and NFT sales to be donated to dog shelters in Macedonia. Anyone who cares about our abandoned, four-legged, furry, cuddly friends can now support them by buying $ZEUS.\nBenefits of the listing\nThe listing signifies improved liquidity and access to the $ZEUS token, as buying and selling it has now become easier. A wider audience will gain exposure to the token, and the listing is a major milestone in the project's roadmap. Future ones include a merchandise drop by the end of July, including hoodies for us and Zeus-inspired leashes, collars, and plushies for our best friends.\nThe team is commissioning a statue to be sent to Zeus's hometown in Macedonia in August, followed by a comic book and NFT drop and further CEX Listings throughout the third quarter of 2025. ND Haus is collaborating on a limited-edition Zeus comic series featuring origin stories, lore, and adventures alongside her favorite artists. Exclusive NFTs connected to the chapters will be distributed to the first 10,000 holders.\nTokens like $PEPE and $BONK have rallied within a few days of their listing, confirming the view that early access to a newly listed token comes with the possibility of high returns if it gains traction. Zeus' push for more CEX listings, a wide-reaching marketing campaign, and surprise community drops can all increase the token's value. The team will fly community members to meet Zeus IRL and launch a non-profit DAO led by ND Haus to support meme and underground artists by the end of 2025.\nNewly listed tokens come with certain risks, but this is not $ ZEUS' first listing. It's also listed on UniSwap, LBank, and other decentralized exchanges.\nReady to trade? Head to KuCoin and explore the ZEUSCC8 market today!\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Experts Say Ruvi AI (RUVI) Is Your Best Shot At Over 105x This Year", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/missed-early-solanas-sol-rally-experts-say-ruvi-ai-ruvi-is-your-best-shot-at-over-105x-this-year", "text": "If you regretted missing Solana’s (SOL) meteoric rise from an undervalued gem to one of the leaders in blockchain, there’s good news. Analysts are pinpointing Ruvi AI (RUVI) as the next big opportunity for investors looking to ride a wave of exponential growth. With its utility-first approach, stellar presale success, and high ROI potential, Ruvi AI mirrors some of the early dynamics that made Solana a standout. Experts predict this token could deliver over 105x returns this year, making it one of the most sought-after investments in the current bull cycle.\nHere’s why Ruvi AI stands out and why it’s being compared to Solana’s early breakthrough.\nTransparency and Security Backed by Strong Foundations\nThe cryptocurrency market can be a challenging landscape, but Ruvi AI prioritizes trust and security from the outset. It underwent a third-party audit by CyberScope, ensuring that its smart contracts are secure, dependable, and free from vulnerabilities. This proactive measure reassures investors, mitigating concerns about potential risks often associated with new crypto projects.\nAdding to its credibility, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange to guarantee post-presale liquidity, making it seamless for investors to trade their tokens as soon as the presale concludes. These foundational steps demonstrate a clear commitment to safety and accessibility, setting Ruvi AI apart from speculative tokens.\nImpressive Presale Momentum\nRuvi AI has already turned heads with its remarkable presale performance. Here are the highlights so far:\n- $2.2 million raised during the presale.\n- More than 180 million tokens sold, reflecting strong market demand.\n- Over 2,000 holders have joined, signaling growing community confidence.\nPriced at just $0.015 per token in Phase 2, Ruvi AI provides an exceptional opportunity for early adopters. By the time the presale ends, the price will rise to $0.07, nearly a 5x ROI before public listing. Post-listing, analysts project a $1 valuation per token, equating to an incredible 66x ROI. With its structured growth strategy, Ruvi AI’s potential for delivering over 105x returns appears well within reach.\nReal-World Utility Drives Long-Term Value\nUnlike speculative assets, Ruvi AI focuses on solving real-world challenges through practical applications powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. Its scalable solutions cater to high-demand industries such as marketing, entertainment, and finance, ensuring long-term demand for its platform.\nMarketing Revolutionized\nFor marketers, Ruvi AI offers AI-driven tools designed to improve audience targeting, optimize advertising, and significantly enhance ROI. This makes it indispensable for businesses striving for efficiency and effectiveness in their campaigns.\nEmpowering Entertainment Creators\nRuvi AI addresses revenue distribution issues faced by content creators through blockchain-secured payment systems, ensuring fair compensation and transparency. Additionally, AI-enabled audience analytics open up new avenues for creators to engage with their audiences and unlock additional monetization opportunities.\nFinancial Solutions Modernized\nWithin the financial sector, Ruvi AI deploys fraud-detection algorithms and secure payment infrastructures to increase trust and improve operational efficiencies. By reducing the friction in digital transactions, Ruvi AI delivers scalable benefits to individuals and businesses alike.\nThe versatility of Ruvi AI’s applications sets it apart as far more than a catchy ticker, its utility creates real-world demand that sustains the value of the token.\nMaximize Returns With VIP Investment Tiers\nRuvi AI incentivizes early participation with VIP investment tiers designed to boost returns significantly. These tiers cater to various investment levels, offering substantial bonuses to those who capitalize early:\n- VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus):\n- Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus).\n- Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900.\n- Value at $1 per token: $70,000.\n- VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus):\n- Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus).\n- Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680.\n- Value at $1 per token: $224,000.\n- VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus):\n- Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double allocation).\n- Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600.\n- Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000.\nThese structured investment tiers not only provide flexibility but also multiply ROI potential, making Ruvi AI an attractive opportunity for both first-time and seasoned investors.\nWhy Ruvi AI Is the Best Bet for 105x Returns This Year\nWhile Solana burst onto the scene with a groundbreaking approach to scalability, Ruvi AI is making waves with its utility-first platform and impressive early milestones. Priced at just $0.015 per token during the presale, Ruvi AI offers a rare chance for investors to secure a significant stake in what could be the next breakout cryptocurrency.\nWith a secure foundation rooted in transparency, real-world applications, and a path to scalability, Ruvi AI is engineered for growth.

{"title": "ChatGPT Will Place Ethereum (ETH) at $18,500 and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) at $3 if Bitcoin (BTC) Soars to $300,000: How possible is this?", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/chatgpt-will-place-ethereum-eth-at-18500-and-little-pepe-lilpepe-at-3-if-bitcoin-btc-soars-to-300000-how-possible-is-this", "text": "In a new projection shaking up digital asset discussions, ChatGPT has outlined a scenario where Ethereum (ETH) reaches $18,500 and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) hits $3—if Bitcoin (BTC) rises to $300,000. This forecast ties together market momentum, investor psychology, and broader adoption patterns within the cryptocurrency space. As Bitcoin continues to be the dominant force in the market, speculation grows regarding its long-term price potential. One prediction suggests that a major Bitcoin rally could ignite large-cap and meme-based altcoins alike.\nEthereum's Potential at $18,500: Market Factors and Network Strength\nEthereum remains one of the most widely adopted innovative contract platforms. Its position as the leading Layer 1 network for decentralized applications, NFTs, and DeFi supports ongoing demand for ETH. If Bitcoin were to climb to $300,000, market analysts expect Ethereum to follow closely due to historical correlations and investor rotations from Bitcoin profits into altcoins.\nEthereum’s ecosystem strength lies in its network effect. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) supports a broad range of applications across finance, gaming, and social platforms. Upgrades like the Merge and ongoing scalability improvements through Layer 2 solutions continue to enhance its efficiency. If institutional investment increases alongside a Bitcoin surge, ETH could benefit from capital inflows and renewed developer interest.\nLittle Pepe's $3 Projection: Meme Utility Meets Layer 2 Technology\nThe forecast also placed the meme-inspired token, Little Pepe (LILPEPE), at $3, presenting a dramatic rise from its current presale value of $0.0013. Little Pepe distinguishes itself from other meme coins by building on an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 network that prioritizes speed and low fees. Its $LILPEPE token functions as a utility asset, supporting staking, transaction fees, and ecosystem activity.\nFor LILPEPE to reach $3, several market conditions must align. One critical factor would be a surge in user adoption fueled by community growth, influencer promotion, and viral interest across social media. Moreover, if Layer 2 usage expands in applications like gaming and microtransactions, demand for efficient platforms like Little Pepe could rise substantially.\nCurrently in Stage 4 of its presale, Little Pepe has already raised over $3.41 million by selling over 2.93 billion tokens, signaling strong investor confidence. Stage 1 launched on June 10 at a price of $0.001 per token and saw 500 million tokens sold, raising $500,000 within just 72 hours. Stage 2 followed with tokens priced at $0.0011, selling 1.167 billion tokens and raising $1.325 million ahead of schedule.\nThe momentum carried into Stage 3, where tokens were offered at $0.0012—over 2 billion tokens were sold, bringing total funds raised to more than $2.5 million. Now in Stage 4 at $0.0013, Little Pepe is closing in on its $4.475 million presale hard cap. The meme coin also allows purchases through Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and card payments. This accessibility, along with its focus on zero taxes and high transaction speeds, adds to its appeal as a scalable and user-friendly alternative in the meme coin space.\nConditions Required for a $300,000 Bitcoin and Its Impact on Altcoins\nThe prediction centers on Bitcoin reaching $300,000, a level far above its current price. To get such a target, global macroeconomic conditions would need to favor risk assets. This scenario may include lower interest rates, increased inflation hedging, or rising institutional investment in digital assets. Capital inflows could also be achieved by spot Bitcoin ETFs, growth in corporate holdings, and the embrace of sovereign funds.\nIn the past, altcoins followed the rise of Bitcoin when Bitcoin was experiencing a rally. This trend is referred to as altcoin season, with retail and institutional investors spreading investments across the board and generally gaining huge appreciation in the prices of smaller investments. In this regard, Ethereum and LILPEPE can also gain more attention, particularly if their utility and ecosystems are extended further.\nThe movement of Bitcoin is usually a signal in the market. If the $300,000 target comes true, the total sum of all the crypto market caps would be higher than $10 trillion. In this environment, Ethereum can gain a larger share of this market, and well-utilized meme coins such as LILPEPE can do better because of speculative and viral marketing.\nConclusion\nEthereum's speculations at 18500 and Little Pepe's at three are based on the most optimistic view of Bitcoin. Although a hypothetical situation, it shows the level of interconnectedness that cryptocurrency markets find themselves in. When Bitcoin goes to new highs, Ethereum and tokens based on memes that have actual use might gain tremendously. Investors and analysts will still pay attention to the events occurring in macroeconomics, technological innovation (in blockchain), and regulatory policy to determine how probable a future it may be.\nFor More Details About Little PEPE, Visit The Below Link:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

However, a new contender, Ruvi AI (RUVI), is rapidly gaining attention among crypto enthusiasts and market analysts. With its innovative blend of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI), Ruvi AI not only offers practical utilities across diverse industries but also brings unparalleled transparency to investors.\nAnalysts predict Ruvi AI’s token could reach $1 post-listing, representing a 66x return for investors, potentially outshining Avalanche’s performance this year. Here’s a closer look at why Ruvi AI is emerging as a strong challenger.\nTransparent Foundations Boost Trust\nRuvi AI has earned investor confidence by prioritizing transparency and security. A critical step in this effort was a third-party audit by CyberScope, a recognized leader in blockchain security. The audit confirmed that Ruvi AI’s smart contracts are secure, tamper-free, and dependable, addressing concerns about the potential vulnerabilities that often accompany new projects.\nAdding further legitimacy, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange, ensuring liquidity post-presale. This partnership guarantees that investors can trade their tokens seamlessly on major platforms once the presale concludes, eliminating liquidity risks that are all too common in early-stage cryptocurrencies.\nCombined, these measures underpin Ruvi AI’s dedication to protecting its investors, a crucial factor in its rapid rise to prominence.\nExplosive Momentum During the Presale\nThe numbers from Ruvi AI’s presale phase speak volumes about the demand for this project:\n- $2.2 million raised, indicative of strong backing and market interest.\n- Over 180 million tokens sold, showcasing investor enthusiasm.\n- A community of 2,000+ holders, reflecting growing confidence in the project.\nCurrently in Phase 2, Ruvi AI tokens are available for just $0.015 each, offering a ground-floor opportunity for investors. Upon completion of the presale, token prices are set to rise to $0.07, delivering an almost 5x ROI for early buyers. Post-listing, analysts expect Ruvi AI’s valuation to soar to $1 per token, equating to an extraordinary 66x return, enough to rival or surpass Avalanche’s year-to-date prediction.\nSolving Real-World Problems with Blockchain and AI\nRuvi AI separates itself from speculative tokens by addressing real-world challenges through its innovative use of blockchain and AI. Its scalable applications span multiple sectors, ensuring that its utility extends far beyond its presale allure.\nSmarter Marketing Solutions\nWith Ruvi AI’s AI-powered marketing tools, businesses can fine-tune audience targeting, minimize ad spending inefficiencies, and maximize their ROI. These solutions are indispensable in the competitive landscape of digital marketing, offering companies the tools needed to thrive in a data-driven environment.\nRevolutionizing the Entertainment Industry\nFor entertainers and creators, Ruvi AI provides blockchain-secured payment platforms, ensuring fair compensation and transparency. Additionally, AI-driven audience insights allow creators to engage audiences more effectively and uncover new revenue streams, making their efforts more sustainable and profitable.\nTransforming Financial Services\nRuvi AI is making waves in fintech by integrating fraud detection systems and secure payment solutions. These innovations build trust in digital transactions, improve efficiency, and reduce risks, making Ruvi AI an attractive technology partner for businesses operating in financial services.\nBy tackling real-world problems across these industries, Ruvi AI ensures demand for its token will remain strong long after the presale phase is over.\nMaximizing Returns Through VIP Investment Tiers\nRuvi AI has created several VIP investment tiers, rewarding presale participants with substantial token bonuses. These structured tiers cater to both small-scale and large-scale investors, aligning with Ruvi AI’s focus on inclusivity and accessibility.\n- VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus):\n- Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus).\n- Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900.\n- Value at $1 per token: $70,000.\n- VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus):\n- Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus).\n- Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680.\n- Value at $1 per token: $224,000.\n- VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus):\n- Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double allocation).\n- Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600.\n- Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000.\nThese tiers allow investors to amplify their potential returns significantly, providing a strong incentive to get involved early.\nIs Ruvi AI Set to Outshine Avalanche’s Predictions?\nAvalanche (AVAX), with its innovative blockchain capabilities, maintains a strong presence in the crypto space. However, its growth no longer mirrors the explosive momentum of its early years. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, is emerging as a dynamic alternative with utility-driven applications, an audited foundation, and astronomical growth potential.\nWith a projected post-listing price of $1 per token and an accessible Phase 2 price of just $0.015, Ruvi AI offers unmatched ROI potential for investors ready to act now.

Many traders are now looking at alternative coins for better opportunities. With the spotlight shifting, certain altcoins could be on the verge of significant breakouts.\nLUNC, XLM, SEI, and Codename:Pepe crypto are catching the attention of investors. These coins and projects are set to show robust growth in the coming months. Codename:Pepe crypto, in particular, is harnessing AI to deliver impressive gains, standing out in the meme coin sphere. Investors are keenly watching to see how these assets perform.\nCodename:Pepe (AGNT) Gains Traction After Listing and Supply Burn, Eyes $2.1 Milestone\nCodename:Pepe ($AGNT) has recently made its entrance on Uniswap, opening the floodgates for global trading — and it didn’t come quietly.\nIn a dramatic power move, Codename:Pepe has burned a significant portion of the tokens to tighten the supply and send a clear message: this project plays to win.\n$AGNT token burns mean reducing the supply and boosting scarcity, which may fuel a price surge.\nSource: Codename:Pepe X account\nIf you missed the chance to grab $AGNT at a fraction of a cent during the presale, don’t worry — there’s still time to get in at a bargain price before it targets its next milestone: $2.\nThe team is rallying the community to drive momentum and push the price higher, aligning everyone around a shared goal — collective growth through smart, unified action.\nSource: Codename:Pepe Telegram account\nThe AGNT Outlook: Bullish with AI Fuel\nAnalysts are paying attention — and some are projecting a 30,000% gain before the end of 2025.\nHere’s why:\n-\nAI-Driven Strategy: AGENT A.I. will scan social media and blockchain data to detect trending meme coins before they explode.\n-\nAutomated Trading: The AI engine will be able to execute real-time trades, turning noise into signals and volatility into opportunity.\n-\nDAO Utility: Token holders will gain exclusive access to insider analytics and community voting through the AGNT DAO.\nMomentum is building: the presale sold out early. Now with liquidity, community energy, and a shrinking supply, AGNT is poised to move.\nCodename:Pepe fuses cutting-edge AI with meme market psychology, and it’s already showing signs of breakout potential. With the supply burn and Uniswap launch, AGNT is now positioned to lead the next wave of meme coin dominance.\nPrice Is Rising. Supply Is Shrinking. Buy $AGNT Now\nTerra Classic's Resurgence: Is LUNC Set for a 2025 Comeback?\nTerra Classic (LUNC) is making a quiet return to the spotlight. Originally launched as Terra in 2019, it aimed to blend the stability of traditional currencies with the benefits of blockchain technology. After a significant split in 2022, resulting in Terra Classic, it continues to offer stablecoins linked to various global currencies.\nLUNC uses fiat-pegged stablecoins to enable secure and stable global payments. By combining price stability with the censorship resistance of blockchain, it provides fast and affordable transactions. This technology allows users to transact seamlessly across borders using stablecoins like USTC, KRTC, and EUTC.\nIn the current market, LUNC presents an interesting opportunity. Its focus on stability and practical use makes it appealing to those looking for reliable payment solutions. As more people adopt and develop on its platform, it could regain a strong position in the crypto world.\nHistorically, LUNC has faced challenges. The collapse of UST in 2022 was a major setback, similar to Ethereum's DAO hack in 2017. However, over the past few years leading up to 2025, it has shown resilience, with gradual recovery and growth.\nLooking ahead, LUNC may continue to build on its strengths. If it expands its stablecoin options and maintains user adoption, it could see further positive developments. Keeping an eye on LUNC could be worthwhile as it strives to realize its potential in the evolving blockchain landscape.\nStellar Lumens: Bridging Finance and Crypto, Ready to Soar\nStellar Lumens (XLM) is a cryptocurrency designed to make international money transfers faster, cheaper, and more efficient. Unlike traditional methods that can be slow and costly, XLM allows quick and safe transactions across borders. It's a global payment network built on blockchain technology that connects people, banks, and payment systems.\nXLM acts as a bridge between the world of cryptocurrencies and traditional financial institutions. By using blockchain, it enables seamless currency transfers and promotes financial inclusion. Its focus on practical applications has made it popular among users who need to send money internationally without high fees or long wait times.\nAs of 2025, Stellar's potential looks promising. Partnerships with major companies like Coinbase, Franklin Templeton, and MoneyGram have boosted its adoption. Positive reactions on social media suggest growing interest and investment in XLM. Many believe that its emphasis on fast and affordable transactions gives it an edge over competitors.\nHistorically, Stellar reached an all-time high of $0.9381 in January 2018. Although it has faced ups and downs since then, analysts predict that XLM could surpass its previous highs. With continued adoption and technological advancements, there's a strong belief that Stellar will grow significantly in value.\nLong-term forecasts are optimistic. DigitalCoinPrice predicts that XLM could reach $2.30 by 2030. Other experts suggest that widespread use and favorable regulations might push the price even higher. While challenges remain, many see Stellar Lumens as a promising cryptocurrency with great growth potential.\nSEI: Speeding Toward a Promising Future in Crypto Trading\nSEI burst onto the crypto scene in August 2023, aiming to revolutionize trading with its fast blockchain technology. By November of that year, it integrated with Circle's USD Coin (USDC), boosting its appeal to traders seeking quick and low-cost transactions.\nThe focus on speed and affordability helped SEI reach an all-time high in March 2024. However, despite a thriving market and the launch of its V2 upgrade in May 2024, SEI experienced a downward price trend. This has left many wondering about the coin's future prospects.\nPrice predictions suggest a potential recovery for SEI. By the end of 2025, it could average around $0.75, possibly reaching up to $1. Looking further ahead, forecasts indicate that by 2030, SEI might climb to an average of $2.50, with highs of up to $4.\nSEI aims to make trading easier with its ultra-fast blockchain, promising transaction speeds as swift as 250 milliseconds. This allows for quick and easy exchanges of digital assets, positioning SEI as one of the fastest blockchains in the industry.\nWith its commitment to innovation and potential for growth, SEI could be a coin to watch in the coming years. Its focus on speed and efficiency addresses key needs in the crypto market, suggesting a promising path ahead.\nConclusion\nWhile coins like LUNC, XLM, and SEI have shown some movement, their short-term potential appears limited. Their performance suggests they may not deliver significant gains in the immediate future.\nIn contrast, Codename:Pepe crypto is emerging as a standout by unleashing true intelligence for maximum profits. It uses artificial intelligence to identify promising meme coins, predict market trends, and provide exclusive trading signals. With a capped supply and a community-driven approach, it offers investors access to a secret DAO with insider analytics and voting power on key missions. This positions Codename:Pepe crypto as a compelling opportunity for those seeking significant returns.\nFind out more about Codename:Pepe crypto here:\nCodename:Pepe ($AGNT) Telegram\nCodename:Pepe ($AGNT) Twitter/X\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Can Bitcoin still surge to an all-time high in this kind of economic environment?\nMore turmoil in US trade deals\nOn Monday all seemed fairly serene as far as the long-running saga of US trade deals goes. However, US President Donald Trump put the cat back among the pigeons by announcing that any country that sided with the BRICS nations in deals that were “anti American”, would be hit by a 10% additional tariff.\nNot content with this, the US president also put allies Japan and S. Korea in the crosshairs, threatening a 25% levy on both, to come into force on 1 August.\nIn the face of these impending tariffs, it might have been expected that the Asian stock market would be feeling the pressure. However, the opposite has been true. The Hang Seng Index is up more than 1% in overnight trading.\nAnother fakeout narrowly avoided\nSource: TradingView\nIn the midst of yet more tariff uncertainty, the 4-hour chart for $BTC shows that another fakeout has been narrowly avoided. The price was able to cling to the upper trendline of the bull flag without a candle body opening below. It seems that the price may just continue to roll along the top of the trendline until such time as the bulls are good and ready to send it skyward.\nSMAs on the daily are in order ready for upside move\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily chart is shown with the simple moving averages (SMA). This illustrates that the 50 SMA (blue), 100 SMA (green), and the 200 SMA (red) are now in order. All three of these SMAs should now begin to angle upward, following the price as soon as it starts surging.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI on this time frame has the indicators angled downward. If the price continues to move sideways for a few more days, the indicator lines can drop to the bottom and then tick back up, signalling upside price momentum for $BTC’s next rise.\nWeekly chart shows $BTC ready for lift-off\nSource: TradingView\nThe weekly chart reveals that the $BTC price is just about ready to head higher. The breakout of the bull flag has happened, the confirmation has been made, and now it is just a matter of time. The indicator lines have crossed back up on the Stochastic RSI. What are the bulls waiting for?\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

At the same time, big players in finance are turning their eyes toward XYZVerse, drawn by its blend of sports themes and memes. This shift raises questions about market trends. What is driving this change, and what might it mean for the future?\nXYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin?\nThe buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch.\nThe current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price.\nBullish Mood on $XYZ\nXYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow.\nXYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster, who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.”\nMore Than Just a Meme Coin\nUnlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value.\nRight now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention.\nStill Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends\nBeyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time.\nA Community-Driven Project With Big Plans\nOne thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility.\nThe recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use.\nAs part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem.\nBy bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement.\nCould XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin?\nWith a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look.\nJoin XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity\nOndo Finance: Bridging Traditional Finance with Blockchain Innovation\nOndo Finance is revolutionizing the financial world by combining the reliability of traditional assets with the efficiency of blockchain technology. It does this by tokenizing stable, income-generating real-world assets like U.S. Treasuries. This approach makes high-grade financial products accessible to more people around the globe. Ondo has two main parts: an asset management arm that creates these tokenized products and a technology arm that builds decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. By working with trusted partners like BlackRock and using Coinbase for secure asset custody, Ondo emphasizes trust, security, and transparency. One of its standout offerings, USDY, is backed by U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits, providing stability and a steady yield for non-U.S. investors.\nThe potential of Ondo lies in its unique blend of traditional finance and cutting-edge technology. By bringing real-world assets onto the blockchain, it enhances accessibility and transparency in the financial market. In a time when the cryptocurrency market is often volatile, Ondo's focus on regulated, stable assets sets it apart from many other coins. Current market trends show a growing interest in asset-backed tokens and platforms that offer real-world utility through DeFi solutions. Compared to other cryptocurrencies that might fluctuate wildly, Ondo presents a different kind of opportunity by anchoring its value in tangible assets. This positioning could make it an intriguing option for those interested in both the stability of traditional finance and the innovation of blockchain technology.\nConclusion\nDespite ONDO's milestone amid its 3% dip, attention shifts to XYZVerse (XYZ), the pioneering sports-memecoin aiming for massive growth and uniting fans across multiple sports.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Its focus on simplicity and speed has earned it respect in the payments sector. But as the blockchain space matures, even the most loyal XLM holders are asking the same question: what's next? While predictions swirl around Stellar’s future price, another project is quietly turning heads by doing more than just transferring value, it’s creating it. Bitcoin Solaris is entering the spotlight with its LBank listing, a gamified reward model, and tech infrastructure that’s built for wealth generation.\nXLM Still Has Value, But Is It Enough?\nLet’s be clear. XLM is still a solid coin. It’s fast, widely integrated, and has proven staying power. But while it plays its role in the global remittance puzzle, it hasn’t evolved much in how it empowers holders. The protocol works. The foundation is stable. But the excitement? That part is running a bit thin.\nBitcoin Solaris, on the other hand, brings something fresh. It's not here to replicate. It’s here to amplify. And XLM watchers are starting to notice.\nTechnical Backbone: Built to Perform, Not Just Promise\nBitcoin Solaris isn’t playing catch-up. Its architecture is one of the strongest on the market. The dual-layer blockchain combines Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake, creating an engine that’s secure, scalable, and impressively efficient.\n-\nBase Layer: Secured by PoW, ensuring decentralized protection\n-\nSolaris Layer: DPoS with 15-second blocks and validator rotation every 24 hours\n-\nAchieves up to 10,000 TPS with 2-second finality in real tests\n-\nSmart contracts in Rust for fast, secure application development\n-\nCross-chain bridge development is already underway\nThis setup isn’t just fast. It’s future-ready. And for users looking to grow wealth with more than market swings, BTC-S delivers through its upcoming Solaris Nova App. This tool turns smartphones and laptops into mining machines, opening access to everyone. To get a sense of what’s possible, try the live mining calculator.\nLBank Listing and a 0.5 BTC Surprise\nBitcoin Solaris has officially started the process of landing on LBank, marking a huge milestone for accessibility and investor confidence. The listing alone brings BTC-S into the hands of a global audience. But it’s what the project is doing with that attention that’s making waves.\nBTC-S holders can now participate in a Blockchain Gaming rewards program. This is no ordinary utility layer. It’s dynamic, interactive, and packed with opportunity.\n-\nEvery BTC-S wallet is eligible for daily free spins\n-\nHigher purchase amounts unlock bonus spins\n-\nTop-tier participants can win up to 0.5 BTC\n-\nNo staking or freezing is required to play\nThis isn’t speculation. It’s engagement. You’re not just holding a token. You’re participating in a financial system designed to reward you. Influencers are taking notice too. Reviews by Crypto Vlog, Token Empire, and Crypto Show break down why this is more than hype. It’s a new kind of utility with real traction.\nThe Future of Crypto Doesn’t Wait BTC-S Is Already Moving\nThe Presale Is Heating Up\nThe buzz is building. Bitcoin Solaris is now in Phase 11 of its presale. Here’s the current situation:\n-\nCurrent Price: $11\n-\nLaunch Price: $20\n-\nPotential Return: 150 percent\n-\nOver 14,150 users already joined\n-\nMore than $6.6 million raised\nIt’s one of the shortest presales in the crypto space. And just when you think it couldn’t get more urgent, BTC-S drops a surprise.\nA Price Rollback. For a limited time, buyers can get BTC-S for $5 instead of $11. No bonuses. No codes. Just a moment of opportunity for those paying attention. If you missed early phases, this is your second chance.\nAnd when it’s time to receive your tokens on launch day, wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless delivery.\nAll details and presale access are available at Bitcoin Solaris.\nAudited, Reviewed, and Growing Fast\nSecurity is non-negotiable, and Bitcoin Solaris takes it seriously. The project has been successfully audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins, ensuring smart contract integrity.\nThe community is also expanding rapidly. Real-time updates and group discussions are already happening on Telegram and X, where users are sharing progress, strategies, and excitement.\nFinal Verdict\nAs XLM experts speculate on price movements, Bitcoin Solaris is offering something better, action. With a high-performance blockchain, innovative reward mechanics, and a presale that’s outperforming expectations, BTC-S is showing the market what wealth-building should look like in 2025. It’s not just about the tech. It’s about how the tech rewards the people who believe in it early.\nFor more information on Bitcoin Solaris:\nWebsite: https://www.bitcoinsolaris.com/\nTelegram: https://t.me/Bitcoinsolaris\nX: https://x.com/BitcoinSolaris\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Markets started the week in the red with BTC extending its losses for a second day. The flagship cryptocurrency briefly fell to a low of $107,569 before recovering and moving to its current level. BTC is down over 1% in the past 24 hours, trading around $108,017. Ethereum (ETH) also traded in the red, losing momentum after reaching an intraday high of $2,585 and moving to its current level of $2,543. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is down 1.24% in the past 24 hours.\nMeanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is marginally down, and Solana (SOL) is down nearly 2%, having slipped below $150 and trading around $149. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down over 3%, while Cardano (ADA) is down 1.38%, trading around $0.577. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Toncoin (TON), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines.\nCoinbase Crypto Lobby Urges Congress To Back Bill\nCoinbase’s crypto lobby and several crypto firms have urged US House lawmakers to pass a major bill that would define how the crypto industry will be regulated. The Coinbase lobby, called Stand With Crypto, along with 65 crypto advocacy groups and firms, urged lawmakers to back the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY Act), stating,\n“We know that there have been efforts to politicize crypto legislation, but with crypto drastically reshaping the global economy, the US risks falling behind unless we adopt pro-crypto policies that fully embrace blockchain technology.”\nThe CLARITY Act specifies the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in regulating crypto. The bill grants the CFTC primary jurisdiction, while allowing the SEC to regulate crypto-related securities. The group added,\n“We cannot afford to let inaction and uncertainty jeopardize our ability to secure America’s economic future. Above all else, the U.S. crypto industry needs market structure, which ensures there are clear rules of the road and provides the regulatory clarity that developers, users, and advocates need to continue innovating.”\nRipple CEO To Testify Before Senate Banking Committee\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has confirmed he will testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday, July 9. Garlinghouse will testify alongside other industry figures, with the appearance coming at a crucial time for crypto regulation in the US. Garlinghouse stated,\n“I am honored to be invited to testify in front of the Senate Banking Committee this Wednesday on the need for passing crypto market structure legislation. Constructive crypto market structure legislation in the US is imperative in bringing about a new era of innovation and financial opportunity, while protecting consumers.”\nGarlinghouse’s appearance before the committee comes at a time when Ripple is looking to move on from a gruelling legal battle with the SEC. A US judge ultimately deemed XRP was not a security. Ripple Labs recently withdrew its appeal of the permanent injunction on institutional sales of the XRP token.\nSEC Acknowledges Truth Social Bitcoin, Ethereum ETF\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has accepted Trump Media’s application for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETF. The acknowledgment officially initiates the process for the agency to approve or reject the proposed funding. Trump Media’s Bitcoin ETF. The ETF proposes offering investors exposure to BTC and ETH through shares listed on NYSE Arca, and backed by crypto assets. The allocation is split 75% to BTC and 25% to ETH. Foris DAX Trust Company will act as the custodian, while asset management firm Yorkville America Digital will be the fund’s sponsor.\nThe filing comes amid an influx of crypto ETF applications. The SEC is exploring a simplified listing structure for crypto ETFs, which would automate part of the approval process.\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\nBitcoin (BTC) has recovered during the ongoing session, with the price marginally up after falling to an intraday low of $107,446. The flagship cryptocurrency traded in positive territory over the weekend, rising 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $109,229. However, it lost momentum on Monday after facing volatility and selling pressure, falling to a low of $107,562 before recovering to settle at $108,283.\nAnalysts believe long-term BTC holders may hold the keys to another substantial price jump. According to crypto analyst and trader CrediBULL, 80% of the BTC supply is in the hands of “diamond hands,” individuals and institutions that won't sell the asset easily. With 80% of the supply locked, the analyst stated that there is less “extra” supply that can be dumped on the market. In such a scenario, any demand could have a substantial impact on BTC’s price. The analyst pointed out previous instances when “diamond hands” helped boost BTC.\nThe first was when BTC was at $43,000 and heavy holding pushed the price to $73,000. The second was when the price was at $58,000. Long-term holders holding on to BTC helped push the asset beyond $100,000. However, because the tight supply makes BTC sensitive to demand, even a small rush of buyers can impact the price.\nPublic companies that add BTC to their reserves as a treasury asset are also locking up more coins, decreasing their supply on exchanges. Michael Saylor’s Strategy holds over 597,325 BTC, while Marathon Digital Holdings, Metaplanet, GameStop, Genius Group, and Blockchain Group also hold substantial quantities of BTC. CrediBULL believes that because of these factors, BTC’s next price jump could be substantially bigger than the last two, predicting a push towards $150,000.\nBTC traded in positive territory the previous weekend, rising 0.14% and 0.20% on Friday and Saturday to cross $107,000 and settle at $107,339. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price rose nearly 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,350. Despite the positive weekend, BTC lost momentum on Monday, dropping 1.09% to $107,167. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as the price fell 1.33%, slipping below $106,000 to $105,742. BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,845, but not before reaching an intraday high of $108,845.\nSource: TradingView\nBTC continued rising Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $110,583 before losing momentum and settling at $109,650, ultimately increasing 0.74%. BTC lost momentum on Friday, falling 1.42% to $108,097. However, it recovered over the weekend, rising 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,229. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC started the current week in the red, dropping to a low of $107,572 before settling at $108,283. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control.\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\nEthereum (ETH) is marginally up during the ongoing session as it looks to recover from Monday’s drop to $2,514. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency registered a sharp drop on Friday but recovered over the weekend, rising 0.35% on Saturday and over 2% on Sunday to settle at $2,572. However, it was back in the red on Monday, dropping .12% to $2,543.\nETH is currently trading at $2,546, close to a critical resistance zone that sits around $2,590. Analysts believe a harmonic pattern (butterfly) could emerge, requiring a corrective leg C before a bullish leg D continuation. ETH could stall at this key level before resuming its upward trend. However, for the harmonic pattern to remain valid, ETH must form a corrective leg C, implying a drop towards $2,300. If the price falls to this zone and holds, it will confirm the formation of leg C, setting the foundation for a bullish continuation into leg D, with a potential move past $3,000.\nETH traded in positive territory over the previous weekend, rising 0.57% on Saturday and nearly 3% on Sunday to settle at $2,500. However, ETH was back in the red on Monday, dropping to a low of $2,436 before recovering to settle at $2,486, ultimately falling 0.55%. Bearish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as ETH fell over 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $2,407. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 7% to cross the moving averages and settle at $2,572. ETH continued rising on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $2,626 before settling at $2,592, ultimately registering an increase of nearly 1%.\nSource: TradingView\nETH lost momentum on Friday, falling over 3% to settle at $2,509. It recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday before rising over 2% on Sunday and settling at $2,572. ETH was back in the red on Monday as the price fell over 1% to $2,543. The current session sees ETH marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle for control. Buyers will look to retain control and push ETH beyond the resistance around $2,590.\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\nSolana (SOL) has registered strong performances in recent sessions, despite registering a substantial decline on Friday. It registered a marginal drop on Saturday before rebounding on Sunday, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $150 and settle at $151. The price was back in the red on Monday, falling 1.96% before recovering during the current session.\nSOL’s performance can be attributed to the launch of its staking ETF on Wednesday. The ETF offers investors exposure to SOL and generated over $12 million in inflows on its first day. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the ETF made a “healthy” start, putting it among the top 1% of new launches. However, the SEC is yet to give the green light to ETFs tracking the spot price of SOL and other altcoins.\nSOL’s price action was bullish the previous weekend as it rose over 6% on Saturday and nearly 2% on Sunday to settle at $153. It faced selling pressure and volatility on Monday as sellers attempted to overwhelm buyers. Despite this, it registered an increase of 1.01% and settled at $154. SOL lost momentum on Tuesday, falling over 5% to go below $150, and settling at $147. Despite the selling pressure, it recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 4% to reclaim $150 and settle at $152.\nSource: TradingView\nSOL was back in the red on Thursday, registering a marginal decline.

The current session sees SOL up nearly 1%, trading around $150.\nArbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis\nArbitrum (ARB) traded in positive territory the previous weekend, rising 1.73% on Saturday and then surging nearly 18% on Sunday to cross the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settle at $0.367. Despite the positive sentiment, ARB was back in the red on Monday, dropping nearly 6%, slipping below the 50-day SMA to $0.345.

Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 1.33%, falling below $1.50 to $1.49. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, TIA recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 9% to cross the 20-day SMA, reclaim $1.50, and settle at $1.62.

{"title": "Grayscale XRP ETF Gets SEC Nod: XRP Price Prediction & Market Impact", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/grayscale-xrp-etf-gets-sec-nod-xrp-price-prediction-market-impact", "text": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially approved Grayscale’s application to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), marking a significant milestone for crypto ETFs in the U.S. What sets this approval apart is the inclusion of XRP—a first for a regulated crypto ETF in the country.\nThis insight is powered by Outset PR, a data-driven crypto communications agency that helps digital assets gain attention through a combination of media intelligence, strategic narrative timing, and performance-driven outreach.\nThe Market Impact\nThis marks the first time XRP has been included in a U.S.-regulated spot ETF, following its long-running legal battles with the SEC. The inclusion legitimizes XRP in the eyes of institutional investors, reinforcing its status as a core asset in the crypto space.\nThrough GDLC’s ETF wrapper, institutional and retail investors can now gain indirect exposure to XRP without needing to hold or custody the token themselves. This lowers the barrier to entry and may drive new capital into XRP markets.\nWith XRP under regulatory scrutiny since 2020 due to the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs, its inclusion in a spot ETF signals a turning tide in regulatory perception. This move could influence the approval of other XRP-related financial products in the future.\nXRP Price Analysis and Prediction\nSource: tradingview\nXRP is currently trading between $2.17 and $2.35. It has been on a positive trend lately. In the past week, its price saw a rise of about 5.7%. Over the past month, it climbed by nearly 7.9%. If XRP can break through the nearest resistance level of $2.43, it might aim for the $2.60 mark, which would mean a potential growth of more than ten percent from its current range.\nOverall, XRP appears to have a promising outlook, with support levels not too far below, suggesting a strong market interest.

When it does, the memecoins are going to be in the vanguard of this next, potentially explosive move to the upside. Top memecoins $DOGE, $SHIB, and $PEPE are likely to be among the frontrunners.\n$DOGE confirms breakout\nSource: TradingView\nThe short-term chart for $DOGE shows that the price has gotten above the descending trendline, and has just confirmed this break. The Stochastic RSI has just crossed up signalling some short-term upside price momentum, and it looks as though the series of higher highs and higher lows could be set to continue. $0.18 is the first target for this move.\nNext $DOGE move could be explosive\nSource: TradingView\nThe weekly time frame for $DOGE looks even better. The descending trendline can be seen to stretch all the way back to early December 2024, so a breakthrough here could be explosive. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators have just crossed up. This can signal the upside price momentum needed to send the $DOGE price much higher. Getting above the previous local high at $0.26 would leave the path open to the top of the last big swing high at $0.48.\n$SHIB price arriving at top of ascending triangle\nSource: TradingView\n$SHIB is looking bullish on the short-term chart. An ascending trendline is forcing the price up and against a band of horizontal resistance, forming an ascending triangle pattern as it does so. Once the price breaks through the band of resistance, the target would be $0.000014.\n$SHIB breakout is nigh\nSource: TradingView\nThe weekly time frame for $SHIB reveals that the big breakout is very near - either this, or next week. As is the case for $DOGE, the Stochastic RSI indicators confirmed in a bullish cross-up, lending fuel to the coming breakout. All the horizontal resistance levels on the chart are likely to be breached, so the minimum target is $0.000017, with a decent chance of matching the last swing high at $0.000033 should this bull market switch into overdrive.\n$PEPE breaks out of descending channel\nSource: TradingView\n$PEPE has recently broken out of a descending channel and the horizontal level at $0.00000917 is acting as solid support just below. This gives $PEPE bulls the base to start the next big climb higher. The next target levels are the resistance at $0.0000114, and the previous local high at $0.000016. Stochastic RSI indicators are crossing back up.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "The Hidden Fortune of Meme Coin DEXes — And this AI is Coming to Regulate It", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/the-hidden-fortune-of-meme-coin-dexes-and-this-ai-is-coming-to-regulate-it", "text": "Interview with Yoann Defay and Jeremy Dahan, co-founders of AssetSwap.ai\nIntro\nIn a DeFi landscape where daily rug pulls have become normalized — and where DEX platforms generate fees even when users lose everything — AssetSwap.ai is proposing a radically different model.\nWe sat down with the platform’s co-founders, Yoann Defay (CTO) and Jérémy Dahan(CEO), to discuss why meme coin trading needs an AI-powered reset, what VibeFi really means, and how their tool is helping beginners survive in one of the most chaotic corners of crypto, specially in Meme coin markets.\nQ1: DEXes like Pump.fun and Axiom are generating millions in fees — mostly from meme coins. How much of that volume do you think is actually “real”?\nJérémy:\nIf you define “real” as value created for the user, it’s probably under 10%. Most of the volume is raw speculation — users chasing hype without tools, getting rugged, and repeating the cycle. And guess what? The DEX still wins. They charge fees on every entry and exit. They don’t care who survives.\nYoann:\nFrom a technical point of view, we’ve seen huge clusters of liquidity cycling between wallets and tokens created in seconds. That’s not real trading. It’s just noise designed to generate fee revenue — and it works, at scale.\nQ2: It’s estimated that over 90% of meme coins today are scams or low-effort rugs. Why are DEXes still letting this happen?\nJérémy:\nBecause they benefit. The more chaos, the more volume. It’s not a bug — it’s their business model. They don’t want filters. They want frictionless pumps and exits. Retail is the exit liquidity.\nYoann:\nThey’ve optimized for throughput, not trust. It’s like giving anyone a printing press and not caring what they print, as long as someone clicks “buy.”\nQ3: Are DEXes financially incentivized not to protect users?\nJérémy:\nAbsolutely. Let’s be blunt — protecting users would mean slowing down volume. And volume is their KPI. So when we step in with tools like AssetSwap that flag scams or recommend safer entries, it goes against their economic incentives.\nYoann:\nThat’s why they don’t integrate risk signals or AI scoring at the protocol level. It’s not profitable for them to slow you down before you ape in.\nQ4: You coined the term “RugFi.” What does that mean exactly?\nJérémy:\nRugFi is the system where rugs are normalized, and platforms profit from it. It’s DeFi with no defenses. The problem isn’t just bad actors — it’s that the system is designed to welcome them.\nYoann:\nIt’s also an infrastructure term. RugFi is what happens when tools aren’t connected, signals aren’t scored, and the user has to fend for themselves with no intel. We’re changing that.\nQ5: So is this a cultural problem, or a structural one?\nJérémy:\nIt’s both. The culture glorifies aping in and “degen” behavior, but that only works for whales or insiders. Structurally, it’s worse — DEXes don’t screen anything, and the average user is flying blind.\nYoann:\nWhen structure is missing, culture becomes dangerous. If you want to change the culture, you need to build better infrastructure — that’s what we’re doing with AI.\nQ6: How does AssetSwap.ai protect users in real time?\nYoann:\nWe created AI-Pick, our flagship signal engine. It analyzes over 10,000 data points in real time — things like wallet behavior, LP unlocks, bot activity, dev token holdings, liquidity patterns, and social signals.\nEvery token gets a live score. You see what’s trending, but also what’s dangerous. It’s signal-first, not sentiment-first.\nJérémy:\nFor the user, it’s simple. They just type: “What’s safe to enter on Solana today?”\nThe AI filters, scores, and suggests trades — clean, accurate, and emotion-free. That’s Vibe Trading.\nQ7: Are you trying to fix the DEX problem — or replace it?\nJérémy:\nWe’re not trying to replace DEXes. They’re infrastructure. But we are building an intelligent layer on top of them — one that prioritizes the user, not the volume.\nYoann:\nExactly. Think of AssetSwap as the brain. The DEX is the muscle — fast but blind. Together, they work. But only if the brain is in control.\nQ8: Can a total beginner really trade meme coins safely with your platform?\nJérémy:\nYes. That’s the magic of VibeFi. You don’t need to know how to trade. You just describe what you want: “Safe coins under $10M market cap,” or “Tokens trending in Telegram but not yet pumped.”\nOur AI turns that into action — scoring tokens, giving signals, and helping you trade intelligently.\nYoann:\nBehind the scenes, it’s complex. But for the user, it feels like talking to ChatGPT — except it can execute trades. That’s how we onboard the next wave of crypto users.\nQ9: What makes AssetSwap.ai different from other AI trading tools?\nYoann:\nMost AI tools just give predictions or sentiment summaries. We do live analysis, live scoring, and live execution. The AI doesn’t just talk — it acts.\nJérémy:\nWe’re also focused on meme coin survival, not just alpha. Our mission is not to help you win big once — it’s to help you avoid losing over and over.\nQ10: Final message to DEX founders?\nJérémy:\nYou can keep profiting from rugs — or you can start building tools to protect your users. If you don’t, we will.\nYoann:\nAnd we already are.\nAbout AssetSwap.ai\nAssetSwap.ai is the first GPT-style trading assistant for meme coins, crypto tokens, and tokenized assets. It provides real-time AI analysis, token safety scoring, and prompt-based execution across major chains. Designed for both beginners and experienced traders, AssetSwap is redefining what it means to trade in DeFi — safely, intelligently, and without fear.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This strategic move brings part of the $GUN token’s circulating supply to Solana, enhancing accessibility for U.S. (and global) users while reinforcing GUNZ’s leadership in the blockchain gaming sector. On the 10th of July $GUN lands on Solana, bringing lightning-fast access and next-gen infrastructure to a whole new wave of gamers and community members.\nStrategic Alignment with Solana: A Multi-Chain Vision\nUnder the bold banner, “$GUN is Coming to Solana,” GUNZ is embracing Solana’s high-speed, low-cost blockchain infrastructure and robust ecosystem to amplify its multi-chain strategy, aptly summarized as “Too Big for One Chain.” This move represents the latest step in a clear multichain strategy, setting the stage for additional expansions to other prominent blockchains in the future. The bridging process to Solana will be facilitated by LayerZero, a leader in blockchain interoperability and seamless cross-chain transactions.\nCurrently, $GUN is available on multiple blockchains and platforms, including GUNZ Layer 1 and AVAX C-chain.\nThis alignment radically increases accessibility to the token and unlocks new opportunities for partnerships, campaigns, and community engagement by leveraging Solana’s global reach.\nTo celebrate this milestone, GUNZ will launch a limited-edition Solana-themed NFT content pack. Details on how to claim this exclusive offering will be announced soon, adding excitement for the growing Off The Grid community.\nOff The Grid and the GUNZ Ecosystem: A Clarified Vision\nGUNZ is renowned for Off The Grid, the first AAA game with an onchain economy, available across platforms like Epic Games Store, Xbox, PlayStation, and soon Steam. Within OTG, the $GUN token serves as a utility token, enabling players to purchase in-game items, engage in asset trading, and participate in blockchain-powered gameplay interactions. Following the Solana integration, players will be able to deposit Solana-based $GUN directly into their in-game wallet, enabling fast, reliable, and convenient transactions within OTG’s immersive digital economy.\nWith over 17 million wallets registered in the GUNZ ecosystem, GUNZ is poised for strong growth. This milestone will boost ecosystem activity and token utility.\nLeadership Perspective\n“Launching $GUN on Solana reflects our long-term commitment to building a truly global, player-first ecosystem,” said Vlad Korolov, CEO at Gunzilla Games. “Solana’s speed and scalability allow us to reach new communities with greater efficiency and reliability. This is more than a technical upgrade—it’s a major step toward making blockchain gaming seamless, inclusive, and ready for the mainstream.”\nLooking Ahead\nGUNZ is set to share additional updates in the coming weeks, including details on the highly anticipated Steam release of Off The Grid and further global token availability. As the ecosystem gears up for mass adoption, the crypto community is encouraged to stay tuned for announcements that will solidify GUNZ’s position as a trailblazer in blockchain gaming.\nRisk & Regulatory Disclosure\n$GUN is an in-game utility asset. It has not been registered, qualified, or approved as a security, capital-markets product, or digital payment token in any jurisdiction. No regulator has reviewed this material. This release is not an offer, solicitation, or investment advice, and $GUN is not offered to U.S. persons. The token’s value may fall to zero and is not covered by investor-compensation schemes (including those under EU MiCAR).

{"title": "Could Ruvi AI (RUVI) Beat Cardano (ADA) to $1 Evaluation? Successful Audit Might Make It Reach Sooner Than Expected", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/could-ruvi-ai-ruvi-beat-cardano-ada-to-1-evaluation-successful-audit-might-make-it-reach-sooner-than-expected", "text": "The cryptocurrency market thrives on innovation, with new contenders constantly challenging established players. One such rising star is Ruvi AI (RU, a blockchain project powering real-world solutions by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain. Analysts believe Ruvi AI has the momentum and structure to reach a $1 valuation faster than Cardano (ADA), despite the latter’s dominance in the blockchain space.\nHere’s why Ruvi AI is taking the market by storm and why its growth trajectory could outpace Cardano’s. VI)\nTransparency and Security Build Investor Trust\nOne of the key factors enhancing Ruvi AI’s appeal is its commitment to transparency and security. The project completed a third-party audit by CyberScope, a leading blockchain security firm. This certification assures investors that Ruvi AI’s smart contracts are secure and free from vulnerabilities, which is crucial for earning investor confidence in a competitive market.\nBuilding further trust, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange, ensuring liquidity post-presale. This partnership guarantees that investors can trade RUVI tokens seamlessly immediately after the presale concludes. These measures, designed to ensure safety and accessibility, solidify Ruvi AI’s reputation as a transparent and reliable investment.\nPresale Success Paves the Way\nRuvi AI’s presale results reflect strong demand and robust momentum:\n- Over $2.2 million raised.\n- More than 180 million tokens sold.\n- A growing and engaged community of 2,000+ holders.\nThis level of early success speaks to the widespread interest it has generated among investors. Currently priced at just $0.015 per token during Phase 2 of the presale, Ruvi AI offers an unparalleled ground-floor opportunity. By the time the presale ends, the price will increase to $0.07, representing an almost 5x ROI for participants before the token enters public markets.\nPost-listing, analysts expect a $1 valuation per token, equating to an extraordinary 66x ROI. With its structured growth model, Ruvi AI positions itself as a clear challenger to established players like Cardano.\nReal-World Utility Drives Ruvi AI’s Appeal\nWhile many cryptocurrency projects rely on speculative appeal, Ruvi AI is creating practical tools and algorithms to solve real-world challenges. By combining AI and blockchain, Ruvi AI serves essential industries with scalable solutions.\nAI-Driven Marketing Solutions\nFor brands and marketers, Ruvi AI offers AI-powered tools to enhance audience targeting, reduce wasted ad spend, and improve overall ad performance. These innovations are crucial as businesses seek to optimize their digital marketing strategies.\nEmpowering Creators in Entertainment\nRuvi AI addresses long-standing issues in entertainment, with blockchain-secured payment models to ensure fair and transparent revenue sharing. Additional AI audience insights allow content creators to strengthen relationships with their audiences and unlock new monetization strategies.\nTransforming Financial Transactions\nRuvi AI also brings AI innovation to fintech, deploying fraud prevention systems and secure payment protocols that modernize financial services. These advancements build trust, reduce inefficiencies, and improve the overall quality of digital transactions.\nThe practical applications of Ruvi AI’s technology ensure sustained demand for its token and platform, far beyond its presale phase.\nHow to Maximize Returns with VIP Investment Tiers\nRuvi AI’s VIP investment tiers allow early adopters to unlock significant bonuses, amplifying their ROI potential. Here’s a breakdown of the tiers and their benefits:\n- VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus):\n- Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus).\n- Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900.\n- Value at $1 per token: $70,000.\n- VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus):\n- Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus).\n- Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680.\n- Value at $1 per token: $224,000.\n- VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus):\n- Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double allocation).\n- Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600.\n- Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000.\nThese tiers provide extraordinary value, enabling investors to capitalize on Ruvi AI’s growing demand and increasing token valuation.\nCould Ruvi AI Beat Cardano to $1?\nCardano is widely recognized for its innovation and market presence, but its growth rate has cooled as the network matures. Ruvi AI, entering the market with cutting-edge solutions and strong early-stage momentum, might achieve similar milestones significantly faster. With its low entry price of $0.015, real-world applications, and projected 66x ROI, Ruvi AI is positioned to reach a $1 valuation sooner than expected.\nIf you missed out on Cardano’s early gains, Ruvi AI’s presale offers an opportunity to secure high returns while investing in a project that merges transparency, scalability, and innovation. Don’t wait, seize the chance to be part of the crypto market’s next breakout success!\nLearn More\nBuy RUVI: https://presale.ruvi.io\nWebsite: https://ruvi.io\nWhitepaper: https://docs.ruvi.io\nTelegram: https://t.me/ruviofficial\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/RuviAI\nTry RUVI AI: https://web.ruvi.io/register\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Crypto Price Analysis 7-7: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, DOGECOIN: DOGE, LITECOIN: LTC, COSMOS: ATOM", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/crypto-price-analysis-7-7-bitcoin-btc-ethereum-eth-solana-sol-dogecoin-doge-litecoin-ltc-cosmos-atom", "text": "The crypto market has started the new week on a bullish note, up nearly 2%at $3.38 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC), which was steady around $108,000 for most of the weekend, has bounced to reclaim $109,000. The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $109,627 as buyers eye a move past $110,000. Analysts are optimistic of a new all-time high if BTC crosses key resistance levels.\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) attempted to move past $2,600 early on Monday but was thwarted by upper-level resistance. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is up over 2% in the past 24 hours, trading around $2,577. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is up 2.29%, trading around $2.27, while Solana (SOL) is up nearly 3%. SOL spent most of the weekend below $150, but sentiment picked up late on Sunday, and the price moved to its current level of $152. Dogecoin (DOGE) has registered a substantial increase over the past 24 hours, up nearly 7%, while Cardano (ADA) is up 2.03%, trading around $0.587. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Toncoin (TON), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial increases.\nDeFi, TradFi Convergence Could Occur Sooner Than Expected\nNelli Zaltsman, head of blockchain payments innovation at JPMorgan Kinexys, believes the divide between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi). Zaltsman made the comments speaking alongside Chainlink Labs co-founder Sergey Nazarov at the RWA Summit Cannes 2025. She added that JPMorgan is pushing to merge institutional-grade payments infrastructure with emerging on-chain assets, indicating a tipping point for blockchain adoption.\n“Our goal has always been to find the best way to work with the public blockchain, regulatory environment permitting.”\nJPMorgan has recently partnered with Chainlink to pilot a synchronized settlement technology, enabling the bank’s blockchain-based deposits to orchestrate transactions across multiple blockchains. Nazarov called the milestone an example of how banks can connect traditional capital with digital asset markets.\nSpeaking about TradFi and DeFi, Zaltsman stated that artificial boundaries separating traditional and decentralized finance could disappear faster than expected thanks to improved infrastructure and cooperation. She pointed out that JPMorgan built its private blockchain a decade ago due to the lack of suitable options, adding that the situation was different today.\n“Thankfully, that’s not the case today. It took many years for there to be tools that are kind of underpriced and in support. I hope that this convergence happens sooner rather than later… we start looking at tech for what it is and how we can help different users and not… having these artificial boundaries.”\nSecret Service Seizes Nearly $400M In Crypto\nThe US Secret Service has seized over $400 million in digital assets over the past decade, creating one of the largest crypto cold wallets. According to Jamie Lam, an investigative analyst, the agency’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) tracked funds using open-source tools, blockchain analysis, and lots of patience. The Secret Service’s crypto stash, most of which is stored in a single cold wallet, is the result of several investigations into elaborate scams. Scammers have been targeting users by luring them into seemingly legitimate crypto investment platforms. Victims see initial profits before scammers disappear with all their deposits. Lam stated,\n“That’s how they do it. They’ll send you a photo of a really good-looking guy or girl. But it’s probably some old guy in Russia.”\n$6.8 Billion Bitcoin Whale Not Selling\nBlockchain intelligence firm Arkham has said that the $8.6 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) moved last week does not seem to be heading for a sell-off. Arkham believes that the transfers may be the owner upgrading from the original legacy wallet to a Native SegWit address, which offers improved security and lower fees.\n“There are no indications that this whale is selling Bitcoin. Yesterday’s $8 billion transfers were possibly related to address upgrades, moving from 1-addresses to bc1q-addresses.”\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\nBitcoin (BTC) price action picked up late on Sunday, fueled by optimism around the upcoming “crypto week” in Washington. However, broader market sentiment remains cautious thanks to growing uncertainty about President Trump’s shifting stance on tariffs. The flagship cryptocurrency dropped to a low of $107,340 on Friday before recovering over the weekend, with the price rising 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and move to $109,229. However, BTC finds itself back in the red during the ongoing session, marginally down, trading around $108,834.\nBTC and the broader crypto market enter a crucial week with two major catalysts set to dictate price action. The most important catalyst for BTC and the broader market will be the upcoming July 9 tariff deadline. The US has reached agreements with several trading partners. However, President Trump could revert to the high tariffs announced back in April. The return of retaliatory tariffs will likely be a bearish development for BTC and the broader markets. BTC had plunged to a low of $74,000 after Trump’s Liberation Day speech before bouncing back when he announced the 90-day pause.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes are also scheduled for release on Wednesday and could act as another decisive catalyst for BTC. The minutes are expected to provide more information about the previous meeting, where the Fed left interest rates unchanged between 4.25% and 4.50%. The minutes will also shed light on when the Fed could cut interest rates. A rate cut will be bullish for BTC and the broader crypto market. However, the odds of a rate cut have reduced due to strong nonfarm payrolls data.\nMeanwhile,. Bitcoin dominance of the overall crypto market continued to grow, crossing 65% to reach its highest levels since early 2021.\nBTC registered a sharp increase on Monday (June 23), rising over 4% to cross $105,000 and settle at $105,443. The price continued pushing higher on Tuesday, rising 0.66% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,137. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as BTC rose 1.19% to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,397. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Thursday, registering a marginal decline, slipping below $107,000 to $106,980. BTC recovered over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Friday and Saturday to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,339. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price rose nearly 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,350.\nSource: TradingView\nBTC was back in the red on Monday, beginning the previous week in the red, dropping 1.09% to $107,167. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell 1.33%, slipping below the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settling at $105,742. BTC rebounded on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,845. Buyers retained control on Thursday as BTC reached an intraday high of $110,583 before settling at $109,650. The flagship cryptocurrency lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.42% to $108,097. Price action turned positive over the weekend as BTC rose 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday, reclaiming $109,000 and settling at $109,229. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control.\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\nEthereum (ETH) is marginally up during the ongoing session as it attempts a fresh move beyond the $2,550 resistance zone. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency remained in positive territory over the weekend despite falling to a low of $2,476 on Friday before reclaiming $2,500. ETH recovered to register a marginal increase on Saturday and then rose over 2% on Sunday, crossing $2,500 and settling at $2,572. ETH’s price action is drawing considerable attention as it continues trading within a well-defined range. According to one analyst, ETH could be on the verge of a significant move that could take the price beyond $3,000.\nETH registered a sharp drop on Thursday (June 26), falling from an intraday high of $2,531 to $2,415. Despite the drop, it recovered on Friday, registering a marginal increase and moving to $2,423. ETH remained in positive territory on Saturday and Sunday, rising 0.57% and 2.57% to settle at $2,500. However, it lost momentum on Monday, dropping 0.55% to $2,486. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as the price fell over 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $2,407.\nSource: TradingView\nDespite the selling pressure, ETH recovered on Friday, rising nearly 7% to cross the moving averages and $2,500 and settle at $2,572. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price rose almost 1% and settled at $2,592, but not before reaching an intraday high of $2,637. ETH lost momentum on Friday, plunging over 3% to $2,509. The price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.36% on Saturday and over 2% on Sunday to settle at $2,572. The current session sees ETH marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control.\nETH faces immediate resistance around the $2,600 mark, with the key resistance level sitting at $2,620. A break above $2,620 and $2,650 could push the price beyond $2,700.\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\nSolana (SOL) extended its gains with the price marginally up during the ongoing session. The altcoin registered a sharp drop on Friday, falling over 3% to $147. The price registered a marginal decline on Saturday before rising nearly 3% to reclaim $150 and settle at $151. While SOL's trading volume is low, the cryptocurrency remains volatile. However, one analyst has made an outlandish claim about SOL’s price action, stating,\n“Bitcoin and Solana Cup and Handle Pattern on the monthly chart. $BTC has broken out of the handle while $SOL is still waiting for the breakout. This pattern sets $BTC and $SOL to targets of $230,000 and $4,390, respectively.”\nSOL reached an intraday high of $148 on Wednesday (June 25) before losing momentum and settling at $143. Price action remained bearish on Thursday as SOL fell over 3%, slipping below $140, and settling at $139. Despite the selling pressure, SOL recovered on Friday, rising over 2% to reclaim $140 and settle at $142. Bullish sentiment intensified on Saturday as the price rose over 6%, crossing the 20-day SMA and settling at $150. Buyers retained control on Sunday as SOL rose nearly 2% to end the weekend at $153.\nSource: TradingView\nSOL faced selling pressure and volatility on Monday as sellers attempted to overwhelm buyers.

With meme-driven narratives proving to be more than just internet humor, they’ve become serious vehicles for exponential returns. However, as the top meme coins mature, early-entry opportunities become increasingly scarce. That’s where Little Pepe (LILPEPE) enters the scene: a new presale-stage meme coin project with the kind of high-octane potential that could turn a modest $4,000 investment into $40,000 or more—possibly before the end of 2025.\nThe Evolution of Meme Coins: From Noise to Next-Gen Narratives\nSHIB and PEPE succeeded not just because of meme virality, but because they captured moments in crypto history—SHIB surfed the Ethereum bull run. At the same time, PEPE capitalized on the dominance of pure meme culture. Yet despite their origins, these coins haven’t evolved much in terms of utility or innovation. That’s where Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) takes a radically different approach.\nWhile still rooted in meme culture, Little Pepe isn’t content with just vibes. It’s building something foundational: a Layer 2 blockchain powered by its native $LILPEPE token. In a landscape plagued by high gas fees and slow confirmation times, the project aims to outshine Ethereum’s existing Layer 2 networks—not just by being faster or cheaper, but by infusing meme virality with genuine technical value. This isn’t your typical meme coin. This is a memecoin with a Layer 2 heart—a rare hybrid that gives it both narrative weight and practical use case.\nWhat Makes $LILPEPE Different?\nLittle Pepe is more than just a tribute to the legendary frog. It’s the heir to a throne long abandoned by meme coins that forgot how to innovate. With its own Layer 2 network in development, Little Pepe promises lightning-fast transactions, ultra-low fees, and EVM compatibility—all while maintaining the playful, community-driven ethos of its meme coin roots. The development team has taken cues from Ethereum’s scalability issues and built $LILPEPE to address them head-on. And with no buy or sell tax, every token movement is clean and efficient—ideal for both trading and holding. Moreover, the team isn’t hiding behind gimmicks. With a transparent roadmap and real token utility, $LILPEPE is attracting attention not only from memecoin enthusiasts but also from broader DeFi communities seeking high-throughput Layer 2 solutions.\nStrategic Tokenomics Designed for Growth\n$LILPEPE comes with a thoughtfully designed supply of 100 billion tokens, and it’s currently in Stage 4 of its presale, with over $3.27 million already raised—a clear signal of growing investor confidence.\nToken distribution is balanced to support sustainable growth:\n-\n26.5% allocated to presale, offering early backers access to discounted prices before launch.\n-\n30% reserved for the Layer 2 chain, ensuring the ecosystem has ample liquidity for on-chain functions.\n-\n10% each for liquidity, DEX allocation, and marketing, with the latter backing an aggressive campaign that includes influencer partnerships and community challenges.\n-\n13.5% is set aside for staking and rewards, reinforcing the project's emphasis on long-term holders.\nNo taxes. No hidden traps. Just a meme-powered rocket ship waiting to take off.\nThe Presale Opportunity: Limited Supply, High Upside\nRight now, $LILPEPE is priced at just $0.0013 per token in its fourth presale stage. With over 2.82 billion tokens already sold out of a 3.75 billion cap, time is running out for those looking to get in early.\nAnd there’s more than just the token at stake. Little Pepe is running a $777,000 giveaway, including ten prizes of $77,000 each, simply for participating in the presale and completing community tasks. It’s a rare mix of incentives that not only rewards early buyers but also amplifies the project’s reach. The buzz is growing, and when $LILPEPE hits exchanges, the combination of hype and solid fundamentals could spark a major price rally. For comparison, early PEPE buyers saw thousands turned into millions within months. While no investment is without risk, $LILPEPE’s structure and timing suggest it could be the next breakout in a market hungry for novelty and speed.\n2025: The Year of Little Pepe?\nIf there’s one thing the crypto market teaches us again and again, it’s that narrative sells—but utility sustains. Little Pepe merges both. In a post-PEPE, post-SHIB world, investors are seeking the next disruptive meme coin, not one that merely copies, but one that builds upon it. By 2025, as gas fees rise and Layer 2 solutions become more critical, LILPEPE’s early focus on infrastructure could give it a major competitive edge. Could a $4,000 investment turn into $40,000? The answer lies in timing, traction, and tokenomics—and right now, Little Pepe checks all the boxes.\nMeme magic is alive. And this time, it’s building a blockchain.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

However, with Bitcoin (BTC) looking as though it may be about to put on a surge out of its bull flag, $SOL is ready to not just match this, but to outperform $BTC over these next few weeks.\n(SOL/USDT) breakout in favour of $SOL\nSource: TradingView\nStarting off with $SOL against its $USDT pair on the weekly time frame, it can be seen that the price has broken out of the descending wedge and is consolidating above the breakout. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is showing a cross back up of the indicator lines which should signal a rise in the $SOL price. If the bulls can get the price beyond the $158 horizontal resistance level this could help to propel it to $180 and a higher high just beyond this.\nW bottoming pattern could help propel $SOL to higher high against $BTC\nSource: TradingView\nThe weekly chart for $SOL against its $BTC pair (SOL/BTC) reveals that $SOL has confirmed the breakout of the descending trendline, which has been in $BTC’s favour since mid-January 2025. As can be noted in the chart, a W bottoming pattern has formed which could help to propel $SOL back above the big triangle pattern.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI shows a cross back up of the indicator lines - another signal that $SOL is about to start outperforming $BTC. The same thing could be about to happen in favour of $SOL in the 2-week chart, with the indicator lines right at the bottom, with therefore a lot more room and time to move upwards.\n(SOL/ETH) pair about to move in favour of $SOL\nSource: TradingView\nNot only is $SOL about to outperform $BTC, but it should start outperforming $ETH as well. The ascending channel in the 2-week chart above is not a bullish pattern as such, but if the $SOL bulls can manage to get the price back into the channel, a swing back to the top of this channel could be expected to take place, which could result in a 60% gain for $SOL over $ETH. The support belt that the price is currently resting on is also perfect for a bounce back to the upside from $SOL.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI has the indicators right at the lowest point. When they tick back up again this should signal that price momentum will be in favour of $SOL.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Best Crypto to Buy Now As Trade War And Tariff Fears Pass", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-trade-war-and-tariff-fears-pass", "text": "In the wake of Trump’s sweeping tariff announcements, markets across sectors responded with volatility. Major economies stumbled, growth slowed, and fears of a recession in the United States gained momentum. Crypto, caught in the crosscurrents, mirrored this turbulence. But something has shifted. In the last few days, signs of retreat from the hardline stance have begun to emerge.\nWith negotiations resuming and trade sentiment improving, the broader market, including crypto, appears to be catching its breath. A rebound has quietly begun, and sentiment is now skewing far more optimistic than it was just a month ago.\nFading Recession Fears Could Reignite Crypto Momentum\nAt the peak of global trade tensions, recession predictions for the United States were being thrown around with alarming frequency. Back in March, markets reeled after Trump rolled out a barrage of retaliatory tariffs under what he theatrically called “Liberation Day.” The timing could not have been worse.\nThe Federal Reserve had already been trimming its balance sheet, and early GDP models from the Atlanta Fed pointed to a possible 1.5% contraction. Panic crept into Wall Street. Goldman Sachs raised its 12-month recession forecast to 45%, and on Polymarket, the chance of a 2025 U.S. recession soared to 66%.\nThe US recession odds are starting to look like a media rug pull.\n— Polymarket (@Polymarket) June 11, 2025\n22% chance.\nBut as always, markets move faster than politics. The trade narrative has softened. Behind the scenes, negotiations with China have resumed, and financial conditions have started to ease. Analysts coined the term “TACO,” which is short for “Trump Always Chickens Out,” to describe the president’s pattern of hard posturing followed by quiet reversals. That trend seems to be playing out once again. In fact, Goldman recently revised its own recession odds downward to 30%.\nMore notably, Polymarket data now shows just 22% odds of a U.S. recession in 2025, which is the lowest level since February. That is not just a sentiment shift but rather a signal. As macro anxiety fades, capital is returning to risk-on sectors. And crypto, ever sensitive to shifts in liquidity, has already begun to climb. Investors are not just buying the dip. They are repositioning ahead of what could be another strong leg upward.\nBest Crypto to Buy Now - Tokens That May Gain Attention\nSUBBD\nWhile most platforms continue to chase after technical breakthroughs, SUBBD has remained fixed on an entirely different question: how can content itself be restructured in a Web3 world? The result is not another creator coin or superficial media layer, but an evolving ecosystem where creator-led communities build their own narrative economies.\nAt its core, SUBBD allows content creators to tokenize engagement. Every post, reaction, and exchange becomes measurable value in a system that prioritizes cultural output over mere transactions.\nThe timing of SUBBD’s rise is no accident. As macro volatility gripped markets through the early part of the year, speculative bets on NFTs and creator coins largely fell quiet. But with the sharp decline in recession expectations and easing trade tensions, risk appetite is returning in sectors that were previously treated as fringe.\nContent, long overlooked during periods of economic anxiety, is finding its way back to center stage. For many, SUBBD is a well-placed bet on that shift, which is a notion shared by many creators, including popular education channels like 99Bitcoins.\nWhat makes the platform stand out is its structural clarity. It does not pretend to compete with Layer 1s, and it does not brand itself as a speculative token farm. Instead, it carves out a lean infrastructure for ownership, attribution, and community-led monetization. The bet here is not just on creators. It is on the enduring value of attention and cultural capital. And in a market where attention is once again becoming liquid, SUBBD may finally be aligned with a broader macro upswing.\nBest Wallet Token\nThere was a stretch of time when wallets were treated as little more than interface tools. But Best Wallet has built something that defies that old categorization. It is not merely a place to store assets or sign transactions. It is, increasingly, a critical checkpoint in how users interact with the entire crypto ecosystem.\nThe token behind it, Best Wallet Token, serves as more than just a governance layer. It is gradually becoming the connective tissue for rewards, priority access, and ecosystem engagement.\nWhat gives this project a fresh layer of relevance now is not just its fundamentals, but the moment in which it sits. With the U.S. recession narrative softening and trade risk easing, on-chain activity has started picking up pace. This is the precise environment in which wallet infrastructure gains renewed utility. Users are exploring again. They are bridging, swapping, testing, and holding. And they are doing it through wallets that offer more than passive functionality.\nBest Wallet has leaned into that trend. Its token ties directly into platform activity, user tiers, and even social modules that let users explore and curate content around their crypto behavior. In a way, it reflects the structural convergence now happening across DeFi, NFTs, and social layers. This is not a project banking on hype cycles. It is aligned with deeper user behavior. And if the broader macro tailwinds hold, tokens like this will likely benefit as more users re-enter the space with clearer intent.\nToken 6900\nEvery cycle has its wild card. A project that breaks every rule of design logic, mocks its own existence, and still captures the moment better than anything polished or pitch-decked. Token 6900 is exactly that. It is absurd, self-aware, visually chaotic, and somehow razor sharp in its timing. It exists to ridicule and revive the very idea of what memecoins used to represent before they became corporate mascots. And in doing so, it might have become the most accurately tuned asset for this phase of the market.\nEarlier this year, projects like this would have been shrugged off as noise. Recession fears were dominating headlines, liquidity was tight, and regulatory chatter had everyone bracing for impact. But now, as macro fears ease and crypto regains a speculative pulse, the market is warming again to irreverence.\nif i buy token 6900 baddies will come to me pic.twitter.com/APhCEbbTio\n— Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 5, 2025\nAnd that is where Token 6900 finds its edge. It is not pretending to be the next Solana. It is playing to the moment. One filled with irony, speed, and cultural backlash against over-designed token models.\nIt is also chasing the shadow of SPX 6900, which was a cult success in its own chaotic lane. But this time, the presentation is even bolder. Token 6900 has no roadmap in the traditional sense. What it does have is an aesthetic language that speaks directly to the degen class of users waiting for the next cultural combustion. And in a market just beginning to loosen again, that kind of madness has often proven to be strangely well-timed.\nSnorter\nSnorter is not a meme. It is a mechanism disguised as one. On the surface, it looks like another Telegram-based bot project vying for relevance in a saturated space. But a closer look reveals something else entirely. Snorter is building a real-time AI-layered command suite for crypto operations directly inside Telegram, the very place where most Web3 communities actually live.\nThat framing alone shifts how it should be evaluated. This is not a wallet, not an exchange, not a news feed. It is a functional layer that exists between user intent and market execution.\nSnorter’s relevance has only grown in light of recent macro reversals. During periods of high volatility and recession panic, automation tools take a backseat. Traders flee to simplicity, and retail interest fades. But as risk-on appetite returns, users begin demanding agility again. They want tools that can scan, sort, execute, and alert — without requiring tab hopping or switching platforms. And Snorter, by existing entirely within the social fabric of crypto chat culture, answers that demand with eerie precision.\nIts AI engine is not a gimmick. It allows Snorter to process natural language prompts, filter through volumes of token data, and deliver instant command execution for everything from price tracking to sniping.\nFor traders who live inside Telegram already, it offers a seamless experience. For the broader market, it represents a direction where UX and utility are finally converging. If the macro calm holds and market activity accelerates, Snorter may well become one of the few tools that feels necessary rather than optional.\nConclusion\nWith economic anxiety subsiding and capital flowing back into risk-on sectors, crypto is beginning to reassert itself as a viable and dynamic space for opportunistic entry. This is not merely a rebound. It is a recalibration.\nFor investors looking to re-engage, the current moment offers a window where narrative, momentum, and utility are finally aligning. Several quality projects stand out in this setting, not just for their timing but for how precisely they are positioned within it, making it a good time to buy.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The secret lies in its free-to-play onboarding experience, engineered to be familiar, rewarding, and scalable. Early evidence suggests this approach is resonating: with meaningful user adoption, on-chain engagement, and sustained price momentum.\nPresent-Day Market Snapshot\nFUNToken is trading around $0.0100, reflecting a 24-hour trading volume near $12 million and a market capitalization of approximately $110 million.\nThese statistics underscore that FUNToken is generating real interest and liquidity, rather than fleeting hype: a trend reinforced by consistent community growth and quarterly ecosystem updates.\nFree-to-Play Meets Mobile-First Gaming\nSeamless Entry with Zero Cost\nThe cornerstone of FUNToken’s strategy is allowing users to earn tokens without investing money upfront. Through the Telegram AI bot, new participants can engage in simple tasks and receive $FUN rewards immediately. This frictionless experience feels just like playing casual mobile games, making blockchain participation feel natural rather than intimidating.\nDesigned for Global Mobile Users\nFUNToken’s onboarding flows were built for mobile-first users. Everything runs inside Telegram and mobile-friendly web views. There is no need to install external wallets or manage complex seed phrases. Users can participate from anywhere, using data-conserving interfaces and preserving language familiarity. Over 105,000 users are already active in Telegram, and growth remains strong: averaging 10-15 percent monthly.\nConnecting Free Play and Real Utility\nRevenue-Backed Burn Model\nTokens distributed through the free-to-play experience are net positive for the ecosystem because every reward pulls from platform revenue, which is tied to concrete usage. The recent 25 million $FUN burn on June 24 was fully paid from revenue rather than reserves. Every quarterly burn permanently reduces supply and increases the real value of tokens users earn.\nRoadmap Alignment\nBy Q3–Q4 2025, FUNToken plans to launch its mobile wallet and staking features. Community members familiar with the bot and comfortable with small token rewards can smoothly transition into deeper utility. This gradual approach ensures the user funnel remains warm before introducing more advanced features.\nTrust That Supports Growth\nCertiK Audit and Skynet Monitoring\nSecurity is another pillar in FUNToken’s offering. The project passed a full CertiK audit, certifying that the smart contract is immutable and mint-proof. Regular real-time monitoring through CertiK Skynet prevents exploits, earning confidence from participants who might otherwise distrust crypto ecosystems. The result has been stronger retention, as users understand both the playground and the rules are safe.\nEvidence of Traction and Momentum\nThe Telegram AI bot functions as both an onboarding and retention mechanism. With over 105,000 active users, it illustrates how free-to-play mechanics can build organic network growth. Early AInvest data shows that 30 percent of these users return daily and many begin staking or preparing for upcoming features.\nPrice and Volume Validation\nThe free-to-play model may be unconventional in crypto, but it has correlated with notable market activity. FUNToken has traded in a range between $0.010–$0.0118 over the past two weeks, supported by daily volumes that often exceed $10 million. These metrics suggest that token distribution via gameplay is translating into real liquidity and trading activity.\nChallenges and Considerations\nOnce users earn small amounts, the next step must involve clear incentives to stay active. The roadmap’s mobile wallet and staking features will be critical in sustaining engagement.\nProgrammatic exploitation of reward systems is a risk. FUNToken must continue evolving its Telegram bot with engagement tracking, limits, and real-user verification mechanisms.\nAs user volume grows, infrastructure must adapt to handle high transaction volumes, wallet loads, and on-chain activities without service degradation.\nWhy FUNToken’s Strategy May Succeed\nHere are some reasons why FUNToken is on the right track, and they’re likely to succeed if they stick to their strategies.\nActionable, zero-cost entry for gamers makes adoption accessible worldwide.\nOne of the biggest barriers to onboarding in crypto is the expectation that users must invest before they understand the ecosystem. FUNToken flips this model by letting people earn tokens without spending any money.\nWhether a user is in Southeast Asia, Latin America, or Europe, they can start participating immediately with just a mobile phone and a Telegram account. This approach dramatically widens the funnel to include anyone curious about play-to-earn, without financial risk or technical barriers.\nReward mechanics that feel familiar and fun reinforce daily use and habit formation.\nFUNToken’s design borrows heavily from casual mobile games that use streaks, achievements, and small daily bonuses to create consistent engagement.\nThe AI-powered $FUN Telegram bot gives instant positive feedback when users complete challenges or interact with the community. Over time, these small incentives help establish routines that keep users coming back, just as daily quests do in popular gaming apps.\nLinking free play to revenue and burns ensures that tokens are not inflationary.\nA critical flaw in many play-to-earn ecosystems is uncontrolled supply. FUNToken counters this by tying all distributed rewards to a revenue-backed burn cycle.\nWhen users earn tokens through free-to-play engagement, platform revenue is simultaneously allocated to buy back and permanently remove supply. The June 24 burn of 25 million FUN was an example of this mechanism in action. This dynamic keeps the token economy balanced and creates confidence that early adopters won’t see their holdings diluted over time.\nStructured roadmap progression keeps users engaged through deeper utility over time.\nThe roadmap outlines a clear path beyond initial participation. After users experience the Telegram bot, they can transition into staking, gaming interactions, and wallet-based activity when the mobile wallet launches in Q3–Q4 2025.\nThis layered approach means that no user feels overwhelmed on day one, but there is always a next step to explore. As each milestone comes online, the platform gradually evolves from simple earning to more sophisticated engagement, building loyalty along the way.\nIndustry-grade security and transparency builds trust, particularly among skeptical or first-time crypto participants.\nFUNToken has placed a premium on verification and accountability. The CertiK audit confirmed that the smart contract is immutable and cannot be manipulated to mint extra tokens. CertiK Skynet provides ongoing, real-time monitoring so the community can see that no changes occur without notice.\nThis combination of proven security practices and clear, public reporting helps reassure new users - especially those who may have been hesitant to trust blockchain platforms in the past - that FUNToken is a safe environment to participate and grow.\nConclusion\nFUNToken’s free-to-play model may represent a turning point in mainstream blockchain adoption. By meeting mobile users where they are and providing value upfront, it reduces friction and builds trust by design. Coupled with a revenue-backed burn model, CertiK-verified contracts, and a clear roadmap, FUNToken’s approach combines inclusion, security, and economic sustainability. If execution holds, it might just redefine how projects attract and retain millions in the global gaming community.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Indicators are now pointing to an imminent price surge. How soon could this take place?\nUS spending about to push assets higher\nAs Bitcoin jockeys for position, ready for a potential incoming surge, the passing of President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” on Thursday, with the promise of $5 trillion in new spending, is likely to provide plenty of fuel for Bitcoin’s next upward trajectory.\nThe amount of new money that can hit the US economy could be akin to that of the vast wall of money that was printed by the US administration during the Covid pandemic. Rightly or wrongly, given the gargantuan pile of debt that the US already has outstanding, the incoming tsunami of money from the US, plus increasing levels of global liquidity, should push all assets very much higher.\n$BTC back above the bull flag - but not spiking yet\nSource: TradingView\nAs seen on the 4-hour time frame, the $BTC price is back above the upper trendline of the bull flag. Granted that it’s still not surging, and that the Stochastic RSI is rolling back over, a big pump to the upside may not happen for a little while yet.\nThe price is following an ascending trendline (faint dotted line) but it would not be a surprise if $BTC fell through this and continued to roll along the upper bull flag trendline for a period, although the setup is looking very bullish and a spike higher could come at any time.\nA retest of the bull flag breakout?\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily time frame reveals how the price has moved back out of the flag and could be about to test the top of the bull flag upper trendline. Bulls will be hoping that this is a successful test and not another fakeout.\nTo make the test, the price would need to come down to around $108,500. This could also allow the price to remain above the ascending trendline.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the RSI has the indicator line pointing downward, but this may be to allow another retest of the yellow moving average line. Staying above this line, and getting above the 70.00 level will be key.\nBullish weekly close provides platform for imminent surge\nSource: TradingView\nThe weekly time frame view shows that a candle body has opened above the upper trendline of the bull flag. While this is very bullish, just as bullish is the cross back up of the indicators on the Stochastic RSI. This comes at the same time as a cross up on the 2-week time frame.\nWith price action looking very positive, and indicators also closing the last week with bullish signals, it would seem as though it’s just a matter of time before the next Bitcoin price surge.

{"title": "From human hands to autonomous agents and what the future of digital finance holds", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/from-human-hands-to-autonomous-agents-and-what-the-future-of-digital-finance-holds", "text": "The global financial arena has entered a new era, one where autonomous agents (AI-driven programs capable of making and executing decisions) are handling tasks once reserved for human experts exclusively.\nAs part of this shift from human-centric to agent-driven finance, complex operations such as trading and portfolio management are being automated with unprecedented speed and precision, with the implications of this transition being profound for both everyday retail investors and large institutions.\nTo this point, across most major equity markets, an estimated 60–75% of their respective trading volumes (as of 2024) are now being handled by algorithms as they can process millions of data points and execute trades in milliseconds, operating quite literally a thousand times faster than any human expert.\nThe numbers are eye-watering\nRetail investors are also increasingly entrusting their money with these so-called robo-advisors, as evidenced by the fact that the assets under management (AUM) with these entities soared from roughly $200 billion in 2018 to over $1.1 trillion last year.\nInstitutional investors have likewise adapted, with banks and hedge funds now embracing more autonomous AI in everything from trade execution to risk management. In fact, by the end of 2021 alone, about 70% of the U.S. stock market’s daily trade volume was being executed by AI-driven algorithms (a figure that has only continued to climb since)\nAs expected, early adopters reported improved efficiency and consistency, making one thing clear markets across the globe are becoming more agent-friendly, guided by humans only in certain specialized instances.\nThe result has been a more continuous, optimized deployment of capital, with less friction from human schedules or limitations. Therefore, with each passing year, the line between what an individual investor can achieve as compared to a large firm is blurring rapidly, heralding a more inclusive and efficient financial system.\nAutonomous agents in action\nFrom the outside looking in, the emergence of this paradigm has been more evident within the decentralized finance (DeFi) arena than in any other sector. A prime example is Giza’s ARMA offering, a pioneering autonomous financial entity that continuously optimizes stablecoin yields across different lending protocols, essentially acting as a digital portfolio manager for depositors.\nSince its launch, ARMA has provided a compelling proof of concept for its vision, as in just the first few weeks of its debut, it was able to independently manage over $1.12 million in user assets and generate more than $6.6 million in transaction volume.\nFurthermore, as of May 16, ARMA had been able to accrue a total operational volume of $32 million, gather more than $3.1 million in assets under agent (AUA), and lap up nearly 102k autonomous transactions.\nAll of this was possible because ARMA is able to execute trades and rebalance positions continuously (often hundreds of times a day), with the Giza team noting that their internal backtesting has allowed ARMA’s strategies to outperform any individual lending market by 83% (over a four-month period).\nEqually important is the fact that ARMA has functioned without compromising on security or user control. All of its furious transaction activity has been executed in a non-custodial manner, such that even though users deposit funds into smart contracts, they retain complete ownership of their assets as the agent is simply authorized to move those funds within set parameters.\nTo elaborate, by operating within predefined constraints and safety checks, the agent avoids the kind of errors or abuses that might be feared when handing over one’s keys to a machine. For users, this means enjoying the benefits of automatic strategy execution while preserving full sovereignty over their assets.\nBridging complexity and sovereignty with ease\nTrue self-sovereignty can become an empty ideal if the cognitive burden on users is so high that they have to revert to centralized intermediaries for added convenience. In this context, Giza’s answer has been to provide an intelligent agent layer that absorbs complexity while preserving the user’s autonomy.\nIn the firm’s lexicon, this burgeoning paradigm can be referred to as “Xenocognitive Finance,” meaning a financial ecosystem that transcends human cognitive boundaries through agentic automation while keeping users in control.\nTherefore, as this sector evolves and grows, Giza is positioning itself at its helm, developing an SDK for others to build custom agents. This hints at an approaching Cambrian explosion of automated finance, so the least one can expect is an interesting time ahead.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "How Confidential Token Swaps Enhance Security While Maintaining Compliance", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/how-confidential-token-swaps-enhance-security-while-maintaining-compliance", "text": "One of the most intrinsic things about blockchain is its transparency, with all transactions recorded on a public ledger, where they can be viewed and verified by anyone. This transparency is critical to the design of blockchains, as it’s what fosters trust and enables peer-to-peer interactions without the need for any middleman.\nYet, it’s also problematic, making it difficult to reconcile blockchain with existing data privacy regulations, and it can also expose users to a number of risks, such as front-running attacks, financial surveillance, and the possibility of being targeted by criminals.\nIn response to these challenges, numerous privacy-focused blockchains and decentralized finance protocols have emerged, offering innovative solutions to confidentiality that aim to protect users and their data while maintaining enough transparency for users to transact securely. They’re based on an assortment of clever techniques, including zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, stealth addresses, privacy coins, and more.\nThe problems of blockchain transparency\nAlthough blockchain is often praised for its transaction security, it’s also something of a paradox in that it often sits at the opposing end of the technological spectrum in terms of privacy. The decentralized nature of blockchain is only possible because of its transparent and public architecture and is what makes the technology so secure. But it’s also detrimental for user’s privacy, leaving their transactions exposed to anyone who cares to look at them.\nThe lack of privacy in blockchain transactions is problematic with regards to compliance with data privacy regulations such as Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation. Known as GDPR, this landmark legislation was enacted by the EU in 2018 and decrees that individuals should be able to exercise significant control over their data. For instance, companies must obtain users’ explicit consent to be able to process their data, and those users must also be able to access and rectify any personal information or records kept by those companies. In addition, GDPR also stipulates a right to be forgotten, where users can request to have certain publicly available information erased completely.\nThat explains why it’s challenging for blockchains, which are known for being immutable, to comply with the GDPR. On networks such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, once data is recorded, it cannot be altered or erased, which seems to clash with the ideas of data erasure or rectification under the GDPR. Moreover, it’s also not possible to identify a “controller” of blockchain data, as these networks are operated by a network of independent nodes.\nLack of transaction privacy can also create problems specifically for users. The transparent nature of blockchain makes it relatively easy for criminals to identify and potentially target wealthy individuals. While blockchain wallets are essentially anonymous, in that they’re merely a number, with a bit of determination, it’s possible to link certain wallets to individuals. For instance, if someone posts an NFT on their social media profile, it might be possible to identify that user’s crypto wallet, and if that happens, it’s a trivial matter to establish how much funds they possess.\nThe dangers of this became all too clear earlier this year with a spate of kidnappings of crypto executives and their family members in France. In June, authorities arrested and charged 25 individuals over a series of abductions of prominent crypto figures in that country. In several instances, the kidnappers reportedly demanded significant ransom payments in exchange for the release of their victims.\nThere are other risks, too. For instance, rival traders can take advantage of blockchain’s transparency to surveil the investment strategies of crypto whales and other institutions, while those trading large volumes of cryptocurrencies are often subject to “front-running attacks”, where automated bots insert their transactions ahead of large buy and sell orders to profit from the price impact of such trades.\nHow Has The Industry Responded?\nStill, these challenges do not necessarily mean that blockchain is incompatible with privacy requirements. Rather, they have invited yet more innovation in the crypto industry, with numerous projects attempting to create novel solutions that respect users’ privacy rights while maintaining decentralization and transparency. One popular technique is the “hashing” of personal data, which involves masking information with a numerical value to protect users’ identities. In addition, some developers are working on “off-chain” storage solutions or permissioned blockchains that are only visible to eligible users. Such innovations demonstrate how data privacy headaches can stimulate innovation instead of holding it back.\nSome of the earliest solutions for blockchain privacy were privacy coins like Monero, Zcash, and Firo, which mask their ledgers using cryptographic techniques and make transactions untraceable. Monero utilizes ring signatures, which merge chunks of blockchain data to make it impossible to link a specific transaction with an individual wallet, while Zcash uses a different technology known as “zk-SNARKS. In this case, it allows users to verify transactions by proving they know the amounts sent and the addresses involved, but without publicly disclosing those details. As for Firo, it uses a different cryptographic protocol called Lelantus that achieves the same thing.\nThese privacy coins provide clear advantages in terms of user privacy and anonymity, but they have also faced considerable scrutiny and attracted a reputation as favorites for cybercriminals, as they can be used to mask illicit activities such as money laundering and ransom payments.\nThis has led to a focus on more balanced privacy solutions that attempt to be more palatable in terms of regulations. Aleo is a privacy-focused blockchain network that employs Zero-Knowledge Proofs to secure transactions and smart contracts and give users control over their financial data, while simultaneously catering to regulatory bodies that demand transparency and accountability to prevent fraud and other illicit financial activities.\nAleo incorporates a trio of features designed to ensure it can meet compliance obligations without forsaking privacy. For instance, it supports the “selective disclosure” of certain pieces of data, so users can prove they are in compliance with regulations without revealing personal information. It means they can demonstrate their financial dealings are legitimate by proving the origin of their funds and showing they comply with tax obligations while maintaining privacy.\nAdditinally, Aleo also supports auditability under certain circumstances. For instance, it can disclose specific transaction details with the approval of the parties involved, or when governments go through the correct legal channels while ensuring that no unauthorized parties will ever be privy to such information. Aleo also offers compliance tooling for developers, such as the ability to embed regulatory checks into smart contracts.\nSecret Network is an alternative to blockchain privacy that leverages “secure enclaves” to process transactions in hardware-protected environments. This ensures data can be processed with full confidentiality, so data remains hidden from unauthorized access. The network is further fortified by its consensus mechanism, which encrypts transaction details during transmission and storage.\nThis may seem like Secret Network contravenes most compliance requirements, but it gets around this through its native SCRT token, which serves as the backbone of its network and adheres to various evolving global regulatory frameworks. Because Secret Network utilizes mechanisms such as staking and transaction fees, it promotes accountability and transparency, helping it to function within various compliance layers while guaranteeing user anonymity and data privacy.\nAnother innovative approach is employed by Railgun, a privacy-focused protocol that uses ZK-proofs to mask smart contract actions, so users can interact with DeFi in a private and secure way. Alongside ZK-proofs, it implements a mechanism known as Proof-of-Innocence, through which users can verify that they did not interact with any blacklisted crypto wallets or suspicious addresses linked to illicit activities. It provides cryptographic proof of non-interaction for users to show they are not a hacker or bad actor.\nA Catalyst For Privacy Innovation\nThe transparency of blockchain is rightly hailed as one of the most significant technological breakthroughs this century, paving the way for trustless financial systems with unprecedented user security. Yet, the focus on transparency paradoxically encroaches on users’ privacy and safety from another angle, creating the need to strike a delicate balance between disclosure and discretion.\nHowever, rather than create an impasse, this tension has helped to catalyze the development of pioneering new approaches to privacy, illustrating how such difficulties tend to increase innovation instead of stifling it. With the emergence of privacy-focused blockchains such as Aleo and Railgun, blockchain users can remain safe and secure with full anonymity, without falling foul of regulatory concerns.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This is a way of mining Bitcoin remotely, whereby you rent hashing power in data centers that have the necessary equipment. By 2025, cloud mining will have developed, and multiple providers will deliver legitimate services in which a user may begin earning free Bitcoin. The best five legit cloud mining sites that pay free Bitcoins for mining shall be discussed in this article with emphasis laid on the reputable and reliable sites where you can mine Bitcoins passively without having to make any initial investment.\nHow Free Cloud Mining Works\nCloud mining involves renting mining power in a company which has mining equipments in some distant data center.

Infrastructure platforms are gaining prominence for their groundbreaking solutions, while a fresh player is capturing attention through viral trends. This piece delves into how these entities are influencing the market during this bullish surge.\nPrice Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible?\nXYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains.\nThe broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch.\nKey Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market:\n-\nStrong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal\n-\nDeflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure\n-\nLiquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch\n-\nCommunity incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding\nPrice Prediction for $XYZ\n-\nCurrent Presale Price: $0.003333\n-\nProjected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates)\n-\nPotential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO)\n-\nLong-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings)\nBuy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential\nRealistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10?\nA 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on:\n-\nStrong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day.\n-\nSustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement.\n-\nMarket Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit.\nIs a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ?\nXYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable.\nInvest in $XYZ Before It Surges\nHyperliquid: Revolutionizing DeFi with Speed and Zero Fees\nHyperliquid is a new blockchain platform transforming decentralized finance (DeFi). It has built its own Layer 1 blockchain from the ground up, focusing on speed and scalability. With its unique HyperBFT consensus mechanism, transactions are fast and secure. A standout feature is its decentralized exchange for perpetual futures trading without gas fees. This means users can trade quickly without extra costs.\nWhat sets Hyperliquid apart is its fully on-chain order book, offering more transparency and security. The team behind it comes from top institutions like Harvard, Caltech, and MIT, bringing a wealth of expertise. As a self-funded project, Hyperliquid stays true to its vision without outside influence. In today's market, where speed and low costs matter, Hyperliquid's features make it an attractive option. Its focus on efficiency and transparency sets it apart in the DeFi space.\nOndo Finance: Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain for All\nOndo Finance is changing how people access financial products. By blending the reliability of traditional finance with the efficiency of blockchain technology, Ondo tokenizes stable, income-generating real-world assets. This means high-grade financial products become accessible to more people. Ondo has two main parts: an asset management arm that creates these tokenized products, and a technology arm that builds decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Together, they enhance the functionality and scalability of Ondo's offerings, making them more efficient and accessible.\nIn today's market, where trust and security are important, Ondo stands out. It works with reputable partners like BlackRock and uses Coinbase for asset custody. Their product, USDY, combines the stability of a stablecoin with the added benefit of yield, backed by US Treasuries and bank deposits. This approach provides non-US investors with high-quality, regulated, and transparent financial products. While many cryptocurrencies face ups and downs, Ondo's focus on real-world assets and compliance could make it an attractive option for those interested in both traditional finance and blockchain innovation.\nConclusion\nThough HYPE and ONDO have merit, XYZVerse distinguishes itself as a sports-focused memecoin targeting massive growth and community engagement, potentially becoming a cultural icon.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

But just as some investors were bracing for another wave of uncertainty, a different kind of crypto announcement stormed into the spotlight. Bitcoin Solaris, the high-speed, mobile-first blockchain project, confirmed its listing on LBank and dropped a surprise announcement that’s already sending shockwaves through Live Coin Watch Data. A 72-hour price rollback to just $5, timed perfectly before the listing, has traders scrambling for a piece of what’s quickly becoming the most talked-about coin in the market.\nWorldcoin Wavers, BTC-S Surges\nWorldcoin has certainly built its name on big ideas. With ambitions tied to global identity systems and eye-scanning devices, it captured attention early. But that attention often comes with price swings that make even seasoned traders a little nervous. While the project deserves credit for tackling ambitious goals, recent fluctuations have raised more questions than confidence.\nIn contrast, Bitcoin Solaris is proving that speed, simplicity, and surprise can go a long way. Instead of pushing futuristic narratives, it’s delivering something tangible, immediate, and exciting, especially with a limited-time rollback that feels more like a flash sale than a crypto event.\nA New Era of Mining That Fits in Your Pocket\nForget bulky hardware and soaring electricity bills. Bitcoin Solaris is ushering in a new era of mobile-first mining that anyone can access with the upcoming Solaris Nova App. Designed for efficiency and scalability, the app allows users to mine directly from their smartphones, no rigs, no overheating, just pure convenience. It’s already turning heads among GPU-weary veterans who want passive income without the pain.\nAnd the best part? The current mining model is backed by a high-throughput network capable of up to 100,000 TPS through its Solaris Layer. That’s not just fast, that’s lightning in blockchain form.\nYou can even estimate your mining potential with the official Bitcoin Solaris calculator, giving users clear projections on earnings before they get started.\nIn addition, Bitcoin Solaris introduced daily mini games for its holders for a chance to earn daily rewards, checkout all the details here.\nCore Features Setting BTC-S Apart\nWhat’s making Bitcoin Solaris the darling of Live Coin Watch this week isn’t just hype or the LBank listing. It’s the tech stack under the hood. Here’s why analysts and investors are jumping in:\n-\nDual-layer consensus model combining PoW for security and DPoS for performance.\n-\nValidator rotation every 24 hours ensures decentralization and avoids monopolies.\n-\nDynamic block sizes up to 32MB and block time of 15 seconds on the Solaris Layer.\n-\nAdvanced smart contract support using Rust, compatible with Solana’s dev tools.\n-\nEnergy efficiency improved by over 99 percent compared to traditional mining.\nCrypto’s Next Giant Isn’t a Clone It’s Bitcoin Solaris\nSome of the most active crypto influencers are covering it too, including:\n-\nA feature breakdown from Token Empire that highlights the speed and accessibility of the project.\n-\nToken Galaxy showcasing the potential of the mobile mining model.\n-\nCrypto Vlog analyzing the technical architecture in depth.\nAnd behind the scenes, Bitcoin Solaris has passed not one, but two audits one from Cyberscope and another from Freshcoins. That means trust isn’t just implied, it’s verified.\nThe Presale Storm and the $5 Rollback\nWith over 13,900 users already onboard and more than $6.3 million raised, the Bitcoin Solaris presale has already outpaced expectations. The presale is currently in Phase 11 with a price of $11 per token. However, for just 72 hours, the team is rolling back the price to $5, giving both new buyers and hesitant watchers a rare window to jump in before it returns to $11 and heads toward its $20 launch target.\nIt’s rare to see a presale offer a rollback like this, and rarer still when the fundamentals are this strong. The 72-hour countdown isn’t just about pricing, it’s a test of who’s ready to take action.\n-\nLess than 4 weeks remain before the listing.\n-\nAlready one of the shortest and fastest-moving presales in the market.\n-\nWallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless token delivery after launch.\nBuilt to Scale and Built to Last\nThe architecture behind Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just flashy, it’s solid. With a Base Layer throughput of up to 3,000 TPS and a Solaris Layer pushing performance to 100,000 TPS, the system can handle mass adoption. Cross-layer transactions are synchronized through secure block commitments, while validator rotation prevents centralization and keeps the network fair.\nMore importantly, the token distribution is smart and sustainable. With a fixed 21 million BTC-S cap, the tokenomics ensures long-term growth and community control:\n-\n66.66% allocated for mining\n-\n20% reserved for presale\n-\n5% for liquidity\n-\n2% for marketing, staking rewards, ecosystem development, and community rewards each\n-\n0.33% for the team and advisors\nThis guarantees that the majority of BTC-S remains in the hands of actual users and miners, not locked behind private deals.\nFinal Thoughts\nBitcoin Solaris is pulling off what most projects only dream of. With a real-use mobile mining app on the horizon, dual-consensus security, and a high-speed blockchain that doesn’t compromise on decentralization, BTC-S is on a collision course with mainstream success. And with the LBank listing confirmed and a surprise price rollback live for just 72 hours, the timing couldn’t be better.\nWhether you're a seasoned miner tired of chasing hash rates or a new investor looking for a smarter way in, this is your moment. When the dust settles, you’ll either be part of the Bitcoin Solaris movement, or wishing you had been.\nFor more information on Bitcoin Solaris:\nWebsite: https://www.bitcoinsolaris.com/\nTelegram: https://t.me/Bitcoinsolaris\nX: https://x.com/BitcoinSolaris\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

AGNT Could Be the Ultimate Upside Play for Q3", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/swapping-trx-or-bnb-agnt-could-be-the-ultimate-upside-play-for-q3", "text": "The digital currency market is buzzing with activity as investors explore new opportunities. With increased attention on cryptocurrencies like TRX and BNB, a surprising contender has come into play: AGNT. As the market experiences a bull run, AGNT is being touted as a potential top performer this quarter, intriguing many in the trading community.\nAn emerging contender, Codename:Pepe crypto, is also catching eyes with its unique approach. It aims to cut through the noise of fake AI promises, offering genuine smart trading strategies. Inspired by the legendary PEPE coin's success, this project aims for significant returns by leveraging artificial intelligence. Its community-driven mission is building momentum amid the ongoing market surge.\nCodename:Pepe Sells Out Presale in Record Time, $AGNT Eyes 1000x Surge\nCodename:Pepe, the latest entrant in the meme coin arena, has successfully concluded the presale of its native $AGNT tokens ahead of schedule and is now preparing for its upcoming listing on a major cryptocurrency exchange.\nBy merging AI-powered functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins, Codename:Pepe taps into two of the most dominant trends in the crypto space today.\n$AGNT Presale Sells Out Early\nAmid growing investor enthusiasm for AI-driven crypto ventures, Codename:Pepe completed all 28 stages of its $AGNT token presale in just a few months, well ahead of expectations. The swift sellout underscores strong community interest and bullish sentiment surrounding the project.\nSource: Codename:Pepe X account\nNext on the roadmap is the Token Generation Event (TGE) and exchange listing. Within the community, anticipation is building that $AGNT could soar as much as 1000x from its presale launch price.\nWhy $AGNT Could Be the Next 1000x Meme Coin\nCodename:Pepe is engineered to be a smart, adaptive platform. According to its developers, the AI framework is designed to:\n-\nSpot Emerging Meme Coins\n-\nAnalyze Market Sentiment\n-\nDeliver Actionable Trading Insights\n-\nOptimize Automated Trading\nThe development team is actively enhancing both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the platform evolves in tandem with the broader crypto ecosystem.\nCodename:Pepe brings together two of the most compelling forces in today’s market: AI innovation and meme coin virality. With a focus on real utility, intelligent automation, and community-powered growth, it stands out among the latest wave of crypto launches.\nAs the listing date approaches and momentum builds, the limited presale supply and tiered pricing model could make $AGNT one of the top-performing tokens post-launch, possibly achieving 1000x growth from its presale price.\nGrab the Next 1000x Meme Coin — Get Ready for $AGNT Listing Now\nTRON Takes Off: Why TRX Is the Crypto to Watch in 2025 and Beyond\nTRON is a public blockchain platform that supports smart contracts. It's open-source and works smoothly with Ethereum. This means developers can easily move their apps from Ethereum to TRON. The platform aims to make transactions fast and cheap, giving users and developers a better experience.\nTRON uses a Proof-of-Stake system. This involves 27 super representatives who validate transactions and earn rewards. New blocks are added every three seconds, much faster than some older blockchains. This speed allows TRON to handle more transactions efficiently.\nIn early 2018, TRX, the coin that runs on the TRON network, hit an all-time high of $0.3004. Then, in December 2024, it surged nearly 100% to reach $0.4407. Although it has dipped since then, many are hopeful. With Donald Trump's second term, there's buzz about crypto growth. His World Liberty Financial platform bought $4.66 million worth of TRX in January 2025.\nExperts have positive predictions for TRX. By the end of 2025, it could reach up to $0.45. In 2026, it might climb to $0.60, and by 2030, it could hit $1.20. These numbers suggest strong potential for growth.\nTRON's technology and recent developments make it stand out in the crypto market. Its fast transactions and compatibility with Ethereum position it well for future success. Many are considering TRX as a promising investment in the current market cycle.\nBinance Coin's Future: Will BNB Soar Again?\nBinance Coin (BNB) powers the Binance exchange, one of the world's largest crypto platforms. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum network, BNB moved to the Binance Smart Chain for better speed and lower fees. It helps users trade hundreds of tokens and pay for services like travel and loans.\nBNB has strong potential due to its many uses. Binance buys back and burns BNB tokens each quarter, reducing supply and possibly increasing value. The coin also benefits from the popularity of new meme coins on the platform, boosting trading volumes since 2024.\nIn December 2024, BNB hit an all-time high of $793.35. Although it dipped slightly, it's still up 135% over the past year. Analysts like Altcoin Sherpa believe BNB can break past previous highs due to strong trading patterns. However, some experts, like W.E. Messamore, caution about regulatory challenges that could impact its growth.\nThe current market cycle shows promise for BNB. Predictions suggest it could surpass $1,000 in 2025 and reach up to $1,600 by 2026. By 2030, forecasts vary widely, with some expecting prices over $7,000. The long-term outlook depends on factors like market trends and regulatory developments.\nOverall, BNB's performance and growth potential make it a coin to watch. Its expanding use cases and Binance's strong position in the market could lead to new heights in the years ahead.\nConclusion\nIn the current bull run, established coins like TRX and BNB may offer limited short-term gains. Their growth is steady but might not match the rapid returns that newer projects can achieve.\nCodename:Pepe crypto presents a compelling opportunity for those seeking maximum profits. It leverages real artificial intelligence to identify promising meme coins, predict market trends, and provide early trading signals. With a capped supply and a community-driven model, it offers the potential for significant returns and active participation in its mission.\nFind out more about Codename:Pepe crypto here:\nCodename:Pepe ($AGNT) Telegram\nCodename:Pepe ($AGNT) Twitter/X\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In a market flooded with speculation, it’s Lightchain’s strategic rollout that’s catching the eyes of smart buyers who move before the headlines.\nDogecoin Rides Sentiment Waves With Meme-Driven Surges\nThe cult of DogeCoin (DOGE) has taken another turn toward extreme price volatility and bitter tears in the new year. The cryptocurrency had a one-day gain of 9.7% in May 2025, while trading volume jumped 66% to more than $3.3 billion. The surge was accompanied by a 58.9% increase in the open interest in derivatives, suggesting bullish sentiment among investors.\nInvestor sentiment continues to be very positive, with a sentiment score of 71/100 indicating that enthusiasm persists on online communities. Technical indicators point to a potential move toward resistance at $0.25 if the current momentum expands.\nAlthough Dogecoin price action is frequently affected by external factors like celebrity endorsements and social media trends, its recent gains show that meme-based assets still play a role in the cryptocurrency price landscape.\nLightchain AI Attracts Strategic Buyers Through Structured Presale Flow\nLightchain AI has successfully attracted strategic buyers through a meticulously structured presale flow that built momentum across 15 completed stages. Rather than rushing to market, Lightchain executed a phased approach, allowing community growth and investor confidence to scale alongside platform development.\nEach stage demonstrated clear progress, from architectural refinement to developer engagement, culminating in the launch of the Bonus Round. This final presale phase offers fixed token pricing ahead of mainnet and invites participation from long-term holders and builders alike.\nThe strategic reallocation of the 5% Team Allocation into grants and development incentives further solidified trust, aligning the ecosystem with builder-first values.

As the July 2025 mainnet launch nears, the project is gaining momentum not just in theory but through significant market participation and real-world anticipation.\nPolygon Discusses Scaling Solutions to Enhance Network Capacity\nPolygon is currently upgrading its blockchain infrastructure in a bid to boost scalability and network space. In Q1 2025, there was a 4.4% uptick in the average number of daily active addresses which logged 546,000, while daily transactions were up 8.0% at 3.4 million. These improvements were partially due to EIP-4844, which added “blobs” to lower the cost of Layer 1 posting, driving down average transaction fees 40.4% to $0.01.\nPushing the envelope, Polygon has moved to the POL token to improve staking and governance in its network. The release of AggLayer and the CDK framework advances a modular, interoperable blockchain development tenant of Polygon, helping them to emerge as an indispensable option for dApps.\nLightchain AI Successfully Completes 15 Presale Stages Raising Over $20.9M\nLightchain AI has successfully completed all 15 presale stages, raising over $20.9 million and marking a major milestone on its path to revolutionize decentralized AI blockchain technology.

It gained quick fame thanks to mentions by Vitalik Buterin and Elon Musk. Built on Ethereum, SHIB began as a simple payment token but soon expanded its ambitions.\nThe creators launched a decentralized exchange and an NFT project, adding real utility to SHIB. These moves attracted more users and set SHIB apart from other meme coins. The ecosystem grew with ventures into the metaverse, games, and merchandise.\nBy 2025, SHIB has experienced notable price movements. After its rise in 2021, it hovered around $0.00001. Predictions suggested it could reach up to $0.0000526 by 2025.

Coins like Ripple continue to lead cross-border payments, with the Ripple (XRP) price forecast staying strong amid new ETF chatter and cold wallet moves. Toncoin keeps building on its integration with Telegram, and the Toncoin (TON) price analysis points to growing real-world usage.\nYet BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out with its standout presale momentum, offering a limited-time entry at $0.0016 that unlocks a potential 3,025% ROI when the project hits its locked-in launch price of $0.05. Backed by a clear six-week launch plan to roll out its mainnet, community nodes, DeFi tools, and major exchange listings, BlockDAG’s roadmap proves it’s more than just hype; it’s building trust through real delivery. This comparison breaks down how Ripple, Toncoin, and BlockDAG stack up on adoption, scalability, and what could make BlockDAG the best crypto for the future.\nRipple Price Forecast Driven by ETF Moves and Payment Utility\nRipple remains one of the most practical crypto networks for moving value across borders. Its focus on real-world settlement speeds, minimal fees, and robust partnerships keeps the Ripple (XRP) price forecast underpinned by genuine demand. Recent developments, like the $1.7 million cold wallet move, hint that large holders see Ripple’s momentum carrying forward.\nMeanwhile, speculation about a 5% ETF breakout adds another layer of bullish sentiment. The main headwind continues to be regulatory hurdles, which can dampen large-scale institutional use if unresolved. Still, Ripple’s utility and network maturity make it a solid part of any shortlist when weighing the best crypto for the future.\nToncoin Price Analysis Gains Strength With Telegram’s Real-World Use\nToncoin is making waves thanks to its close integration with Telegram’s massive user base. The Toncoin (TON) price analysis shows positive momentum as the network unlocks new in-app payment tools and decentralized services that boost adoption. Its speed and security features give it an edge among practical blockchain solutions.\nTelegram’s active push for real TON utility keeps the project anchored in daily use, which many other networks lack. That said, questions remain about how the network will handle huge transaction volumes as its popularity scales. For now, Toncoin’s expanding reach and clear roadmap make it one to watch among the best crypto for the future.\nBlockDAG $0.0016 Entry & 3,025% ROI Backed by Six-Week Launch Plan\nBlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release now gives early buyers a rare chance to secure BDAG at just $0.0016 until August 11, setting up a profit potential of 3,025% when the project hits its locked-in launch price of $0.05. Currently in Batch 29 at $0.0276, BlockDAG already offers a 2,660% ROI since Batch 1, but this limited-time price massively expands the upside for anyone ready to move before the window closes.\nBacking this is a clear six-week launch plan that shows real action beyond presale hype. This next phase will see BlockDAG deliver on what many projects only promise: a real ecosystem built on transparency, community mining, and smart DeFi features to keep momentum strong right through launch and beyond.\nSix-week countdown to launch:\n-\nWeek 6: Presale closes, and wallet migration ends\n-\nWeek 4: Internal mainnet goes live with official nodes and ASIC rigs\n-\nWeek 3: Community-run nodes and mining pools activated\n-\nWeek 2: 40% of presale coins get unlocked; DEX, lending, cross-chain bridge, and launchpad roll out\n-\nWeek 1: Developer tools and early-stage dApps launch; major marketing push and exchange integration\n-\nLaunch Week: Early-access listing on lead exchange before expanding to multiple CEX platforms\nThis well-defined plan, paired with the rare $0.0016 entry point, shows exactly why BlockDAG stands out as a serious pick for anyone watching for the best crypto for the future.\nThe Bottom Line\nRipple’s proven payments network and the Ripple (XRP) price forecast keep it relevant, even as regulatory challenges linger. Toncoin’s expansion through Telegram’s real utility push gives it a strong use case, as the Toncoin (TON) price analysis shows steady growth potential. But BlockDAG’s unmatched presale success, the rare $0.0016 entry window that could unlock up to 3,025% profit, and its well-defined six-week launch plan put it ahead of both Ripple and Toncoin.\nWith clear steps from mainnet activation to DeFi rollout and multiple exchange listings, BlockDAG shows what it means to deliver on big promises. For anyone watching for the best crypto for the future, this short window could be the turning point to secure a stake before BlockDAG’s next phase leaves early buyers behind.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

However, all eyes are on Ruvi AI (RUVI), the new AI-powered blockchain token that has already delivered 50% ROI in a short time. According to industry experts, this could just be the beginning for Ruvi AI as it positions itself to exceed expectations. Backed by audited transparency, real-world applications, and unparalleled utility, Ruvi AI’s rise has been anything but ordinary.\nHere’s why analysts believe Ruvi AI could deliver even greater gains while leaving major competitors like Tron in its rearview mirror.\nBuilt on Transparency and Trust\nOne of Ruvi AI’s key strengths is its unwavering commitment to security and investor confidence. Unlike many speculative cryptocurrencies, Ruvi AI passed a rigorous third-party audit conducted by CyberScope, one of the top blockchain security specialists. This audit assures investors of the integrity and security of Ruvi AI’s smart contracts, mitigating the risks often associated with emerging tokens.\nAdding even more credibility is Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange, ensuring post-presale liquidity. This enables Ruvi AI investors to transition seamlessly into trading once the token is listed, addressing one of the most critical concerns for early backers. Together, these milestones establish Ruvi AI as a secure and promising investment opportunity.\nUtility-First Approach Paves the Way\nWhat sets Ruvi AI apart from projects like Tron is its groundbreaking focus on real-world utility. Where Tron is often associated with decentralized content-sharing solutions, Ruvi AI’s versatility spans marketing, entertainment, and finance, providing unparalleled scalability.\nReal Applications Deliver Real Value\n-\nMarketing\nBusinesses are tapping into Ruvi AI’s innovative AI-powered tools to optimize advertising strategies. These tools enhance campaign targeting, reduce budgetary waste, and deliver measurable ROI, critical for today’s competitive markets.\n-\nEntertainment\nRuvi AI offers blockchain-secured payment systems that ensure fair and transparent revenue-sharing for content creators. Coupled with AI-driven engagement insights, creators can understand their audience better and increase their impact.\n-\nFinance\nFinancial entities are utilizing Ruvi AI’s fraud detection systems and secure transaction capabilities. These integrations enhance operational trust while optimizing efficiency, critical for the financial sector’s evolution.\nRuvi AI’s diverse applications serve as a foundation for sustainable growth, ensuring the token’s value extends far beyond speculative trading.\nPresale Success Reflects Market Confidence\nRuvi AI’s ongoing presale is not only impressive but also indicative of growing investor demand. Some standout metrics include:\n-\n$2.2 million raised, giving the project robust financial backing.\n-\n180 million tokens sold, underscoring widespread market adoption.\n-\n2,000+ holders, showcasing a rapidly growing early adopter community.\nCurrently priced at $0.015 per token in Phase 2, Ruvi AI offers early investors significant upside potential. Once the presale concludes, the price will rise to $0.07, delivering a notable 5x ROI. Analysts further project Ruvi AI could reach $1 per token post-listing, providing an outstanding 66x ROI for initial investors.\nAmplify Returns with VIP Tiers\nTo further reward early adopters, Ruvi AI features an innovative VIP investment tier system, enabling investors to maximize their gains through exclusive bonuses. These tiers highlight the earning power of Ruvi AI’s presale:\n-\nVIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus):\n-\nTotal tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus).\n-\nValue at $0.07 per token: $4,900.\n-\nValue at $1 per token: $70,000.\n-\nVIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus):\n-\nTotal tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus).\n-\nValue at $0.07 per token: $15,680.\n-\nValue at $1 per token: $224,000.\n-\nVIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus):\n-\nTotal tokens received: 1,280,000 (double allocation).\n-\nValue at $0.07 per token: $89,600.\n-\nValue at $1 per token: $1,280,000.\nThese VIP tiers present an unmatched opportunity for investors to amplify their returns while positioning themselves for the token’s continued growth.\nThe Real Rally Is Yet to Come\nWhile Ruvi AI has already impressed with its 50% ROI, industry experts emphasize that this is only the beginning. With its focus on audited security and multi-sector utility, Ruvi AI offers a level of scalability and transparency that is rare in the crypto arena. Furthermore, the presale’s results, $2.2 million raised and 180 million tokens sold, speak volumes about its growing market traction.\nComparing Ruvi AI to Tron highlights a key difference in strategy. While Tron has carved a niche in decentralized content-sharing, Ruvi AI's multi-industry versatility ensures that its growth isn’t limited by market constraints. This positions it as a more attractive option for long-term investors seeking substantial ROI.\nFor those looking to invest in a dynamic project with the potential for exponential growth, Ruvi AI offers an ideal opportunity.

Now, cryptocurrency analysts are drawing comparisons between Avalanche’s rise to prominence and the meteoric growth of Ruvi AI (RUVI). With $2.2 million raised, over 180 million tokens sold, and 2,000+ holders already on board, Ruvi AI is establishing itself as a major player in the crypto space. What’s more, its utility-driven approach and strategic development model ensure this is just the beginning of its climb to the top.\nTransparency and Security Foster Investor Confidence\nOne of Ruvi AI's defining features is its steadfast commitment to security and transparency. The project has undergone a comprehensive third-party audit by CyberScope, which verified the integrity of its smart contracts. This audit alleviates common investor concerns surrounding the safety of new crypto ventures, giving Ruvi AI an edge in the trust department.\nAdditionally, Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange guarantees post-presale liquidity, ensuring participants can seamlessly trade tokens after the presale period ends. These measures don’t just enhance reliability, they position Ruvi AI as a project built for long-term success, attracting investors who value security, transparency, and a robust infrastructure.\nReal-World Applications Drive Demand\nLike Avalanche in its early stages, Ruvi AI’s success isn’t built on hype alone. Instead, it focuses on real-world applications that integrate blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) to provide solutions for key industries:\nUse Cases That Set Ruvi AI Apart\n-\nMarketing\nRuvi AI introduces AI-powered tools designed to optimize digital marketing campaigns. These tools help brands improve audience targeting, reduce wasteful ad spends, and achieve higher return on investment (ROI), solving key challenges for modern marketers.\n-\nEntertainment\nContent creators benefit from Ruvi AI’s blockchain-backed payment systems, which deliver transparency and fairness in earnings.

Key milestones include:\n-\n$2.2 million raised, a strong indicator of both community trust and project viability.\n-\n180 million tokens sold, demonstrating significant early demand for the token.\n-\nAn engaged group of 2,000+ holders, establishing a solid foundation for future growth.\nCurrently, investors can purchase Ruvi AI tokens for just $0.015 per token during Phase 2 of the presale. Once the presale concludes, the price will increase to $0.07, giving participants a nearly 5x ROI. Analysts expect the token to reach $1 post-listing, delivering a staggering 66x ROI, with even greater upside as the project matures.\nExclusive VIP Tiers Unlock Huge Earnings\nRuvi AI goes a step further to incentivize early supporters through its rewarding VIP investment tiers. Here’s a breakdown of their benefits:\n-\nVIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus):\n-\nTotal tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus).\n-\nValue at $0.07 per token: $4,900.\n-\nValue at $1 per token: $70,000.\n-\nVIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus):\n-\nTotal tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus).\n-\nValue at $0.07 per token: $15,680.\n-\nValue at $1 per token: $224,000.\n-\nVIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus):\n-\nTotal tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation).\n-\nValue at $0.07 per token: $89,600.\n-\nValue at $1 per token: $1,280,000.\nThese tiered bonuses provide investors with an unparalleled opportunity to maximize their returns early, further solidifying Ruvi AI as a go-to choice for those seeking significant profitability.\nLooking Ahead\nMuch like Avalanche in its early days, Ruvi AI is demonstrating the critical elements needed to succeed in the highly competitive crypto market.

{"title": "Best Crypto to Buy Now? XRP Price Prediction As Ripple Moves Into Banking with FCC Filing", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/best-crypto-to-buy-now-xrp-price-prediction-as-ripple-moves-into-banking-with-fcc-filing", "text": "All eyes are on XRP right now after the recent filing of Ripple's banking application to the FCC. Considering this has happened just after Ripple's decision to p112ut an end to its standoff with the SEC, hopes have risen that XRP could make a comeback, perhaps even cross its $3 resistance in the coming days.\nThis has given weight to the view that XRP could topple Ethereum in terms of market capitalization. Does it mean XRP is the best crypto to buy now, or does it merely hint at the arrival of investor opportunities with a variety of assets to pick from?\nRipple Applying for National Bank Charter from the OCC - Brad Garlinghouse\nThe announcement about Ripple's banking application was made by Brad Garlinghouse, who, on X, posted the news stating that this approach could put more federal oversight on Ripple, which could bolster its trust factor, transforming it into the bridge to connect traditional and decentralized financial institutions.\nHowever, that's not all, as the company has also filed for a Fed Master Account via Standard Custody. This could help Ripple to hold $RLUSD (Ripple Stablecoin) directly from the Fed and gain an additional layer of security.\nTrue to our long-standing compliance roots, @Ripple is applying for a national bank charter from the OCC. If approved, we would have both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight, a new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market.\n— Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 2, 2025\nEarlier in the week via… https://t.co/IdiR7x3eWZ\nJust as expected, community reactions to the news have been positive. Some have said this is a materialization of a dream consisting of Ripple becoming a bank, which clears the way for XRP to reach $100. However, others have asked how XRP will fit into the banking license.\nImpact of the News on the XRP Price\nWhile investors were expecting the news to have a major impact on the XRP price, that, unfortunately, wasn't the case. The DeFi token's value is still consolidating around the $2.2 level, and whatever green candles it was able to print were corrected the next day.\nThat said, a macro-analysis of the price chart shows that the XRP price has been following an ascending channel ever since it dropped to the $1.9 level on June 22, and there have been no signs of the price action stopping. Furthermore, since the US government has been very progressive about crypto, chances are high that Ripple's application could be approved.\nThat could help with streamlining crypto into the traditional financial space, giving XRP much-needed long-term upside. It is also possible for the crypto to reach $3 in the coming days.\nDoes it mean XRP is the best crypto to buy now? The answer to this could arguably be yes. However, until the DeFi crypto crosses the $2.6 mark to retest the $3 level, investors should stay cautious, since it will only take one long red candle to change the course of the XRP price action.\nBest Crypto to Buy Now - Smart Investor Picks During the Current Ecosystem\nBTC Bull\nRipple's growth would consolidate the market's belief that the altcoin season has indeed arrived. However, that does not mean Bitcoin would lose any of its shine, as despite all the news about Ripple's legal qualms, the apex crypto continues to be the major driver of the cryptocurrency market.\nBTC Bull is a project that taps into that particular market, offering users a standard meme coin experience with a robust touch. While no long-term use cases have been mentioned by the official website, the project has continued to delight customers thanks to its social media posts as well as unique mechanics.\nThe project has tied its token burns and Bitcoin airdrop model with Bitcoin's growth, which is a subtle way to grow alongside the apex crypto. While this move could be seen as a gimmick by many, the fact that the project has managed to raise upwards of $8 million already means there could be more to the project than meets the eye.\nThe token is launching soon, with an application to CoinGecko already filed. Furthermore, there are many analysts already bullish about the launch, stating that BTC Bull could achieve a 1000% growth after going live on the price charts.\nSnorter\nAnother crypto that could be considered one of the top offerings among crypto pre-sales is Snorter. Snorter is a meme coin powering an automated crypto trading bot that lets investors find and trade top-performing Solana cryptos.\nWhat further elevates the appeal of Snorter is the fact that it is accessible via Telegram. Being one of the leading messaging apps for crypto gives it access to a range of unique attributes. Not only is the platform easy to use, but the automated sniping tool is also equipped with all kinds of security features.\nIn addition to the perks that come with the bot, Snorter is also very up to the mark when it comes to highlighting its memes. The main animal chosen to highlight this project, an aardvark, has been used to draw an equivalence between an aardvark's snout that it uses to fetch and Snorter's approach to sniffing the best cryptocurrency investment projects.\nWhile Snorter's connection to XRP isn't direct, the fact that XRP has the potential to become the biggest altcoin ultimately means unique projects with niche perks could gain community attention quickly.\nBitcoin Hyper\nBitcoin Hyper is a cryptocurrency project whose core idea is to inject utility into the Bitcoin network, and it aims to accomplish this using Bitcoin's first L2 scaling solution.\nThe tech-related documents of the project show that developers are hard at work, trying to make it a reality. Three technologies have been implemented for this purpose: L2 scaling solution, Solana Virtual Machine, and a Canonical Bridge.\nThe L2 scaling solution will reportedly help the Bitcoin network's transaction mechanics through off-chain aid. With the Solana Virtual Machine, developers are hoping for more DeFi applications to be built on the Bitcoin network, and with a Canonical Bridge, communications will be established between Bitcoin Hyper and Bitcoin.\nIt is the project's simple premise that has allowed it to gain so much momentum, and in presale it has raised close to $2 million already. So, for XRP fans looking for an offbeat crypto with a strong focus on utility, Bitcoin Hyper could be a good investment.\nConclusion\nRipple's entry into the banking sector could lead to a major shift in the world of crypto. It could signal crypto to become more mainstream, leading to increased participation. Tokens that are still available on presale could take advantage of this situation, surging upon launch. Therefore, this \"best crypto to buy now list\" focuses on cryptocurrency ICOs.\nEach ICO has its own unique attribute, giving traders the opportunity to diversify their investments. And as crypto goes mainstream, these picks could yield massive gains, both in the short and the long term.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

As XRP navigates uncertainty, Lightchain AI stands ready to capitalize on its completed presale phase and strong community backing for the next wave of growth.\nXRP Navigates Ongoing Legal Challenges Amid Market Volatility\nXRP has seen continued volatility in the wake of the legal challenges and market fluctuations. Coverage of the highs of March 2025 was how the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dismissed its lawsuit against Ripple Labs, which caused the price of XRP to rise above $2.50. But there have been new dynamics since then.\nIn May 2025 it dipped from $2.65 to $2.27 after the SEC rejected a motion to change a different ruling. Nonetheless, Ripple CEO is still positive on XRP's behalf and is hoping it will be added to the (U.S.) strategic reserve as well as an XRP-ETF before the end of 2025.\nLightchain AI Completes All 15 Presale Stages With Steady Progress\nLightchain AI has completed all 15 presale stages with steady progress, raising over $20 million and building a solid foundation for its ecosystem. A key development is the reallocation of the original 5% Team Allocation to fund developer grants and ecosystem incentives, underscoring the project’s community-first approach.\nIts efficient workflow and data flow leverage federated learning and cryptographic verification to securely execute AI tasks in real time without exposing sensitive data. The platform’s $150,000 grant pool supports builders, researchers, and emerging projects, accelerating innovation. Together with dynamic resource allocation and performance optimizations, Lightchain AI is positioned for scalable, decentralized AI applications.\nLightchain AI- Sparking a Revolution Beyond Headlines\nThe buzz is real—Lightchain AI is making waves with groundbreaking innovation that goes far beyond the hype. Its cutting-edge cross-chain capabilities allow seamless interoperability, connecting multiple blockchains like never before. Add to that smart gas optimization, where fees adapt dynamically to the complexity of AI tasks, and you’ve got a game-changer for cost-effective and efficient operations.\nThis winning formula is driving real adoption, capturing the attention of builders and investors alike. With a focus on long-term, sustainable growth, Lightchain AI isn’t just riding the trend—it’s shaping the future.

While Jasmy Coin continues building its Internet of Things vision, a new player has entered the ring with bold promises, serious tech, and a chance at major Bitcoin-level prizes. Bitcoin Solaris is not just another presale token it is a full ecosystem, dropkicking the market with blockchain gaming, lightning-speed architecture, and a 0.5 BTC reward program for early supporters.\nJasmy’s Steady Climb, But Is It Enough?\nJasmy has made waves among IoT enthusiasts by focusing on data ownership and decentralized storage. Its use case is solid, the partnerships are growing, and the platform has found a loyal fanbase across Asia and beyond. But the price action? Still stuck in slow motion. The token has yet to break past speculative hype into broader utility or adoption, making some traders wonder: Is there more upside elsewhere?\nThat question is now echoing louder as Bitcoin Solaris enters the spotlight.\nMeet Bitcoin Solaris: Built to Win, Engineered to Scale\nBitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is built for speed, usability, and accessibility. It offers a dual-layer structure: a base layer using Proof-of-Work for hardened security and a Solaris Layer powered by Delegated Proof-of-Stake. This hybrid architecture enables both decentralization and performance.\nSome standout features:\n-\nBase Layer supports up to 3,000 transactions per second\n-\nSolaris Layer achieves up to 100,000 TPS with 2-second finality\n-\nSmart contracts are Rust-based and optimized for Solana integration\n-\nEnergy use is slashed by 99.95% compared to traditional mining\nIts ecoszstem supports everything from DeFi to healthcare applications, but one thing has everyone talking right now: the limited-time token holder reward program.\nThe Bitcoin Rewards Mini-Game: Up to 0.5 BTC on the Line\nBitcoin Solaris has merged crypto excitement with gamified rewards.\nHere’s how it works:\n-\nFree Daily Spins: Registered users get one free spin each day, with a chance to win BTC-S instantly.\n-\nPurchase-Based Spins: When you buy tokens, you unlock premium spin tiers:\n-\n$250+ qualifies for up to 5% bonus tokens\n-\n$500+ up to 9%\n-\n$1,000+ up to 13%\n-\n$2,500+ unlocks a spin for a chance to win up to 0.5 BTC\nThis isn’t some mystery wheel gimmick. The system is fully transparent and operates under the same principles as the blockchain that powers it. The rewards are chance-based, but the design keeps it fair and fun, all while reinforcing the utility of BTC-S tokens.\nNot Just Another Coin: A Complete Ecosystem Starts Here\nPresale Ignites: Price Rising, Demand Exploding\nBitcoin Solaris is now in Phase 10 of its presale, with tokens priced at $10 and the next phase moving to $11. The token will launch at $20, offering early investors a potential 150% return.\nTime is running out; only around 4 weeks remain before the presale ends on July 31, 2025.\nAnd momentum is real:\n-\nOver $6.3 million raised\n-\nMore than 13,900 unique users\n-\nLabeled by some analysts as the shortest and most explosive presale of the year\nTo receive your tokens on launch day, Bitcoin Solaris recommends using Trust Wallet or Metamask for seamless delivery. These wallets are not required to buy, only to receive after launch.\nThis entire program is also being covered in crypto media. A detailed review by Token Empire dives into why so many influencers are joining the hype and why this mini-game is being taken seriously.\nAnd yes, the blockchain gaming element is fully tied to the ecosystem, making it a core part of user engagement.\nBTC-S Tokenomics: Scarcity, Utility, and Community First\nBitcoin Solaris is not flooding the market with supply. Instead, it uses a Bitcoin-style model with added modern flair.\nOnly 21 million BTC-S will ever exist. Here's how it breaks down:\n-\n66.66% for mining over 90 years\n-\n20% to presale participants\n-\n5% for liquidity pools\n-\n2% for ecosystem development\n-\n2% for community rewards\n-\n2% for staking\n-\n2% for marketing\n-\n0.33% for the core team\nThis model is live on the Bitcoin Solaris tokenomics page, ensuring maximum transparency and real scarcity.\nWhy Bitcoin Solaris Is Taking the Lead\nBeyond tech, beyond the hype, Bitcoin Solaris is building the kind of crypto experience that brings everyone in, from new users to hardcore investors.\nIt offers:\n-\nWealth-building potential with every spin and token held\n-\nUltra-scalable architecture ready for mass adoption\n-\nFair token distribution without the usual centralized grabs\n-\nReal rewards for real activity\nWith staking, blockchain gaming, and one of the fastest transaction engines in crypto, BTC-S is aiming directly at the heart of the market.\nConclusion\nJasmy Coin still holds promise for niche IoT enthusiasts. But when it comes to building wealth, having fun, and owning a piece of the next big crypto layer, Bitcoin Solaris is miles ahead.\nBetween the 0.5 BTC reward game and the limited presale opportunity, BTC-S is giving crypto investors the kind of second chance Bitcoin never did.\nFor more information on Bitcoin Solaris:\nWebsite: https://www.bitcoinsolaris.com/\nTelegram: https://t.me/Bitcoinsolaris\nX: https://x.com/BitcoinSolaris\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "As BlackRock Buys Bitcoin (BTC) for 9 Weeks Straight, These 3 Tokens Are Also Seeing Massive Attention from Investors", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/as-blackrock-buys-bitcoin-btc-for-9-weeks-straight-these-3-tokens-are-also-seeing-massive-attention-from-investors", "text": "BlackRock has been buying Bitcoin for nine consecutive weeks, adding approximately 107,139 BTC ($4.7 billion via its iShares Bitcoin Trust). That's a signal the pros are doubling down. And when big money moves into BTC, savvy investors often pivot toward smaller but promising tokens. Here are three altcoins drawing attention that could ride the tailwinds.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Infrastructure Lighting Up onslaught\nNo one expected a frog to be building infrastructure, but here we are. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) isn’t just another token riding a meme; it’s engineering the rails for the next generation of meme projects. It’s launching on its own Ethereum-compatible Layer 2, complete with zero-gas trades, anti-sniper tech, staking, and even a decentralized meme launchpad called Pepe’s Pump Pad. In short, this isn’t a meme coin; it’s a meme ecosystem. And investors have noticed. LILPEPE is now deep into Stage 4 of its presale, priced at $0.0013, with over 70% sold and $3 million raised of its $4.475 target. That’s not noise, it’s conviction. What’s more, early buyers aren’t speculating on thin air. The listing price is already locked in at $0.003, meaning a 2.3x gain is already built into the launch. That alone would be enough to attract attention, but the project is also fueling the fire with a $777,000 giveaway, offering 10 winners a life-changing $77,000 each just for supporting the launch. In a world where most meme coins beg for relevance post-launch, LILPEPE is front-loading both momentum and mechanics. That’s what makes it different, and that’s why it’s getting serious attention from meme hunters and early-stage analysts alike.\nPepe Coin PEPE: The OG Frog Isn’t Done Yet\nIf LILPEPE is the new meme tech stack, then PEPE is the meme gold standard, the one that proved in 2023 that frogs can still outperform dogs. Even as Bitcoin dominance surges, PEPE isn’t fading; it’s consolidating. Funds built to track memecoins have begun including PEPE as a staple, and on-chain signals suggest both retail and whales are re-entering just as the broader meme season begins to stir again. And why not? Cultural relevance is PEPE’s native language. It's still one of the most recognizable crypto mascots on the internet. And now, with analysts openly discussing meme ETF proposals and large allocators looking to diversify from Bitcoin into high-octane plays, PEPE is top of mind. In every meme wave, one or two legacy tokens ride the wave harder than the rest. This cycle? PEPE is in position, and it’s already strapped in.\nBonk (BONK): Solana’s Dog with Real Utility\nThen there’s Bonk (BONK); the token that turned Solana’s meme culture into a movement.\nBonk exploded onto the scene with that rare mix of meme energy and network synergy. Built natively on Solana, BONK leverages low gas fees, lightning-fast transactions, and deep integrations with NFT platforms and DeFi apps. It’s not just hype, it’s functioning in the Solana ecosystem. Currently, BONK has a market capitalization of $1.26 billion, with per-unit prices still accessible to small investors. As Solana continues to recover and attract developer attention, BONK is already riding the second wave. Its community is as rabid as ever, and its utility is no longer theoretical; it’s live across dApps and marketplaces. As capital starts rotating from BTC into scalable, viral altcoins with actual use cases, BONK’s unique blend of network placement and memetic stickiness makes it a no-brainer for many meme-hungry traders.\nFinal Word: From BlackRock to the Meme Market\nHere’s the thing: BlackRock isn’t buying Dogecoin. They’re buying Bitcoin because it’s safe, secure, and credible. But when institutional money lays that kind of foundation, the real explosions happen elsewhere. Meme coins have always been characterized by high risk and high reward. This time, though, projects like LILPEPE are building real tech on top of memes, while older projects like PEPE and BONK are quietly getting ready for their next run.\nSmart investors are no longer merely keeping an eye on Bitcoin. They’re front-running the wave into narrative-driven, high-volatility, community-first tokens with structural upside. If the next rotation is coming, and BlackRock's moves suggest it is, this is where the rally begins.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Analysts Point to Audit and Utility as Key Drivers", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/could-ruvi-ai-ruvi-follow-binance-coins-bnb-successful-path-analysts-point-to-audit-and-utility-as-key-drivers", "text": "Binance Coin (BNB) rose from its modest beginnings to become a dominant player in the cryptocurrency world, thanks to its utility and unwavering adoption across Binance’s vast ecosystem. Now, analysts believe Ruvi AI (RUVI) could chart a similar path to success. Driven by a combination of transparency, utility, and early-stage accomplishments, Ruvi AI is rapidly gaining traction as one of the most exciting blockchain projects on the horizon.\nWith $2.2 million raised, more than 180 million tokens sold, and a fast-growing investor base of 2,000+ holders, Ruvi AI is creating waves. But can it follow in Binance Coin’s footsteps? Here’s why market watchers think it might.\nTransparency Builds Investor Confidence\nUnlike many speculative tokens, Ruvi AI focuses on creating trust through robust security measures and unparalleled transparency. A third-party audit conducted by CyberScope, one of the most respected blockchain auditing firms, has confirmed the integrity and security of Ruvi AI’s smart contracts. This audit guarantees that the project is free of vulnerabilities, giving early backers peace of mind that their investment is in safe hands.\nFurther strengthening its position, Ruvi AI has announced a partnership with WEEX Exchange. This partnership ensures post-presale liquidity, eliminating concerns about trading opportunities once the token lists. Together, these measures establish a solid foundation of reliability, making Ruvi AI a safer and more appealing option for both retail and institutional investors.\nUtility-Driven Momentum\nOne of Binance Coin’s most significant achievements was its integration across the Binance ecosystem, providing undeniable utility from the start. Similarly, Ruvi AI stands out as a solution-driven project, combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) to address challenges in high-demand industries.\nKey Applications Driving Demand\n-\nMarketing\nBusinesses utilize Ruvi AI’s AI-powered targeting tools to optimize digital ad campaigns. These tools cut wasteful marketing expenditures while ensuring stronger returns on investment, making them a game-changer for enterprises.\n-\nEntertainment\nRuvi AI empowers content creators with blockchain-secured payment systems, ensuring transparency and fairness in revenue-sharing. Additionally, AI-driven insight tools help creators analyze and engage audiences more effectively.\n-\nFinance\nBy combining blockchain security with AI’s predictive capabilities, Ruvi AI delivers fraud detection tools and streamlined transaction solutions. These offerings are vital for institutions looking to establish higher levels of trust and operational efficiency.\nRuvi AI’s practical applications not only attract enterprises but also establish a sustainable demand for its token, making it much more than simply a speculative crypto asset.\nEarly-Stage Milestones Show Strong Potential\nRuvi AI’s early success signals its readiness for long-term growth. Highlights from the project’s ongoing presale include:\n-\n$2.2 million raised, marking financial readiness for scaling and development.\n-\nOver 180 million tokens sold, reflecting strong market interest.\n-\nA base of more than 2,000 holders, highlighting its growing community and adoption curve.\nDuring Phase 2 of the presale, Ruvi AI tokens are being offered at just $0.015 per token. After the presale concludes, tokens will rise to $0.07, delivering a nearly 5x ROI for early backers. Analysts predict Ruvi AI could climb as high as $1 per token post-listing, equating to a staggering 66x ROI, a level of return that could rival Binance Coin’s upward trajectory.\nUnlock Exclusive Returns Through VIP Tiers\nRuvi AI adds even more value for early investors by offering VIP investment tiers, allowing participants to amplify their returns. Here’s what these tiers offer:\n-\nVIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus):\n-\nTotal tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus).\n-\nValue at $0.07 per token: $4,900.\n-\nValue at $1 per token: $70,000.\n-\nVIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus):\n-\nTotal tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus).\n-\nValue at $0.07 per token: $15,680.\n-\nValue at $1 per token: $224,000.\n-\nVIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus):\n-\nTotal tokens received: 1,280,000 (double allocation).\n-\nValue at $0.07 per token: $89,600.\n-\nValue at $1 per token: $1,280,000.\nThese bonuses provide an incredible opportunity for both first-time and seasoned investors to maximize returns as Ruvi AI continues its growth trajectory.\nWhy Ruvi AI Could Follow Binance Coin’s Path\nBinance Coin’s rise was largely attributed to its utility and consistent adoption within its ecosystem. Ruvi AI shares a similar focus on delivering value beyond speculation. By offering audited security, real-world utility, and multi-sector functionality, Ruvi AI is laying the groundwork for exponential adoption and token growth.\nWith a presale price of $0.015 and an expected climb to $1 per token, Ruvi AI provides a rare opportunity to get in early on a high-potential project. Its transparent operations, innovative foundation, and scalability make it a standout investment option for those seeking the next Binance Coin success story.\nDon’t miss out, secure your stake in Ruvi AI today before the presale closes and prices rise!\nLearn More\nBuy RUVI: https://presale.ruvi.io\nWebsite: https://ruvi.io\nWhitepaper: https://docs.ruvi.io\nTelegram: https://t.me/ruviofficial\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/RuviAI\nTry RUVI AI: https://web.ruvi.io/register\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Amid a revival of memecoins, its presale has soared by an incredible 3,333%. Crypto traders are hurrying to invest in this new token, drawn by its impressive gains. Excitement is building, and many are wondering what's next for XYZVerse. What is driving this meteoric rise? Explore the factors behind its rapid ascent.\nUndervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX\nXYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase.\nSo far, it has gone halfway, raising over $14 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.003333.\nAt the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.005, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount.\nFollowing the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch.\nBorn for Fighters, Built for Champions\nXYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin.\nCentral to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell.\nCommunity-First Vibes\nIn XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record.\nBacked by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary.\nAirdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits\nFrom Meme to Market Star: The Rise and Potential of Dogecoin\nDogecoin started in 2013 as a joke. It was created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. They chose a popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which is rare, Dogecoin is plentiful. There is no limit to how many can be made. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined. At first, people saw it as a \"memecoin.\" But in 2021, its value soared. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies. Its total value went over $50 billion. This surge was fueled by social media buzz and support from Elon Musk. It showed how online communities can impact markets.\nDogecoin's technology is simple and easy to use. Transactions are fast and cheap. Its abundant supply makes it accessible. With growing acceptance, some think it has potential. However, its value is heavily influenced by trends and social media. Compared to other coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin lacks advanced features. In the current market, it's important to be cautious. The crypto market is unpredictable. While Dogecoin has a strong community, its future depends on continued interest. For those looking for a fun and community-driven coin, Dogecoin remains an option. But as with any investment, it's wise to do your research.\nShiba Inu (SHIB): From Meme Coin to Crypto Contender\nShiba Inu, or SHIB, started as a meme-inspired cryptocurrency but has grown into much more. Launched in August 2020 by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work smoothly within the larger Ethereum ecosystem. SHIB began with a massive supply of one quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum, to build trust. Buterin donated a large portion to the India Covid Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, which increased SHIB's popularity. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's use of Ethereum allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a platform for trading, and plans for NFTs and community governance.\nSHIB's connection to Ethereum gives it more possibilities. It aims to be more than just a meme coin. In today's market, SHIB shows potential because of its ongoing development and strong community. While the crypto world can be unpredictable, SHIB's steps into decentralized finance and increased usefulness might make it appealing to some. Compared to other similar coins, SHIB offers more features, which could help it last as the market moves toward practical uses of blockchain technology.\nBONK: The Shiba Inu Memecoin Energizing the Solana Community\nBONK is a new memecoin on the Solana blockchain, featuring a playful Shiba Inu mascot. It's not just another token; BONK aims to shake up the crypto scene by redistributing power from big venture capital firms to everyday users. After its recent listing on Coinbase, BONK's value shot up by over 100%. Half of its total supply was airdropped to participants in Solana's NFT and DeFi projects, showing its commitment to building a strong community.\nThe coin faces challenges like a large total supply and the wild swings common in memecoin prices. However, BONK is carving out a space in the growing ecosystem of decentralized apps on Solana. The launch of BonkSwap, its own decentralized exchange, adds to its utility. In a market where community-driven projects are gaining attention, BONK stands out. While it shares the spotlight with other memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, BONK's deep integration with Solana's technology gives it unique potential. Keeping an eye on market trends and developments around BONK could be worthwhile for those interested in the evolving crypto landscape.\nPEPE: The Frog Memecoin Shaking Up the Crypto Scene\nPEPE is a deflationary cryptocurrency launched on Ethereum as a tribute to the iconic Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie. Embracing the playful spirit of internet culture, PEPE aims to join the ranks of popular meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. What sets PEPE apart is its no-tax policy and its honest approach about having no utility—it's all about fun and simplicity in the world of memes.\nIn April and May 2023, PEPE's market cap soared to an astonishing $1.6 billion, turning early holders into millionaires and gathering a vibrant community of enthusiasts. This explosive growth ignited what some call a \"memecoin season,\" with new meme coins experiencing dramatic rises and falls. Looking ahead, PEPE's roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a bold plan for a \"meme takeover.\" With the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a bull run, many eyes are on PEPE. Compared to other coins, PEPE captures the whimsical side of crypto, standing out in the current market trends.\nConclusion\nWhile DOGE, SHIB, BONK, and PEPE have made strides, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, aiming for 20,000% growth and uniting sports fans worldwide.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Outset PR Uncovers an 82% Media Meltdown That Could Block Your Reach", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/trying-to-scale-your-web3-project-in-europe-outset-pr-uncovers-an-82-media-meltdown-that-could-block-your-reach", "text": "As crypto adoption surges across Europe, you'd expect media visibility to follow suit. But according to Outset PR’s latest report, the opposite is happening.\nBetween January and March 2025, 82% of crypto-native media outlets in Western Europe lost traffic. The platforms that once shaped narratives and drove awareness for Web3 startups are now struggling to survive under the combined weight of regulation, algorithmic change, and shifting user behavior.\nIf you’re trying to scale your Web3 project in Europe, this meltdown might be the invisible force throttling your reach.\nThe Paradox: Rising Interest, Shrinking Visibility\nCrypto interest across the EU is rising: ownership in some countries like Slovenia, Italy, and Croatia exceeds 15%, and Europe's total on-chain crypto value exceeded $500 billion last year which accounted for over 21% of the global value.\nSource: Chainalysis\nYet, while the audience grows, media channels are losing their grip. Outset PR analyzed 133 media outlets across the region, 87 of which were crypto-focused, and found that 82% suffered traffic losses in Q1 2025. The reasons, though varied by country, point to a common denominator: the convergence of regulatory pressure, algorithmic change, and market volatility.\nAt the center of this shift is MiCA, the European Union’s new crypto regulation framework. While full enforcement is still rolling out, its early impact has already reshaped how crypto content is written, published, and ranked. Under MiCA-aligned interpretations, regulators from Paris to Rome began scrutinizing tone, affiliate disclosures, and investment-style language — effectively forcing outlets to recalibrate both editorial and monetization models.\nSome regional regulators interpreted MiCA differently, so the impact of this new framework verified depending on the country:\nSource: Outset report\nOutset’s report also revealed that just 7 outlets across the region crossed the 1 million monthly visits threshold, and accounted for 60.26% of total traffic. Another 6 made up most of the mid-tier.\nBut beyond that, 58 outlets drew under 100K visits each, showing how fragmented and vulnerable the long tail of crypto media has become.\nReal Numbers, Real Fallout\nOutset PR’s traffic tracking via SimilarWeb and Ahrefs shows just how deep the cuts go:\n-\nItalian outlets: Over 70% saw visibility drop, despite high local interest.\n-\nDutch-language media: 76% lost search traffic after Google’s March update.\n-\nGerman-speaking sites: Nearly 40% of total outlets, yet most failed to hold their audience.\n-\nUK platforms: Though not subject to MiCA, many got hit by the FCA’s expanded financial promotions regime.\nSource: Outset report\nOnly a few outliers — like Bit2Me News (Spain, +149.4%) and CoinJournal DE (Germany, +23.9%) — managed to grow, thanks to multilingual content, regulatory awareness, and technical SEO strength.\nAlgorithmic Gatekeeping: The Discover Problem\nBeyond traditional search rankings, Google Discover has emerged as a powerful channel for crypto media distribution. But here too, the visibility crisis is deepening. Outset PR’s report reveals that only 22.99% of crypto-native media outlets in Western Europe maintained consistent presence in Google Discover throughout Q1 2025.\nBy comparison, 32.61% of generalist finance, tech, and economic platforms — the kind that cover crypto as part of broader business reporting — held steady in Discover. This seemingly narrow percentage gap translates into a massive disparity in reach.\nFor Web3 founders, this shift has immediate consequences. Even the most compelling project announcements, protocol updates, or ecosystem news may never surface in front of their intended audience if they rely on media partners that are excluded from Discover.\nWhy This Blocks Your Growth\nIf you’re relying on crypto media in Europe to boost your brand, here’s the harsh truth: your message may never reach the audience it deserves.\nWith fewer high-traffic platforms, limited Google Discover inclusion , and increasing compliance pressure, traditional media outreach is no longer enough.\nWorse still, many remaining outlets under 100K monthly visits now lack the editorial firepower or domain authority to move the needle — especially for token launches, exchange listings, or major product drops.\nConclusion\nThe European Web3 opportunity is enormous with rising user adoption, institutional momentum, and a unified regulatory framework under MiCA. But Outset PR’s latest report makes one thing painfully clear: the infrastructure for visibility is collapsing right when it’s needed most.\nCrypto-native media outlets are bleeding traffic. Google Discover is excluding a growing number of them. And regional regulators are rewriting the rules of public communication.\nFor founders and marketing leaders, the implications are strategic. Getting covered is no longer enough — you need compliance-ready storytelling, multilingual editorial alignment, and a targeted outreach strategy that prioritizes quality over quantity. That’s where Outset PR comes in. As the only data-driven communications agency, Outset builds visibility strategies that match the new rules of engagement. In this new cycle, the winners won’t just be the loudest. They’ll be the most visible to the right audience, through the right channels and at the right level of credibility.\nYou can find more information about Outset PR here:\nWebsite: outsetpr.io\nTelegram: t.me/outsetpr\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

At the same time, Bitcoin appears set for a significant price rally, aiming for $110,000. The strengthening performance of alternative coins adds to the market's momentum. These developments hint at potential major shifts in the cryptocurrency landscape.\n$XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI\nXYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game.\nWith the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project.\nWhat sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth.\nFueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto.\n$XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market\nThe $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price.\n- Launch Price: $0.0001\n- Price Now: $0.003333\n- Next Stage: $0.005\n- Final Presale Price: $0.02\nFollowing the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries.\nSo far, over $14 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch.\nDemand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns.\nJoin $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions!\nBitcoin: The Digital Currency Changing Money Forever\nBitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, reshaping how we think about money. Created by someone known as Satoshi Nakamoto, it's a form of electronic cash that allows people to send payments directly to each other. There's no need for banks or governments to get involved. Bitcoin uses a technology called blockchain, which is like a public ledger shared across many computers. This system ensures that transactions are secure and transparent. Miners around the world verify these transactions by solving complex puzzles. They are rewarded with new bitcoins for their work. This process keeps the network running smoothly and safely.\nRight now, Bitcoin's future looks promising. Every four years, an event called a \"halving\" cuts the rewards miners receive by half. With only 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist, this makes each one more valuable over time. In the current market, Bitcoin stands strong among other digital currencies. Its limited supply and growing acceptance make it an attractive option for investors. As the world moves towards digital solutions, Bitcoin could play a big role in the future of finance. Keeping an eye on market trends might help you decide if now is the right time to get involved.\nSolana's SOL: Speeding Ahead in the Blockchain Race\nSolana is turning heads in the blockchain arena with its emphasis on scalability and speed. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, it provides a solid foundation for decentralized applications (dapps). What makes Solana stand out is its unique architecture aimed at faster transactions and its flexibility in supporting multiple programming languages. At the core of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana's native cryptocurrency, which powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network supporters.\nThe potential of SOL is tied to Solana's high-capacity network that avoids using sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. This design attracts developers and investors seeking a platform capable of handling high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, where efficiency and speed are increasingly valued, SOL presents itself as an attractive option. Its technological advancements position it well against other coins, making it a significant player to watch in the evolving crypto landscape.\nConclusion\nWhile BTC and SOL are strong, XYZVerse, the first all-sport memecoin, unites global sports fans and aims for 20,000% growth, positioning itself as a cultural icon.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Dubbed an intelligence powerhouse, it's set to disrupt with laughter-driven profits while making a mockery of fake AI agents. Whether it can live up to its legendary PEPE ancestor's success remains to be seen, but the opportunity for gains is undeniable.\nCodename:Pepe Sells Out Presale in Record Time, $AGNT Eyes 1000x Surge\nCodename:Pepe, the latest entrant in the meme coin arena, has successfully concluded the presale of its native $AGNT tokens ahead of schedule and is now preparing for its upcoming listing on a major cryptocurrency exchange.\nBy merging AI-powered functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins, Codename:Pepe taps into two of the most dominant trends in the crypto space today.\n$AGNT Presale Sells Out Early\nAmid growing investor enthusiasm for AI-driven crypto ventures, Codename:Pepe completed all 28 stages of its $AGNT token presale in just a few months, well ahead of expectations.

After its launch in 2023, SUI surged past $1, reaching $2.18 by March 27, 2024. Despite a dip afterward, the token rebounded impressively in autumn 2024, hitting a new high of $2.36 on October 14.\nBy the end of 2024, SUI's value soared to $5.35. This growth was fueled by a significant increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) within its system, surpassing $2 billion. Christian Williams, managing director of the Sui Foundation, expressed pride in the ecosystem's growth, noting the remarkable development from the community and DeFi activities.\nAs of January 6, 2025, SUI hovered around $5.20. Named after the Japanese element of water, the Sui platform aims to bring fluidity and adaptability to the Web3 landscape. Built on Sui Move, derived from the Move programming language, it offers a flexible network for developers and users alike.\nFounded by former Meta developers, Sui addresses some limitations of existing blockchains like Ethereum. It uses horizontal scaling to process transactions simultaneously, enhancing speed and efficiency. By storing assets directly on the blockchain, Sui enables cheaper and faster transactions.\nSUI's impressive growth and innovative technology make it a standout in the current market cycle. Its ability to adapt and the strong support from its community position it as a promising player in the blockchain space. As the crypto market evolves, SUI's unique offerings could shape its future trajectory.\nAvalanche (AVAX): The Next Big Thing in Blockchain Revolution\nAvalanche (AVAX) is shaking up blockchain technology. Launched in 2020, it's a Layer 1 network aiming to outperform Ethereum in smart contracts. It's compatible with Ethereum's virtual machine, making it easy for developers to switch over.\nAVAX excels in scalability and speed. Using subnets, it can process up to 6,500 transactions per second. With lower fees and faster transactions than Ethereum, Avalanche is a formidable competitor in decentralized applications.\nIn November 2021, AVAX hit an all-time high of $146.22 during the crypto bull run. Though it hasn't surpassed that peak yet, its strong fundamentals and increasing adoption suggest potential for future growth.\nAnalysts predict bright prospects for AVAX. Some forecast it could reach $81 soon, while others see it hitting $300 by 2030. These projections suggest significant growth, reflecting confidence in Avalanche's technology and potential.\nIn the current market cycle, AVAX appears promising. Its innovative technology and growing community position it well. With scalability and efficiency, Avalanche could become a key player as the crypto market evolves.\nFetch.ai (FET): Pioneering the Fusion of AI and Blockchain\nFetch.ai (FET), launched in 2017 by Humayun Sheikh and Toby Simpson, combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Utilizing Autonomous Economic Agents (AEAs), it automates tasks like contract negotiations and supply chain management, reducing costs and streamlining processes across industries.\nThe platform's proof-of-stake mechanism offers scalability and energy efficiency. Its alliance with SingularityNET and Ocean Protocol forms the Superintelligence Alliance, advancing Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). This partnership creates the largest AI marketplace in blockchain, boosting FET's adoption.\nIn 2024, FET's price surged from around $1 to $3, likely due to growing interest in AI and blockchain. Experts speculate FET could surpass previous highs, strengthened by technological advances and mergers with competitors.\nLong-term predictions vary. Some analysts foresee FET reaching $35 by 2026; others predict more modest growth. By 2030, forecasts range from $3 to $4.66. Projections for 2050 suggest significant potential, but investors should be cautious due to market unpredictability.\nIn today's market, Fetch.ai is appealing for those interested in AI and blockchain fusion. Its innovative technology, strategic partnerships, and potential for industry disruption make FET a cryptocurrency to watch as it evolves.\nONDO's Journey: A Rising Star in DeFi's Future\nOndo Finance has been making waves since it launched its native token, ONDO, on January 18, 2024. Aiming to bring top-tier financial products to everyone, this protocol offers innovative solutions for tokenized real-world assets. ONDO's value surged in the early months, peaking in June before a slight dip.\nLater in the year, interest in real-world asset cryptocurrencies reignited ONDO's momentum. This enthusiasm propelled the token to an all-time high on December 16. By January 20, 2025, ONDO was trading at around $1.45, showcasing its resilience and growing adoption.\nLooking ahead, predictions suggest a promising future for ONDO. By the end of 2025, forecasts estimate the token could range between $1.50 and $3.50. In 2026, the potential increases with predictions of $2 to $6. By 2030, as ONDO achieves significant adoption, it could reach values between $5 and $12.\nOndo Finance's strength lies in its innovative approach to on-chain asset management. By offering transparent and secure financial products, it bridges the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology. Users can easily subscribe, redeem, and transfer assets, making ONDO a user-friendly option in the DeFi space.\nWith solid foundations and a positive outlook, ONDO stands out in the evolving crypto landscape. Its focus on accessibility and institutional-grade solutions positions it well for future growth. As the market matures, ONDO could become a key player in the financial ecosystem.\nConclusion\nAlthough SUI, AVAX, FET, and ONDO have potential, their short-term prospects may be limited. They might not deliver the rapid gains that some investors are seeking in the current bullish market.\nIn contrast, Codename:Pepe crypto is taking a unique approach by unleashing true intelligence for maximum profits.

Now, in 2025, a new wave of meme coins is emerging from the depths of crypto Twitter, infused with humor, driven by technology, and bolstered by community support. Here are four meme coins primed to become the next SHIB-like success stories, with the potential to turn $1,200 into $720,000 by 2026. Leading the pack is none other than Little Pepe ($LILPEPE).\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin Primed for a 30x Explosion\nTicker: $LILPEPE\nNetwork: Ethereum (ERC20)\nPresale Stage: 4 (over $3.2 million raised)\nPresale Price: $0.0013\nLittle Pepe isn’t just another frog meme—it’s an ambitious Layer 2 blockchain project blending humor with real technological firepower. The $LILPEPE token fuels a next-generation ecosystem offering:\n-\nUltra-low transaction fees\n-\nLightning-fast finality, faster than an Elon Musk tweet\n-\nZero taxes on buys and sells\nThis zero-tax policy alone is a breath of fresh air in a market often clogged by hidden fees. However, what truly sets Little Pepe apart is its Layer 2 approach, designed to outscale Ethereum and deliver near-instant transactions—a crucial advantage as meme coins mature into utility-driven communities. The project has already drawn significant traction, with over 16,000 entries pouring into its $777,000 giveaway, and presale allocations are rapidly selling out (2.78 billion tokens of 3.75 billion have already been claimed). As the roadmap advances from presale to top-tier exchange listings, the marketing engine is primed for viral exposure, including influencer campaigns, high-profile partnerships, and aggressive liquidity provisioning. Given its combination of robust tech, no-tax trading, and a seasoned team determined to rival SHIB’s meteoric rise, $LILPEPE has realistic potential to 30x by 2026. Even a conservative projection would turn $1,200 into over $36,000, with blue-sky scenarios aiming much higher as the Layer 2 narrative intensifies.\nBonk (BONK): The Solana-Powered OG Ready to Reclaim Its All-Time Highs\nTicker: BONK\nNetwork: Solana\nBonk is a meme coin that has already carved out a place in crypto history by delivering a 31,000% return from late 2023 to its 2024 peak. The coin has rebounded off crucial support levels and is showing textbook V-shaped recovery patterns on the daily chart.\nBonk’s fundamentals are improving:\n-\nRenewed whale accumulation\n-\nExpanding ecosystem and community-led development\n-\nResilient liquidity across Solana DEXs\nThe Solana narrative is also back in force as transaction volumes rebound, helping Bonk reassert itself as a primary meme asset in the ecosystem. If Bonk simply repeats a fraction of its previous rally, it could easily increase by 10 times or more in the next 18–24 months, offering investors a compelling upside as meme coin cycles reheat.\nPudgy Penguin (PENGU): NFT Mania Meets Meme Power\nTicker: PENGU\nNetwork: Ethereum\nPudgy Penguin merges viral NFT culture with a fast-growing token economy. Over the past month, the project has seen:\n-\nA 52% surge in token price\n-\nA 38% jump in NFT sales volume\n-\nA 13% rise in whale holdings\nWith over $636 million in all-time NFT sales, Pudgy Penguin’s brand equity is driving fresh capital inflows and reducing token supply on exchanges. Supply has contracted from 15.6 billion tokens to 14.7 billion in just weeks—an extremely bullish indicator. As NFTs continue to attract mainstream attention, Pudgy Penguin’s hybrid model is uniquely positioned to capture both collectors and meme coin traders. A 10–15x return remains a realistic target if momentum sustains through 2025.\nSPX6900 (SPX): The Ethereum Meme That Already Delivered 12,000% ROI\nTicker: SPX\nNetwork: Ethereum, BNB Chain\nIf you had dropped $1,000 into SPX6900 a year ago, you’d be sitting on over $123,000 today. This meme coin outperformed nearly every Layer 1 and major token, establishing itself as a serious contender.\nSPX’s formula is simple yet effective:\n-\nLow-liquidity pools create explosive upside during momentum waves.\n-\nCompatibility across both Ethereum and BNB Chain broadens reach\n-\nHigh community engagement sustains liquidity and volume.\nEven if the S&P 500 only matches half of what it did last year, you could still see about ten times your money by 2026.\nFinal Thoughts\nMeme coins are no longer just speculative gambles. The best of them, like $LILPEPE, are fusing cultural virality with real utility, tokenomics, and infrastructure. Back in 2021, many dismissed SHIB as a joke.

Lightchain AI aims to bring a new wave of decentralized innovation focused on transparency, scalability, and community-driven governance.\nAs the blockchain landscape evolves, developers and investors are closely monitoring this emerging platform’s progress. The upcoming launch promises to open fresh avenues for participation and growth, positioning Lightchain AI as a potential game-changer poised to make a lasting impact on the future of decentralized technology and the broader crypto ecosystem.\nXRP’s Staying Power- Holding Strong Among Crypto’s Top Leaders\n2025 has established XRP as one of the top cryptos, at the same time the fourth largest by market cap. At the time of writing, on June 30, 2025, XRP is priced at around $2.19, which is 0.07% lower compared to the most recent close.\nOne big driver behind XRP's resilience is the conclusion of its battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In March of 2025 the SEC drops the lawsuit, the beginning of a new era for Ripple Labs that would see investor conviction in XRP restored.\nIt is the institutional use that is pushing the price up on XRP. Hidden Road, a transaction that was estimated at $1.25 billion opens the door for even greater penetration of XRP in institutional finance, especially within DeFi, cross-margining and between digital and traditional assets.\nIn addition, the introduction of Ripple's stablecoin, RLUSD, on the XRP Ledger have also contributed to higher volumes and more liquidity for XRP, solidifying its stance as the bridge asset of cryptocurrencies.\nAnalysts are optimistic on the outlook of XRP, several predicting that XRP could hit $5 to $15 by the end of 2025, it will depend on continued institutional interest and market environment.\nLightchain AI’s End-of-July Launch- Gaining Momentum Behind Scenes\nLightchain AI’s end-of-July launch is gaining steady momentum behind the scenes as developers and early adopters prepare for its mainnet debut. The platform offers powerful APIs and comprehensive SDKs, making it easy for builders to deploy AI models and integrate Lightchain’s features into new dApps.\nDesigned for high transaction throughput, the network can handle large volumes of AI tasks without performance dips. Smart gas optimization ensures computational tasks are cost-efficient, with fees adjusted dynamically based on workload complexity.\nThis blend of developer-ready tools, scalable performance, and cost efficiency positions Lightchain AI as an attractive entry point for those watching the future of decentralized AI unfold.\nLightchain AI- Rising AI Blockchain Poised to Capture Market Attention\nLightchain AI is the rising AI blockchain poised to capture serious market attention as it gears up for its mainnet launch at the end of July 2025. Its standout Governance Integration empowers token holders to steer protocol upgrades and ecosystem decisions through transparent, on-chain voting.\nBacked by balanced tokenomics with fair rewards and controlled supply, Lightchain AI creates strong incentives for long-term growth.

Hyperliquid’s sharp HYPE price drop has left traders debating whether the correction signals short-term cooling or deeper structural issues. Cardano’s ADA is also under pressure, testing key support near $0.52 as momentum stalls despite ecosystem upgrades.\nBlockDAG, however, is gaining traction for reasons that go beyond price charts. With over $331 million raised and 23.6 billion coins sold, its presale is backed by strong numbers. The $2 million Gold Ticket lottery and exclusive $0.0016 pricing make BlockDAG stand out as a top crypto to buy right now with tangible upside.\nBlockDAG’s $2M Gold Ticket: The High-Roller Shortcut to Massive ROI\nBlockDAG is raising the stakes with its Gold Ticket lottery, offering high-level investors a rare shot at a $2 million USDT grand prize. A $400 deposit not only enters participants into the top-tier drawing but also secures premium BDAG bonuses, designed for those serious about both short-term wins and long-term token gains. Moreover, with limited ticket availability and the highest winning odds in the promotion, the Gold Ticket isn’t just an entry, it’s an edge.\nIn fact, this campaign launches on the back of one of the most successful presales in crypto history. BlockDAG has raised $331 million, selling over 23.6 billion BDAG coins. The presale is currently in Batch 29 at a public price of $0.0276, yet Gold Ticket buyers can still claim tokens at an exclusive $0.0016 rate. That’s a potential 2,660% ROI from Batch 1, with even more upside given the limited pricing window.\nFurthermore, winners will be publicly announced on Telegram, Twitter, and the official BlockDAG site, reinforcing the transparency of this high-reward event. Unlike standard giveaways, the Gold Ticket fuses lottery-style upside with hard token utility, positioning it as a top crypto to buy right now for serious backers.\nUltimately, this offer isn’t open-ended. With limited Gold Tickets and massive financial upside on the line, the opportunity is closing fast. For investors looking to combine high-yield crypto accumulation with the possibility of a life-changing prize, BlockDAG’s Gold Ticket delivers both, if you act in time.\nHyperliquid HYPE Price Drop: Market Cooldown or Structural Weakness?\nThe recent Hyperliquid HYPE price drop has caught the attention of traders after the token slid nearly 50% from its earlier peak. Initially, fueled by strong trading incentives and rapid community growth, HYPE’s sharp reversal is raising questions about its valuation and long-term trajectory.\nSpecifically, analysts point to the end of reward programs and a reduction in speculative demand as contributing factors, suggesting the drop may reflect a broader recalibration rather than a full-scale collapse.\nNevertheless, despite the price dip, trading activity remains consistent, indicating that a core segment of users is still engaged. This could suggest that the platform retains functional appeal, even as short-term hype fades.\nCardano ADA Price Movement Faces Critical Support Test\nThe Cardano ADA price movement has entered a cautious phase as the token trades near key support at $0.52. Following a 16% decline in June, ADA now hovers around $0.56, reflecting market uncertainty despite recent ecosystem upgrades.\nMeanwhile, on-chain data shows a drop in active addresses from 24,000 to under 18,000, signaling reduced user activity even as new integrations roll out. This pullback suggests that short-term sentiment is wavering, with traders adopting a wait-and-see approach.\nFrom a technical standpoint, ADA is stuck between resistance zones at $0.60 and $0.65, while support at $0.5235 remains a focal point. The RSI holding around 49.65 indicates neutral momentum, and narrow Bollinger Bands hint at an imminent breakout or breakdown.\nIf selling pressure increases and ADA slips below support, it may trigger a deeper correction. For now, the Cardano ADA price movement is balanced on a knife’s edge, with market direction hinging on upcoming trading volume and investor response.\nLast Say\nWhile Hyperliquid deals with fallout from the HYPE price drop and Cardano hovers near key support, BlockDAG is capturing attention for more tangible reasons. Its Gold Ticket lottery tied to a $2 million prize adds excitement, but the fundamentals behind the project are just as strong.\nWith $331 million raised, over 23.6 billion coins sold, and a limited-time price of $0.0016, BlockDAG presents a rare mix of accessibility and upside. Compared to peers facing hesitation, BlockDAG is moving forward with momentum. For investors evaluating the top crypto to buy right now, it offers both incentive and evidence to back the interest.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Price scenarios, holder behaviour, and post-breakout plans", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/what-happens-if-fun-hits-010-price-scenarios-holder-behaviour-and-post-breakout-plans", "text": "What if a simple $100 investment today could become $1,000 by Christmas? FUNToken sits at $0.009978 on June 30, 2025, just pennies away from a potential 10x surge that would launch it into crypto's top 100. With 77% of 21.5K community members voting bullish despite recent volatility, the question burning through Web3 gaming circles isn't whether FUNToken will break $0.10.\nIt's what happens next when this deflationary gaming token achieves a milestone that could trigger massive holder redistribution, unlock institutional floodgates, and position early adopters for life-changing wealth. The math is brutal in its simplicity: $0.10 represents a 902% gain from current levels, pushing FUNToken's market cap to $1.08 billion and validating its Web3 gaming leadership thesis.\nCurrent holders are already positioning for scenarios most haven't considered. The FUNToken roadmap reveals strategic timing that could make $0.10 inevitable rather than optimistic.\nMarket Reality Check\nFUNToken's current market position reveals classic pre-breakout dynamics that seasoned analysts recognize immediately. Trading at $0.009978 with a $107.95M market cap, the token shows accumulation patterns despite a 0.26% daily decline and 46.46% volume reduction. These contradictions often signal smart money positioning before explosive moves.\nThe 177.39% yearly gain demonstrates sustained momentum, while the 24.82% volume-to-market cap ratio indicates healthy institutional interest. Most importantly, the fixed 10.81 billion token supply creates mathematical scarcity that compounds with each deflationary burn event.\nCommunity sentiment remains remarkably stable with 77% bullish votes from 21.5K participants. This level of confidence through volatility typically precedes major breakouts.\n|\nMetric |\nValue |\n24h Change |\n|\nPrice |\n$0.009978 |\nDown slightly |\n|\nMarket Cap |\n$107.95M |\n-0.26% |\n|\nVolume |\n$26.62M |\n-46.46% |\n|\nBullish Sentiment |\n77% |\nStable |\nThe $0.10 Mathematics: Why This Target Makes Sense\nBreaking $0.10 isn't fantasy; it's mathematical inevitability if current trends continue. This target pushes FUNToken's market cap to $1.08 billion, placing it firmly in the top 100 cryptocurrencies and triggering institutional recognition algorithms. The journey requires conquering resistance at $0.02, $0.05, and $0.075 before the psychological $0.10 barrier falls.\nHistorical Web3 gaming token analysis reveals 10x moves typically unfold over 2-4 months during favorable market conditions. FUNToken's revenue-driven deflationary mechanism creates additional upward pressure by systematically removing tokens from the 10.81 billion supply based on platform performance. Each quarterly burn event makes remaining tokens mathematically scarcer, amplifying price appreciation potential.\nThe timing aligns perfectly with market cycles and FUNToken's strategic roadmap. Q4 2025 gaming platform launches and major partnerships could provide fundamental catalysts for sustained breakout momentum beyond speculative trading.\nConservative analysis suggests $0.05 by September creates pathway conditions for full $0.10 achievement by year-end. Aggressive scenarios point to $0.15-$0.20 if institutional adoption accelerates beyond current projections.\nHolder Behavior Revolution\nCurrent FUNToken holders face a psychological transformation most haven't experienced. The 77% bullish majority demonstrates diamond-hand mentality, but $0.10 triggers dramatic behavioral shifts as modest investments become substantial wealth. Analysis reveals three distinct holder categories emerging: conviction holders (40%), strategic profit-takers (35%), and full exiters (25%).\nConviction holders understand FUNToken's Web3 gaming positioning offers multi-year value creation beyond short-term gains. These participants will likely hold through $0.10, anticipating further ecosystem expansion and utility growth. Their unwavering confidence often stabilizes prices during volatile breakout phases.\nStrategic profit-takers represent the most sophisticated group, implementing graduated selling strategies that capture gains while maintaining core positions. These holders typically sell 25-50% at major milestones, using profits to diversify while keeping skin in the game for continued upside.\nThe most dramatic transformation affects small retail holders who accumulated below $0.01. A $0.10 breakout converts $500 positions into $5,000+ wealth, creating unexpected financial freedom for ordinary investors. This psychological impact generates viral social media attention that extends rallies beyond fundamental justification.\nProjected Holder Behavior at $0.10\n|\nStrategy |\nPercentage |\nAction Plan |\n|\nHold Strong |\n40% |\nTarget $0.20+ |\n|\nTake Profits |\n35% |\nSell 25-50% |\n|\nFull Exit |\n25% |\nComplete sale |\nRoadmap Convergence: Strategic Timing for Breakout\nFUNToken's 2025-2026 roadmap creates perfect fundamental alignment for $0.10 achievement by year-end. The Q4 2025 gaming platform launch coincides with major partnership announcements that drive organic demand beyond speculative interest. Each completed milestone adds credibility to higher valuation targets.\nDeflationary tokenomics accelerate value appreciation as ecosystem usage expands. Gaming platform transaction fees trigger automatic Buy-and-Burn events, permanently reducing supply while demand increases. This mathematical relationship suggests $0.10 represents fair value rather than speculative overvaluation. These burn events have already started with the June burn of 25 million tokens taken out of circulation.\nStrategic positioning shows FUNToken benefiting from broader Web3 gaming adoption projected for late 2025. Industry analysis indicates gaming tokens with working products achieve 10-20x valuations during sector rotations. FUNToken's execution record positions it perfectly for this institutional recognition phase.\nCritical 2025 Milestones\n|\nTimeline |\nCatalyst |\nExpected Impact |\n|\nQ3 2025 |\nGaming partnerships |\nUtility expansion |\n|\nQ4 2025 |\nPlatform launch |\nRevenue generation |\n|\nQ4 2025 |\nEnhanced burns |\nSupply reduction |\nCommunity Momentum\nFUNToken's community expansion provides essential social infrastructure for sustained price appreciation. The FUNToken Telegram community shows consistent growth while social engagement increases across platforms. This organic building creates viral potential during major price movements. Plus, the AI-power Telegram bot will have gamified features like quizzes to ensure the community remains engaged and build a stronger community.\nInstitutional awareness grows alongside retail enthusiasm. Professional traders increasingly discuss FUNToken's undervaluation relative to competitors with similar utility but higher market caps. This recognition often precedes capital inflows that drive 10x movements.\nThe 77% bullish sentiment from 21.5K votes demonstrates remarkable confidence through volatility. Tokens maintaining 70%+ bullish sentiment during accumulation phases typically experience explosive breakouts within 3-6 months.\nBeyond $0.10: The Ecosystem Expansion Strategy\nAchieving $0.10 represents the beginning of FUNToken's value creation journey rather than its conclusion. Post-breakout strategy focuses on ecosystem expansion and utility diversification that sustains momentum toward $0.20-$0.50 longer-term targets. The Web3 gaming sector's trillion-dollar potential provides unlimited growth runway.\nBreaking $0.10 validates FUNToken's Web3 gaming thesis and unlocks institutional investment previously constrained by market cap requirements. The resulting visibility creates network effects that compound growth exponentially. Smart money recognizes this inflection point as a generational wealth creation opportunity.\nThe $0.10 breakout isn't just a price target; it's a gateway to Web3 gaming dominance. Join theFUNToken community and explore the roadmap that could transform modest investments into substantial wealth by Christmas.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

A $455 Bet on This Cheap Token Could Become $91,000 Before Bull Run Peak in 2026", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/looking-for-the-next-solana-sol-a-455-bet-on-this-cheap-token-could-become-91000-before-bull-run-peak-in-2026", "text": "Back in late 2020, Solana (SOL) changed hands for less than $2. Fast forward to the biggest moments of the 2021 bull run, and that same coin rocketed over $250, handing early backers an eye-popping 15,000% gain. For those who spotted the potential of a high-speed, low-cost blockchain early, life-changing wealth was created. Now, as we stand at the doorstep of the next crypto supercycle, a new contender has entered the arena. It’s not another forked meme token with no utility. Instead, it’s an emerging Layer-2 project that fuses viral meme energy with serious technological muscle: Little Pepe ($LILPEPE). According to its presale math, a modest $455 investment today could potentially grow to $91,000 by the peak of 2026’s expected bull market.\nWhy Little Pepe Could Be the Solana of This Cycle\nJust like Solana introduced a faster, cheaper alternative to Ethereum Layer-1, Little Pepe introduces an ultra-low-fee, high-speed Layer-2 blockchain powered by $LILPEPE—but with a viral twist. While Solana won hearts with its TPS stats, $LILPEPE is winning wallets with a community-first approach and meme-fueled virality that mirrors the early fervor of Dogecoin and PepeCoin. It’s not just tech for devs—it’s tech that memes can live on.\nHere’s why $LILPEPE’s structure draws comparison to early Solana:\n-\nUltra-Fast Throughput: Built on a Layer 2 Ethereum foundation, $LILPEPE can deliver finality faster than you can refresh Twitter, solving the gas and latency problems that drove many away from Ethereum in the first place.\n-\nZero-Tax, All-Fun Philosophy: Unlike the heavy tax models of most presale meme tokens, $LILPEPE offers a 0% buy/sell tax, making it far more appealing for long-term holders and swing traders alike.\n-\nDeep Liquidity Allocations: With 10% of the total supply dedicated to liquidity and another 10% to decentralized exchange (DEX) listings, this token isn’t just built to launch—it’s built to stay.\nFrom $455 to $91,000 – Let’s Break the Numbers Down\nAt the current Stage 4 presale rate of $0.0013 per token, a $455 investment will fetch approximately 350,000 LILPEPE tokens. Now, suppose LILPEPE achieves a price of $0.26—the same magnitude of growth Solana saw during its 2021 meteoric rise. That’s a 15,000% increase from its presale value. 350,000 tokens x $0.26 = $91,000. That’s the power of early entry during a presale—and that’s not theoretical. It’s math backed by history.\nBut Why Is This Cheap Token Making So Much Noise?\nUnlike thousands of forgettable meme tokens that come and go, Little Pepe is a narrative-driven project with real utility and community involvement baked in.\nA Story That Sells Itself\n$LILPEPE isn’t a faceless protocol. It’s a storyline: a meme hero rising from the ashes of failed rugs and gas-heavy chains to build a Layer-2 kingdom. It taps into the same cultural pull that fueled Doge, Shiba, and Pepe—but adds actual tech behind it.\nLayer-2 Buzz\nThe crypto community is now hyper-aware of Layer-2s like Base, Arbitrum, and zkSync. But none of them are as meme-friendly or community-magnetic as Little Pepe. It’s the only one explicitly designed to blend meme culture with high-performance infrastructure.\nZero Tax, All Incentive\nMany meme coins tax holders on every transaction. Not Little Pepe. The project takes a radical stance: 0% tax. That means every jump this baby frog makes in price is yours to keep, untainted by contract fees or tax redirections.\nBrief Presale & Giveaway Details\nLittle Pepe’s presale is currently in Stage 4, offering $LILPEPE at just $0.0013. Over $3 million has already been raised out of the $4.475 million cap, with more than 2.6 billion tokens sold. This suggests massive early interest, and time is running out. To sweeten the deal, a $777K giveaway is now live, with 10 winners standing to receive $77,000 worth of $LILPEPE tokens. Over 12,000 entries have already been logged, making it one of the largest memecoin launch giveaways this year.\nFinal Thoughts: Is Little Pepe the Next Solana?\nSolana wasn’t just a coin—it was a movement. It solved a problem, created a loyal following, and scaled fast. Little Pepe could be on that same trajectory, but with a twist of humor, accessibility, and mass appeal that makes it digestible for every level of investor. Meme coins with no utility are fading fast. The winners of this next cycle will be those who bridge utility and virality, and $LILPEPE is doing exactly that. So, if you missed Solana at $2, and you’re looking for that next shot at a 15,000% return, consider whether $LILPEPE at $0.0013 is your next big bet. Because when the frog leaps, it might leap to the top 100. And a $455 investment today could be the $91,000 portfolio move your 2026 self will thank you for.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

However, the bears had other ideas, and not only forced the price back to the upper trendline, but drove it back inside the flag. Is this just a postponement of the breakout, or could the price be brought lower still?\nIs $BTC going to break out or not?\nSource: TradingView\nThe short-term chart for $BTC shows a fakeout of the bull flag. When the price was over $110,000 on Thursday this was probably the last thing that the bulls expected. That said, $BTC was becoming overbought, and once the first breakout confirmation had been made, and the price rolled over again, the bulls suddenly lost their nerve and the price receded back into the bull flag.\nOne further bearish factor that will give the bulls food for thought is that the surge out of the bull flag did not put in a higher high. It got pretty close, but pretty close still isn’t a higher high.\nOn the more positive side of things, the overbought condition for $BTC is resetting as the Stochastic RSI indicators on the 4-hour time frame have now hit the bottom. Having said that, the 8-hour and 12-hour Stochastic RSIs still have a way to go, and might even start turning up before they get to the bottom.\n$106,000 important level to hold\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily chart reveals that the price is still above the $106,000 support. This is an important level because it marks the top of some candle bodies from December 2024 through to January 2025. If this level continues to hold, the breakout and fakeout of the bull flag could just be a momentary setback.\nWeekly close crucial for deciding next week’s price direction\nSource: TradingView\nThe 4 of July holiday in the United States may have had something to do with the lacklustre trading of $BTC on Friday. Be that as it may, looking at the macro picture, the surge out of the falling wedge pattern has turned into a classic bull flag, and it might be expected that this plays out to the upside, even if it does take a while longer.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are still sitting on a knife edge. Any positive or negative price action over this weekend could tip the scales in either direction. The ideal situation for the bulls would be for a confirmed cross back up at the end of Sunday. If this doesn’t take place, expect at least another week of sideways price action.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With Stage 4 now live at a price of $0.08 per token, the incremental price structure is designed to reward early adopters and increase urgency among potential investors.\nTraders keen to capitalize on the rapid movement of crypto markets are acutely aware of the potential returns from meme coin investments. After all, stories of early adopters achieving significant gains from coins like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu still resonate loudly. As Stage 4 begins, this remains one of the best crypto opportunities available now.\nStage 4 Is Live—Investment Window Narrowing\nAs Stage 4 tokens begin to sell quickly at the increased price point, investors have a narrow window to enter before the next price increment takes effect.

The best Web3 crypto coins now prioritize transparent incentives, sustainable growth, and meaningful utility over hype-driven speculation.\nAmong the leading names in this category, BlockDAG is setting a clear precedent, followed by well-established players like HBAR, Litecoin, and Filecoin. Each offers a unique value proposition within the Web3 economy, and together they represent the most strategic picks for long-term utility-focused investing.\nBlockDAG (BDAG)\nBlockDAG tops the list of the best Web3 crypto coins for its combination of transparent tokenomics and sustainability-oriented incentives. Currently running a summer campaign, BlockDAG has launched a $2 million USDT lottery, but what sets it apart is how it delivers up to 300% BDAG bonuses without diluting token supply. Instead of printing new tokens, the rewards are structured through pre-allocated incentives, preserving token integrity while maximizing holder value. Even those who don’t win USDT prizes receive substantial BDAG instantly, ensuring no entry goes unrewarded.\nThe presale has been a major success, with over $331 million raised and more than 23.6 billion coins sold. BlockDAG is currently in batch 29 with a listed price of $0.0276, but a limited-time offer allows users to buy at just $0.0016.\nThis creates a return on investment of 2,660% for early participants, a figure few projects can match while maintaining solid fundamentals. With this structured reward model, BlockDAG is proving that incentives and sustainability can coexist in the Web3 era.\nHedera (HBAR)\nHedera continues to be one of the best Web3 crypto coins due to its energy-efficient consensus model and strong institutional partnerships. Rather than relying on traditional blockchain architecture, Hedera uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure called Hashgraph, which allows for faster, more scalable, and environmentally responsible transactions. It uses significantly less energy per transaction than proof-of-work chains, making it a preferred choice for eco-conscious developers and enterprises.\nHBAR’s use cases include enterprise-level applications such as supply chain tracking, identity verification, and carbon credit tokenization. The network’s governance council includes leading global organizations, which adds a layer of long-term credibility and stability. Hedera’s approach to sustainable performance and real-world integration makes it one of the few coins that can scale efficiently without overextending network resources.\nLitecoin (LTC)\nLitecoin has maintained relevance in the Web3 conversation by staying consistent with its mission of fast, low-cost peer-to-peer payments. What makes LTC one of the best Web3 crypto coins is its ability to balance network performance with simplicity. Unlike projects that chase constant feature rollouts, Litecoin focuses on doing one thing well — providing a dependable currency that works globally and securely.\nRecently, Litecoin has gained traction in real-world applications, especially in retail payments and ATM integration. Its energy consumption is lower compared to older proof-of-work coins, and it has a history of stable network performance. Litecoin’s sustainability comes not from green branding, but from a decade-long track record of uptime, consistent development, and use-case alignment. For investors looking for long-term durability in Web3, LTC remains a trusted option.\nFilecoin (FIL)\nFilecoin represents a different kind of Web3 sustainability — one centered on decentralized storage infrastructure. As the demand for cloud storage increases, Filecoin offers a decentralized alternative that allows users to rent out unused data storage space in exchange for FIL tokens. This creates a market-driven, peer-to-peer ecosystem that decentralizes control and reduces reliance on traditional cloud providers.\nFIL is considered one of the best Web3 crypto coins because it transforms underutilized digital resources into valuable economic assets. The protocol’s incentive model ensures that data is stored reliably and retrieved efficiently, which is critical for use cases ranging from NFT hosting to decentralized video platforms. Filecoin’s long-term growth hinges on a practical need for decentralized storage, making its value proposition both economically and technically sustainable.\nFinal Thoughts\nIn a market often driven by short-term hype, the best Web3 crypto coins are those that stay grounded in utility, sustainability, and clear token economics. BlockDAG leads this shift by combining real user incentives with a no-dilution policy that protects token value. HBAR follows with energy efficiency and corporate-level adoption.\nLitecoin brings proven reliability with global payment relevance, while Filecoin targets infrastructure sustainability through decentralized storage. As the Web3 movement matures, these coins are setting the standard for responsible, long-lasting growth.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Buying Neo Pepe Coin Today? Here’s What That Could Mean By January 2026", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/buying-neo-pepe-coin-today-heres-what-that-could-mean-by-january-2026", "text": "Fresh Surge in Meme Coins Sends Signals Across Crypto Markets\nCrypto analysts and influencers alike are drawing bold lines between past meme coin cycles and the emerging signals playing out in real time. July's digital asset markets are delivering curious echoes of 2021—with meme coins once again stealing bandwidth from more traditional altcoins. While large-cap players like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) consolidate within tight trading ranges, token chatter is rapidly converging around newer, community-fueled entrants.\nAmong these, Pepe Coin (PEPE) has continued to deliver unexpected strength after its May retracement, and some market watchers believe it’s flashing signs of an accumulation phase. Notably, social analytics platform LunarCrush reported that PEPE’s social volume jumped 27% this week, while its engagement rate outpaced SHIB, BONK, and FLOKI combined. Whale interest is not just returning—it appears to be recalibrating.\nInfluencers like Cobie and Ansem have recently highlighted the shift. Cobie noted in a recent livestream that the “memecoin window hasn’t closed—only narrowed.” Meanwhile, decentralized exchange aggregator Matcha recorded an uptick in swap volume for tokens under $0.01—another clear signal that retail is sniffing out asymmetric bets ahead of what some are calling a Q4 “memebull.”\nTrading Desks Rotate Into Cheaper Social Coins With Narrative Hooks\nWith much of the top-tier altcoin sector either stagnant or suffering drawdowns, smaller meme projects are absorbing that liquidity. Analysts at Kaiko and Messari have pointed to the rotation pattern where traders, especially retail-led Telegram and Discord groups, are deploying capital into coins under a penny that carry strong branding, heavy community involvement, and thematic resonance.\nOne striking development was the listing of FARTCOIN on BitMart earlier this week, triggering a 46% intraday spike in volume. The listing, while humorous, reinforces the thesis that social virality and timing now outweigh technical fundamentals in many corners of crypto. It also suggests that centralized exchanges are once again leaning into meme narratives to boost user engagement amid trading volume slumps.\nInterestingly, the most consistently mentioned meme coin in Telegram alpha chats isn't even listed yet. It’s tied to a presale—and that brings us to what could be one of the most discussed pre-market entrants this year.\nTop 5 Meme Coins to Watch in 2025\n-\nNeo Pepe Coin (NEOP) – Emerging as a serious contender in the meme coin arena, Neo Pepe blends cultural symbolism with robust tokenomics and a community-run DAO model. With a 16-stage presale, hourly unlock mechanics, and a 2.5% auto-liquidity burn system, $NEOP is more than hype—it's a movement against centralized market saturation. Its Certik-audited smart contracts and governance-first structure place it at the forefront of this next meme cycle.\n-\nPepe Coin (PEPE) – The original frog meme token remains a core player due to its first-mover advantage and strong meme identity. Having reached all-time highs during 2023, PEPE continues to post significant volume across decentralized exchanges and maintains a loyal social following.\n-\nShiba Inu (SHIB) – Still one of the most recognizable names in meme crypto, SHIB's broad ecosystem, including Shibarium and ShibaSwap, gives it an edge beyond memes. Its large holder base and upcoming technical developments keep it in the spotlight.\n-\nBonk (BONK) – Born on Solana, BONK represents a newer generation of fast-moving meme coins backed by a vibrant community and minimal fees. It thrives on Solana's high-speed infrastructure and remains a favorite on-chain meme asset with developer engagement.\n-\nFartcoin (FARTCOIN) – While it started as satire, FARTCOIN’s recent BitMart listing and volume spike prove the power of internet culture. Its irreverent branding has garnered a cult following, and its rising chart is forcing analysts to take it seriously, albeit cautiously.\nMatrix Gets a Meme Makeover With Emerging Symbol of Decentralization\nYou might want to get a little Pepe. But let's be clear, a little -Neo- Pepe.\nNeo Pepe Coin ($NEOP) is marching toward the fourth stage of its 16-tier presale, with its current price hovering around $0.07. Once the current tranche sells out, the token price will jump to $0.08—continuing its carefully architected path to $0.16 by the presale's end. This isn’t just price gimmickry. The presale format is deeply tied to Neo Pepe's core narrative: that decentralization should reward urgency, not whales.\nUnlike most meme coin launches, which often unleash their full supply into the market in a single breath, Neo Pepe’s tokenomics introduce hourly post-launch unlocks. This dynamic ensures stability and reduces the risk of sharp dumps. Meanwhile, every $NEOP transaction on Uniswap includes a 2.5% auto-liquidity fee—permanently burned LP tokens lock value, reinforcing price strength over time.\nCommunity Calls Shots in a Movement Built for Control & Clarity\nNeo Pepe’s design is more than marketing theatre. The protocol is governed by the NEOPGovernor contract, enabling true DAO-based governance. Holders can propose new actions, vote on treasury disbursements, and even decide which exchanges $NEOP lists on first. With 45% of the total 1B token supply dedicated to presale buyers, the early community is positioned to hold both influence and liquidity.\nThe governance system includes a 1-day proposal delay, 7-day voting window, and a final timelock before execution. No central party has override capabilities—decisions must pass quorum and follow process. Treasury activity is governed in similar fashion, with funds used for marketing, liquidity, burns, or grants only through approved proposals.\nAdding credibility to the system, Neo Pepe underwent a Certik Audit and scored a 71.96—a respectable mark considering the project’s focus on immutable contracts and permanent liquidity. The full audit details can be viewed here.\nCrypto Fire Evaluates Neo Pepe Coin With Clarity\nCrypto content creator Crypto Fire recently dove into Neo Pepe Coin's presale, positively noting its innovative liquidity arrangement, systematic token sale phases, and strong community-driven governance, while still thoughtfully addressing typical meme-token investment considerations.\nBuying Today Offers Entry Into Something More Than a Meme\nCrypto prices can be fickle, but narratives that resonate with a culture stick. Neo Pepe isn’t vying to replace Bitcoin—it’s aiming to redirect the momentum behind meme coins toward a mission: resisting market saturation, central control, and transient hype.\nIts roadmap reads less like a promise and more like a blueprint. From global marketing campaigns and cross-chain integration to centralized exchange listings and DAO-activated platform features, every milestone is contingent on community participation and approval—not unilateral direction.\nNeo Pepe currently accepts payments in ETH, USDT, USDC across Ethereum, Base, and BNB Smart Chain. Interested buyers can buy crypto directly on the official website, with live presale data and unlock schedules visible in real time.\nCrypto influencers have started to take note—and as we push toward Q4, the next major exchange listing or social breakout could very well come from this insurgent Memetrix movement.\nFor those scouting the best crypto opportunities that still sit under radar yet inside real momentum, Neo Pepe Coin stands ready. But make no mistake—this isn’t just another pepe coin. This is something very different.\nVisit Neo Pepe’s official site to join the presale, buy crypto before Stage 4 pricing kicks in, and dive into what might become the defining meme coin of 2025.\nStay updated by joining the community on Telegram and following the team on X.\nTime to Choose Red\nYou’ve seen the signals, followed the chatter, and glimpsed the possibilities. Now you face the choice that defines every cycle—stay chained to yesterday’s coins or step into the Memetrix. The path of $NEOP is clear, structured, and waiting. No central masters. No manipulated listings. Just code, community, and commitment. Take the red pill. Become part of something decentralized by design.

As XRP solidifies its position, Lightchain AI is preparing for a strategic market entry at the end of July, aiming to introduce innovative AI-driven blockchain solutions.\nThis upcoming launch seeks to capture attention by blending advanced technology with blockchain efficiency, potentially reshaping the landscape. While XRP benefits from established momentum, Lightchain AI’s debut promises fresh opportunities, signaling a dynamic phase in crypto innovation as both projects advance toward broader market influence.\nXRP’s Sustained Growth and Market Presence\nThe continued rise of XRP in 2025 has helped the cryptocurrency bounce back from its 2020 lows and surge with regulatory clarity and increasing institutional interest.\nIts prolonged battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has now been settled, clearing the path for wider adoption and a place within institutional financial systems.\nStrategic actions by Ripple, including the introduction of XRP futures on CME Group, have generated significant institutional interest, with more than $542 million in futures contract volume traded, demonstrating market confidence in XRP’s future.\nIn addition, Ripple adding XRP to the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve highlights the increasing importance this asset class has to nations. According to analysts, XRP could touch down at a price of between $2.90–$5.50 by the time 2025 comes to a close, should it keep up with adoption rates and other market factors.\nLightchain AI’s Innovative Approach and Upcoming Launch\nLightchain AI’s innovative approach is setting the stage for a powerful launch as its mainnet goes live at the end of July 2025. At its core is the unique Proof-of-Intelligence (PoI) consensus, which rewards nodes for performing meaningful AI tasks instead of traditional mining, making every computational cycle purposeful.\nTo safeguard privacy and trust, Lightchain AI integrates Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) that verify AI computations without revealing sensitive data. Reinforcing transparency, all core protocol components—including PoI, staking contracts, and the AIVM engine—will be published on GitHub, inviting developers worldwide to audit, contribute, and fork.\nLightchain AI’s DAO governance model empowers token holders to propose and vote on upgrades, ensuring that community decisions shape the protocol’s evolution. This blend of technology and openness makes Lightchain AI one to watch.\nLightchain AI: The AI Blockchain Ready to Ignite Fresh Market Excitement\nLightchain AI’s highly anticipated mainnet launch is set for July, sparking immense excitement within the blockchain and AI communities. This milestone marks the dawn of a new era, where cutting-edge innovation meets decentralized collaboration.\nWith its unparalleled transparency, community-driven governance, and groundbreaking technology, Lightchain AI is poised to illuminate the future.

Little Pepe ($LILPEPE), currently priced under $0.003, is a rare gem — a memecoin poised not only to capture attention but also to deliver outsized returns. Just as Solana (SOL) transformed from an underdog to a top-10 crypto asset with a nearly 20,000% price surge during the last bull cycle, $LILPEPE is shaping up to chart a similar trajectory. But this isn’t just hype. Behind the memes is a Layer 2 blockchain platform that promises blazing speeds, low fees, and true decentralization — all underpinned by one of the most culturally resonant icons in internet history.\nWhy Little Pepe Is More Than Just a Meme\nMeme coins have always had viral potential. But $LILPEPE separates itself from the pack by fusing meme appeal with Layer 2 scalability — a rare combo in a saturated market of purely speculative assets. While Ethereum continues to grapple with gas fees and congested networks, Little Pepe emerges as a Layer 2 solution built to scale, one that offers finality faster than Elon can tweet and transactions cheaper than your morning coffee. This gives it a significant edge over older, clunkier meme coins that offer nothing but temporary attention spikes. With its native utility token ($LILPEPE) serving as the fuel for the ecosystem, Little Pepe is building its own Layer 2 infrastructure — a blockchain ecosystem designed to support dApps, DeFi, NFTs, and more. In essence, it’s blending the virality of Dogecoin with the technical vision of Ethereum rollups. And here’s where it gets truly interesting for investors.\nThe Price Point: The Sweet Spot Before the Surge\nCurrently in Stage 4 of its presale, $LILPEPE is priced at just $0.0013 — far below the psychological $0.01 threshold and still significantly below its projected price target of $0.60 by the end of 2025. Over $3 million has already been raised from early participants, with nearly 2.7 billion tokens sold out of the 3.75 billion allocated for presale. With this momentum, it’s clear the market sees something special—and if history teaches us anything, presales of this scale often precede explosive listings. If you had bought Solana at $0.22 in early 2020, you would’ve seen it surge to over $250 within two years. The same kind of asymmetric upside exists here, especially for those entering before $LILPEPE hits major exchanges.\nTokenomics Built for Growth, Not Exit Liquidity\nA common pitfall of many presale tokens is poor tokenomics. Fortunately, $LILPEPE avoids this trap with a carefully structured allocation designed to foster liquidity, reward holders, and fund growth.\n-\n26.5% of the supply is allocated to presale participants, giving early investors a significant upside.\n-\n10% is reserved for liquidity, ensuring a smooth launch on decentralized exchanges.\n-\n13.5% is dedicated to staking and rewards, incentivizing long-term holding.\n-\n0% buy/sell tax, keeping it attractive for high-volume traders and whales alike.\nWhat’s missing from this breakdown? Any allocations to “team” wallets or hidden dev bags typically signal red flags. This is a meme coin with community-first tokenomics and full transparency.\nThe $777K Giveaway & Final Push\nTo further amplify attention, Little Pepe is currently running a $777,000 giveaway, where ten winners will receive $77,000 worth of tokens each. With over 12,000 entries already recorded, this campaign is rapidly expanding $LILPEPE’s reach beyond just the typical crypto crowd and into mainstream meme culture. Participation requires only a $100 minimum presale contribution and some basic social tasks—a clever move to drive both capital and viral exposure.\nA Solana-Like Future?\nSolana succeeded because it solved a real problem (the slow and expensive Ethereum) while simultaneously attracting developers and capital. $LILPEPE is on a similar path — offering not only a faster, cheaper Layer 2 solution but doing so in a way that resonates with crypto’s native audience: meme-loving, culture-savvy investors who want both utility and fun. While Solana had the tech crowd behind it, Little Pepe has something just as powerful: a growing legion of retail investors, influencers, and crypto communities rallying behind a vision that is both scalable and culturally sticky. And most importantly, it’s still under $0.003.\nFinal Thoughts\nCrypto has always rewarded those willing to act before the crowd. With $LILPEPE still in presale, priced at a fraction of a penny, the opportunity for exponential upside is staring us in the face.\nIt’s not often you find a token that offers:\n-\nLayer 2 blockchain utility\n-\nMeme virality\n-\nTransparent, community-focused tokenomics\n-\nPresale access with zero tax\n-\nA path to mainstream listings and exchange liquidity\nSolana took less than two years to turn early investors into millionaires. With the right timing, $LILPEPE is the 2025 version of that success story. Don’t wait for $0.30 or $0.50 headlines. If you believe in buying low and holding smart, now is the moment to pay attention.

Jasmy had a good run in the AI and IoT hype cycle. But in a market where speed, decentralization, and real returns matter more than promises, it’s becoming clear that a new player is stealing the spotlight. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is making serious noise in the presale arena with a high-performance blockchain, real tech, and an economic model that doesn’t rely on hype. This isn’t just another altcoin chasing trends. This is Bitcoin 2.0 with a jet engine under the hood.\nJasmy Coin Had Its Moment, But That Moment Is Fading\nJasmy carved out a niche for itself by tying into the narrative of data ownership and IoT decentralization. And to be fair, it still has its community. But as the dust settles, investors are asking harder questions. Can Jasmy deliver speed, scalability, and income-generation at the level the new market demands? For many, the answer is uncertain.\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin Solaris has answered these questions before you even had time to ask them. With real tech already tested and a roadmap loaded with aggressive rollouts, BTC-S is rapidly becoming the coin people wish they bought earlier. The next phase isn’t just coming. It’s already in motion.\nThe Core: How BTC-S Is Built to Make You Rich\nBitcoin Solaris is not trying to reinvent crypto with gimmicks. It’s focused on giving power back to users through wealth-building mechanisms that are practical, scalable, and easy to use.\nSome key core features include:\n-\nA dual-layer blockchain built with Proof-of-Work for security and Delegated Proof-of-Stake for high-speed throughput.\n-\nA tested speed of over 10,000 transactions per second with 2-second finality.\n-\nSupport for Rust-based smart contracts and cross-chain asset bridges.\n-\nEnergy-efficient validator rotation and slashing systems to maintain decentralization.\n-\nThe upcoming Solaris Nova App will unlock mobile mining for users everywhere.\nAnd if you think this is all just talk, one detailed review by Crypto Vlog breaks down exactly why Bitcoin Solaris is becoming the new standard in next-gen wealth tokens.\nCrypto Was Meant for Everyone BTC-S Finally Delivers That Promise\nThis Presale Isn’t Just Fast. It’s Explosive.\nWe’re now in Phase 10 of the presale. The price is $10 and the next jump to $11 is just around the corner. With a launch price locked at $20, that’s a guaranteed 150 percent return for early participants.\nBut this is more than just about numbers. The presale has already raised over $6 million, with more than 13,650 unique users joining in. That’s not buzz. That’s momentum. One of the shortest and most explosive presales on the market is happening right now, and there are only around 4 weeks left.\nSolaris recommends wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask for receiving your tokens on launch day. They’re not needed for purchasing, but they ensure smooth delivery once the network goes live.\nMining Without the Warehouse\nGone are the days of setting up loud rigs in your garage. Bitcoin Solaris introduces mining through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova App. It’s designed to let users mine directly from mobile devices, using adaptive energy-efficient algorithms that scale based on device type.\nYou can already estimate your potential gains with the official Bitcoin Solaris mining calculator. Whether you’re running a spare tablet or your everyday phone, you’re part of the action.\nWith a dashboard that supports real-time metrics, leaderboard challenges, and dynamic team features, mining with BTC-S feels more like a strategy game than a backend tech job.\nThe Roadmap to Domination\nThis is not a coin with an unclear future. Bitcoin Solaris has published a robust and transparent roadmap that stretches from the 2025 mainnet rollout all the way to government-level partnerships in 2028 and beyond.\nIn short, the journey includes:\n-\nWallet, testnet, and smart contract optimization in early 2026.\n-\nFull mainnet launch with governance and AI-ready Nova App by Q3 2026.\n-\nEcosystem expansion and Mining Power Marketplace by late 2026.\n-\nCross-chain functionality, DApp accelerators, and Fortune 500 adoption by 2027.\n-\nGlobal impact partnerships and blockchain education programs by 2028.\nYou can explore the full Bitcoin Solaris roadmap and see for yourself how this isn’t just another speculative altcoin; it’s a vision with real steps.\nReal Audits. Real Confidence.\nBitcoin Solaris has already passed multiple audits, including those from Cyberscope and Freshcoins. This isn’t a whitepaper promise. It’s been reviewed, checked, and verified.\nAnd if you still have questions, just join the growing community on Telegram or follow updates directly from X. Thousands are already discussing it daily.\nFinal Verdict: The Next Bitcoin Is Already Here\nForget Jasmy. It had its chapter. But Bitcoin Solaris is writing the next book in the story of wealth through crypto. With lightning-fast tech, a presale that’s igniting the charts, and mining that fits in your pocket, BTC-S is exactly what Bitcoin 2.0 should be: accessible, scalable, and ready for the world.\nFor more information on Bitcoin Solaris:\nWebsite: https://www.bitcoinsolaris.com/\nTelegram: https://t.me/Bitcoinsolaris\nX: https://x.com/BitcoinSolaris\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin is stabilizing above $62K, Ethereum’s holding $3,400, and traders across X (formerly Twitter), Discord, and Telegram can feel it: the next macro leg up isn’t just possible—it’s approaching. If BTC touches $170,000 and ETH crosses $8,000—targets floated by multiple institutional desks—the meme coin market won’t just move. It’ll erupt. And in this next run, it won’t be the usual suspects leading the charge. We’re watching four meme coins that have the potential to increase by 5,000% or more—not because of nostalgia, but because of their narrative positioning, technical structure, and raw community momentum. First up? A Layer-2 frog with real teeth.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) – The Infrastructure Meme Built to Moon\nYou’ve seen meme coins ride hype waves. You’ve seen them vanish just as fast. But LILPEPE is different—it’s engineered to ride the wave and still be standing when the tide rolls back. At its core is a Layer-2 blockchain, not just a token. Built for zero-tax swaps, staking utility, and meme-native project launches, LILPEPE isn’t trying to follow PEPE or Dogecoin—it’s surpassing them through infrastructure.\nThe market is responding.\nCurrently in Stage 4 of its presale, LILPEPE has already sold 2.57 billion tokens, raising $3,037,695—68.01% complete with a soft cap of $4.475 million. Token price? Just $0.0013, with a guaranteed listing at $0.003, meaning early buyers lock in an immediate 2.3x ROI. But that’s the floor. Analysts are floating $0.05, $0.10, even $1 if listings and narrative tailwinds align.\nAnd they just might. A $777,000 giveaway campaign is pouring gasoline on the fire, rewarding early holders, creators, and community promoters. Social chatter is spiking, and meme coin influencers are piling in—not just for fun, but for function. LILPEPE is staking, launching, and scaling before it even hits the open market.\nIn a bull run defined by narratives, utility-infused memes will outperform legacy tokens. LILPEPE is the most technically capable meme coin in presale today—and the one most likely to 50x before Bitcoin hits $170K.\nPeanut the Squirrel (PNUT) – Viral Animal Meme Coin\nPeanut (PNUT) is a 2024 meme coin born from a heart-wrenching viral story. It honors a rescued pet squirrel (“Peanut”) whose plight drew worldwide attention (even Elon Musk tweeted about it). After its launch, PNUT soared to a $1+ billion market cap in days and won a Binance listing. The coin’s community grew overnight, united by a cause and a whimsical mascot.\nUnlike dog-themed tokens, Peanut stands out as a protest symbol and charity coin (partnering with animal organizations). This unique narrative has kept its momentum alive beyond a typical pump. In late 2024 and 2025, PNUT benefited from crypto bull runs; it jumped quickly on market upswings due to hype.\nGoing into Q3 2025, Peanut’s volatility is very high – it can 10x or more in short bursts – because it’s still seen as a tokenization of a viral meme more than a project. However, its Binance listing and cause-driven branding give it more substance than most new memecoins. For investors looking for the next viral hit, PNUT’s story and engagement make it a top meme pick to follow.\nPudgy Penguins (PENGU) – NFT-Driven Meme\nPENGU is the native token of the Pudgy Penguins NFT project, launched in 2023. Unlike dog or frog memes, its mascot is a cartoon penguin, and it has one of the strongest crypto communities (millions of NFT fans). The token’s market cap is relatively modest (under $100 million), but it often trends in line with NFT and meme markets.\nAnalysts note that even after some pullbacks, PENGU still ranks as a top meme token by social buzz, backed by its large NFT community. The project plans to develop play-to-earn games and has established partnerships (e.g., NASCAR), aiming to expand its ecosystem. In Q3 2025, PENGU’s upside depends on NFT and play‑to‑earn trends: it could rally strongly if those sectors heat up.\nEven without big headlines, the token tends to react to overall market movements (when the crypto market rises, Pudgy often follows). Its community’s focus on fun and collectibility gives it a different flavor among memes. In summary, Pudgy Penguins’ token is a niche play: high-risk but with upside if meme and NFT mania return.\nMemecoin (MEME) – 9GAG’s Viral Token\nMemecoin ($MEME) was created by the team behind the popular meme site 9GAG (sold on launch to early investors in Oct 2023). It’s 100% memes – no roadmap or utility – but it has a strong social angle. As of mid-2025, $MEME trades at a few cents, with approximately 7.5 billion tokens in circulation (market cap: around $260 million).\nIt briefly surged to $0.04 on hype news. The coin’s community is tied to the 9GAG brand (millions of followers) and tends to buy on meme speculation alone. For Q3 2025, MEME is purely speculative; it can surge in a frenzy or crash just as quickly. However, its backing by a known platform means it will remain on the radar of hype-driven investors. Traders may watch MEME for quick momentum plays when the market is frothy. In short, MEME represents the ultimate viral gamble – if meme culture booms, it could explode; if not, it may underperform.\nFinal Word: You Don’t Wait for 5,000% Gains—You Front-Run Them\nLILPEPE is still in presale. PNUT is undervalued in a sleepy zone. PENGU is waiting for NFTs to heat up. MEME is hovering like a loaded spring. If Bitcoin and Ethereum punch through all-time highs this year, these four tokens won’t just rise—they’ll explode. But by the time headlines catch on, it’ll be too late. So look closely now. Because the market’s whispering, and these coins are already leaning into the mic.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Positioned as a next-generation platform, Lightchain AI aims to bring a fresh approach to decentralized innovation by focusing on transparency, scalability, and community-driven governance.\nAs industries increasingly seek secure and efficient blockchain solutions, Lightchain AI’s upcoming debut promises to offer new opportunities for developers and enterprises alike. Though overshadowed by established names, this launch could mark the beginning of a significant shift in the decentralized technology landscape.\nEthereum and Solana- Dominating Headlines with Strong Market Moves\nEthereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are stealing the crypto spotlight in 2025.\nEthereum’s Pectra upgrade, comprising its largest upgrade since the Merge of 2022, has quickened transaction time and brought down fees, helping it take a stand in DeFi and smart contract applications. Although it has competition, Ethereum is nevertheless a lifeline for DeFi projects, from which more than $51.9 billion in “value” is locked.\nNeither Solana’s volume surge nor our claim that DEX Volumes on Solana have surpassed those on Ethereum, by the way, are breaking news or insider baseball to the Solana community itself, which has seen its volume in DEX trading spike to $64.1 billion over 30 days. Raydium and Orca meanwhile are getting credit for going parabolic but remain challenged by memecoin volatility and face increasingly stiff competition from Hyperliquid.\nBoth networks are attracting institutional interest. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has removed a barrier for staked Ethereum and Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – a move that may help bring even more liquidity (and confidence) to the table.\nXRP’s Position Strengthens as Investors Eye Regulatory Shifts\nXRP's market position has strengthened following the resolution of its legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On June 27, Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the company's decision to withdraw its cross-appeal, with the SEC expected to do the same, signaling the end of a nearly five-year legal battle . This move provides much-needed regulatory clarity, affirming that XRP sales on public exchanges are lawful, while institutional sales were deemed to have violated securities laws.\nIn response, XRP's price surged to $2.20, reflecting renewed investor confidence . The resolution has also prompted a 442% increase in daily active addresses, indicating heightened network activity . With legal uncertainties behind it, XRP is poised for growth, supported by expanding institutional adoption and real-world use cases.\nLightchain AI- Rising AI Blockchain Ready to Make Waves in July 2025\nLightchain AI is set to make waves in July 2025 as it transitions from a successful testnet to its highly anticipated mainnet launch. With its unique Proof-of-Intelligence consensus and the advanced Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine, Lightchain AI is designed to merge blockchain’s transparency with real AI computational power.\nThe roadmap includes open-source releases, decentralized validator and contributor nodes, and a robust developer portal to attract builders worldwide. Focused on sustainability and constant evolution, Lightchain AI empowers community-driven governance and continuous technological refinement.\nLightchain AI is set to revolutionize blockchain intelligence by merging decentralized infrastructure with advanced AI capabilities. As July 2025 approaches, this milestone promises to mark a transformative moment for its expanding ecosystem.\nhttps://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf\nhttps://t.me/LightchainProtocol\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

That moment is here. Sentiment indicators are flashing green, on-chain whale movement is up, and “meme season” chatter is rising again in the Telegram and Twitter trenches. If you're reading this, you're early. Because while Layer-1 blue chips simmer, the meme market is starting to bubble—and three tokens are drawing severe heat: Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Pepe Coin (PEPE), and Bonk (BONK). Let’s walk through the trio, starting with the one that isn’t just playing the game, but rewriting it.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) – Engineered for Meme Momentum\nLILPEPE is not just another frog token—it’s the one with a blueprint. Instead of launching with nothing but hype, the dev team went full infrastructure mode: a Layer-2 meme-native chain, zero-tax trades, and staking baked into the protocol. It’s designed for speed, fairness, and scalability—and it's doing what SHIB and PEPE never could: combining meme energy with serious tech.\nThe Results? Electric.\nLILPEPE is midway through Stage 4 of its presale. It’s already raised $3,037,695 out of a $4.475 million target—68.01% sold for $0.0013. The listing is locked at $0.003, meaning traders who get in now are securing a near-130% gain before it even hits the market.\nAnd then there’s the $777,000 giveaway—a massive campaign that has LILPEPE all over influencer feeds and community chats. But hype aside, there’s real strategy here. Anti-bot mechanics protect entries. Staking rewards ensure retention. And the presale dashboard feels less like a meme farm and more like a DeFi product. This isn’t a cash grab—it’s a token with legs.\nIf meme coin cycles reward speed, design, and visibility, then LILPEPE isn’t just poised to run—it’s already running. Analysts are whispering price targets from $0.05 to $0.10, with some even daring to suggest $1 if listings and momentum align. At current pricing, that’s not just a 10x play—it’s potentially 50–70x for early movers.\nPepe (PEPE) – Frog Meme Memecoin\nPepe Coin (PEPE) sprang up in April 2023 as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog meme. It exploded almost instantly – early holders saw life-changing gains as PEPE became one of the hottest new memecoins. Although built with no-code utility, its cultural impact and wild returns cemented Pepe’s status. After the 2023 surge cooled, Pepe remains one of the largest meme tokens by market cap (multi-billion USD).\nAs of mid-2025, the project is seeing renewed interest: on-chain data indicates whales are accumulating PEPE again. BraveNewCoin also highlights surging whale flows and rising futures open interest, suggesting that smart money is betting on a Q3 rebound. The fanbase remains very active and vocal on Twitter and Telegram, keeping the meme alive.\nFor traders, PEPE offers high volatility: any new “meme season” (crypto hype cycle) could send it roaring higher. The risks are also high – it’s pump-and-dump by design – but if one is looking for momentum plays, Pepe checks the box. In short, PEPE’s proven track record and signs of renewed accumulation make it a prime meme coin to watch in Q3.\nBonk (BONK) – Solana’s Community Doge\nBonk was the first dog-themed meme coin on Solana, launched at the end of 2022 via an airdrop to Solana users. Built by community devs to rally Solana, Bonk quickly became the network’s mascot token. Today, Bonk sits among the top meme coins by market cap, widely traded on Binance and Coinbase. Its broad distribution and burn of the initial supply give it a more grassroots feel than some token launches.\nImportantly, BONK has started to gain utility on Solana: many Solana NFT and DeFi projects now accept BONK for payments, including burns. Bonk’s price has also tracked Solana’s market action: when SOL rose in late 2023 and 2024, Bonk followed with big gains. The community on Solana is very engaged, and Bonk feels like a rallying point.\nGoing into Q3 2025, Bonk could continue to benefit if Solana’s revival persists. It has momentum on its side; analysts note that Bonk’s edge (low cap and Solana focus) could see it deliver outsized gains by year-end. In summary, as Solana’s “Doge”, Bonk is a promising memecoin play with both hype and growing real-world use\nConclusion: Don’t Wait for the Frog Chorus—Lead It\nAll three coins carry different weights:\n-\nPEPE has meme pedigree, whale signals, and volatility upside.\n-\nBONK has Solana integration and a loyal, utility-focused community.\n-\nBut LILPEPE? It has everything—momentum, infrastructure, and upside still on the launchpad.\nWith presale entries still open, LILPEPE offers what the others can no longer: early access. And in a meme market, the edge goes to the one everyone’s about to talk about—not the one they’ve already priced in.\nThe indicator is flashing. The meme cycle is stirring. And if there’s one coin most likely to leap from presale buzz to market firestorm in Q3, it’s the one building on-chain with a frog face and a plan.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Under The Radar Meme Coin TOKEN6900 Raises $150k In Presale Overnight", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/under-the-radar-meme-coin-token6900-raises-150k-in-presale-overnight", "text": "Bitcoin’s rally to $110k has resulted in a return of the bull market euphoria, bringing meme coins back into the spotlight.\nBesides the large caps, new meme coins are in high demand as well.\nFor instance, TOKEN6900 (T6900) has emerged as one of the hottest presale tokens on the market, raising over $150,000 in its ICO overnight.\nBranding itself as the successor to the viral SPX6900, TOKEN6900 is driven by the same anti-Wall Street spirit, meme-fueled delusion, and blind devotion to one sacred number: 6900.\nMuch like Fartcoin, SPX6900 and Useless Coin, T6900 doesn’t pretend to have any utility. It boldly claims to be the product of the brain rot theory, which may very well be the winning formula.\nIndeed, despite being an under-the-radar meme coin, many analysts are already calling it the next 10X crypto.\nTOKEN6900 - The Ultimate Brain Rot Meme Coin With Explosive Potential\nGone are the days of meme coins trying to sell investors on their utility.\nNew meme coins are now living up to the spirit of Pepe and Dogecoin, relying on community spirit and the power of memes.\nFartcoin reached a $2.7 billion valuation without any Tier-1 listing or developer team, just because of its funny name and the constant habit of annoying Wall Street purists.\nMeanwhile, Useless Coin captures its spirit in its name. Despite being useless, it has surged by over 5000% from its June lows.\nSPX6900 has also established itself as one of the top-performing meme coins on the market, driven by nothing more than the collective delusion of overtaking the S&P 500.\nTOKEN6900 is a product of the same meme-fueled delusion.\nUnlike coins that hide behind vague claims of future utility or AI integration, TOKEN6900 is blunt about its purpose: attention, chaos, and collective belief. The project describes itself in the whitepaper as a “consciousness parasite” and “a benchmark for brain rot finance,” intentionally leaning into the absurdity that drives today’s meme coin rallies.\nThis self-aware tone is the core of its identity. “It doesn’t track GDP, oil, or earnings,” the whitepaper states. “It tracks vibe liquidity.” In a market where narrative often beats fundamentals, that kind of radical honesty resonates.\nUnsurprisingly, TOKEN6900 has quickly established itself as one of the hottest new meme coins on the market. Raising over $150k in its ICO overnight is a sign of potential whale involvement, strong community support and high upside potential.\nT6900 Is A Meme Coin With Sound Fundamentals, Without Even Trying\nT6900 isn’t trying to sell investors on its utility or fundamentals. Yet, smart money investors are impressed with its sound tokenomics, multiple smart contract audits by Coinsult and Solid Proof and lucrative staking rewards.\nFor starters, the T6900 presale has a $5 million hard cap, which is already creating FOMO among sidelined investors. The ICO won’t be open for long, and investors will have a very limited window to buy the meme coin at its discounted presale price.\n80% of the token supply is up for grabs in the presale, with no separate provision for any private sale or VC round. This makes TOKEN6900 a community-centric meme coin, drawing comparisons to the early days of Fartcoin.\nOf the remaining 20%, 40% will be utilizied for the project’s marketing initiative, ensuring far-reaching brand awareness to take full advantage of the ongoing bull market.\n5% is allocated towards staking rewards, while nearly 25% is set aside for some mystery purpose. Check out the TOKEN6900 whitepaper for the full tokenomics.\nThe project’s staking protocol is already live, with presale buyers currently earning a reward rate of 290%. It will last for the entire duration of the presale and a year after the TGE, providing buyers with ample opportunity to earn attractive passive income.\nUnsurprisingly, prominent analysts are bullish on TOKEN6900’s upside potential, with many eyeing up to 10x returns from it. Considering its brain rot narrative and small market capitalization, those projections are very possible.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Unlike traditional firms that prioritize coverage volume, Outset focuses on user acquisition metrics.\nWhat are Google Top Stories and Google Discover, and why do they matter?\nGoogle Top Stories and Discover are highly visible content surfaces that drive significant mobile traffic.

Its methods prioritize visibility that leads to action, which is critical during fundraising or presale periods.\nIs guaranteed media placement better than organic outreach?\nGuaranteed placements ensure your content will appear in specific outlets, which can be valuable for consistency and reach. However, organic outreach—when paired with performance strategy and SEO optimization—often yields higher-quality traffic. The strongest agencies, like Outset PR and MarketAcross, combine both.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "FTX Freezes Creditor Funds in China and 48 Regions; Awaiting Legal Clearance", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/ftx-freezes-creditor-funds-in-china-and-48-regions-awaiting-legal-clearance", "text": "The FTX Recovery Trust has suspended repayments to creditors in 49 regions where cryptocurrency operations face legal restrictions, with Chinese users accounting for the majority of the disputed claims.\nPayouts Halted in Restricted Jurisdictions\nThe FTX Recovery Trust has placed a hold on creditor repayments across 49 jurisdictions due to unresolved legal and regulatory issues surrounding cryptocurrency activity. The decision, outlined in a court filing on July 2, affects countries where crypto trading is either restricted or outright banned. Notable regions impacted include China, Nigeria, Fiji, Andorra, and Zimbabwe.\nDespite these areas representing just 5% of total allowable claims, China alone accounts for a striking 82% of the total frozen claim value.\nThe delay comes as FTX seeks legal clarity on whether disbursements to residents in these regions would violate local regulations. The bankrupt crypto exchange recently began the second phase of its creditor repayment program, distributing approximately $5 billion to eligible claimants.\nChina at the Center of the Dispute\nChina’s longstanding crypto trading ban, imposed in 2021, has placed a significant portion of FTX’s repayment obligations in jeopardy. The Recovery Trust has acknowledged the legal risks of distributing funds into jurisdictions where crypto transactions remain outlawed.\nIn response, FTX has submitted a proposal to the U.S. bankruptcy court requesting approval for a new claims protocol targeting these restricted regions. Under the proposed framework, claims would only be honored if legal counsel confirms such payouts comply with the respective country’s laws. Failing that, claims risk being formally disputed and potentially denied.\nNew Claims Process and Dispute Mechanism\nFTX has introduced a “hold-and-review” system, reclassifying all claims from the 49 affected regions as “disputed.” These claims will remain on hold pending legal reviews. Should the court approve the updated claims process, affected creditors will receive a “Restricted Jurisdiction Notice,” detailing the reason for the hold and offering a minimum 45-day period to contest the decision.\nFTX has indicated that legal opinions will be sought to determine if distributions can proceed. If legal barriers persist, creditors may be advised to transfer or sell their claims to entities in approved jurisdictions to recover value.\nChinese Creditors Prepare Legal Action\nChinese creditors, who dominate the list of impacted users, are actively exploring legal avenues. Some have voiced frustrations on social media, questioning why claims settled in U.S. dollars cannot be wired internationally to Chinese residents, given that while crypto trading is banned, holding virtual assets and foreign currencies is permitted under Chinese law.\nMeanwhile, others have pointed out that unless legal pathways are established, the only options for affected users might be to transfer or sell their claims via approved jurisdictions.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With all 15 presale stages completed and a fixed price of $0.007, Lightchain AI has already raised nearly $21 million, driven entirely by early adopters and high-intent buyers.\nIts traction isn’t built on announcements—it’s powered by a working AI Virtual Machine, developer incentives, and transparent governance. While Chainlink upgrades its backend, Lightchain AI is expanding its front-facing momentum, showing up in wallets and watchlists across all buyer tiers.\nChainlink Advances Its Oracle Network With Infrastructure Upgrades\nChainlink upgrades its network of decentralized oracles with major infrastructure improvements in 2025. The addition of Off-Chain Reporting v3 (OCR3) has further improved scalability and programmability, allowing Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs) to handle thousands of unique data points at once. This is in support of the emerging requirement of the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\nFurthermore, the Multistream architecture increases data throughputs and enables a DON to efficiently transmit heterogeneous asset data. The Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) also provides a modular chain-agnostic framework that can be used to integrate Chainlink services with any blockchain system.\nThese improvements have resulted in growing adoption, such as the TRON DAO’s Chainlink Data Feeds integration, which now protects more than $5.5 billion in DeFi TVL. Furthermore, the deployment of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) v1. 5 standard for Cross-Chain Token \\(CCT\\) The introduction for easy cross-chain management of the token for developers.\n! )The Network's native token grew in value, prompting speculation that investors were realizing the potential of ChainLink's newfound capabilities.\nLightchain AI Drives Buyer Demand Through Bonus Round Activation\nLightchain AI is driving renewed buyer demand through the activation of its Bonus Round, offering fixed token pricing after the successful completion of all 15 presale stages. With $21 million raised, the Bonus Round now presents a final entry point before mainnet, attracting investors seeking value in a rapidly maturing ecosystem.\nThis demand is further fueled by Lightchain’s transparent, builder-centric roadmap—featuring decentralized validator onboarding, upcoming public GitHub release, and an already deployed $150,000 grant pool for developers.\nThe platform’s architecture supports real-time AI execution through the AIVM, with sharded scalability and privacy ensured by Zero-Knowledge Proofs. Combined with integrated governance, where token holders influence development direction, Lightchain AI converts clear technical execution into sustained buyer confidence and long-term engagement.\nLightchain AI- Turning Innovation Into Movement\nLightchain AI isn’t just growing—it’s igniting a market revolution. With live tools, decentralized infrastructure, and booming wallet activity, the momentum is unstoppable. This isn’t about hype; it’s about real progress fueled by a builder-led ecosystem that traders trust.\nStrategic execution, optimized gas fees, and a smart token allocation strategy make Lightchain AI more than just a project—it’s shaping the future of decentralized technology. Don’t just watch from the sidelines.\nJoin the movement, secure your tokens, and help build a smarter, decentralized tomorrow.\nhttps://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf\nhttps://t.me/LightchainProtocol\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Top Cryptos for Long Term: BlockDAG, XRP, SEI, and TON", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/top-cryptos-for-long-term-blockdag-xrp-sei-and-ton", "text": "Looking ahead to the next cycle, some crypto projects are proving they’ve got more than just short-term hype behind them. If you're planning to build a portfolio that holds up for the long haul, you need coins with strong fundamentals, active development, and real utility. While market trends can shift, the value of well-structured and forward-focused projects tends to hold. That’s what this list is all about.\nWe’re diving into four picks that are getting attention for all the right reasons. These aren’t just high-volume tokens or quick-flip plays, they’re long-term holds with real potential. Whether you’re looking for something new like BlockDAG or established names like XRP and Toncoin, these are some of the top cryptos for long term growth. Here's what makes each of them worth watching, and possibly holding onto.\n1. BlockDAG – Locked Price, Real Growth, Long-Term Focus\nBlockDAG’s presale is getting close to its final stretch, and the momentum it has built is hard to ignore. More than 23.5 billion BDAG tokens have already been sold, raising approximately $330 million. The current price sits at just $0.0016 in Batch 29, available through a limited-time global launch promo that runs until August 11. With a confirmed listing price of $0.05, early buyers are looking at a potential 25x ROI. This isn’t just a best crypto presale on paper, BlockDAG already has a live mobile mining app with over 2 million active users, and hardware shipments are on track with X30 and X100 rigs shipping by July 7, followed by X10 rigs on August 15.\nSecurity is another strong point. The project has successfully completed audits with CertiK and Halborn, boosting trust as it prepares for listings on MEXC, LBANK, CoinStore, XT.com, BitMart, and others. Liquidity and market-making strategies are already in place to support price stability post-launch. With strong infrastructure, clear timelines, and real products already in use, BlockDAG has what long-term investors are looking for. It’s easily one of the top cryptos for long term value, especially at this low presale entry.\n2. XRP – Stability With Legal Clarity and Real Use\nXRP has gone through years of legal uncertainty, but it’s now entering a different phase after several major regulatory wins. That clarity has helped strengthen its case as a real financial asset, and many investors are now taking a second look. XRP is focused on enabling fast, low-cost cross-border payments, and it's already partnered with banks and payment providers in multiple countries. That kind of utility keeps it relevant, even during slow market periods.\nCurrently priced around $0.47, XRP is trading well below its previous highs, which gives it decent upside room for long-term investors. The recent recovery in public and institutional sentiment means XRP has a clearer path forward. If you’re building a balanced portfolio with established players and strong use cases, XRP remains one of the top cryptos for long term investment. Its real-world partnerships and now cleaner regulatory status give it lasting value beyond just speculation.\n3. SEI – Tech-Driven Approach with a Growing Ecosystem\nSEI is built to handle trading-focused applications with an optimized, high-speed infrastructure. It’s often compared to high-performance chains that support DeFi, gaming, and real-time apps, but it carves out its niche by focusing heavily on order matching, front-running protection, and seamless throughput. SEI is also designed to be easy for developers to integrate with, which is helping it grow a dedicated community.\nAt the time of writing, SEI is trading close to $0.36, making it a mid-tier token in terms of price, but with upside based on ongoing ecosystem expansion. SEI has been forming key partnerships and continues to push updates aimed at improving scalability and user experience. While it doesn’t have the name recognition of older coins, SEI has the tech and developer interest to support steady growth. It makes the list of the top cryptos for long term thanks to its specific use focus and long-view strategy on adoption.\n4. TON (Toncoin) – Built for Scale Through Telegram\nToncoin is one of the few projects that benefits from a direct connection to a massive platform, Telegram. With its tools, Toncoin is being integrated into bots, mini apps, and peer-to-peer payments inside the messaging app. This makes it easy for users to get involved in crypto without needing to download new wallets or apps. It also means Toncoin is building out its user base through real-world use, not just hype cycles.\nToncoin is currently trading near $7, holding steady as one of the higher-priced coins in this group. It continues to attract interest from both retail users and developers looking to build products with instant access to Telegram’s audience. As more features roll out, including token payments inside chats, Toncoin could turn into one of the more widely used utility coins. If you're hunting for the top cryptos for long term, TON checks the boxes for scale, access, and usability.\nConclusion\nChoosing what to hold long-term isn’t about finding the most viral coin, it’s about recognizing which projects have the tools, momentum, and support to stay relevant. BlockDAG leads this list with a rare mix of active infrastructure, real product rollout, and a very low entry point compared to its listing target. XRP, SEI, and Toncoin round things out with strong tech, legal wins, and embedded user networks that help them stand out.\nIf you’re picking coins for next year and beyond, it’s smart to start with the top cryptos for long term growth. This list gives you a balance of early-stage potential and established strength. BlockDAG’s current price window, in particular, offers a shot at long-term gains without needing to chase hype. Keep your strategy focused, and look closely at what these projects are actually building.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Maximize Your Crypto Investments, Harness Trends, and Control Risks", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/maximize-your-crypto-investments-harness-trends-and-control-risks", "text": "The crypto investment space is unlike any other. It's an incredibly volatile ecosystem where fortunes are made and lost within hours. This space rewards the informed and punishes the ignorant. You cannot thrive in the cut-throat sector without adequate knowledge, discipline, and consistency.\nIn this context, adequate knowledge refers to being familiar with several key concepts, including how to maximize your crypto investments, harness trends, and control risks. The hacks outlined below will get you started.\nMaximizing Your Crypto Investments\nIn the current market, which is replete with high volatility, rapid growth, and constant innovation, you must prioritize maximizing your crypto investments. To do that, first visit the AvaTrade educational website. Here you can gain a better understanding of how to trade crypto alongside other popular financial instruments.\nAfter learning the basics, set clear investment goals. That will help you build your portfolio, gauge progress over time, and make the necessary adjustments. While setting your investment goals, consider crucial factors like what you plan to achieve, your risk tolerance, and time horizon. Finally, try to put idle crypto assets to work through lending, staking, and yield farming.\nHarnessing Market Trends\nA single social media post can send a crypto asset to the moon. Conversely, a regulatory rumor or concern can tank a coin's value. That's just how the crypto market is. You must harness market trends to stay ahead, enjoy maximum returns, and minimize losses. In other words, go with the tide and avoid swimming against the current whenever you can.\nHarnessing market trends requires you to do your homework. Follow recent developments on the most crucial platforms, from crypto news sites to Reddit's r/cryptocurrency. That is the only way to stay ahead of the curve and spot trends before they gain momentum. Also, use tools like Whale Alert and DeBank to monitor what savvy investors are doing closely.\nControlling Risk\nVolatility isn't a bug in the world of crypto investing – it's an inherent feature. A coin can pump by over 100% within less than a day, or crash within a matter of minutes. Take $Trump as an example. This meme coin's value rose by over 300% overnight immediately after its launch, only to lose approximately 90% of its value within 24 hours. The sudden price changes led to both massive profits and losses.\nYou must mitigate your risk exposure to avoid enormous losses and remain in the crypto investing game for a long time. First, obey the golden rule of investing: only risk capital you can afford to lose. Secondly, set stop-loss and take-profit orders. Last but not least, you should hold your assets in secure wallets and optimize their protection with protocols like 2FA and biometric authentication.\nFinal Thoughts\nNavigating the world of crypto investing is like sailing in finicky waters that are both promising and unpredictable. Many have made fortunes overnight from crypto assets. Sadly, thousands have also lost tons of money to volatile digital assets like Bitcoin, Solana, and Ethereum. Use the tips discussed here to avoid getting wiped out and squeeze every penny from crypto investing. Finally, and this can't be overemphasized, never invest what you can't afford to lose.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It’s a major performance boost for the network that puts it in the ranks of the top ten fastest blockchains in the business, alongside similarly swift networks such as Solana, Sui, Sei and Aptos.\nBuilt to provide high throughput and interoperability with Ethereum and the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem, Cronos is an EVM-compatible smart contract blockchain was originally designed to support payments through Crypto.com’s prepaid debit card, which allows people to spend their crypto in real-world stores.\nSince then, the project has expanded and the network sees itself as a vital part of the Ethereum ecosystem, supporting the rollout of high-performance decentralized finance applications. For instance, it also powers Crypto.com’s Auto-Harvest feature, which allows users to convert DeFi rewards from staking and liquidity provision directly into fiat stablecoins so they can be used for everyday payments.\nCronos is based on Ethermint, a highly-scalable blockchain framework that supports full interoperability with the Ethereum mainnet, meaning any Ethereum-based dApp can run on its network. It runs Ethermint as a Cosmos application-specific blockchain, which makes it possible for Cronos developers to access the best features of Ethereum while taking advantage of Ethermint’s superior performance and lower costs.\nWith the latest update, it’s now even faster. According to Cronos, getting down to sub-second block finality has long been a key goal for the network, in-line with its mission to support high-performance decentralized finance and artificial intelligence applications that require more responsiveness. It said the achievement means it ranks as one of the lowest-latency Ethereum-compatible chains around, paving the way for the bulk of the world’s dApps to enjoy much faster transaction speeds.\nCronos said the performance leap was made possible by recent innovations such as BlockSTM, a parallel execution engine that first appeared in the Cronos Pallene upgrade. With BlockSTM, it’s possible for multiple transactions to be processed simultaneously in a single block, and this capability is enhanced by an increase in block frequency.\nFor users of Cronos-based applications, they’ll benefit from smoother interactions and near-instant responsiveness in things like payments and DeFi swaps. Meanwhile, developers can be assured of an improved user experience in the most demanding, high-frequency trading applications.\nThe update is the second major performance boost Cronos has delivered in recent weeks, coming after a previous upgrade in June that reduced its network gas fees by around ten-times on average.\nCronos Labs Head of Product & Engineering Mirko Zhao said the update is about delivering a new class of “ultra-fast” blockchain applications. “This upgrade reinforces our long-term commitment to developer experience and performance at scale,” he insisted.\nCronos dApp users will appreciate the increased speeds and responsiveness, but even more encouraging is that today’s update shows that its developers can be relied on to keep their word, executing on a roadmap that calls for enhanced performance, lower costs and, ultimately, AI agent readiness and the next generation of automated DeFi applications.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The ETF is only behind the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF.\nThe IBIT Bitcoin ETF holds $76 billion in assets under management (AUM) and generates an estimated $191 million in annual revenue.\nIBIT Becomes BlackRock’s Third Most Profitable Fund\nBlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has quickly established itself as the firm’s third-highest revenue-generating fund. The ETF has $76 billion in assets under management (AUM), and a 0.25% expense ratio, generating $191 million in annual revenue. The ETF’s stunning growth puts it behind only BlackRock’s iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF. IBIT launched in January, easily crossing early projections thanks to strong demand from institutional and retail investors. The ETF has experienced consistent inflows since then, which have significantly contributed to its annual revenue. Most analysts believe IBIT will surpass its competition in revenue generation. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated,\n“IBIT is now the 3rd highest revenue-generating ETF for BlackRock out of 1,197 funds, and is only $9b away from being #1. Just another insane stat for a 1.5-year-old (literally an infant) ETF.”\nStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor responded to the milestone, stating that IBIT will soon become BlackRock’s number one revenue-generating ETF. Market watchers also noted that the spot Bitcoin ETF is only $9 billion in assets away from surpassing IWF as BlackRock’s top revenue-generating ETF.\nA Record-Breaking ETF\nBlackRock manages over 1,100 ETFs. However, IBIT’s stunning growth has been unlike any other. The ETF’s current revenue is only $20 million lower than IWF and $16 million lower than EFA. Current market conditions and investor sentiment could help IBIT climb higher. BlackRock’s IBIT became the fastest ETF to reach $2 billion in inflows, reaching the milestone just days after its launch. The fund crossed $50 billion within six months, placing it among the fastest-growing ETFs of all time.\nIBIT has consistently registered inflows from corporate treasuries, hedge funds, and advisors, benefiting from the rising demand for Bitcoin and other digital asset investment products. According to BlackRock, IBIT’s growth signals rising institutional adoption of Bitcoin. IBIT’s trajectory mirrors the early success of gold ETFs and suggests a push towards crypto integration in traditional portfolios.\nIBIT’s success is largely due to the fact that it gives investors exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of wallets and direct ownership of the asset. It also underscores the growing demand for Bitcoin as a mainstream investment asset.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Top 4 Cryptos to Buy Today: BlockDAG, Toncoin, Hedera, and Litecoin", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/top-4-cryptos-to-buy-today-blockdag-toncoin-hedera-and-litecoin", "text": "Why are so many investors watching Toncoin and Hedera this week? And is it too late to get in on Litecoin’s latest push? There’s been a major shift in focus recently as utility, growth potential, and real-world traction are taking priority over hype. But among all the headlines and predictions, one project is hitting the perfect combo of low price, massive presale demand, and a working ecosystem, and that’s BlockDAG.\nThis list highlights four coins that are getting strong attention from both traders and early-stage investors. Whether it’s because of major partnerships, high-tech upgrades, or just insane ROI potential, these cryptos are climbing watchlists fast. If you're looking for the best crypto coins to buy today, these four are worth checking out. And yes, prices and project milestones are current, so you can act on real info, not speculation.\n1. BlockDAG – Big ROI Potential + Infrastructure Already in Place\nBlockDAG’s presale is closing in on its final stages, and the progress so far has been massive. More than 23.5 billion BDAG tokens have already been sold, bringing in approximately $330 million in funding. The current presale price stands at $0.0016 in Batch 29, available as part of a limited-time global launch promo that runs until August 11. With the listing price set at $0.05, investors at this stage are eyeing a potential 25x return, a rare opportunity, especially with key infrastructure already in place. BlockDAG’s mobile mining app has crossed 2 million active users, and its hardware rollout is in motion with X30 and X100 rigs shipping by July 7, and X10 rigs following in August.\nOn the backend, BlockDAG has prioritized stability and trust. Security audits are complete via CertiK and Halborn, and listings on major exchanges like MEXC, LBANK, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart are already lined up. Combined with referral bonuses and a live leaderboard, this is a high-engagement rollout that’s driving serious traction. BlockDAG is undeniably one of the best crypto coins to buy today, and the current entry point might be as low as it gets before listings begin.\n2. Toncoin – Getting Support From Telegram’s Ecosystem\nToncoin has been attracting attention thanks to its integration with Telegram, one of the largest messaging platforms in the world. This connection gives Toncoin an edge when it comes to user onboarding, micropayments, and bot-related features. As more Telegram users discover the ability to send crypto easily through chat apps, Toncoin’s real-world use case becomes more relevant. It’s not just about buzz, it’s about actual usage scaling fast.\nThe coin recently hit a price around the $7 mark and has managed to maintain its position despite wider market fluctuations. With ongoing developments and more app integrations on the roadmap, Toncoin is seen as a solid choice for investors seeking utility along with growth. It may not be under-the-radar anymore, but it’s still early enough to ride the upside. That’s why it’s making this list of the best crypto coins to buy today for anyone watching adoption trends closely.\n3. Hedera (HBAR) – Built for Enterprise, Gaining Attention Again\nHedera has always positioned itself as a faster, more energy-efficient alternative to traditional blockchains. What makes it different is its underlying technology, Hashgraph. Instead of using a conventional chain of blocks, Hedera runs on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure that helps it settle transactions faster and with lower fees. Large companies like IBM and Google are already part of its governing council, which adds credibility to its long-term roadmap.\nCurrently trading around $0.075, HBAR has been climbing slowly but steadily. The steady movement and partnerships backing the project make it a serious option for mid-to-long-term holders. It’s not a moonshot like some meme coins, but Hedera’s strength lies in consistent development and real use cases, especially in sectors like supply chain and identity. For those looking to balance risk and utility, Hedera is easily one of the best crypto coins to buy today.\n4. Litecoin – Proving Old Isn’t Outdated\nLitecoin has been around for over a decade, but it’s still showing signs of strength, especially during Bitcoin-led rallies. Often called “digital silver” to Bitcoin’s gold, LTC offers faster transaction times and lower fees. It remains a reliable option for payments, with wide exchange support and merchant integration. This dependability keeps it active in discussions even in newer investor circles.\nAt a current price near $73, Litecoin is on a steady path, bouncing back from the dips seen earlier this year. Halving events and its role as a transaction-focused coin keep it relevant. While it doesn’t have the flash of newer projects, it has trust, and that matters when looking at strong coins to hold. It makes this list of the best crypto coins to buy today because it offers something different: consistency, legacy, and ongoing use.\nConclusion\nFrom new entrants like BlockDAG to long-time players like Litecoin, there’s real diversity in what makes a crypto worth buying today. Some offer insane upside potential, like BlockDAG with its 25x ROI entry window and strong infrastructure already built. Others like Toncoin and Hedera bring growing real-world use and partnerships to the table. And then you have Litecoin, still standing strong as a payment coin despite the competition. These four picks each bring something useful to the mix, whether that’s low entry pricing, institutional support, fast tech, or long-standing trust.\nIf you’re looking for the best crypto coins to buy today, start with what’s trending for the right reasons, not just hype. BlockDAG’s limited-time presale price and major growth signals put it at the top of the list. The others round out a solid set of options to consider right now while the market is heating up again.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Congressman Stephen Lynch and Congresswoman Maxine Waters are leading the campaign, aiming to stop three crypto-related bills from passing in the House. Democrats argue the bills would legalize financial misconduct and deepen Trump’s alleged abuse of crypto for personal enrichment.\nCLARITY Act Faces Democratic Resistance\nThe CLARITY Act is one of the central targets of Democratic opposition during Anti-Crypto Corruption Week. Democrats say the bill weakens federal oversight of digital assets and opens the door to financial loopholes. They argue the legislation removes vital protections and could legitimize unethical conduct in the crypto sector.\nDemocrats offered nearly 30 amendments during a committee markup, but Republicans blocked every proposal. The amendments aimed to prevent self-dealing, enhance consumer safeguards, and stop former officials from exploiting crypto. Despite the rejection, Democrats say they will continue efforts to revise or block the bill.\nWaters organized detailed reviews of the legislation with legal and national security experts. These sessions were intended to highlight hidden risks in the bill and educate Democratic members. Lawmakers also convened a separate hearing to feature alternate expert testimony critical of the bill’s implications.\nGENIUS Act Draws Criticism for Enabling Corruption\nHouse Democrats are also scrutinizing the Senate’s GENIUS Act. They believe the bill accelerates deregulation and benefits politically connected individuals involved in digital asset schemes. According to Lynch, the bill could threaten market integrity and national financial stability.\nDemocrats argue the act aligns with Trump’s personal interests and allows continued enrichment through crypto ventures. They say foreign investments in Trump’s family businesses pose serious national security questions. The bill, in their view, strengthens loopholes that benefit Trump’s inner circle.\nIn response, Democrats have used procedural moves to delay or challenge hearings involving the bill. These actions include staging walkouts and calling minority-led hearings with independent witnesses.\nAnti-CBDC Bill Sparks National Security Concerns\nThe Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act proposes a ban on a government-issued digital currency. Democrats believe this would stifle innovation and weaken America’s position in global digital finance. They say the bill hands strategic advantage to countries like China already developing central bank digital currencies.\nOpponents of the bill argue it undermines U.S. research capabilities and restricts future economic tools. Lynch warned that banning federal efforts on CBDCs puts America behind in emerging technologies. Democrats also point out that while Republicans attack government-backed digital dollars, they support unregulated private crypto schemes.\nCommittee Democrats have long supported responsible innovation while protecting consumers and the economy. Under Waters’ leadership, they established task forces to study the impacts of fintech and artificial intelligence. Through 22 hearings, Democrats have stressed the importance of adapting laws to new technologies without compromising safety.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 23:23:37 +0000", "author": "Yasmin Werner", "source": "https://coincentral.com/news/feed/"}

Maintenance product sales, which represent the bulk of the business, grew by 2% to $150.4 million, offsetting weakness in other segments.\nStrong Margin Recovery and Earnings Growth\nWD-40’s gross margin expanded significantly to 56.2% in Q3 2025 from 53.1% a year ago. This gain was driven by higher average selling prices and lower input costs. The company’s adjusted EBITDA margin reached 20%, up from 19% in the prior year, reflecting improved profitability.\nDiluted earnings per share rose to $1.54 from $1.46, a 5% gain. Net income climbed 6% to $21 million, while operating income was up 1% to $27.4 million. Cash flow from operations stood at $35 million during the quarter.\nAdvertising and promotional spending declined slightly to $9.2 million, or 5.8% of total sales, as the company focused on margin preservation.\nRegional Sales and Strategic Shifts\nIn the Americas, sales grew by 4% to $78.2 million, supported by demand for maintenance products and digital channel strength. Asia-Pacific sales increased by 7% to $22 million. However, sales in EIMEA dropped 5% to $56.7 million due to volume declines in Turkey and the Middle East.\nE-commerce sales and WD-40 Specialist product lines both rose 11% year-to-date, indicating success in strategic growth areas.\nThe company noted that foreign currency translation negatively impacted total sales by about $1.6 million. Management reiterated the uncertainty surrounding the planned divestiture of its homecare and cleaning products segment, which has underperformed and could affect future revenue composition.\nShareholder Returns and Guidance Updates\nWD-40 declared a dividend of $0.94 per share, approved on June 17, and repurchased approximately 12,750 shares for $3 million during the quarter.\nFor full fiscal year 2025, WD-40 expects net sales between $600 million and $620 million, representing 6% to 9% growth. Operating income guidance was raised to $96 million to $101 million, while EPS guidance was increased to a range of $5.30 to $5.60. The gross margin is now expected to exceed 55%, ahead of schedule.\nDespite elevated SG&A costs, now at 38% of net sales, and lingering macro risks, CEO Steve Brass expressed confidence in the company’s direction. He credited strong employee retention and operational execution for sustaining growth.\nWD-40’s next financial results will cover the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025, and investors will be looking for confirmation of the raised guidance and progress on portfolio simplification.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 22:01:16 +0000", "author": "Yasmin Werner", "source": "https://coincentral.com/news/feed/"}
{"title": "BTC Digital Ltd. (BTCT) Stock Surges 13% as Company Unveils $1M Ethereum Reserve Strategy", "url": "https://coincentral.com/btc-digital-ltd-btct-stock-surges-13-as-company-unveils-1m-ethereum-reserve-strategy/", "text": "TLDR\n- BTCT gains 13% after revealing $1M Ethereum reserve strategy shift.\n- BTC Digital pivots from mining to Ethereum-based DeFi infrastructur.\n- BTCT eyes stablecoins, staking as key Ethereum investment drivers.\n- Ethereum’s utility boosts BTCT’s move into tokenization, DeFi services.\n- BTCT sees ETH upgrades as catalyst for long-term blockchain expansion.\nBTC Digital Ltd. (BTCT) closed at $4.25 on Thursday, gaining 13.33% after announcing a $1 million Ethereum reserve. The announcement drove early momentum, although the stock retreated from intraday highs before stabilizing. The company’s Ethereum strategy marked a pivotal shift toward digital asset infrastructure.\nEthereum Acquisition Marks Strategic Shift Toward On-Chain Finance\nBTC Digital confirmed it has established an initial Ethereum reserve worth $1 million, signaling its move beyond crypto mining. The company now aims to build deeper exposure to Ethereum’s financial infrastructure and smart contract ecosystem. This new reserve forms part of its broader pivot toward long-term blockchain participation.\nEthereum remains the dominant platform for stablecoin issuance and USD settlement in the decentralized ecosystem. With over half of major stablecoins operating on Ethereum, it underpins a growing share of digital dollar transactions. BTC Digital’s move aligns with emerging market trends and current blockchain use cases.\nHigh on-chain activity and increased ETH collateralization are reshaping how decentralized networks handle security and liquidity. These changes support BTCT’s strategy to allocate capital toward scalable, revenue-generating digital assets. The firm expects Ethereum to become central to future decentralized finance frameworks.\nStablecoin Infrastructure, Staking Trends Drive Ethereum’s Role\nBTCT cited Ethereum’s rising volume and stablecoin usage as key catalysts for its investment decision. The platform processes billions in USD-equivalent transactions daily, rivaling traditional financial rails. This high throughput confirms Ethereum’s role in digital settlement networks.\nAs asset tokenization and real-world finance shift on-chain, ETH’s role as staking collateral continues to grow. Higher staking rates restrict token supply, which increases its scarcity and utility in decentralized systems. BTCT plans to grow its ETH position accordingly in response to these structural shifts.\nEthereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade and Layer-2 scaling advances are expected to lower costs and boost compliance efficiency. These improvements could reinforce BTCT’s decision to support Ethereum’s infrastructure with a strategic allocation. The firm views this as both a capital optimization and technology upgrade initiative.\nBTCT Evolves from Crypto Miner to Blockchain Infrastructure Participant\nHistorically known for its large-scale crypto mining operations, BTCT now positions itself within the on-chain financial space. The company seeks to participate in stablecoin issuance, tokenization, and decentralized finance beyond hash rate production. It views Ethereum as foundational to this transformation.\nBTCT plans to gradually increase its ETH holdings as market conditions evolve and infrastructure matures. Its strategy reflects confidence in Ethereum’s long-term role in global finance. The company intends to align reserves with network milestones and regulatory developments.\nThis reserve marks the first step in BTCT’s broader push into digital asset finance and decentralized economic activity. The company aims to deliver value by leveraging blockchain infrastructure across North America. Its expansion builds on existing data center, mining, and crypto-related services.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 20:58:23 +0000", "author": "Yasmin Werner", "source": "https://coincentral.com/news/feed/"}
{"title": "Shanghai Signals New Approach to Digital Currencies and Stablecoins", "url": "https://coincentral.com/shanghai-signals-new-approach-to-digital-currencies-and-stablecoins/", "text": "TLDR\n- Shanghai Eyes Stablecoins as China Warms to Digital Currency Discussions\n- Yuan-Backed Stablecoins Gain Ground as China Rethinks Crypto Strategy\n- Shanghai Signals Shift with Talks on Stablecoins and Digital Finance\n- China’s Financial Hubs Pivot Toward Blockchain Amid Global Pressure\n- Asia’s Stablecoin Race Heats Up as Shanghai and Seoul Advance Plans\nShanghai has moved to assess its position on digital currencies, marking a visible shift in China’s previous hardline stance. A recent meeting led by the Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission brought key officials together. The focus remained on strategic preparation for potential integration of stablecoins and broader digital currency frameworks.\nBREAKING: 🇨🇳 Shanghai’s state assets regulator meets to discuss crypto and stablecoin regulations. pic.twitter.com/AXHn6O6YFk\n— Conor Kenny (@conorfkenny) July 11, 2025\nThe meeting included around 70 participants and highlighted research as the next key step. This move reflects growing interest within Chinese financial hubs to respond to global digital currency trends. China banned crypto trading in 2021, yet Shanghai appears to be opening discussion on the future of blockchain-based financial tools.\nThis development comes amid rising global stablecoin transactions, which outpaced major credit networks in total volume last year. Shanghai’s new posture suggests a pivot towards technological readiness and policy groundwork. The city is often selected for national pilot programs and may once again serve as the testing ground for regulated digital currency initiatives.\nYuan-Pegged Stablecoin Gains Support in Mainland and Hong Kong\nLeading companies are pushing for the introduction of a yuan-based stablecoin across key Chinese markets. JD.com and Ant Group have reportedly prepared to apply for licenses in Hong Kong for this purpose. Legislation governing stablecoins is expected to take effect in Hong Kong by August 1.\nExperts have proposed that China begin trial issuance in both the Shanghai Free Trade Zone and Hong Kong. They argue that such dual-track adoption would balance regulatory control and international engagement. State-backed voices are now aligning with this view, stressing the need for action rather than resistance.\nDigital yuan development remains distinct from stablecoin projects, yet interest in additional blockchain instruments is growing. Stablecoins backed by fiat currency enable faster, cheaper transactions, and their global uptake pressures China to respond. While capital controls remain a challenge, new discussions show a departure from previous regulatory silence.\nSouth Korea’s Consortium Model Adds Regional Momentum\nSouth Korea’s largest banks are forming a consortium to develop a won-linked stablecoin as a private-sector initiative. The banks involved include KB Kookmin, Shinhan, and Citibank Korea among others, working alongside regulators and blockchain associations. Development is progressing independently from the central bank’s digital currency efforts.\nThe proposed models involve either trust-backed reserves or tokenized bank deposits, both of which undergo compliance checks. The stablecoin plan aims to compete with dollar-linked options and enhance the utility of regional currencies. Legal and technical frameworks are expected to be finalized by 2026.\nThis effort places South Korea as a regional leader in structured stablecoin development. It could also encourage similar responses in neighboring markets, including China. Asian financial systems are increasingly exploring their regulated digital solutions.\nGlobal Trends Pressure China’s Digital Currency Strategy\nGlobal adoption of stablecoins is driving major financial centers to rethink national currency-based blockchain systems. In the U.S., companies such as Amazon and Walmart are exploring stablecoin solutions within existing legal frameworks. These developments are reshaping how countries assess the risks and benefits of digital tokens.\nARK Investment Management estimated stablecoin transaction volume at $15.6 trillion globally in 2023. That figure exceeded Visa’s annual volume, showcasing their increasing relevance. This growth reflects both the scalability and utility of such blockchain assets.\nShanghai’s move represents a calculated shift rather than a policy reversal. By initiating expert discussions and preparing for future regulatory models, it seeks to remain globally competitive. Though hurdles remain, early signals point toward gradual digital currency integration, with stablecoins at the forefront of that evolution.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 21:40:30 +0000", "author": "Yasmin Werner", "source": "https://coincentral.com/news/feed/"}

The legal action follows Oregon’s unexpected shift in policy, accusing the exchange of illegally offering unregistered crypto assets to state residents. Coinbase argues that this reversal occurred without public input, formal hearings or legislative approval.\nALERT: Coinbase Battles Oregon Officials Over Crypto Policy Shift! Coinbase is in court demanding records to prove political influence altered Oregon's cryptocurrency regulations, viewing it as unfair targeting. This case highlights tensions between regulators and the crypto…\n— VJT (@KelvinCold1234) July 11, 2025\nOregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield initiated the case in April, claiming Coinbase exposed residents to fraud and market manipulation risks. His office alleges the platform sold unregistered cryptocurrencies, violating state laws and putting users at financial risk. Coinbase, however, disputes this claim, stating Oregon previously maintained that such assets were not classified as securities.\nCoinbase’s new complaint, filed in Marion County Circuit Court, demands access to internal communications about the state’s policy change. The company says the public deserves transparency on why the state reversed its crypto stance behind closed doors. It also accuses state officials of withholding records despite formal public records requests.\nCoinbase Challenges Sudden Legal Shift\nThe exchange contends Oregon’s decision to sue marks a sharp break from earlier guidance that digital assets were not under state securities law. For years, Coinbase operated under the understanding that Oregon did not treat cryptocurrencies as securities. Yet, the April lawsuit contradicts that approach and seeks penalties for alleged past non-compliance.\nCoinbase claims the lawsuit was orchestrated by out-of-state law firms seeking large contingency fees if Oregon wins. These firms, based in New York and Washington, D.C., could receive up to 30% of any settlement or award. The exchange argues the legal strategy benefits external interests more than local residents.\nNo legislative action or rulemaking preceded Oregon’s legal move, according to Coinbase’s court filing. The company insists that such a significant shift in policy should involve public scrutiny and legal procedures. Instead, it says the state acted unilaterally and in secrecy, creating legal uncertainty for digital asset users in Oregon.\nOregon Stands Alone After SEC Case Dropped\nOregon remains the only state pursuing legal action against Coinbase since the federal SEC case was dropped earlier this year. The Biden-era SEC lawsuit accused Coinbase of operating without registering its securities offerings, but the Trump administration later dismissed those charges. Two months later, Oregon revived similar claims at the state level.\nCoinbase argues this move undermines federal consistency and sends mixed signals about crypto oversight across states. The company believes the Oregon case is politically motivated and designed to fill the regulatory gap left by the federal withdrawal. Legal observers say this action raises questions about jurisdiction and regulatory coordination in digital asset markets.\nWhile Oregon pursues its case alone, Congress prepares to vote on federal crypto regulation. Two bills Clarity and GENIUS aim to define oversight for crypto markets and stablecoins. These laws could centralize authority and reduce patchwork enforcement by individual states like Oregon.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 22:37:16 +0000", "author": "Yasmin Werner", "source": "https://coincentral.com/news/feed/"}

Key speakers included Pak Hon, head of Samsung’s digital health team, and Michael McSherry, CEO of Xealth, who discussed how their combined capabilities could address long-standing problems in healthcare such as rising costs, limited workforce capacity, and chronic disease management.\nCentral to this strategy is the enhancement of the Samsung Health app, which will soon feature an AI engine capable of generating insights based on users’ clinical records and wellness data. The app will also include a generative AI chatbot designed to alert users to potential health issues and provide tailored recommendations in real time.\n#Samsung has signed an agreement to acquire #Xealth, a unique healthcare integration platform that brings diverse #digitalhealth tools and care programs that benefit patients and providers.

Since then, the company has steadily expanded its healthcare portfolio through targeted programs.\nOne of the most notable was a 2019 cardiac rehabilitation initiative with Kaiser Permanente, which achieved an 87 percent completion rate and drastically reduced hospital readmissions.\nOther efforts include the Birdsong Initiative, which improved mental health among seniors using tablet-based interventions, and the Smart Healthcare Citizenship program in India, which delivered diagnostic tools to underserved communities. These projects have built a robust foundation in user experience, clinical validation, and technology integration, all of which will now be amplified through the Xealth platform.\nSamsung’s Strategy in a Fragmented Market\nThe global digital health market is booming, expected to double to over $330 billion by the end of 2025. Tech giants are scrambling to capture slices of this growing sector, each with a unique strategy.\nWhile Apple centers its efforts around its devices and health records, and Google focuses on fitness tracking and wearables, Samsung is pursuing a more expansive approach. By bridging hospital-grade solutions with consumer electronics and home appliances, Samsung is creating a seamless, connected healthcare environment.\nXealth’s strength lies in its ability to integrate data from more than 70 digital health providers, positioning Samsung to tackle the fragmentation that plagues modern healthcare systems.\nAI-Powered Healthcare for an Aging World\nDemographic trends are also driving the urgency for innovation. With the senior population in the US expected to hit 73 million by 2030 and chronic disease rates continuing to rise, the need for scalable, tech-driven solutions has never been greater.\nSamsung’s work with partners like Reemo Health, which turns smartwatch data into actionable insights, showcases how wearables and AI can extend care beyond hospitals and clinics.\nBy acquiring Xealth and advancing its AI capabilities, Samsung is not just expanding its health portfolio but positioning itself at the forefront of healthcare’s digital transformation.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 19:50:57 +0000", "author": "Newton Kitonga", "source": "https://coincentral.com/news/feed/"}

The firm argues that the SEC missed a statutory deadline, which automatically deems the ETF approved by law. Grayscale claims the delay disrupts fair market processes and harms its product’s timeline and strategic market entry.\nBitcoin ETF: Procedural Clash Escalates\nThe proposed GDLC ETF includes Bitcoin, which forms nearly 80% of the fund’s holdings and anchors its performance profile. Grayscale states that the SEC’s stay on approval violates Section 19(b)(2)(D) of the Securities Exchange Act. Under this section, a rule is automatically approved if not formally disapproved within 240 days.\nNEW: @Grayscale and their lawyers filed a letter in response to the SEC's \"Stay\" order on $GDLC's ETF conversion arguing that the SEC didn't have the power to do this. pic.twitter.com/9m1J30eiJb\n— James Seyffart (@JSeyff) July 11, 2025\nThe SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets had approved the ETF under delegated authority on July 1. However, a commissioner called for further review, which placed the approval on hold through Rule 431(e). Grayscale maintains this procedural move does not override federal statutory timelines.\nGrayscale emphasizes that the rule proposal was submitted on October 15, 2024, and the 240-day window closed on July 2, 2025. The firm believes the fund should now be considered legally approved. It also insists that the agency’s stay order has no authority to postpone the approval once the deadline has passed.\nEthereum’s Inclusion Strengthens Fund Appeal\nEthereum is the second-largest holding in the GDLC and broadens its portfolio appeal beyond Bitcoin. Grayscale’s ETF aims to offer diversified exposure through a regulated exchange, targeting wider adoption in traditional finance. This approach aligns with the firm’s goal of reshaping crypto access for mainstream market players.\nThe inclusion of Ethereum enhances the fund’s value proposition and signals market maturity. Grayscale sees the ETF structure as a tool for simplifying digital asset access. Despite the SEC delay, the firm says market infrastructure and demand remain strong.\nEthereum’s growing role in decentralized finance adds strategic weight to its ETF placement. Grayscale argues that regulatory uncertainties should not undermine its structured offerings. The company urges timely SEC decisions to uphold market confidence and legal standards.\nXRP Faces Regulatory Uncertainty Yet Stays in Fund\nDespite its legal challenges with the SEC, XRP remains part of the GDLC. Grayscale has kept the asset in the fund, citing its market cap and liquidity. The company believes inclusion reflects objective asset-ranking criteria rather than subjective regulatory status.\nThe ETF structure does not imply endorsement of any asset’s legal classification. Grayscale stresses that XRP contributes to the fund’s diversified composition. Its place in the basket supports exposure to key large-cap digital assets.\nRegulatory scrutiny has made XRP controversial, but its market performance keeps it relevant in multi-asset portfolios. Grayscale highlights transparency in its selection model and calls on regulators to avoid mixed signals that confuse the market.\nSolana and Cardano Add to Broader Market Strategy\nSolana and Cardano round out the GDLC’s holdings, adding scale and blockchain diversity to the portfolio. Grayscale includes them to capture long-term sector trends and reduce single-asset concentration. Both assets reflect growing developer activity and user adoption.\nCurrently, Solana has limited ETF representation, while Cardano has none in the U.S. market. Grayscale aims to fill that gap by offering comprehensive exposure. The GDLC would become the first multi-crypto ETF if approved.\nGrayscale sees the multi-asset structure as a competitive advantage in a crowded digital asset market. The firm views these additions as essential for future-proofing the ETF. It reiterates that delays damage market progress and contradict established legal processes.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 19:33:01 +0000", "author": "Yasmin Werner", "source": "https://coincentral.com/news/feed/"}

Lawmakers announced the launch of “Crypto Week,” set to begin on July 14, as part of a broader initiative to position the United States as a global leader in financial technology and digital assets.\nThe push forms part of the Trump administration’s ongoing effort to deliver on campaign promises aimed at bolstering crypto innovation while curbing government control over digital finance systems.\nThree Pivotal Bills Under Consideration\nDuring this legislative drive, House Republicans aim to advance three significant pieces of legislation: the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, and the Senate’s recently passed GENIUS Act. Together, these bills seek to overhaul the U.S. digital asset regulatory framework, address stablecoin issuance, and prevent the introduction of a government-backed central bank digital currency (CBDC).\nFrench Hill, Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, described the effort as a “historic step” toward ensuring the United States remains at the forefront of financial innovation, stating,\n“After years of work in Congress on digital assets, we are advancing landmark legislation that safeguards consumers, provides rules for stablecoins, and permanently blocks a CBDC to protect Americans’ financial privacy.”\nGENIUS Act Gains Momentum\nAmong the bills, the GENIUS Act has emerged as a priority for both chambers of Congress. Passed by the Senate last month with bipartisan support, the bill addresses the regulation of dollar-backed stablecoins and outlines a regulatory structure that would allow state-level supervision of issuers, a key divergence from the House’s earlier STABLE Act, which called for strict federal oversight.\nPresident Trump has urged lawmakers to fast-track the GENIUS Act before Congress recesses in August, reinforcing its status as a legislative priority. If passed in its current form, the bill would head directly to the President’s desk for approval. However, amendments from the House could send it back to the Senate for further negotiation.\nPotential Legislative Roadblocks\nDespite momentum, legal analysts have pointed out potential hurdles. Attorneys at Pillsbury Law noted the House may seek to revise critical provisions within the GENIUS Act, including those related to issuer eligibility and federal-state oversight dynamics. Should changes be made, a joint committee may be formed to reconcile differences between the GENIUS and STABLE Acts, with final approval from both chambers required before the legislation reaches the White House.\nThe outcome of “Crypto Week” is set to shape the regulatory direction of digital assets in the U.S., with implications for market participants, stablecoin issuers, and broader financial innovation under the Trump administration’s second term.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

DDC will lead the operations, offering a framework that enhances asset productivity through disciplined, technology-backed strategies. Both firms expect this to influence how public companies adopt and integrate digital assets in treasury functions.\nThis collaboration is structured to remain flexible, as either party may exit due to its non-binding nature. However, the scale and ambition suggest a firm commitment to execution. The partnership is expected to accelerate DDC’s broader digital asset objectives and long-term treasury plans.\nBitcoin Visionary Council Adds Strategic Depth with Industry Leader\nYat Siu, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman of Animoca Brands, will join DDC’s newly established Bitcoin Visionary Council.

DDC intends to integrate these insights into both operational and financial decision-making. This move is also expected to support broader adoption frameworks across the corporate sector.\nDDC Positions Bitcoin at the Core of Financial Strategy\nDDC continues to redefine itself by integrating Bitcoin as a principal reserve asset in its treasury model. While the company remains anchored in its global Asian food business, it is now expanding its digital finance footprint. DDC operates consumer brands like DayDayCook, Yai’s Thai, and Nona Lim across key markets.\nThe strategic shift aims to transform Bitcoin from a speculative asset into a structured, yield-driven corporate reserve. DDC’s objective is to merge traditional business operations with modern digital finance techniques. This combination reflects a bold move toward asset diversification and forward-looking capital management.\nThe company’s dual focus on food and finance places it in a unique category among public firms. It demonstrates a proactive stance on digital transformation without losing sight of its core business.

Holders are advised to redeem or migrate their tokens in accordance with Tether’s guidelines.…\n— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 11, 2025\nThe move comes after an internal review of blockchain activity, market demand and partner feedback. Tether aims to focus resources on blockchains with higher scalability and active development. The company continues to support its core mission by adapting to the evolving digital asset landscape.\nUSDT remains the largest stablecoin in circulation, with the majority issued on Ethereum and Tron. Tether plans to increase support for Layer 2 networks and high-performance platforms.\nOmni, the First Home of USDT, Faces Sunset\nTether will discontinue USDT support on Omni, marking the end of its original issuance layer. Despite processing millions in its prime, Omni has seen steep usage declines. Tether previously halted minting on Omni, but redemptions remained . According to the recent data, around $888 million USDT was issued on Omni over time. Today, only about $82 million remains in circulation on the network. .\nTether cited Omni’s declining relevance in the face of Layer 2 developments like the Lightning Network. The company redirects focus to faster and more scalable platforms. Users must redeem or migrate their USDT before the September deadline.\nBitcoin Cash SLP Loses Support After Low Adoption\nUSDT support on Bitcoin Cash SLP will also end as part of Tether’s restructuring. Less than $1 million remains in circulation, compared to the $5 million issued over time. The chain has failed to sustain significant transaction volumes.\nSLP did not retain developer interest or community activity. Tether previously stopped minting on SLP due to poor performance. Redemptions remained active but will now be permanently halted. The decision follows Tether’s trend of removing low-utility chains. The company emphasized its goal to streamline operations. SLP joins other networks in losing Tether’s support by September 2025.\nKusama Integration Ends as Network Activity Drops\nTether will phase out USDT on Kusama, a testing ground for Polkadot-based innovations. Only $250,000 USDT remains active from a total issuance of $3.5 million. Activity on Kusama no longer meets Tether’s operational standards.\nKusama, designed for experimental features, did not maintain user engagement for stablecoin transactions. Tether responded by halting further minting and now finalizing the exit. The firm encourages users to transfer assets to supported chains. Kusama’s deprecation enables Tether to focus on networks that show long-term growth. The transition aligns with broader infrastructure priorities.\nEOS and Algorand Also Dropped for Low Circulation\nEOS and Algorand will also lose USDT support, finalizing the list of five deprecated blockchains. EOS issued $85 million USDT historically but holds under $5 million. Algorand’s full USDT supply remains under $1 million.\nBoth blockchains once offered alternative environments to Ethereum, but failed to maintain consistent usage. Developer activity and user demand on these chains have sharply declined. Tether now redirects its support to faster and broader-reaching networks.\nUsers must redeem or migrate their holdings before support ends in September 2025. Tether’s withdrawal reflects a stronger emphasis on adoption metrics.

Price prediction models by several respected market analysts have recently highlighted significant potential for selected altcoins, making them top contenders to consider today.\nCrypto influencer and analyst Benjamin Cowen has emphasized the importance of tracking altcoin dominance relative to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Cowen, known for his methodical approach, recently underscored how select altcoins are primed for growth as market liquidity and investor confidence show signs of resurgence. Among these coins, Chainlink (LINK), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) have consistently shown up as favorites due to their strong fundamentals and widespread developer support.\nAnalysts Identify Breakout Potential in Chainlink & Cardano\nChainlink’s price recently broke key resistance levels, supported by bullish activity across major decentralized exchanges, particularly Uniswap. LINK’s oracle technology continues to be integrated widely, underpinning DeFi protocols and furthering its utility and intrinsic value.\nCardano, meanwhile, benefits from continuous development updates and significant community-driven governance. Recently, Charles Hoskinson's involvement and active community engagement have positioned ADA to potentially outperform during this cycle. ADA has been identified by various price models as undervalued relative to its fundamentals, suggesting a strong upside potential.\nSolana Gathers Momentum—DeFi & NFT Innovations at Forefront\nSolana (SOL) continues to attract substantial attention thanks to its high-throughput blockchain architecture, enabling efficient decentralized applications and NFT marketplaces. Recent integrations and successful network updates have driven renewed investor interest, with analysts predicting substantial upside movement based on fundamental developments and adoption metrics.\nTop 5 Crypto Presales to Watch in 2025\n-\nNeo Pepe Coin ($NEOP) - Community-driven governance, innovative presale structure, and auto-liquidity mechanisms designed to maximize community involvement and stability, solidifying its position as the best crypto presale.\n-\nBitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) - This presale focuses on leveraging bullish Bitcoin market conditions, providing exposure to Bitcoin's price movements through advanced derivatives and structured products.\n-\nKaanch (KNCH) - Offering unique integration with NFTs and metaverse projects, Kaanch targets immersive digital experiences, combining blockchain gaming and virtual reality ecosystems.\n-\nSolaxy (SOLX) - An ambitious project blending decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT marketplace functionalities, aiming to streamline decentralized trading and asset management.\n-\nSnorter (SNORT) - Utilizing advanced AI technologies, Snorter provides sophisticated crypto analytics, automated trading strategies, and personalized bot services to optimize trading decisions.\nNeo Pepe Coin Gains Momentum With Community‑Centric Model\nEnter Neo Pepe Coin—a rising contender carving a unique path among meme-influenced projects. Backed by a multi-stage presale and a robust governance mechanism, $NEOP is quickly emerging as a top pepe coin with serious potential.\nOfficial announcements from GlobeNewswire and Cryptopolitan highlight its 16-stage presale, starting at $0.05 and heading toward a target of $50 million. With each stage incrementally increasing price, early backers are rewarded with strategic entry points.\nTokenomics & Liquidity Engineering\nEvery $NEOP transaction channels 2.5% directly into liquidity pools—automatically added on Uniswap—and immediately burns LP tokens to fortify long-term price support. This auto‑liquidity model is central to Neo Pepe’s stability narrative.\nGovernance is handled through the NEOPGovernor smart contract with time‑locked votes, empowering holders (minimum 1 million tokens) to steer listing decisions, treasury initiatives, and protocol upgrades.\nSecurity is also a highlight: a recent Certik audit awarded a score of 71.96, underscoring commitment to contract reliability and investor safety.\nApproaching Stage 4 & Presale Tactics\n$NEOP is currently priced around $0.07—and is almost at Stage 4, where the price will rise to approximately $0.08. This key transition reinforces urgency: early entry before Stage 4 may unlock stronger value potential in upcoming rounds.\nCommunity & Influencer Endorsement\nCrypto analyst BITGIRL CRYPTO and others have praised Neo Pepe’s methodical presale rollout, detailed auto-liquidity engine, and participatory DAO structure. Indeed, investor inflows are driven largely by $NEOP’s community-first design and decentralized roadmap.\nIn a nod to crypto zealots seeking the next big meme coin with substance, you might want to get a little Neo Pepe before token pricing enters its next phase.\nCRYPTO QUEEN & BLOCKCHAIN Breaks Down Neo Pepe’s Distinctive Appeal\nWith clarity and precision, CRYPTO QUEEN & BLOCKCHAIN evaluates Neo Pepe’s standout features compared to other meme coin options. She focuses attention on Neo Pepe’s thoughtful tokenomics, carefully structured presale approach, and engaging governance model. Her assessment presents Neo Pepe as a genuinely attractive crypto asset set apart by its thoughtful community design and technical solidity.\nAs decentralized governance gains traction—and with listings potentially influenced by holder-driven votes—the protocol sets itself apart from many presale projects. While altcoins like LINK, ADA, and SOL draw mainstream model-backed attention, Neo Pepe Coin adds a fresh, community-governed dynamic to the conversation around best crypto presale opportunities.\nHow to Join & What Lies Ahead\nParticipation is streamlined: users can access the presale via Ethereum, BNB Chain, or Base, using ETH, BNB, USDT, or USDC. Tokens unlock on an hourly basis post-purchase to minimize sell pressure. Supply is capped at one billion tokens, with 45% allocated to presale, 25% marketing, 10% liquidity, 10% development, and 5% earmarked for ecosystem and community rewards.\nChoose Your Pill—Step into Memetrix\nThe time has come to decide your role in the unfolding Memetrix. Will you remain passive, letting centralization control your crypto destiny, or will you choose Neo Pepe—the pathway to true decentralized freedom? Each token you hold is your voice in the resistance against centralized control. Each presale stage marks a deeper immersion into the revolution.

With all 15 presale stages completed and a Bonus Round now active at a fixed price of $0.007, the project has already raised nearly $21 million—drawing the eyes of builders, traders, and strategic buyers alike.\nRather than chasing buzzwords, Lightchain AI is anchoring its growth in a fully functional AI Virtual Machine, transparent governance, and developer-focused grant programs. It’s not about overcrowded ecosystems or fleeting incentives—Lightchain AI is becoming the focused, high-conviction choice in a market full of noise.\nEthereum Layer-2 Solutions Battle for Visibility Among Builders\nEthereum’s L2 scene is heating up as developers continue to search for more scalable and less expensive alternatives for their projects. Top platforms including Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism are in a battle for acceptance — with Arbitrum and Base both with more than $2.3bn in Total Value Locked (TVL) each at the end of 2024 and Optimism lagging at around $664m.\nBase, which is backed by Coinbase, has quickly seen traction, with more than 6 million transactions processed daily, and 28% of new startups founded on the platform within a year of launch. However, the large amount of over 40 L2 projects has created fragmentation that made it difficult for developers to pick the best platform.\nThere is an added pressure coming from Vitalik Buterin’s hopes of getting “Stage 1” decentralization done not later than 2025, (projects that will not meet these expectations would put themselves at risk of the lack of community support. As L2s continue to develop, the key to their success will be finding the right mix of scale, decentralization, and user experience to ensure that they are relevant in Ethereum's future.\nLightchain AI Secures Early Traction With Clear Tools and Grant Support\nLightchain AI is securing early traction by offering developers more than just promises—it delivers real tools and funding support. With 15 presale stages completed and a Bonus Round live, the platform is backed by clear progress and structured incentives.\nA $150,000 grant pool has already been deployed, targeting builders focused on explorers, data oracles, and dApps powered by the AIVM. Additional grants are on the way, reinforcing a builder-first strategy. Developers can access a dedicated portal with technical documentation and test environments, while Lightchain’s public GitHub repository will go live at mainnet.\nCombined with scalable infrastructure, sharded execution, and community-driven governance, Lightchain AI is proving it’s ready for serious adoption. Early traction is no accident—it’s the result of purposeful, transparent ecosystem design.\nSteady Progress, Big Impact — How Lightchain AI is Shaping Future of Blockchain\nLightchain AI is revolutionizing blockchain by blending cutting-edge artificial intelligence with decentralized technology. Say hello to the innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) — tools that make scalable, intelligent dApps a reality.\nThis game-changing approach has already caught the attention of major investors, raising over $21 million during its presale, with tokens fixed at just $0.007. With a capped supply of 10 billion LCAI tokens and a decentralized governance model, Lightchain AI is setting the standard for sustainability and community-driven progress.\nAs the final presale stage wraps up, Lightchain AI is ready to deliver powerful, long-term results in the ever-evolving blockchain world.

The global fiat-crypto payment gateway has been granted a Money Transmitter License (MTL) in South Carolina. This license marks a significant milestone of the company as it expands its legal bases in the United States.\nNew MTL Lets Alchemy Pay Expand Fiat-Crypto Services\nThrough this, Alchemy Pay has acquired about MTLs in 10 states in the U.S. These states are Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Wyoming, Arizona and now South Carolina. This indicates that Alchemy Pay is not joking with obeying the U.S regulations and establishing trust among the regulators.\nAlchemy Pay can provide numerous money services in South Carolina MTL. Such services are sending and receiving electronic money, selling stored value, and processing payments. It also deals with foreign money exchange and other licensed money operations. It implies that Alchemy Pay is free to offer its fiat-crypto ramps in South Carolina according to the law and without any danger.\nIt is a good time to see such progress. The U.S is beginning to offer crystal-clear guidelines on digital assets. It is evidenced by the recent creation of the GENIUS Act and the increased popularity of representations of real-world assets. With this new license, Alchemy Pay is still ahead of this evolving market.\nAccording to the CEO of the company, the license demonstrates their high interest in compliance. Through it, Alchemy Pay will be able to extend its business in the United States and facilitate the process of connecting traditional money with blockchain. This action will subsidize their new projects as well.\nTo give an example, Alchemy Pay will introduce a new RWA platform in August. The blockchain will provide tokenized stocks and ETFs, which individuals can purchase with ordinary money. At first, there is an intention to collaborate with Backed and xStocks in order to introduce the initial batch of 60 tokenized assets. Alchemy Pay will be able to facilitate this launch more easily with the MTL in place.\nCompany Prepares for MiCA Rules, Targets Hong Kong Licenses Next\nIn addition to the U.S., Alchemy Pay is expanding worldwide. The firm is also a holder of an Authorized Payment Institution License in the UK. It is an Australia Digital Currency Exchange Provider. It is the part of Switzerland where it is a member of VQF which is a recognized group by FINMA.\nAlchemy Pay is also a Money Services Business in Canada. It is made legal in South Korea to offer electronic financial services. These approvals demonstrate that Alchemy Pay aims to obey the regulations wherever it shows its presence.\nAlchemy Pay has even greater plans. It has a desire to introduce its stablecoin. It is also developing Alchemy Chain, a blockchain based on stablecoins in worldwide payments. Good licenses will also assist the company in pushing such ideas with increased trust and safety.\nMeanwhile, Alchemy Pay is preparing for new regulations in Europe as well. The firm is gearing up against MiCA, a crypto regulation in Europe. It is also exploring acquiring more licenses in Hong Kong and other large markets.\nUltimately, acquiring the license of South Carolina is not merely paperwork. It demonstrates that Alchemy Pay is prepared to take a substantial role in the development of the new generation of payments. As it provides new products and expands the number of licenses, it aims to bridge the gap between the new and the old sectors of the financial world.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 21:00:30 +0000", "author": "Bilal Hassan", "source": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/feed/"}
{"title": "Gates Launches $75M Tokyo Real Estate Tokenization on Oasys Blockchain", "url": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/gates-launches-75m-tokyo-real-estate-tokenization-on-oasys-blockchain/", "text": "- Gates tokenizes $75M Tokyo properties on Oasys blockchain.\n- Plans to tokenize $200B assets, 1% of Japan’s real estate market.\n- Expansion targets US, Europe, Asia, and Japanese IP assets.\nJapan-based real estate investment firm Gates Inc. announced that it has partnered with the Oasys blockchain to tokenize 75 million dollars of income-generating properties in central Tokyo. Experts consider the project one of the largest real estate tokenization efforts in Japan, as it aims to increase liquidity and provide foreign investors with greater access to the Japanese market.\nThe project will be one of the first stages of tokenization of over 200 billion dollars or 1 percent of the roughly 20.5 trillion yen or 200 billion dollar Japanese real estate market. Gates also aims to make it easier to purchase and sell property using blockchain to avoid legal, regulatory, and language barriers that have ensnared the process of the foreign buyer in the past.\nExpanding Liquidity and Investor Access\nGates will adopt the tokenization through a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that is set in a foreign land to comply with the local legislation. The partnership with Oasys is based on the blockchain-based platform originally targeting the gaming world, currently focused on the field of real-world assets (RWA) tokenization, and provides secure, scalable, and interoperable terms of token issuance.\nThe tokenized assets will allow any investors worldwide to buy, sell, and trade their real estate-backed tokens with Web3 wallets. The model reduces the barriers to entry, ensures that liquidity is maximized, with a vision to scale the liquidity of the token up to 34 billion in the initial stage.\nOasys has developed an EVM-compatible proof-of-stake network that provides the seamless migration of assets and wallet compatibility to help institutions to join tokenized real estate markets. Oasys leadership stated that they designed the platform to maximize compounding returns by automatically reinvesting returns.\nGlobal Expansion and Diversification Plans\nGates will aim to expand its tokenization efforts to other nations, primarily in the United States, Europe, the Philippines, and other Asian markets after its launch in Tokyo. The company is also exploring the use of Japanese intellectual property, like assets in the gaming and anime sectors, to diversify its real-world assets offerings through tokenization.\nIn 2024, Gates realized 145 million in revenues, and the prospective listing of the company on Nasdaq has shown that it wants to be a global market leader in asset tokenization. The project aligns with the growing global interest in tokenized real estate, which experts project to exceed 4 trillion dollars by 2035, as institutional investors pursue greater liquidity and efficiency.\nBy putting ownership on the blockchain, Gates will simplify investment, eliminating transaction expenses and opening up new pools of retail and institutional capital, anywhere in the world. The project will probably serve as a precedent to the real estate and digital asset industry in Japan and will lead to the adoption of blockchain technology in the traditional markets.", "published": "Sat, 12 Jul 2025 02:55:32 +0000", "author": "Emily John", "source": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/feed/"}
{"title": "Tokenized Securities Are Still Securities, US SEC’s ‘Crypto Mom’ Affirms", "url": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tokenized-securities-are-still-securities-us-secs-crypto-mom-affirms/", "text": "- Digital tokens linked to securities are legally securities.\n- Compliance with disclosure rules is mandatory.\n- SEC supports innovation within legal boundaries.\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) once again clarified that tokenized securities will be regulated by federal securities laws irrespective of their digital nature. Commissioner Hester Peirce, SEC crypto mom, has made it clear that blockchain does not alter the nature of these assets.\nPeirce gave an announcement advising companies intending to distribute or trade tokenized securities to make contact with the SEC and follow the current regulations. She emphasized that tokenization provides significant approaches to trading and distributing securities, but does not exclude the latter instruments of legal regulation.\nRegulatory Clarity on Tokenized Securities\nThe process of tokenization consists of transforming traditional types of securities, i.e., shares of a company, into digital tokens that are traded on a blockchain. Such a process can be done internally by the issuer itself or by third parties who are custodians of the underlying securities. Tokens issued by third parties are associated with extra risks, among which the counterparty risks should be listed by investors, and Peirce warned about them.\nAll market participants must comply with the disclosure requirements of federal securities legislation when issuing tokenized securities. To clarify these responsibilities, Peirce cited the recent guidance by the SEC Division of Corporation Finance. She also pointed out that tokenized securities may have a different legal form, including being in the form of security-based swaps or security-based receipts; each of these forms has different regulatory implications.\nThis position taken by the SEC is agreeable with the appeals made by the former Chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler, that companies need to proactively reach regulators whenever launching products related to crypto that might be considered as securities. Peirce once again noted the willingness of the agency to collaborate with those in the market to modernize rules or devise exemptions where warranted by technological advancement.\nIndustry Impact and Future Directions\nThe message arrives when companies such as Robinhood and Coinbase consider tokenizing exchange-traded products and stocks with a view to providing blockchain-based trading opportunities. The recent launch of a tokenization-focused layer-2 blockchain by Robinhood and its submission to the SEC of a regulatory framework proposal are good examples of increased momentum in this area.\nRegardless of the optimistic attitude to the prospect of tokenization in connection with the simplification of capital formation and the rise in asset liquidity, issues arise regarding the non-evasion of regulations and safeguarding investors. Certain legislatures have cautioned that tokenization might be used to evade SEC regulation, and thus place retail investors at risk of an unknown danger.\nThe statements of Peirce restate the fact that innovations should be undertaken within legal frameworks. The SEC is willing to work with the companies to ensure there is a need to make adjustments to regulations, but it also wants to ensure that the tokenized securities follow the securities law that is already in place.", "published": "Sat, 12 Jul 2025 02:39:38 +0000", "author": "Emily John", "source": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/feed/"}

The court drastically escalated the initial 18-month sentence after finding Truglia guilty of wire fraud in 2022 for a SIM-swapping hack.\nA jury convicted Truglia, 27, for participating in a scheme that defrauded crypto investors in the Bay Area, California. He and his accomplices took control of Terpin’s phone number, using SIM-swapping methods, and accessed and drained his cryptocurrency accounts. Terpin, a blockchain investor and CEO, had 24 million stolen in the hack.\nJudge Cites Evasion and Lavish Lifestyle\nJudge Alvin Hellerstein noted in the sentence that Truglia had flagrantly disregarded his own written promise to make reparation payments on many occasions. The judge said, “You did not pay a cent, not one cent,” and emphasized that Truglia had made no effort to repay the victim, despite having significant personal holdings.\nAccording to court documents, Truglia had over $60 million worth of assets, including cryptocurrency, art, and jewelry, at the moment of the initial sentence. The judge said, You had no job, yet you were living in splendor, which was a reference to the affluent lifestyle that Truglia was leading as he avoided paying his debts.\nThe legal team of Truglia made an argument that he had given up all the available property, and most of the wealth he had was trapped in a Bitcoin wallet that he could not unlock. But these justifications were not convincing to Judge Hellerstein, who referred to the actions of Truglia as intentional avoidance of law enforcement as well as judicial enforcement of the restitution order.\nSIM-Swapping Scheme and Legal Fallout\nThe scam entailed deceiving telecom workers to change the phone number of Terpin into a SIM card under the control of the hackers. This enabled the gang to circumvent the authentication tools and steal crypto holdings of Terpin.\nTruglia pleaded guilty in 2021 to one count of wire fraud. The court initially mandated him to pay almost 20.4 million as restitution and imposed three years of supervised release, in addition to his jail term.\nIn 2019, the court awarded Terpin the full amount of damages after he filed a civil suit against Truglia and a $224 million case against his wireless carrier, citing negligence.\nThe defense team of Truglia has termed the new sentence as an extraordinary abuse of discretion and has said they will appeal. The case highlights the growing attention and harsh punishment of those found to be guilty of mass crypto robbery.", "published": "Sat, 12 Jul 2025 02:06:49 +0000", "author": "Emily John", "source": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/feed/"}

The institutional demand took Bitcoin to a new all-time high of $118,760.\nSource – Sosovalue\nU.S. spot Bitcoin ETF trading volumes have increased to an all-time high, with BlackRock’s IBIT topping inflows at just over $448.5 million and Fidelity FBTC not far behind at slightly over $324.34 million. Net inflows of more than $51 billion into Bitcoin spot ETFs were generated by this influx of capital.\nInstitutional Demand Fuels Bitcoin’s Record Rally\nAsset managers, corporate treasuries, and wealth platforms continue to demand, according to the latest inflow statistics. Seven of the twelve Bitcoin funds experienced net inflows, with IBIT being the leader and FBTC following it.\nThe steady flow of funds into the regulated ETF products has changed the market dynamics of Bitcoin, where big investors have upped their investment.” What we are experiencing is not a retail-driven madness, but a stable supply of capital, flowing out of asset managers, corporate treasurers, and wealth platforms, finally entering the market. Weeks of uninterrupted inflows prove that,” one of the market observers said.\nThe price of Bitcoin followed the momentum of the ETF, and it reached a high of above $118,450 before declining to $118,140. The new record of $118,760 for the token revealed the influence of ETF-fed demand on the price exploration.\nETF Flows Reshape Crypto Market Structure\nInflows of ETFs are now one of the characteristics of the institutionalization of Bitcoin. The standardized nature of the spot ETFs has allowed conventional investors to gain exposure to crypto without custody, private keys, or unregulated exchanges.\nThe ETF wrapping has opened the door to new market segments and already has billions in assets in products issued by BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark 21Shares. ARKB of Ark 21Shares attracted $268.7 million on July 10, and Bitwise and VanEck also had smaller, albeit considerable, inflows. Grayscale’s GBTC, in contrast, saw outflows of $40.2 million.\nThe cumulative inflows of all the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have now reached a mark of almost 6 percent of the total Bitcoin supply, with more than 1.25 million BTC being held by the funds.\nEthereum has not been an exception to the influx of ETF funds, with its Ether spot ETFs registering $383 million in net inflows on the same day, the second-largest daily inflow figure of the asset. The price of Ether rose to more than $3,000, which indicates strong institutional interest in the crypto market as a whole.\nThe change was mentioned in a recent statement: Bitcoin is no longer being viewed as a high-risk outlier but more like a long-duration macro asset. The infrastructure is ready, the regulatory clarity is on the rise, and the capital is flowing with a long-term perspective. That is what is causing the inflows, and it is not abating”.\nThe new all-time high of Bitcoin and unprecedented ETF inflows are indicators of a turning point in the cryptocurrency market as institutional involvement is becoming more ingrained and transforming the environment.", "published": "Sat, 12 Jul 2025 01:51:09 +0000", "author": "Emily John", "source": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/feed/"}

Just a few weeks ago, Hayes was cautious about the crypto market. He was concerned that filling the U.S. Treasury General Account (TGA) would cause liquidity to be taken out of the economy. This could have damaged risky assets such as Bitcoin and altcoins.\nTrump Tariff Easing May Fuel Crypto Rally, Says Hayes\nBut this has changed with the speed of light. On July 11, Hayes provided a post on X explaining why he has now become bullish. According to CoinMarketCap data, the price of Bitcoin has touched its new all-time high of 118,869 with $122B trading volumes. This is a good indication that the market has shifted gears to be positive again.\nThe move has prompted Hayes to say that his previous bearish outlook is no longer valid. He wrote, “I was slightly bearish in my last essay due to TGA refill. What changed? $BTC busted through ATH on good volume.”\nThen Hayes thinks that Ethereum will be superior to Bitcoin. He believes ETH will take the next big rally. He tweeted, $ETH is tracking and will lead the way, prepare yourself for a monster alt season. Hayes has always argued that altcoins follow when Ethereum becomes strong.\nAlso, the macroeconomics are fueling the fire. Hayes noted that the markets now think that former President Trump will be more moderate in his tariff policy should he get re-elected. “TACO” is an acronym meaning Trump Always Chickens Out, implying that Trump might not enact harsh trade barriers.\nThe reduction of tariffs can benefit international commerce and undermine U.S. dollar. A falling dollar usually drives investors to Bitcoin and other digital tokens as alternative stores of value. Consequently, crypto prices go higher.\nEthereum’s fundamentals are improving too. In the recent past, the Pectra update increased ETH by almost 50% in the course of a brief period. It demonstrates increasing confidence in the future of Ethereum in the market. Hayes is sure that ETH is no longer a tech network but rather an asset that could be rated as a treasury.\nXRP, ETH, PEPE Rally Signals Monster Altcoin Season Approaching\nLarge corporations are beginning to concur. GameSquare (Nasdaq) has also declared a 100 million strategy that centers on Ethereum. Recently, SharpLink Gaming purchased an additional 10,000 ETH and raised its portfolio to more than 215,000 ETH.\nHayes believes that such movements demonstrate that Ethereum is regarded as having real value by institutions. Once the ETH breaks out, a lot of money tends to move to the minor altcoins. In the past, altcoins have worked exceptionally well when Ethereum picks up the pace. Hayes referred to ETH as the most despised Layer-1. According to him, when people overlook assets, investors are usually surprised by the huge returns on such assets when bull runs come.\nThe other cause is international debt and easy money policies. Governments spending more and maintaining interest rates at low levels cause investors to seek assets that will provide higher returns. Altcoins, particularly Ethereum, can fill this demand of high-yielding opportunities.\nEven now, one can see evidence of an altcoin rally. Within the same day, XRP surged by 14% to reach a value of 2.82 dollars. Ethereum was up 8% and trading above $3,000. Even memecoins, such as PEPE, increased by 10 to 20% over 24 hours.\nFinally, Arthur Hayes thinks that a massive altcoin season is approaching. The market may be strengthened further by strong Bitcoin momentum, Ethereum upgrades, and positive macro signals. Investors are watching closely to see if this “monster alt szn” really takes off.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 22:00:04 +0000", "author": "Bilal Hassan", "source": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/feed/"}

Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming and London’s Smarter Web Company have both made big moves to strengthen their digital asset reserves. Their choices demonstrate the way companies are gaining confidence in maintaining crypto as a part of their balance sheets.\nSharpLink Buys 10,000 ETH Directly from Ethereum Foundation\nSharpLink Gaming has acquired 10,000 ETH directly from Ethereum Foundation. The transaction amounted to 25.7 million dollars. The deal was an over-the-counter transaction, and it was closed on July 10 with an average price of $2,572.37 per ETH. The acquisition gives SharpLink an aggregate of approximately 215,634 ETH.\nAt current market prices, these holdings are currently valued at approximately 558 million dollars. The Ethereum foundation is a large organization that is situated in Switzerland, Zug, and it is instrumental in the expansion of the Ethereum network. It invests in projects, programs, and developers and tries to ensure Ethereum remains decentralized.\nDevelopers consider ethereum one of the most significant blockchains nowadays. It is a decentralized application and smart contract supporting. These tools help build the Web3 economy, which many call the internet’s future.\nJoseph Lubin, SharpLink Chairman and Ethereum Co-Founder, commented directly on the deal. He said Ethereum is now entering a new era of institutional importance. Therefore, SharpLink feels proud to support its long-term strength and decentralization goals. In his view, this move proves their commitment to Ethereum’s future.\nSmarter Web Spends £21.88M to Grow Its Bitcoin Treasury\nSharpLink is expanding its ETH stack, whereas The Smarter Web Company is interested in Bitcoin. The London-listed company said on Friday that it bought another 275 BTC. This is within its 10-Year Plan, it plans to continue to add Bitcoin to its treasury in the long term.\nIt cost the company approximately 21.88 million pounds to acquire the new bitcoins. The average Bitcoin price was £79,563, which equals about $108,182. In this new acquisition, Smarter Web now has a total of 1,275 BTC.\nSmarter Web started accepting Bitcoin payments in 2023. Since then, it has invested in the establishment of a good Bitcoin reserve. It is confident that Bitcoin has a significant future in the future of money.\nIn addition, it owns Bitcoins of over 100 million in average prices purchased by the company. The company also possesses nearly 31 million pounds worth of cash that it can use to acquire additional Bitcoins should it be necessary.\nSmarter Web claims that its Bitcoin treasury is providing huge dividends. Its Bitcoin assets alone have experienced a 31,263 percent improvement this year. In 30 days alone, the yield has gone up by 497%.\nIn addition to crypto, Smarter Web also does web design, development, and marketing. Each month it generates revenue as setup fees, hosting, and additional services.\nSuch mega steps by SharpLink and Smarter Web indicate the fact that now crypto is not just a trading asset. It is turning into a mainstream treasury of certain firms.\nBoth companies appear to be long-term investment participants.

It bought Kolscan, a wallet-tracking tool that monitors top on-chain traders. The deal was announced on Thursday. This is a new phase of Pump.fun as it seeks to expand in a rapidly evolving crypto market.\nPump.fun Keeps Kolscan Free, Promises Faster Trade Updates\nKolscan stands for “key opinion leader scan.” It follows the actions of the best traders in the blockchain. Real-time transactions, profits, and even leaderboards can be visualized by users. This provides people with tips on who traders are on the winning side and how they do it.\nAs Pump.fun says, it is already planned to interconnect the data of Kolscan with its platform. This implies that users will soon look forward to new features. They will have access to superior tools to follow the leading trader, copy trade, and identify the best traders. According to Pump.fun, this will form “completely new experiences” in onchain trading.\nCo-founder Alon Cohen shared more details on X, formerly Twitter. He added Kolscan will remain free to all. It is good news for the existing Kolscan users. Cohen also ensured to provide quicker trade updates, improved accuracy of data, and new tools on social trading.\nFor Cohen, on-chain trading is not just about making money alone. He terms it a social sport. Individuals engage in trade with their friends, share their outcomes, and acquire knowledge from one another. Further, he thinks that this social aspect is what makes traders busy. Pump.fun aims at continuing to increase its users by incorporating additional social tools.\nPump.fun used to dominate the Solana memecoin market. However, in the recent past, its share has fallen to less than 60 %. Meanwhile, it has also lost revenues. Competitors such as LetsBonk are becoming more powerful. That is why Pump.fun has to include new ideas to remain ahead. The purchase of Kolscan may be beneficial.\nPump.fun Shifts From Memecoins to Social Trading With New Tools\nThe new data tools will bring more value than just launching new tokens. When markets are risky, people seek useful information. Pump.fun will provide more incentives to use the site because it displayed the winning, and hence more reasons to remain.\nThis acquisition is also taking place on the eve of the large ICO that Pump.fun is celebrating. A cryptocurrency firm cannot get a bigger event than the Initial Coin Offering. Thus, the buyout by the Kolscan can facilitate increasing the trust of investors. It demonstrates that Pump.fun is strong with being dynamic by introducing new services and expanding its ecosystem.\nCohen commended the founder of Kolscan for creating an app that the traders can run daily. According to him, that is the indication that the product is sound and fulfills actual needs. He also indicated that projects are successful because of the traders themselves. Information concerning those who are investing, the time of investment, and the level of their belief may alter the fate of a project.\nOverall, the first acquisition by Pump.fun is an indication of a change of approach taken by the latter. It not only aspires to be a platform to mint memecoins. It is aspiring to be the center of social trading, insights, and community. This mixed use of fun, data, and social tools can even enable it to gain market share back since there is increasing competition.\nIn the future, traders will monitor the progress of this plan. At this point, Pump.fun is gambling that responder dynamics and instantaneous data will be enough to maintain traders interested and faithful. In case it succeeds, it would define how people conduct trading on-chain in the future.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 19:07:47 +0000", "author": "Bilal Hassan", "source": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/feed/"}

Whales have made some big purchases, hinting at a possible price rise later in 2025. At the same time, Near Protocol (NEAR) is trading around $2.00, showing a slow and cautious trend. Traders are waiting to see if it can move towards $4.66 or beyond.\nBut the spotlight is now on BlockDAG (BDAG), thanks to its exciting Buyer Battles and massive presale growth. With $336 million already raised, interest is surging. Every day, 50 million BDAG coins are released, and if any are left unsold, they go to the wallet that spent the most that day. Right now, as part of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, users can buy BDAG at a special $0.0016 price until August 11. With a listing price of $0.05, this gives a possible 3,025% return, making it one of the best crypto choices today.\nDogecoin Eyes $3.40 Comeback Path\nOn July 7, Dogecoin (DOGE) rose 6.6%, reaching $0.1743. This gain came after large buys by whales and growing interest from the wider market. Still, the overall chart remains mixed. Technical signals show both strength and weakness. DOGE is currently stuck in a descending wedge pattern, and its key support near $0.13 is being tested once again.\nMany believe that if this support breaks, DOGE could slide further. But others argue it could bounce back. In past cycles, Dogecoin has often surged after quiet periods. One analyst sees this pattern repeating. If it does, we could see Dogecoin aim for a price of $3.40 by the end of 2025. Right now, traders are staying alert and weighing both risk and potential.\nNEAR Awaits Breakout Toward $22.22 Goal\nNEAR is facing pressure as it stays just below $2.10. It now trades close to $2.00, causing a stir among those tracking its price. Short-term signs suggest caution, but solid support at $1.80 has helped prevent further dips so far.\nExperts still believe NEAR could climb to $4.66 by the end of 2025 if momentum returns. Looking ahead, forecasts suggest it might even reach $22.22 by 2031 due to tech upgrades and rising use. For now, the chart shows that buyers and sellers are balanced. NEAR is waiting for a clear direction, and the coming days will be important for its next move.\nBlockDAG 50M Buyer Battles Push Presale Over $336 Million\nBlockDAG’s Buyer Battles are gaining attention fast. These daily contests are simple but effective. Each day, 50 million BDAG coins are available. If any are left unsold, they’re given to the wallet that made the biggest buy that day. This smart setup gives users a way to get more coins without paying more. One user even got over 1 million BDAG by topping the chart.\nRight now, BlockDAG is in Batch 29, and its current batch price is $0.0276. But during the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, BDAG is being offered at just $0.0016 until August 11. The confirmed listing price is $0.05, giving those who buy now a huge 3,025% return potential. For those who joined in Batch 1, returns have already hit 2,660%.\nBuyer Battles also help users lower their average cost per coin. That makes it even more appealing. The daily leaderboard resets at midnight UTC, turning every day into a fresh chance to win. With over 23.7 billion BDAG already sold and $336 million raised, more people are joining daily to boost their share before prices rise. As the GLOBAL LAUNCH release moves closer, BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the most active and exciting projects right now.\nEach new day offers a new shot at winning more BDAG through Buyer Battles. Many users are returning daily to climb the chart and grow their share. It’s an easy way to stay active in the presale without needing to spend extra. As more people take part, BlockDAG’s presale has already reached $336 million in total sales. With over 23.7 billion coins sold so far, demand remains high. Everyone’s watching to see who leads next before the GLOBAL LAUNCH release wraps up.\nFinal Verdict\nDogecoin (DOGE) remains in a zone of uncertainty. Prices are stable for now, but technical signals are mixed. NEAR is also trading in a tight range. Long-term growth looks possible, but short-term moves are harder to predict. In contrast, BlockDAG is gaining serious ground with its presale crossing $336M.\nThe ongoing Buyer Battles make each day exciting and help users get more BDAG without needing to spend more money. With the special $0.0016 offer running until August 11 and the confirmed $0.05 launch price ahead, the chance for a 3,025% return is turning heads. Right now, for those choosing where to look next, BlockDAG stands out as the top crypto to watch.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nPress releases or guest posts published by Crypto Economy have been submitted by companies or their representatives.

From meme coin surprises to Layer-2 strategy overhauls, both seasoned participants and new entrants have plenty to monitor right now.\nJustin Sun’s bold $100 million move has put TRUMP coin back in the spotlight, while Polygon’s sharp 20% recovery and strategic turn away from zkEVM are fueling fresh optimism for POL. These moves underline how quickly momentum can shift, and where attention is heading next.\nAt the same time, BlockDAG (BDAG) is turning heads with its latest sports tie-ins and a remarkable $336 million presale. Along with a limited-time $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release entry, it’s positioning itself as one of the most active projects with real-world traction.\nTRON to TRUMP: Justin Sun’s $100M Crypto Play\nTRON founder Justin Sun has pledged $100 million to acquire TRUMP Coin, reigniting conversation around the token. Announced on July 9, the plan involves bridging TRUMP Coin onto TRON’s network using LayerZero tech, aiming to boost speed and compatibility. Although the token trades nearly 90% below its peak of $75.35, it still holds a robust $1.8 billion market cap.\nSun already holds over $40 million worth of TRUMP Coin and previously backed Trump-aligned initiatives like World Liberty Financial. This fresh capital could inject renewed liquidity and interest. Many see the move as a catalyst for recovery, if the cross-chain integration succeeds.\nPolygon Surges 20% After Strategic Pivot\nPolygon (POL) surged 20% after disclosing it would sunset its zkEVM chain by 2026. The team is shifting focus to its main PoS chain and the emerging AggLayer, signaling a more streamlined and sustainable direction. This pivot suggests growing attention to real-world applications, stablecoin use, and NFT-related infrastructure.\nThe zkEVM chain reportedly ran a $1 million annual deficit and lacked support for Ethereum’s Blob upgrade, which led to a steep drop in TVL from $80 million to just $16 million. Now, under CEO Sandeep Nailwal, Polygon is realigning resources toward growth areas. Support for zkEVM remains until 2026, but the narrative is clearly evolving.\nSeattle Orcas & Seawolves Join BlockDAG’s Web3 Play\nBlockDAG’s latest move into professional sports is building meaningful real-world use. Its collaboration with the Seattle Orcas, a rising Major League Cricket team, brings exclusive digital content, collectibles, and interactive features to fans. It’s a practical demonstration of Web3 connecting with mainstream entertainment.\nThe brand’s role as Official Blockchain Partner for the Seattle Seawolves also stands out. Through NFT-backed fan tokens, behind-the-scenes access, and limited-edition drops, BlockDAG is actively creating value beyond speculation. These efforts support stronger user engagement and real utility for BDAG holders.\nWith a community-first approach and execution that matches ambition, BlockDAG is moving ahead where others are still making promises. Its partnerships enhance visibility and trust as the GLOBAL LAUNCH release window approaches.\nTo date, BlockDAG has raised more than $336 million and sold over 23.8 billion coins. With the $0.0016 price available until August 11, users have a rare chance to capture up to 3,025% upside before it launches at $0.05.\nConclusion\nJustin Sun’s $100 million plan brings TRUMP Coin back into focus, potentially expanding its liquidity and technical reach. Polygon’s decision to retire zkEVM has shifted sentiment, with POL showing signs of renewed strength as attention moves to core infrastructure and utility.\nBlockDAG is emerging as one of the best-performing cryptos this year, combining real-world adoption with a record-setting presale. With $336 million raised, 23.8 billion coins sold, and a $0.0016 entry available through August 11, BlockDAG’s upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release may offer one of the strongest upside cases in the market right now.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nPress releases or guest posts published by Crypto Economy have been submitted by companies or their representatives.

{"title": "BlockDAG Scores Major Partnership with Seawolves as Hedera Price Signal & SEI Short-Term Analysis Flash Bullish Momentum", "url": "https://crypto-economy.com/blockdag-scores-major-partnership-with-seawolves-as-hedera-price-signal-sei-short-term-analysis-flash-bullish-momentum/", "text": "Searching for the top bullish crypto heading into 2025? With so many updates hitting the market, today’s developments could help narrow the search.\nA new Hedera (HBAR) price signal is drawing interest, with RSI divergence forming near a key resistance level, suggesting a potential breakout. Similarly, the SEI short-term analysis points to a possible rally as chart patterns develop on multiple timeframes.\nIn the presale market, BlockDAG (BDAG) has announced a fresh sports partnership with the Seattle Seawolves, a major step toward mainstream presence. With over $336 million raised so far, this announcement is expected to fuel even more interest in one of the largest crypto presales to date.\nSo, which of these projects offers the best chance for upside in the coming year? Let’s break it down.\nHedera (HBAR) Price Signal Hints at a Breakout Ahead\nHBAR is currently positioned just under a long-standing trendline from March, trading near the $0.162 resistance mark. This level has been tested three times in recent days, but hasn’t broken yet. However, there’s reason to stay alert, RSI is forming higher lows while the price remains steady or slightly lower since mid-June.\nThis pattern of divergence is an important Hedera (HBAR) price signal, often signaling a potential price breakout. If HBAR moves above $0.162, analysts point to $0.178 and $0.217 as the next targets. On the other hand, if resistance holds again, the price could revisit $0.143, a lower support zone and another key area to monitor.\nSEI Short-Term Analysis Signals a Rally Setup\nThe SEI short-term analysis reveals signs of a rally building. On the weekly chart, SEI is holding above long-term support and approaching the $0.28 resistance line. If the price can break through, it may pave the way for a jump to $1.00, a potential 288% gain from current levels.\nZooming in, SEI’s 4-hour chart displays a descending triangle forming between the $0.245 and $0.250 support range. This setup often leads to a breakout. If SEI moves past $0.28, a quick push to $0.3475, about a 30% rise, becomes a realistic short-term target.\nBlockDAG Teams Up with Seattle Seawolves to Expand Reach in Sports\nBlockDAG has taken another major step by becoming the official blockchain partner of the Seattle Seawolves, one of the standout teams in Major League Rugby. This isn’t just about marketing; fans will get hands-on with blockchain content like digital collectibles and tradable tokens.\nThe partnership also includes a co-branded content series on the Seawolves’ social media, featuring match highlights, player insights, and behind-the-scenes access powered by BlockDAG. This move helps bridge Web3 technology with real-world audiences.\nThe BlockDAG presale has already raised over $336 million, selling more than 23.8 billion coins. This new partnership is expected to further drive visibility, helping the project inch closer to its $600 million presale goal. Market watchers say the coin could hit $1 after launch, putting it firmly in the top bullish crypto category.\nRight now, Batch 29 is open with the BDAG price at a special $0.0016. This price remains locked until the upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. With a confirmed launch price of $0.05, that’s a potential return of 3,025% for those who buy in now. Following the Seawolves announcement, interest in Batch 29 has surged, and available supply is quickly shrinking. This could be the final opportunity to join before prices move up.\nWhich Project Looks Like the Top Bullish Crypto for 2025?\nThe recent Hedera (HBAR) price signal shows a breakout might be coming soon, with strong RSI divergence and clear targets ahead. SEI’s technicals are also setting up well, and the SEI short-term analysis points to a possible quick jump if resistance breaks at $0.28.\nBut among all three, BlockDAG stands out as the top bullish crypto to watch. Its partnership with the Seattle Seawolves proves it’s not just talk, it’s delivering real adoption and expanding its reach. Add in the $336 million raised, growing mining community, and the 3,025% ROI locked in for presale buyers, and BlockDAG looks well-positioned for explosive growth.\nThe current $0.0016 price won’t be available for long. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release set for August 11, this may be the last window to secure one of the highest-ROI opportunities of 2025.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nPress releases or guest posts published by Crypto Economy have been submitted by companies or their representatives.

{"title": "BlockDAG’s Seattle Sports Partnerships Put Web3 Into Play as ETH Targets $5K & Celestia Shows Rollup Power", "url": "https://crypto-economy.com/blockdags-seattle-sports-partnerships-put-web3-into-play-as-eth-targets-5k-celestia-shows-rollup-power/", "text": "The search for the best crypto right now keeps turning up a few clear standouts. Ethereum still grabs headlines with its bold $5K price target and consistent developer action. Celestia’s fresh 26% surge shows how its unique rollup model is paying off in real time.\nBut it’s BlockDAG (BDAG) that’s making waves beyond the usual hype, locking in over $336 million in presale funds while teaming up with the Seattle Seawolves to put blockchain tech where real fans gather. This look at Ethereum, Celestia, and BlockDAG breaks down what makes each one worth watching as the market hunts for real use cases, steady traction, and strong upside potential.\nEthereum’s $5K Target: Smart Money Keeps Backing ETH\nEthereum still sets the standard for smart contracts and DeFi, and its $5000 target stays strong despite recent dips. Big wallets waking up and steady whale buying suggest smart buyers see the next big move coming. Ethereum still leads in total value locked and developer activity, which keeps it ahead of other chains.\nUpgrades like proto-danksharding will improve how Ethereum handles scaling and costs, even as gas fees remain a challenge. While some uncertainty exists around regulations, Ethereum’s strong network effect makes it tough to knock off its top spot. Each market cycle, Ethereum has shown staying power, and that won’t change soon. As long as adoption and developer support stay healthy, the $5000 Ethereum (ETH) price goal stays realistic. For many, its proven use case and real adoption make it a core pick worth holding through the market ups and downs.\nCelestia’s 26% Price Climb Shows Real Rollup Traction\nCelestia proves that a modular approach can actually deliver real gains. Its unique design separates consensus and execution, letting developers spin up rollup chains that don’t get stuck in traffic. That setup is why the Celestia (TIA) price rally keeps attracting attention. A recent 26% jump shows that traders and builders trust its direction.\nUnlike some projects that promise more than they deliver, Celestia’s rollup focus stays practical. Developers keep choosing it because it works — plain and simple. Liquidity is flowing in, and its community sees the clear benefits of its rollup strategy. That keeps the Celestia (TIA) price rally in the spotlight, with targets like $2.26 looking realistic if adoption holds. This cycle is full of so-called scaling projects, but Celestia’s steady fundamentals and unique structure help it stand apart from the noise.\nBlockDAG’s $336M Presale Gets Real-World Push With Seattle Seawolves Deal\nBlockDAG wants to be more than just another Layer 1 name. By partnering with the Seattle Seawolves, a big name in Major League Rugby, it’s showing how Web3 can reach real-world fans. This isn’t just about putting a logo on a jersey. BlockDAG’s deal will bring special digital collectibles, player content, and fan perks all backed by blockchain. That makes people see what the tech can really do.\nWhat’s important is that BlockDAG’s tech can handle big, secure interactions. This partnership will test it live with sports fans, proving its potential. Instead of empty claims, people will see how blockchain works in everyday life. That’s the kind of thing Web3 needs more of, actual reasons for people to use it.\nOn the numbers side, BlockDAG’s momentum is clear. It has raised over $336 million in presale, sold 23.8 billion coins, and over 18,516 miners. Early buyers can still get BDAG at $0.0016 until August 11. With its $0.05 launch price locked in, that’s a possible 3,025% return, and a total 2,660% gain since Batch 1.\nThis is why many see BlockDAG as the best crypto right now, with its real partnerships, strong presale, and working tech pushing it way ahead of other projects that talk more than they deliver.\nIn Summary\nEthereum’s proven upgrades and steady whale action keep its $5000 goal looking possible. Celestia’s clear modular setup and its recent 26% rally make its rollup model stand out in a sea of empty Layer 1 promises. But BlockDAG is doing something different, bringing blockchain into sports with a real partnership, not just hype. Its $336 million presale and Seattle Seawolves deal show how Web3 can actually reach people outside the crypto bubble.\nFor anyone keeping an eye on which projects have staying power, these three deserve a spot on the radar. But with fresh use cases, strong growth numbers, and a plan that connects the tech to everyday fans, BlockDAG is shaping up to be the one to watch the closest this cycle.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nPress releases or guest posts published by Crypto Economy have been submitted by companies or their representatives.

{"title": "Best Crypto For Beginners: BlockDAG, BONK, CRO & KAS Could Be This Cycle’s Breakout Picks", "url": "https://crypto-economy.com/best-crypto-for-beginners-blockdag-bonk-cro-kas-could-be-this-cycles-breakout-picks/", "text": "Looking for the best crypto for beginners means finding more than just trending names. You want projects with actual use, new developments, and price setups that show real potential. BlockDAG is leading this list with a record-breaking presale and talk of a big U.S. partnership. BONK remains active below $0.00003, driven by meme momentum and Solana connections.\nCRO, trading around $0.09, powers real-world payment features and DeFi use. Meanwhile, Kaspa (KAS) sticks near $0.15 as it upgrades its fast blockDAG structure and keeps developers interested.\n1. BlockDAG: Final Presale Stage & Sports Collaborations Create Buzz\nBlockDAG is quickly becoming the best crypto for beginners, with explosive presale numbers, a user-friendly mobile mining app, and attention-grabbing real-world partnerships. So far, it’s pulled in over $336 million, sold more than 23.8 billion coins, and onboarded 18,480+ miners. Its X1 Miner app lets anyone with a smartphone mine BDAG, making it easy for new users to join the action.\nTech-wise, BlockDAG’s structure allows fast, scalable, and energy-efficient transactions, something traditional chains struggle with. But what’s turning heads is how BDAG is going mainstream. It already has deals with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas have already launched their names into major sports circles, and rumours hint at an even bigger American partnership in the pipeline.\nAdd to that its clear, inflation-resistant emissions model, and BlockDAG looks serious about long-term sustainability. Right now, its presale price is locked at just $0.0016 until August 11. With a launch target of $0.05, early supporters could potentially see a massive 3,025% return.\nBlockDAG isn’t just hype. Its strong funding, clever marketing, and easy-to-access mining ecosystem make it a real contender for those looking to get in before the crowd. With the presale window closing fast, the upside could be huge.\n2. CRO: Real Payment Features & DeFi Expansion Keep It Steady\nCRO remains a solid pick for those who want real-world use, not just speculation. Priced around $0.09, it fuels Crypto.com’s network, debit cards, and its Pay feature. A fixed supply and token burn system helps CRO avoid inflation, supporting its long-term price story.\nAnalysts watching CRO believe it could retest the $0.12 to $0.15 range if DeFi and payments volume pick up again. It checks the boxes as one of the best cryptos for beginners, especially with the Cronos Chain expanding. Regulatory pressure is something to watch, but steady product upgrades and the platform’s strong brand keep CRO in the running for a comeback.\n3. BONK: Meme Power Meets the Speed of Solana\nBONK is the meme coin to watch if you’re okay with some risk and love community-driven energy. It’s still trading under $0.00003, built on Solana’s speedy, low-fee network. Constant NFT drops, new exchange listings, and frequent supply burns keep BONK buzzing with life.\nIf Solana’s ecosystem continues growing, BONK might revisit its earlier highs near $0.00005. For anyone exploring the best crypto for beginners, BONK’s viral charm and limited supply make it one of those coins that can spike when least expected. While it competes with meme giants like SHIB and DOGE, BONK’s fresh approach keeps it on the watchlist.\n4. Kaspa: High-Speed Network With Loyal Developer Support\nKaspa is gaining slow but steady attention. Still holding around $0.15, its predictable emissions schedule helps reduce long-term selling pressure. Recent price action suggests that if upgrades and wallet integrations continue, Kaspa could head toward $0.40.\nIf you’re looking for the best crypto for beginners with a simple structure and community backing, Kaspa has its strengths. It’s still under the radar compared to bigger projects, but its fast blockDAG tech and steady rollout of features are helping it gain traction. Long-term success will depend on whether it can stay relevant and compete for attention in a crowded space.\nFour Projects Bringing Real Potential for New Buyers\nBlockDAG, BONK, CRO, and Kaspa each offer something unique for anyone exploring the best crypto for beginners. BlockDAG leads with huge presale funding, sports-backed visibility, and a strong mining model. BONK adds high-risk, high-reward energy with its meme strength. CRO delivers real-world payment utility and strong brand presence. Kaspa, while still emerging, offers solid design and consistent development.\nOut of the four, BlockDAG is clearly the project with the most early momentum, especially with a limited-time $0.0016 entry and whispers of another U.S. deal on the way. Still, all four are worth tracking as market conditions evolve. Getting in early, with the right strategy, could make all the difference this cycle.\nPress releases or guest posts published by Crypto Economy have been submitted by companies or their representatives.

This update covers three cryptos drawing attention today.\nDogecoin’s price trend is showing bullish signals, staying above important support levels as whale holdings continue to increase. Similarly, Hedera’s price forecast is positive, with a possible breakout if it crosses the $0.19 resistance.\nAt the same time, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making headlines in the presale market. It has revealed a new sports partnership with the Seattle Orcas, a well-known Major League Cricket (MLC) team. Having raised over $333.5 million so far, many believe this partnership could accelerate BDAG’s global growth. Let’s find out Which of these cryptos could lead your Q3 list.\nDogecoin (DOGE) Price Trend Suggests Breakout Ahead\nThe Dogecoin (DOGE) price trend is holding well above the $0.13 support, a level tested many times this year without failure, indicating strong demand. The chart pattern is shaping a falling wedge, which usually points to an upcoming bullish breakout.\nWhale accumulation is another positive factor for Dogecoin. Wallets holding 1 million to 100 million DOGE are increasing, while smaller wallets are decreasing, showing big players are gearing up. Large transactions worth over $100K and even $1 million have picked up, suggesting major holders expect DOGE to move higher soon.\nHedera (HBAR) Price Forecast Eyes $0.19 Resistance Break\nHedera (HBAR) has faced ups and downs in 2025. After touching nearly $0.40 in January, the price dipped as weak market sentiment and global issues impacted trading. In April, things turned around as HBAR broke a falling wedge pattern with support from a broader market rally, leading to an almost 80% rise from $0.125 to $0.228 by mid-May. Later, renewed uncertainty caused the price to fall back.\nHowever, strong support levels have stayed intact, hinting that buyers are still active. The current Hedera price forecast depends on breaking the $0.19 resistance. If this happens, analysts expect it could rise further towards the $0.23 target zone.\nBlockDAG Secures Major Seattle Orcas Partnership\nIn another major move for its global goals, BlockDAG has signed a sports partnership with the Seattle Orcas, a leading team in Major League Cricket (MLC). Cricket has over 2.5 billion fans worldwide, making this an effective way to reach a massive audience.\nAs the Orcas’ Official Blockchain Partner for 2025, BlockDAG will share co-branded content, exclusive player videos, match highlights, predictions, and behind-the-scenes clips that fans rarely see. This collaboration comes just as the Orcas achieved back-to-back wins, first chasing down a record 238 runs against MI New York on June 28 and then defeating the LA Knight Riders the following day. These wins have put the team back in playoff talks.\nMore than just marketing, this deal shows fans how blockchain can fit into things they already follow and enjoy. BlockDAG’s presale has already collected over $336 million, selling more than 23.7 billion coins. Currently, BDAG is priced at $0.0016 in Batch 29, available until August 11th before its GLOBAL LAUNCH.\nEarly buyers have already seen a 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. With its launch price set at $0.05, this offers a potential 3,025% return from current levels. Some experts see BlockDAG as the top crypto about to explode, with predictions aiming as high as $20 by 2027.\nThe Next Crypto About to Explode in 2025?\nDogecoin’s price trend shows strength with rising whale holdings and a falling wedge suggesting a breakout above $0.13. Hedera’s positive price forecast depends on its ability to break above $0.19, opening room for $0.23.\nHowever, for those watching the next crypto about to explode, BlockDAG is standing out. With its presale entry price at just $0.0016 until August 11th and a confirmed launch price of $0.05, early holders are looking at a 3,025% potential return. Its Seattle Orcas partnership could help drive mainstream adoption by connecting with cricket’s massive fan base, and early buyers have already enjoyed 2,660% growth since the first batch.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nPress releases or guest posts published by Crypto Economy have been submitted by companies or their representatives.

It’s the sheer unpredictability, viral potential, and record-breaking gains. In 2024, meme coins saw astronomical growth, with some tokens multiplying portfolios overnight. As 2025 unfolds, new meme coins are launching with even more aggressive features: limited supply, community-first models, and stealth-mode staking benefits. This surge has created a perfect storm for those looking to catch the next breakout star before it makes headlines.\nAmong the most anticipated is MoonBull ($MOBU), a new coin launch in 2025 that’s generating significant buzz for its exclusivity-driven whitelist and rewards model.

It’s a high-stakes opportunity for traders chasing asymmetric upside. For those watching the new coin launch in 2025 market, MoonBull is the ticket to early access that could rewrite ROI expectations.\nWhy MoonBull made this list: As a new coin launch in 2025, MoonBull offers rare whitelist-only benefits and is purpose-built for explosive upside.\n2. Degen ($DEGEN)\nDegen ($DEGEN) is a pure meme coin with a bold community-first strategy. It thrives on chaotic market behavior and embodies the risk-taking attitude of the degen trading world.

{"title": "Presale Meltdown Coming: Arctic Pablo’s 1,602% ROI Window Is Slamming Shut as Trump Coin and Snek Surge Ahead", "url": "https://crypto-economy.com/presale-meltdown-coming-arctic-pablos-1602-roi-window-is-slamming-shut-as-trump-coin-and-snek-surge-ahead/", "text": "What if the next 20X crypto was quietly climbing stages while everyone chased hype? Could today’s forgotten presale be tomorrow’s millionaire-maker? In a digital gold rush where every scroll brings a new opportunity, only a few hold life-changing upside.\nThe official Trump Coin has just crossed $10, igniting trader enthusiasm across meme-friendly markets. Meanwhile, Snek nearly hit the $1 milestone, proving its meme roots can still charm the blockchain. However, neither may offer the explosive window that is currently open with Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) — a meme project that shatters expectations and breaks presale records.\nWith the 31st phase — Frigid Fortress — underway and over $2.91M already raised, the clock is ticking. Arctic Pablo Coin is among the Best crypto coins to buy, and missing it now could be like watching gold turn to ice. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Trump Coin, and Snek.\nScarcity in Motion: Arctic Pablo’s Deflationary Firestorm\nArctic Pablo Coin ($APC) introduces a unique twist — a weekly token burn system that permanently removes unclaimed tokens during its presale. Not only does this elevate scarcity, but it also creates genuine economic pressure, ensuring that each token becomes increasingly valuable over time. And here’s the kicker: Are there any leftovers after the presale? Gone too.\nEach burn transaction is transparently recorded on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), reinforcing the project’s commitment to investor trust and blockchain immutability. The approach screams long-term thinking — not pump-and-dump mechanics. This calculated deflationary mechanism places Arctic Pablo Coin among the Best crypto coins to buy now, as value is programmed to rise, not dilute. How many meme coins can you name that reward holders simply by reducing supply?\nFortress is Cracking: The Final Presale Window Is Narrowing\nArctic Pablo’s meme coin presale has reached critical mass, raising over $2.91 million, and now offers a price of just $0.00047 per token. With a future listing price of $0.008, the projected ROI from this stage sits at a staggering 1,602%. Imagine turning $1,000 into $17,021.28 — not a dream, but a mathematical reality based on current metrics.\nAt this point, 2,127,660 APCs are awarded for every $1,000 invested — but the supply is dwindling. With only one shot at this icy-low price, early investors are locking in positions before the phase escalates or the window closes.\nCould Arctic Pablo be the next breakout meme token that rewards bold entries? Arctic Pablo is among the Best crypto coins to buy, and this presale might be the single most undervalued window left in 2025. Time is not your ally here — blink, and Frigid Fortress might become ancient history.\nOfficial Trump Coin Blasts Past $10 in Meme-Led Rally\nOfficial Trump (TRUMP) has taken center stage once again, surging past $10.14 with an explosive $594 million in 24-hour trading volume. Fueled by election-year momentum and its cult-like online following, TRUMP has shaken off any doubts about meme-based longevity.\nThe coin’s parabolic movement mirrors previous memecoin eras, but with a political twist that keeps eyes glued to every tweet and headline. Its community is growing fiercer, making TRUMP one of the most polarizing yet profitable tokens in the current meme economy.\nBut while it’s blazing today, how long can this rally sustain before profit-takers exit? Don’t be caught sleeping while the market’s hot — opportunity rarely knocks twice.\nSnek Coils for Breakout as Price Nears $1\nSnek — the meme coin that blends humor and high-stakes trading — is striking with venomous speed. With a live price of $0.960076 and an eye-watering $466 million in 24-hour volume, it’s inching closer to the psychological $1 barrier, where meme mania could explode even further.\nBuilt on a humorous yet powerful branding, Snek continues to ride the wave of market sentiment, driven by community memes, NFT utility talk, and aggressive social media traction. But with such heat, can it keep its momentum — or will buyers miss the strike zone?\nWhen memes bite back, hesitation becomes regret.\nFinal Verdict: One Presale, Three Titans — Only One Window Open\nFrom Trump Coin’s political charge to Snek’s venomous rise, today’s meme coin market is buzzing with life. But among all this noise, Arctic Pablo Coin is quietly delivering something different — a well-structured presale, a deflationary system built to reward, and a return potential that makes spreadsheets sweat.\nUnlike most meme tokens that chase attention after launch, Arctic Pablo is engineering its value before listing, giving early backers room to multiply their investments without relying on pure hype. That’s not common — that’s calculated.\nAs Frigid Fortress closes in, only a limited number of investors will be able to say they entered before $APC hits the main stage. Arctic Pablo is among the Best crypto coins to buy, and this might be the only chance to grab it before prices melt away and the gates freeze shut. The iceberg is moving — will your wallet follow suit?\nFor More Information:\nArctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/\nTwitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ\nFrequently Asked Questions\n- What is the current phase of the Arctic Pablo Coin presale?\nThe Arctic Pablo Coin presale is currently in its 31st phase, titled “Frigid Fortress,” with each token priced at $0.00047. - How much can people earn if they invest $1,000 in Arctic Pablo Coin now?\nAt the current presale rate, a $1,000 investment gives you 2,127,660 APC. When listed at $0.008, this could be worth $17,021.28. - Why is Arctic Pablo considered deflationary?\nArctic Pablo Coin burns unsold tokens weekly, including those from the presale and post-sale leftovers, thereby permanently reducing the supply and increasing scarcity and long-term value. - Is Arctic Pablo Coin on a major blockchain?\nYes, Arctic Pablo Coin is built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), offering transparency and scalability for transactions. - What makes Arctic Pablo one of the best crypto coins to buy?\nIts strategic presale structure, deflationary design, early-stage ROI potential, and rising momentum make Arctic Pablo Coin among the Best crypto coins to buy in 2025.\nSummary\nArctic Pablo Coin is storming through its 31st presale phase, Frigid Fortress, with unmatched hype and ROI potential. With a price of $0.00047 and a projected listing at $0.008, early buyers stand to gain over 1,600%. Weekly token burns ensure growing scarcity and lasting value. As Trump Coin and Snek experience massive trading spikes, Arctic Pablo quietly positions itself as the next breakout. With over $ 2.91 M already raised and deflationary mechanisms in place, this is more than a meme — it’s a wealth blueprint. Arctic Pablo is among the Best crypto coins to buy right now — before the frost turns golden.\nPress releases or guest posts published by Crypto Economy have been submitted by companies or their representatives.

{"title": "Troller Cat Could Turn $20K Into $180K in Presale as Best 100x Crypto While Pepe and Trump Move", "url": "https://crypto-economy.com/troller-cat-could-turn-20k-into-180k-in-presale-as-best-100x-crypto-while-pepe-and-trump-move/", "text": "Is this the moment meme coin investors have been waiting for? Over the past 24 hours, market volatility has returned. Pepe has posted a massive 15.22% surge to $0.00001274, igniting excitement among traders. Meanwhile, Official Trump has climbed 9.19%, bringing its price to $10.02, backed by rising volume.\nBut while these moves catch attention, their sustainability remains questionable. Meme coin rallies are often driven by sentiment and short-term catalysts. Pepe’s recent surge lacks foundational momentum, and Official Trump appears to be riding the wave of political hype cycles. What about long-term ROI? That’s where a quieter but stronger contender emerges.\nTroller Cat presale is gaining traction not by hype but by design. With an ROI of over 1193.2% already locked and another 721.06% projected, its presale model has captured investor interest. Its current stage channels digital absurdism through “Horse_ebooks”, offering a blend of lore, transparency, and real potential. For those hunting the best 100x crypto, it might already be here.\nTroller Cat ($TCAT): Absurdist Lore Meets Data-Backed Ascent\nThe theme of Stage 12 is inspired by Horse_ebooks, the accidental internet philosopher who posted bizarre, fragmented wisdom on Twitter. Troller Cat adopts this surreal identity, building a meme-based storyline that’s both humorous and resonant. However, behind the chaos lies a well-structured presale model, locked liquidity, and a capped token supply, all of which support long-term growth.\nStage 12 of the Troller Cat presale is fully active, with tokens priced at $0.00006466. Early buyers from Stage 1 have already seen a 1193.2% ROI, while the projected listing price of $0.0005309 opens a 721.06% opportunity for current entrants. With over $325,000 raised and more than 1,300 token holders, the numbers are no joke. A $25,000 investment today could return over $180,000 at listing.\nTroller Cat’s deflationary design and KYC-backed security audit further reinforce its reliability. While many meme tokens thrive on chaos alone, TCAT does so with purpose. It’s a satirical journey that respects investor trust. This rare balance is what positions it among the best 100x crypto projects today.\nLiquidity Blueprint and Long-Term Stability\nTroller Cat isn’t winging it when it comes to stability. A portion of funds from each presale stage is dedicated to liquidity provisioning on decentralized exchanges, ensuring a smoother transition post-listing. This strategy reduces price dumps and protects investor positions.\nMoreover, its smart contract has been audited, and liquidity will be locked, providing early investors with assurance that their capital will not be compromised by rug pulls or sudden volatility. The roadmap also outlines long-term staking pools, community games, and cross-chain expansion, reinforcing the project’s commitment to sustainable growth.\nPepe ($PEPE): Meme Momentum Fueled by Short-Term Hype\nPepe surged 15.22% in the last 24 hours, climbing to $0.00001274. Traders rushed in following heavy social media buzz and renewed interest in classic meme assets. The coin’s momentum can be attributed mainly to volume spikes and community-led promotions on major crypto forums.\nFrom a technical standpoint, Pepe has broken past resistance levels, but its support lines remain fragile. Unless this momentum is matched by development activity or long-term utility announcements, such spikes may be short-lived. The coin is heavily reliant on meme cycles, which means investors need to time their entries and exits very carefully.\nFor all its excitement, Pepe lacks a clear roadmap or strategic ecosystem. Beginners looking for calculated upside may find it difficult to gauge entry positions or make long-term commitments. It’s a fun coin to trade, but not a structured play in today’s evolving meme economy.\nOfficial Trump ($TRUMP): Politically Driven, Volatile Momentum\nOfficial Trump saw a 9.19% rise in the last 24 hours, bringing its token price to $10.02. This pump aligns with increased trading volume and ongoing speculative chatter linked to real-world headlines. As usual, this politically themed token benefits from visibility during election seasons and major political events.\nChart patterns reveal a breakout past the $9.60 resistance, with next levels anticipated around $10.40. However, large sell orders and tight resistance above that mark could cap further gains unless volume accelerates. There’s also minimal news around project development or token utility, raising concerns over sustainability.\nThe Trump token appeals to a niche audience and remains polarizing. While it often experiences quick gains, its performance depends heavily on external cycles rather than internal development. This introduces unpredictability, making it less attractive for those seeking strategic exposure to the best 100x crypto candidates.\nConclusion\nBased on our research and market trends, Troller Cat emerges as the best 100x crypto opportunity among its peers. While Pepe and Official Trump ride temporary momentum, Troller Cat is rooted in a data-backed roadmap, lore-rich narrative, and deflationary mechanics.\nIts current 721.06% upside projection, combined with liquidity planning, security measures, and a vibrant community, makes it a more grounded and scalable choice. Stage 13 is around the corner with a 30% price jump, making timing crucial for new entrants.\nDon’t just chase the noise. Stake your claim early in Troller Cat and ride its presale ascent.\nFor More Information:\nWebsite: https://www.trollercat.io/\nBuy Now: https://www.trollercat.io/buy-now/\nFAQs\n- What is the current price of Troller Cat?\n- $0.00006466 in Stage 12 of the presale.\n- What’s the projected ROI from current price to listing?\n- 721.06% based on the listing price of $0.0005309.\n- How much has been raised in the presale?\n- Over $325,000 across more than 1,300 holders.\n- What makes Troller Cat different from other meme coins?\n- A unique mix of lore, deflationary tokenomics, audit transparency, and community strategy.\n- Can I still invest before the next stage?\n- Yes, but Stage 13 comes with a 30% price hike, so urgency matters.\nGlossary of Key Terms\n- Presale Stage: A structured pricing period preceding the public listing.\n- ROI: Return on Investment, or profit percentage.\n- Deflationary Tokenomics: Supply-reducing model that increases value over time.\n- Liquidity Lock: A Mechanism that prevents fund withdrawals to build trust.\n- KYC: Know Your Customer, a process for identity verification.\n- Resistance Level: A price point where upward movement tends to stall.\n- Volatility: Degree of fluctuation in price.\nPress releases or guest posts published by Crypto Economy have been submitted by companies or their representatives.

{"title": "Options Market Hints at Caution as Bitcoin Eyes $120K", "url": "https://crypto-economy.com/options-market-hints-at-caution-as-bitcoin-eyes-120k/", "text": "TL;DR\n- Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $118,000, but the options market signals caution with a Put/Call ratio of 1.06.\n- Deribit places the “max pain” point at $108,000, while the rise in bearish contracts and extreme leverage increases technical pressure in derivatives.\n- The spot market remains solid, although the gap between bullish spot sentiment and bearish option expectations hints at a potential correction or short squeeze.\nBitcoin reached a new all-time high of $118,000 today, but the derivatives market has started flashing multiple warning signals.\nOptions expiring today have a notional value of $4.3 billion and hold a Put/Call ratio of 1.06. This indicates a higher number of put (sell) contracts in circulation compared to calls (buy), suggesting that a significant portion of traders expects a pullback in the coming days.\nData from Deribit places the “max pain” point at $108,000 — the level at which the largest number of option buyers would lose capital at expiry. This figure is key because it establishes a pressure point for the market as expiry approaches, potentially shaping short-term price action.\nMeanwhile, derivatives analytics platforms are noting a surge in extreme leverage. Greeks.Live reported trades with margins up to 500x — a strategy that multiplies risk in a highly volatile environment. Although these positions represent a minority, their very existence reflects the speculative tone dominating the market. Despite repeated warnings, aggressive strategies aiming to capture quick moves continue to emerge, amplifying both potential gains and losses.\nA Divided Market: Overbought and Prepping for a Pullback\nThe spot market shows resilience, but the disparity between the optimism of spot traders and the caution evident in options reveals a divided landscape. The rise of the Put/Call ratio above 1 aligns with previous overbought episodes, where options acted as hedges against corrections after price rallies.\nThe buildup of open interest at elevated levels and the concentration of bearish positions create a technically tense scenario. If Bitcoin extends its rally, these derivatives could trigger forced short liquidations. If instead the price retreats, the leverage exposure of traders could heighten volatility.\nThe market faces a decisive moment, where the excitement of record highs coexists with technical signals urging caution. The next few days will determine whether bullish momentum continues or if positions get adjusted ahead of a new consolidation phase.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 19:03:28 +0000", "author": "Guido Battigelli", "source": "https://crypto-economy.com/feed/"}
