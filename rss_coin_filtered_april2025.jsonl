The cascade was fueled by high leverage exposure, creating a domino effect of forced selling across exchanges.\nBitcoin’s sharp drop erased more than $3,000 in value within hours, pulling major altcoins into the red. ETH fell nearly 5%, while Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) each dropped 4–5%.\nXRP tested the critical $3 support level, underscoring the market-wide fragility. Interestingly, Chainlink (LINK) bucked the trend, posting a daily 5% gain despite the turmoil.\nEthereum Faces a Liquidation Cliff\nEthereum appears particularly vulnerable if its price breaks below $4,200. Data from Hyperdash shows that more than 56,000 ETH long positions, worth about $236 million, sit at risk of liquidation near $4,170.\nAdditional liquidation clusters are positioned around $3,940 and $2,150–$2,160, levels that could amplify volatility if triggered.\nAndrew Kang, founder of Mechanism Capital, warned that ETH could fall as low as $3,600 if the liquidation cascade continues. He added that overall ETH liquidations across exchanges could reach $5 billion, potentially driving prices even lower before stabilizing.\nETH's price losing momentum on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview\nBitcoin Whale Accumulation or General Market Breakdown?\nDespite the sell-off, some analysts argue the crash may be setting up a whale accumulation phase.\nCrypto analyst CrypNuevo noted that Bitcoin recently printed a new all-time high before a sudden $1 billion liquidation event, a move he believes was engineered to flush out retail traders. He suggested that one whale absorbed much of the forced selling, signaling that institutional players may be scooping up BTC at discounted prices.\nIf whales are indeed accumulating, the dip could serve as a springboard for the next rally once leveraged positions reset and selling pressure eases. However, with geopolitical uncertainty and fragile support levels, traders should remain cautious.\nThe coming days will determine whether Bitcoin stabilizes above $115,000 and Ethereum holds $4,200, or if another wave of liquidations drags the market deeper into correction.\nCover image from ChatGPT, ETHUSD chart from Tradingview", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 23:00:48 +0000", "author": "James Halver", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/ethereum/feed/"}
{"title": "Ethereum Foundation Wallet Sells Over 7,000 ETH: Smart Money Taking Profits?", "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-foundation-wallet-7294-eth-smart-money/", "text": "Ethereum has been in the spotlight lately after reaching its highest levels since November 2021, showcasing remarkable resilience following weeks of massive price surges. The rally has drawn intense debate across the market, with analysts divided on Ethereum’s next move. Some argue that a deeper correction is inevitable after such an aggressive run, while others believe ETH is primed for a massive breakout above its all-time highs.\nOn-chain data continues to add fuel to the discussion. According to Lookonchain, the Ethereum Foundation-linked wallet 0xF39d sold 7,294 ETH, worth approximately $33.25 million, over the past three days. The average selling price was $4,558, a level that highlights confidence in taking profits as ETH consolidates just below major resistance. Notably, this same wallet has a history of timing the market well, having accumulated 33,678 ETH at just $1,193 back in June 2022.\nDespite this selling activity, bulls remain optimistic, pointing to strong institutional demand and record inflows into Ethereum ETFs as drivers of continued upside. As ETH holds firm near critical resistance, the coming weeks could define whether the market faces a healthy correction—or prepares for a surge into uncharted territory.\nSmart Money Moves Around Ethereum\nEthereum’s latest price action has been accompanied by significant on-chain activity, and one wallet in particular has caught the attention of analysts. According to Lookonchain, the Ethereum Foundation-linked address 0xF39d has built a reputation as a remarkably strategic trader. Back in June 2022, when the market was deep in a bearish phase, this wallet accumulated 33,678 ETH, worth about $40.2 million, at an average entry price of just $1,193. That move alone highlighted the long-term conviction and precise timing often attributed to institutional-grade market participants.\nFast forward to today, and the same wallet recently sold over 7,000 ETH near the $4,500 mark, capturing massive profits. This kind of activity underscores the role of “smart money” in shaping Ethereum’s market cycles, often positioning ahead of broader trends. The timing of these sales has stirred debate, particularly as ETH hovers below its 2021 highs and analysts remain divided on the broader outlook.\nFor some, these transactions signal caution, suggesting that Ethereum may be nearing the end of its current cycle as profit-taking intensifies. Others argue the opposite: that despite short-term volatility, ETH is in the early stages of a bullish phase fueled by institutional inflows, ETF adoption, and diminishing supply on exchanges.\nIn this environment of volatility and uncertainty, wallets like 0xF39d serve as key reference points, offering a glimpse into how experienced players are navigating Ethereum’s complex price structure. Whether this marks a local top or simply a pause before further gains remains one of the most pressing questions in the market.\nETH Price Action Analysis: Testing Support\nEthereum’s daily chart highlights its strong rally, followed by the recent retrace from multi-year highs near $4,800. After a steep climb through July and early August, ETH is now consolidating around the $4,420 level. Despite this pullback, the broader structure remains bullish.\nThe 50-day moving average (blue line) continues to trend upward, providing dynamic support near $3,480. Meanwhile, the 100-day (green) and 200-day (red) moving averages sit much lower at $3,012 and $2,564 respectively, showing how extended this move has been. ETH remains well above these long-term averages, confirming that bulls still control momentum.\nThe retrace resembles a healthy correction, allowing the market to digest gains and reset before the next move higher. If ETH holds above the $4,200–$4,300 zone, this level could act as a strong base for another push toward the $4,800–$5,000 resistance.\nOn the downside, a break below $4,200 could open the way toward the $3,800–$3,900 support area, aligning with the rising moving averages. Overall, ETH remains in a bullish trend, with corrections looking more like pauses than reversals.\nFeatured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView", "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 19:30:01 +0000", "author": "Sebastian Villafuerte", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/ethereum/feed/"}

Despite the downturn, analysts say Trump’s concentrated ETH bet signals confidence in the asset’s long-term strength.\nTrump’s pivot aligns with broader institutional adoption of Ethereum. In 2025, Ethereum-based ETFs absorbed more than 500,000 ETH in a single month, surpassing new issuance since the Merge.\nThis scarcity effect has fueled expectations of higher valuations, with Standard Chartered recently raising its ETH target price to $7,500. Some analysts even forecast $12,000 over the next five years if adoption trends continue.\nInstitutional Inflows and Whale Activity Drive Ethereum (ETH) Demand\nEthereum remains the backbone of DeFi, commanding over 78% of total value locked in Q2 2025. However, this dominance comes with risks. Leveraged whale strategies and large-scale withdrawals have exposed liquidity weaknesses in the ecosystem.\nA 300,000 ETH withdrawal in July pushed Ethereum’s staking exit queue to 13 days, highlighting the network’s fragility under stress.\nSimilarly, whales are accumulating on Ethereum (ETH). A single investor boosted holdings to over 76,000 ETH, valued at $342 million, while Ethereum co-founder Jeffrey Wilcke recently transferred nearly 10,000 ETH to Kraken.\nETH's price hit critical resistance on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview\nAnalysts See a Buying Window for Ethereum\nWhile Ethereum faces technical resistance around $4,000–$4,400, its structural strength remains intact. Analysts believe that ETH’s deflationary mechanics, Layer-2 scaling, and institutional inflows position it for a strong recovery once market sentiment stabilizes.\nTrump’s aggressive ETH allocation is also being interpreted as a political and financial statement. His policy moves, such as expanding 401(k) eligibility for crypto, could accelerate mainstream adoption.\nFor investors, the increased regulatory support and growing institutional demand indicate that the current dip might be a smart buying opportunity instead of a cause for concern.\nWhether Trump’s bold bet pays off could depend on how Ethereum weathers its leverage and security risks, but analysts agree the long-term trajectory remains bullish.\nCover image from ChatGPT, ETHUSD chart from Tradingview", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 19:00:01 +0000", "author": "James Halver", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/ethereum/feed/"}
{"title": "Ethereum Floods Exchanges As Bitcoin Remains Unshaken: Market Braces For Volatility", "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-floods-exchanges-bitcoin-remains-unshaken/", "text": "Ethereum is navigating renewed volatility after weeks of relentless gains and bullish momentum. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency surged to its highest levels in years, but bulls are now locked in a battle to defend the $4,200 mark. This price point has emerged as a crucial short-term support, with institutional buyers continuing to accumulate ETH despite recent turbulence in broader markets.\nWhat stands out in this phase is Ethereum’s exchange inflow activity compared to Bitcoin. Over the past month, the two assets have displayed sharply different patterns. While Bitcoin’s inflows have remained relatively moderate, signaling stability and limited selling pressure, Ethereum has seen a significant uptick in coins moving onto exchanges.\nThis divergence suggests a more dynamic market structure for Ethereum. Rising inflows could indicate profit-taking by long-term holders, or repositioning by large investors preparing for volatility or upcoming catalysts in the ETH ecosystem. Still, institutional interest, alongside strengthening fundamentals such as declining supply on exchanges, continues to support Ethereum’s long-term outlook. Traders now watch closely to see if ETH can hold $4,200 and stabilize for another leg higher.\nBitcoin vs. Ethereum: Divergence in Exchange Inflows\nAccording to on-chain data from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are showing a clear divergence in exchange inflows, signaling very different dynamics at play in the market. Bitcoin inflows have remained moderate, fluctuating between 12,000 and 70,000 BTC per day.\nWhile there have been brief spikes in mid-July and around August 1st, these movements have not persisted long enough to suggest a broader trend. This steadiness implies that BTC holders are not rushing to exchanges, which reduces immediate selling pressure. It also reinforces the idea that sentiment around Bitcoin remains relatively stable despite recent volatility in price action.\nEthereum, however, is telling a different story. Over the past several weeks, ETH inflows have surged significantly, with daily exchange inflows repeatedly climbing above 2 million ETH in mid-August and peaking near 2.6 million ETH. This marks a sharp increase compared to late July, when inflows often sat below 1.5 million ETH.\nSuch elevated activity suggests large-scale repositioning among major holders or increased profit-taking following ETH’s strong rally. The data highlights that Ethereum is entering a more active trading phase, potentially introducing short-term selling pressure that could influence price direction.\nThe divergence is striking: Bitcoin inflows suggest relative calm, while Ethereum inflows signal heightened market activity. This imbalance means traders should watch ETH closely, as sustained exchange inflows could either spark a corrective pullback or serve as a stepping stone for a renewed rally, depending on how the market digests the additional liquidity.\nTechnical Details: Key Price Levels\nEthereum’s recent price action shows a notable retracement following weeks of strong bullish momentum. After peaking near $4,790, ETH has pulled back to around $4,272, reflecting an 11% decline. This move has brought the price back toward a critical support zone at $4,200, where bulls are currently attempting to defend against further downside pressure.\nThe chart highlights that Ethereum remains well above its key moving averages (50, 100, and 200-day), which are all trending upward and reinforcing a broader bullish structure. Despite the sharp retracement, the longer-term trend still favors buyers, as ETH has maintained higher highs and higher lows since its reversal earlier this year.\nA breakdown below $4,200 zone could open the door to $3,800–$3,900, while a successful defense could set the stage for another attempt at the $4,800–$5,000 region. Overall, Ethereum’s chart continues to show bullish strength, though volatility remains high.\nFeatured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 21:00:43 +0000", "author": "Sebastian Villafuerte", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/ethereum/feed/"}
{"title": "Ethereum Outflows Top $888-M As Binance And Coinbase Balances Shrink", "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-outflows-top-888m-binance-coinbase-shrink/", "text": "Ethereum (ETH) trades above the $4,400 price mark following a rather eventful market week. Although CoinMarketCap data reports the altcoin notched up a net weekly gain of 4.21%, a sharp 7.14% pullback toward the end of the week has dampened sentiment, introducing a more cautious undertone. With ETH now consolidating in a sideways range, crypto analyst Amr Taha has outlined both short and long-term market outlooks, drawing on recent exchange flows and futures market activity.\nBearish Funding Rates Vs. Bullish On-Chain Flows: Ethereum At A Crossroads\nIn a recent QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, Taha provides valuable insight into the price trajectory of Ethereum as both futures market positioning and exchange balances are undergoing significant changes. In studying recent developments in the derivative markets, the crypto expert observes a 29% decline in Open Interest over the past two days, following a drop in ETH prices from above $4,700 to below $4,400, which suggests that traders are rapidly closing or liquidating positions amid market turbulence.\nAdding to the bearish atmosphere, perpetual futures funding rates turned negative across major exchanges. Negative funding rates occur when short positions dominate, meaning traders are paying to maintain bearish bets. While this reflects prevailing pessimism, Amr Taha states that history shows that such extremes often coincide with oversold conditions and can precede a rebound if other bullish catalysts emerge.\nAmid this derivative market situation, spot market data paints a different picture. In recent days, Taha explains that 200,000 ETH, worth approximately $888 million, were withdrawn from major centralized exchanges. Coinbase saw an outflow of 128,000 ETH, while Binance recorded 72,000 ETH leaving its platform.\nGenerally, large-scale exchange withdrawals are often interpreted as a bullish signal. When investors remove funds from trading platforms, they typically move them into cold storage wallets for multiple reasons, such as long-term holding or staking, which signals confidence in future price appreciation. There are also instances where institutions move their assets off exchanges to perform over-the-counter (OTC) transactions.\nThis dual narrative, i.e., bearish derivatives activity and bullish spot outflows, highlights Ethereum’s complex short-term outlook. On one hand, negative funding rates and collapsing open interest indicate traders are cautious, expecting further downside in the near term. On the other hand, shrinking exchange balances reduce immediate selling pressure, creating conditions that could support a strong price floor.\nInterestingly, Amr Taha also notes that similar waves of ETH withdrawals from exchanges have preceded notable rallies, as reduced exchange liquidity tightens supply, indicating potential for a long-term price rally.\nETH Price Overview\nAt press time, Ethereum trades at $4,446, reflecting a 0.19% gain in the past day. Notably, investors’ attention remains heavily on the 4,400 support level in the coming sessions. A decisive bounce could validate the view that Ethereum is oversold, while sustained weakness may see ETH retest lower zones before a potential recovery.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 00:00:33 +0000", "author": "Semilore Faleti", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/ethereum/feed/"}
{"title": "Bitmine And Donald Trump Spent The Weekend Stacking Ethereum, Here’s How Much They Got", "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/donald-trump-stacking-ethereum/", "text": "On-chain data shows that Tom Lee’s BitMine and Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI) have been buying the dip amid the recent Ethereum price crash. Both companies spent almost $140 million buying ETH as they doubled down on their bet on the largest altcoin by market cap.\nBitMine And Donald Trump’s WLFI Buy The Dip\nAccording to on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain, BitMine bought 106,485 ETH ($470.51 million) on August 15 as the Ethereum price crashed from its 2025 high of $4,500. Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s WLFI bought 1,911 ETH ($8.6 million) during the same period. BitMine now holds 1.3 million ETH ($5.75 billion) for its Ethereum treasury.\nNotably, BitMine has been on a buying spree. Just before the $470 million purchase, the company had bought 28,649 ETH, worth around $129.88 million. Tom Lee’s firm made these purchases through Galaxy Digital’s OTC. Two days earlier, it had also purchased $158.47 million in ETH, according to Arkham data.\nBitMine is currently the largest Ethereum treasury company, way ahead of the second-placed SharpLink, which holds 728,800 ETH ($3.16 billion). Tom Lee’s company has declared their intention to hold at least 5% of ETH’s total supply and has filed a $20 billion stock offering to advance this strategy.\nLike BitMine, Donald Trump’s WLFI is another whale that is bullish on Ethereum. Following the recent WLFI purchase, Donald Trump’s son Eric Trump again encouraged everyone to buy the dip. In February earlier this year, he opined that it was a great time to buy ETH when it was trading at around $2,800.\nEthereum then suffered several pullbacks, during which Donald Trump’s son doubled down on urging everyone to buy ETH. The largest altcoin by market cap has since faced a resurgence over the last 90 days, and is up over 66% during this period. The altcoin is up 27% year-to-date (YTD).\nOther Whales Are Buying ETH\nBesides Tom Lee’s BitMine and Donald Trump’s WLFI, other whales are accumulating Ethereum during this downtrend. Lookonchain drew attention to a “mysterious institution” that has been buying ETH.

{"title": "Ethereum Whale Activity Surges: $280M Purchased In 24 Hours", "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-whale-activity-surges-280m-purchased-24/", "text": "Ethereum has entered the spotlight once again after reaching a multi-year high above $4,790, only to retrace toward critical demand levels. The move highlights ongoing volatility as bulls remain patient, waiting for a breakout beyond the $4,900 level, a threshold that would push ETH into uncharted price territory. While the retracement may seem like a pause, market structure still favors strength, with higher lows forming and momentum shifting toward accumulation.\nWhat makes the current setup even more compelling is the surge in whale activity. Arkham Intelligence data revealed that three new whale addresses collectively purchased $279.5 million worth of ETH in just the past 24 hours. These transactions underscore confidence from deep-pocketed players at a moment when Ethereum is consolidating below key resistance. Such large-scale accumulation typically signals expectations of further upside, aligning with growing optimism that ETH could soon break above its historic ceiling.\nWith supply on exchanges continuing to decline and institutional demand rising, Ethereum’s next move carries weight for the broader altcoin market. Traders and investors alike will be watching closely, as the convergence of whale accumulation and technical resilience suggests that Ethereum could be on the verge of another explosive phase.\nEthereum Whale Accumulation Deepens As Bitmine Expands Holdings\nEthereum’s bullish narrative continues to strengthen as whale activity accelerates. Arkham’s AI has linked the latest wave of ETH purchases to Bitmine, raising questions about whether strategist Tom Lee is doubling down on Ethereum exposure. Bitmine’s total ETH holdings are a staggering 1.174 million ETH, valued at around $5.26 billion at current prices.\nThis scale of accumulation places Bitmine among the most influential players in the Ethereum ecosystem, with its wallet activity now drawing comparisons to major institutional participants. The timing of these buys is especially significant, arriving as ETH consolidates just below the $4,900 mark, with bulls watching closely for a breakout into uncharted price territory.\nWhat’s more, this accumulation trend aligns with moves from companies like Sharplink Gaming, which have also been positioning aggressively into Ethereum. The shift highlights a broader pattern: institutional actors are increasingly viewing ETH as a long-term strategic asset, not just a speculative play.\nAdding further fuel to the bullish outlook, exchange supply is drying up while OTC desks report running out of Ethereum. This supply squeeze is historically a precursor to major rallies, as demand from whales and institutions collides with reduced availability. If these dynamics persist, Ethereum may be entering one of its most explosive phases yet, with whale behavior acting as the clearest signal of confidence.\nETH Holds $4,400 After Sharp Decline\nEthereum’s 4-hour chart highlights a healthy pullback from the recent peak near $4,790, with the price now consolidating around $4,414. This decline comes after a strong multi-week rally, suggesting that the move is more of a cooldown phase rather than a full trend reversal.\nThe 50-period SMA at $4,407 is now acting as immediate support, making this level a critical short-term battleground. If bulls can defend it, momentum could quickly shift back toward the $4,600–$4,800 resistance area, where ETH was recently rejected. A confirmed breakout above $4,900 would validate bullish strength and set the stage for fresh all-time highs.\nOn the downside, the 100-SMA ($4,025) and 200-SMA ($3,822) remain deeper support zones that could absorb stronger selling pressure if the $4,400 area fails. Importantly, trading volume shows heavy activity during the rally followed by lower participation during the retrace, implying sellers are not in full control.\nOverall, Ethereum remains in an uptrend, but the current consolidation will determine its next leg. Holding above $4,400 keeps bulls in control, while a drop below could trigger a short-term correction before the uptrend resumes. This makes the coming sessions pivotal for ETH’s trajectory.\nFeatured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView", "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 16:30:11 +0000", "author": "Sebastian Villafuerte", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/ethereum/feed/"}

This has raised questions about what it could mean for the altcoin season, since ETH usually leads the way during that period.\nEthereum Falls Behind Solana In Perp Volume\nDeFiLlama data shows that Ethereum fell behind Solana in perp volume by chains on August 14. The former recorded a perp volume of $2.667 billion while the latter recorded a perp volume of $2.989 billion during this period. However, Ethereum has quickly reclaimed its position above Solana to rank second behind Hyperliquid over the last two days.\nFurther data shows that Ethereum recorded $2.22 billion in perp volume on August 15, while Solana saw $1.635 billion in volume. Meanwhile, Ethereum hit $2.22 billion again in perp volume on August 16 while Solana’s volume stood at $1.635. Over the last 30 days, ETH is also well ahead of Solana, with the former recording a $61.067 billion volume while the latter hit $44.406 billion in perp volume.\nFurthermore, Ethereum ranks number one in terms of decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, above Solana. The former’s DEX volume in the last 24 hours stands at $4.817 billion, while the latter’s stands at $3.869 billion. Over the last 30 days, ETH has also recorded the most DEX volume, hitting $123.513 billion, while Solana hit $114.681 billion.\nEthereum’s lead in these major metrics coincides with the resurgence of its native coin, ETH. The largest altcoin by market cap is up over 33% in the last 30 days and 78% in the last 90 days. Solana is up just 10% and 11% during these periods, respectively. This suggests that ETH is still likely to lead the altcoin season when it finally happens, with its dominance notably rising against Bitcoin’s.\nAltcoin Season Is Coming, And ETH Is Driving It\nIn an X post, Coinbase declared that the altcoin season is coming and suggested that Ethereum is the major catalyst behind the altcoin season. The exchange noted that as September approaches, the transition to a full-scale altcoin season is likely. They added that this positive outlook stems from macro trends such as potential Fed rate cuts and expected regulatory advancements.\nRegarding Ethereum’s role, Coinbase stated that institutional interest in ETH is driving the altcoin season at the moment. This interest is fueled by digital asset treasuries like BitMine and stablecoin narratives. The exchange added that the divergence in the altcoin season index and total altcoin market cap reflects rising institutional interest in ETH.\nAt the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $4,400 while Solana is at $188, both down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.", "published": "Sat, 16 Aug 2025 18:00:07 +0000", "author": "Scott Matherson", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/ethereum/feed/"}

Instead of celebrating, some experts warn it would reveal deep cracks in the US economy.\nGalaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said in a recent podcast that such a price surge wouldn’t be a victory but a warning sign.\nHe explained that the crypto could only reach that level if the country is facing severe economic distress.\n“I’d rather have a lower Bitcoin price in a more stable United States than the opposite,” he said, stressing that sudden currency collapses often come at a heavy social cost.\nBitcoin Seen As A Crisis Hedge\nWhen national currencies weaken, investors often turn to Bitcoin, calling it “digital gold.” That’s why Novogratz believes a skyrocketing BTC price would be tied to instability.\nHis comments echo remarks from crypto analyst Wolf Of All Streets, who said last year that if BTC moves too fast, it likely means the world is in trouble.\nStories and lessons from a decade in crypto with Mike @Novogratz.\nWe talk about $GLXY, the 80,000 bitcoin transaction, whether Mike has any investing regrets, maxis and altcoin communities, Bitcoin’s roadmap to $1 million and much more.\nTimecodes:\n00:00 Meet Mike Novogratz:… pic.twitter.com/4HrOi1juE5— Natalie Brunell ⚡️ (@natbrunell) August 12, 2025\nStill, not all predictions are gloomy. Cathie Wood of ARK Invest believes Bitcoin could hit as high as $1.5 million by 2030. Even her lower estimates land in the hundreds of thousands, with the forecast tied to growing institutional demand and the crypto’s limited supply.\nReports show that BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes expects Bitcoin to climb between $750,000 and $1 million by 2026, while Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor recently said that “Winter is not coming back,” and he went as far as saying that if Bitcoin is not going to zero it could reach $1 million.\nConcerns Over US Debt\nNovogratz also voiced frustration with how the government is handling debt. He said US President Donald Trump’s choice of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hasn’t produced the results many expected. According to him, debt-to-GDP remains unaddressed and the US deficit is set to rise, not shrink.\nThat fiscal outlook has added to investor anxiety. Market watchers believe rising debt and deficits could weaken confidence in the dollar, fueling demand for Bitcoin.\nBut Novogratz warned against cheering too loudly, suggesting the long-term costs of such a shift could outweigh the short-term price excitement.\nTreasury Adoption Sparks Worries\nAnother point of concern for Novogratz is the growing number of companies adopting Bitcoin for their treasuries. He revealed Galaxy Digital is now receiving around five calls a week from businesses wanting to put BTC on their balance sheets. To him, this surge feels more like a frenzy than steady adoption.\nFor Novogratz, the warning is clear: Bitcoin at $1 million wouldn’t mean triumph. It would mean the US economy is in a fragile and dangerous place.\nFeatured image from BCB Group, chart from TradingView", "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 18:00:46 +0000", "author": "Christian Encila", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/bitcoin/feed/"}

He gave Bitcoin a 30% chance of having already topped in this cycle and suggested a pullback to about $60,000–$70,000 by November 2026 could come before a later major rally toward $500,000.\nI think there is a 30% chance that BTC has topped for this bull market cycle.

Track ETF and institutional inflows, exchange balances, and derivatives data.\nA steady stream of institutional buying would make a long, deep retrace less likely. On the flip side, sustained outflows, rising exchange inventory, or heavy derivative liquidations would strengthen the case for a larger pullback toward the $60k–$70k zone.\nHas Bitcoin Already Peaked?\nBrandt’s estimate — a 30% chance BTC has already peaked and a possible slide to $60,000–$70,000 by November 2026 before a later push toward $500,000 — gives traders a concrete downside scenario to factor into position sizing and risk plans.\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView", "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 00:00:25 +0000", "author": "Christian Encila", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/bitcoin/feed/"}

This has also come with the formation of multiple bullish patterns on the Bitcoin price chart that lend credence to predictions that a new all-time high is on the horizon.\nBull Flags Put Bitcoin At New All-Time Highs\nCrypto analyst Madden shared an interesting development on the Bitcoin price chart after its recent rally. This analysis focused on the recent break that has now ended the long-standing consolidation that points toward a continuation of the rally. Additionally, the analyst also outlined the possible next steps for the Bitcoin price and where it could end up.\nOne of the most notable things that has happened during this time is that the price was able to retest and break out of the channel above $117,000. As Madden explains, this retest and break have now led to the creation of a possible bull flag, and this could point to a further price surge.\nThere is also the fact that there is now a rising blue diagonal line from the previous support, suggesting higher lows for the Bitcoin price. Then again, a bullish cross could possibly be on the horizon. This is forming in the MACD-indicator that suggests that bears will continue to lose their hold on the market.\nTaking all of these developments into account and adding in the fact that Bitcoin is now forming a textbook bull flag, the most likely outcome from here is that the cryptocurrency will see a possible 10% increase to notch new peaks.\nHow High Can The Bull Flags Take The BTC Price?\nThree bull flags are highlighted in the chart that could see the Bitcoin price hit new all-time high after all-time high. The first bull flag is at the $127,500 level that would signal the first continuation of the bullish trend. Once this is established, then the other two bull flags come into play.\nNext is the second bull flag at the $131,500 level as the bulls continue to dominate the market. Then, last but not least, is the third bull flag marked at the $136,900 level, to complete a 10% increase from its current all-time high.", "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 10:00:31 +0000", "author": "Scott Matherson", "source": "https://bitcoinist.com/category/bitcoin/feed/"}

Exceptions were only allowed to cover debt interest or preferred equity dividends.\nUnder the updated policy, Strategy will permit stock issuance below the 2.5x threshold “when otherwise deemed advantageous to the company.” Analysts like Brian Dobson of Clear Street said the additional language allows Saylor to be more opportunistic in financing Bitcoin purchases.\nThe shift comes as demand for the firm’s preferred stock program, a novel perpetual equity product Saylor unveiled in July, faces uncertainty. Investor appetite has been tested by falling premiums on Strategy’s shares and increasing competition from Bitcoin ETFs and other crypto-treasury firms.\nSlower purchases, strong holdings\nStrategy’s pace of Bitcoin accumulation has moderated. The company disclosed on Aug. 18 that it bought 430 Bitcoin for $51.4 million in the prior week, following a 155 BTC purchase the week before. In total, Strategy now holds 629,376 BTC, acquired at an average price of $73,320. With Bitcoin trading near all-time highs around $119,666, the firm sits on more than $26 billion in unrealized gains.\nDespite these gains, Strategy’s stock has fallen 22% since reaching a record in November, lagging Bitcoin’s 23% rally over the same period. Short sellers like Jim Chanos have questioned whether the firm’s four series of preferred stock offerings can offset reduced at-the-market equity sales.\nThe latest revision shows how quickly Saylor’s bold financing strategy is being tested. While easing restrictions may reassure the company’s ability to keep building its Bitcoin reserves, it also highlights investor concerns about dilution and long-term sustainability.", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 05:03:22 +0000", "author": "Leon Okwatch", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

Using Tendermint consensus, the network will alternate between multiple independent sequencers instead of relying solely on one. This change improves censorship resistance, ensures fair transaction ordering, and boosts fault tolerance.\nTo improve user experience with sub-second latency, the upgrade also adds a new transaction status called “pre-confirmations.” This system offers smoother performance even under high network traffic, with the majority of transactions achieving near-final confirmation in less than a second.\nBlock times will remain between 4 to 6 seconds, but pre-confirmations allow users to see results much more quickly, making this upgrade a major step in lowering wait times for routine transactions.\nFee market and technical enhancements\nStarknet (STRK) v0.14.0 employs a fee structure based on Ethereum’s EIP-1559, with a minimum base price for layer-2 gas set in FRI. This change reduces costs and increases predictability by cutting the connection between Ethereum gas prices and Starknet fees.\nAlong with adding new transaction statuses to RPC 0.9.0 and updating the mempool architecture, the release also makes multi-block processing possible to increase proving efficiency. The roadmap shows that future updates will progressively decentralize sequencer operations, even though StarkWare will still be in charge of them in this version.\nTo ensure a seamless migration, there will be a brief outage of roughly 15 minutes during the switch to v0.14.0, during which time transactions will be temporarily paused.\nRecent Starknet ecosystem developments\nThe upcoming upgrade follows a series of ecosystem milestones. Extended, a perpetual trading decentralized exchange with over 50 trading pairs and leverage of up to 100x, debuted on the Starknet mainnet on Aug. 12. . Earlier this month, the community voted on SNIP-31, a proposal introducing Bitcoin (BTC) staking through tokenized assets such as WBTC and tBTC.\nIn its July recap, Starknet announced improvements to its mempool, the launch of the fee market, faster block times, and a shift to sole support for V3 transactions using STRK as the gas token.\nAll of these advancements point to Starknet’s drive for decentralization, scalability, and wider Ethereum rollup ecosystem adoption.", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 04:59:49 +0000", "author": "Leon Okwatch", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

The company said it has partnered with Electric Capital to maximize returns through staking, DeFi lending, and liquidity provisioning, positioning the firm to benefit from Ethereum’s expanding utility beyond mere price appreciation.\nThe pivot from biotech to Ethereum treasury management came after ETHZilla raised $565 million in private funding, with backing from over 60 institutional and crypto-native investors.\nThe list features both a deep bench of both institutional capital and Ethereum-native builders. Polychain Capital, Electric Capital, and Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund anchor the institutional side, while key DeFi founders, including EigenLayer’s Sreeram Kannan, Lido’s Konstantin Lomashuk, and Compound’s Robert Leshner, lend credibility to the venture. Their participation suggests confidence not just in ETHZilla’s model, but in Ethereum’s long-term viability as a cornerstone of decentralized finance.\nWhile ETHZilla’s treasury strategy dominates headlines, the company hasn’t abandoned its roots entirely. The company said its legacy biotech assets remain part of the portfolio, with plans to monetize intellectual property, and its gaming division continues to operate. This diversified approach could provide stability if crypto markets turn volatile, though the firm’s future now hinges on Ethereum’s performance.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 20:25:51 +0000", "author": "Brian Danga", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

These are: application programming interfaces, digital identity verification, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology use and monitoring.\nWhy public input?\nThe notice fulfills a requirement under GENIUS Act, the landmark U.S. stablecoin law President Donald Trump signed into law in July 2025. According to the government agency, the public have 60 days from the date of publishing the request for comment notice in the Federal Register to give their input, with this deadline set for October 17, 2025.\nPublic feedback on this matter helps the administration’s quest for policy that supports responsible growth and use of cryptocurrencies. Treasury’s move aligns with Trump’s executive order on “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” signed on January 23, 2025.\n“Today’s request for comment fulfills Treasury’s obligation pursuant to section 9(a) of the GENIUS Act, which creates a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers in the United States.

Despite this retrace, the bullish structure remains intact with higher lows and strong volume inflows.\nKey technical points\n- $2.80 High-Timeframe Support: Confluence of value area high and prior retests, confirming strong structural demand.\n- Bullish Structure Intact: Higher highs and higher lows remain in place despite intraday corrections.\n- Volume Profile Strength: Sustained buy-side inflows support the probability of a continued rally.\nXRP’s price action has retraced into the $2.80 support, a region that has been tested multiple times and continues to act as a foundation for bullish momentum. This level is aligned with the value area high, a region where volume has consistently built, signaling strong demand. Holding above this level is critical for XRP to preserve its bullish momentum and sustain its broader uptrend.\nFrom a market structure perspective, XRP remains intact with consecutive higher highs and higher lows. The pullback to $2.80 has not damaged the larger trend, but rather reinforces it as a healthy retest. These retests of major supports confirm the presence of buyers and strengthen the probability of upward continuation. A strong defense of this zone will likely set up XRP for a fresh rally back toward its all-time high of $3.60.\nIn addition to structural integrity, Fibonacci levels add another layer of confluence. The $2.80 region coincides with the 0.618 retracement zone, a level often associated with strong bullish reversals. Historically, XRP has reacted positively at this level during bullish trends, increasing the likelihood of another expansion higher if bulls hold the line.\nThe volume profile further strengthens the bullish case. Data shows a steady influx of buy-side pressure, indicating market demand is still strong even during corrective phases. Such volume dynamics often precede larger impulsive moves, as accumulation periods resolve with expansions higher. A break back above $3.60, backed by strong volume, could accelerate XRP toward the $4.19 Fibonacci extension target.\nWhat to expect in the coming price action\nXRP remains bullish as long as the $2.80 support continues to hold. Multiple retests are healthy and signal demand. With strong volume inflows, XRP is well-positioned for a rally back toward $3.60 and potentially $4.19.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 18:26:48 +0000", "author": "Aziz Zamani", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

Its balance sheet includes about 629,000 BTC, worth around $72.5 billion at current market prices.\nFor much of that time, investors treated the stock as a way to gain amplified exposure to Bitcoin without holding it directly. When Bitcoin rose, MSTR often rose faster.\nThat relationship looks weaker in 2025. During the week when Bitcoin set new highs, Strategy’s shares fell from about $400 on Aug. 11 to $366 by Aug. 15, a decline of nearly 9%.\nThe stock is also trading roughly one third below its 52-week peak of $543, despite the size of its reserves.\nValuation highlights the disconnect. Strategy’s market cap stands near $104 billion, which works out to a net asset value multiple of about 1.4 times its Bitcoin holdings.\nIn earlier cycles, that ratio was much higher. Throughout 2024, the premium often stretched between 2.5 and 3 times, showing how much investors once valued the stock as a proxy. Today, the premium has compressed toward parity.\nThe change is visible in recent returns. Between February and August 2025, a $10,000 investment in Bitcoin grew about 22%, while the same investment in Strategy gained less than 9%.\nEarlier in the year, the pattern was reversed, with Strategy shares delivering more than 30% while Bitcoin advanced about 15%. Since June, Bitcoin’s climb has continued, while the stock has slipped back, losing the amplification effect that once defined it.\nFunding model shows signs of strain\nThe weakness in Strategy’s stock is not just about charts. It reflects strain in the financing structure that has allowed the company to keep building its Bitcoin reserve.\nSince 2020, the firm has relied heavily on equity sales and convertible debt, raising billions through repeated issuances. The model worked while investors believed that dilution was offset by the promise of leveraged gains from Bitcoin.\nThat confidence has started to fade. The company’s recent update to its equity issuance guidelines triggered a sell-off, signaling that shareholders are less willing to accept more dilution when the stock is already lagging behind Bitcoin itself.\nEarlier fundraising rounds benefited from unusually favorable conditions. In 2021 and again in 2023, Strategy issued convertible notes with coupons as low as 0.75% to 1.5%, locking in billions at terms that looked cheap even before Bitcoin’s appreciation was considered.\nThose opportunities are harder to come by now. With higher interest rates and a thinner stock premium, the company has shifted toward preferred shares as a financing tool.\nPreferred equity avoids immediate dilution but comes with fixed payouts that narrow flexibility in the future.\nShare issuance has also become more of a reputational burden. Over the past three years, the number of outstanding shares has risen by more than 40%.\nThat pace was tolerated when MSTR consistently outperformed Bitcoin. Today, with the stock trailing the underlying asset, the trade-off looks less compelling.\nThe result is a financial engine that no longer spins as smoothly as before. Strategy still controls the largest corporate Bitcoin treasury in the world, yet the mechanics that once helped it expand that position are now under pressure.\nWhy investors no longer pay a premium for Strategy\nWhen Michael Saylor first turned his company toward Bitcoin in 2020, owning MSTR shares offered a straightforward way for equity investors to gain exposure without buying the asset directly.\nInstitutional products were scarce, custody solutions were less mature, and buying Bitcoin on retail platforms carried frictions that justified the premium investors attached to the stock.\nThe environment in 2025 looks very different. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have gathered hundreds of billions of dollars in assets since approvals began in early 2024.\nBlackRock’s fund alone has crossed $89 billion under management, with other issuers adding substantial inflows.\nThese products give investors liquid, regulated, and cost-efficient exposure to Bitcoin, often with annual management fees below 0.25%. For institutions, that combination of safety, simplicity, and low cost has proved compelling.\nRetail channels have also widened. Coinbase, Robinhood, and even traditional brokerages now allow users to buy fractions of Bitcoin directly within the same apps used for equities and ETFs.\nThe ease of purchasing digital assets in small amounts has reduced the need for a corporate proxy.\nThat shift explains why the premium once attached to Strategy has compressed. Investors no longer need to rely on a software company’s balance sheet to hold Bitcoin. They can buy it outright or use regulated ETFs that avoid dilution and carry minimal fees.\n$360 emerges as the market’s pressure point\nStrategy’s stock is increasingly being defined by psychology rather than just balance sheet math. The share price has hovered in one of its narrowest ranges in years, with $360 emerging as the level investors are watching most closely.\nThe character of ownership has also changed. Vanguard, once the anchor shareholder, reduced its position last quarter. In its place, hedge funds have taken on a larger role in daily trading.\nOther treasury-style plays show the same stress. In Japan, Metaplanet has dropped more than a third over the same period, pointing to a broader loss of investor appetite for listed corporate holdings of Bitcoin.\nWhat has drained the appeal is a collapse in volatility. Investors who once paid above intrinsic value to chase amplified gains now see less reason to do so.\nCapital is being redirected toward areas that feel newer and less crowded, such as Ethereum-linked reserves and crypto IPOs.\nThe open question is whether Strategy can remain relevant in this new order. A firm support at $360 might provide a tactical entry point, but the longer-term story rests on whether treasury-style companies can regain their role as amplified proxies for Bitcoin.\nAnalysts remain divided on what comes next. Some still see upside, with price targets in the $550 to $570 range suggesting more than 50% potential gains from current levels.\nMuch will depend on how Strategy adapts. A strong Bitcoin market can provide support, but investor confidence will rest on whether the company balances reserve growth with shareholder value.\nThe role Strategy once played as the de facto proxy for Bitcoin is no longer unique. User access to ETFs and direct ownership means that investors have simpler choices today.\nStrategy’s challenge is to redefine its appeal in this new environment. If it succeeds, the company can remain a prominent, listed vehicle tied to the largest corporate Bitcoin treasury in the world. If it falls short, its once-central role as a bridge to Bitcoin may continue to fade.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 19:43:33 +0000", "author": "Ankish Jain", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

The real PEPE price prediction 2030\nHey, how do you feel about Pepe? Someone needs to tell this frog to calm down — the chart’s acting like it’s trying to speedrun the entire market cycle in a week. Today, we’re taking a shot at figuring out what PEPE might be worth in 2030.\nBefore we get into the Pepe price prediction for 2030, it’s worth taking a moment to understand what this meme coin really is.\nTable of Contents\nHow is PEPE performing right now?\nPEPE’s price on August 18 sits at $0.0000108. Over the last 24 hours, the price has moved by -4.73%, with a change of 1.31% in the past hour. For longer-term performance, the price has varied by -7.84% over the last 7 days and by -17.11% in the past month.\nPepe’s big moment came on December 9, 2024, hitting an all-time high of $0.00002825. Since then, it’s lost about 60.5% of its value — a familiar story for meme coins after a big surge. With PEPE, expect the unexpected — volatility is baked in, and the price moves often ride the hype just as much as technical signals.\nWhat’s set to move the PEPE price in 2030?\nPEPE future price factors\nWhen it comes to the Pepe future price in 2030, there are a few big factors that could shape where it’s headed:\n- Community & hype: PEPE lives off vibes. If the fanbase keeps growing and stays loud, that energy could keep pushing it forward.\n- Market mood swings: Like most cryptos, PEPE’s price will likely follow the overall vibe of the market. If we see another big bull run, it could soar. But in a bearish stretch? It might take a hit, just like everything else.\n- Real use & development: If PEPE actually builds out some utility or lands big partnerships, that could attract more serious investors.\nSo what could the Pepe expected price be in 2030? Will PEPE hit $0.01 by 2030?\nPepe price prediction 2030\nPrice predictions for PEPE in 2030 are all over the place:\n- CoinCodex offers one of the more moderate forecasts, expecting PEPE to settle somewhere between $0.000015 and $0.000028. It’s not a rocket ride, but steady growth if things go right.\n- Wallet Investor isn’t to hopeful — their 2030 target price is just $0.0000015, which doesn’t leave much room for optimism about PEPE’s future.\n- On the flip side, DigitalCoinPrice is pretty optimistic. Their forecast puts PEPE between $0.0000525 and $0.0000609, hinting that the frog might just bounce back and still has fans rooting for it. If this upbeat projection plays out, it could be a sign that investors and analysts still believe PEPE’s got some fight left — and might just find its way back into the spotlight.\nIn short, forecasts for PEPE’s future remain mixed — with target prices ranging from major dips to steady gains. But hey — that’s what you’d expect from a meme coin. Just don’t forget: PEPE’s real strength is its community… and yes, you could be part of it too.\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party.

It will be included in the second phase of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, which the FSC has been drafting since late 2023.\nOnce unveiled, the proposal will provide the country’s first unified framework for stablecoin issuance, bringing clarity to how won-pegged tokens can be issued, launched, and managed.\nDemocratic Party lawmaker Park Min-gyu reportedly confirmed recently that he had received an FSC briefing on the direction of stablecoin regulation, adding that the proposal is expected to be submitted to the National Assembly in the coming months.\nThe push builds on months of growing political and industry attention toward stablecoins. Since the election of pro-crypto President Lee Jae-myung, who pledged to expand digital asset use during his campaign, momentum around a won-denominated token has accelerated.\nSurveys conducted earlier this year already revealed strong interest in stablecoins among South Korean citizens, with USD-backed tokens widely used for trading and remittances. To offset the dominance, eight major banking institutions in the region are also collaborating to build a joint stablecoin venture that serves the local market, urging regulatory greenlight to avoid using ground to foreign issuers.\n“There is a shared sense of crisis that if things continue this way, foreign dollar coins could dominate the domestic market,” a bank official said earlier in the year. “It is time to secure both the independence and competitiveness of the domestic financial system through a won-based digital currency.”\nAs collaborative efforts mount, the country has now seen the rollout of the first won-pegged stablecoin.\nPrivate sector leads South Korea stablecoin debut\nOn August 5, South Korea-based entertainment platform fanC, in partnership with financial software firm Initech, unveiled KRWIN, a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Korean won.\nAs reported by the local media at the time, the pilot program is testing KRWIN’s technical feasibility, including transferability and real-world applications in payments, remittances, and tourism. Lee Dong-ho, a spokesperson for fanC, called the launch “a major milestone” in advancing stablecoin adoption in the nation, positioning KRWIN as a potential private model for won-denominated digital assets.\nWhile distribution is limited to internal groups affiliated with the firms for now, the firm has reportedly filed a trademark application for KRWIN with the Korean Intellectual Property Office, signaling intent for a broader rollout.\nMeanwhile, other Asian countries, including Japan and Hong Kong, are also pushing for similar initiatives, as global interest in stablecoins grows following the rollout of supportive legislation in the United States.\nFor now, dollar-pegged assets like USDT (USDT) and USDC (USDC) continue to dominate the market, and it remains to be seen how Asian markets can catch up.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 17:27:27 +0000", "author": "Grace Abidemi", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

With Trump’s financial interests in the mix, the agency faces unprecedented scrutiny over its next move.\n- SEC delays ruling on Truth Social’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF to October 8.\n- Routine extension gains weight due to Trump Media’s involvement and political context.\n- Watchdog group urges rejection, citing conflicts of interest and TMTG’s weak financials.\nOn August 18, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pushed its deadline to rule on the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF to October 8, marking the first delay since NYSE Arca filed the proposal in June.\nThe extension, though routine for crypto-related ETFs, carries unusual weight given the fund’s ties to President Donald Trump’s media empire and his family’s growing crypto ventures. In its filing, the SEC cited the need for “sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change,” a standard justification that belies the politically charged context surrounding this particular application.\nThe political minefield facing the SEC’s ETF decision\nThe SEC’s extension of its review period for Truth Social’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF follows standard procedure, but the filing’s single public comment reveals why this case is anything but routine.\nAccountable.US, a government watchdog group, submitted a blistering critique urging the SEC to reject the proposal, arguing it represents an unprecedented conflict of interest given President Trump’s 52% stake in Trump Media & Technology Group and his family’s growing crypto ventures.\nCaroline Ciccone, president of Accountable.US, framed the stakes bluntly:\n“The SEC must deny this proposed rule,” Ciccone wrote. “If the SEC votes to approve the launch, it will put doubts into the minds of Americans and potentially undermine confidence in the markets and the agency itself.”\nThe submission highlights concerns ranging from the ETF’s proposed custodian, Crypto.com subsidiary Foris DAX, which Ciccone claimed has hundreds of consumer complaints, to TMTG’s shaky financials, including first-quarter 2025 earnings of just $821,200 against a $5 billion market valuation.\nTrump’s financial footprint in crypto\nThe political overtones are compounded by Trump’s own financial footprint in crypto. According to a July update of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, his estimated net worth of $6.4 billion has remained largely steady, but nearly $620 million of that figure is now tied to digital assets.\nFrom DeFi projects to branded meme coins, crypto has become a significant pillar of the Trump family’s portfolio. That context raises the stakes around a Truth Social ETF that would put the Trump brand directly into a regulated investment vehicle tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum. With TMTG’s stock down 50% since January 2025, critics argue the ETF could be a lifeline for a struggling business tied directly to the president.\nA shifting regulatory landscape\nStill, the broader regulatory backdrop has shifted in ways that complicate the narrative. The SEC’s approach to crypto ETFs has evolved significantly since the Trump administration took office.\nIn July 2025, the agency approved rule changes allowing in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs, paving the way for more complex products. This marked a departure from the Biden-era SEC, which only greenlit spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs after court mandates.\nThe SEC now faces a defining choice. Approving the ETF risks perceptions of favoritism toward a sitting president’s business interests, while rejecting it could invite accusations of political bias. As Ciccone put it: “The commission will have to face these questions: Did they approve the rule because it is the right thing for the country? Or did it do so because it will benefit the president’s business?”", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 19:02:54 +0000", "author": "Brian Danga", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

CMB International Securities, a subsidiary of the $1.7 trillion China Merchants Bank, has launched a crypto exchange in Hong Kong.\n- CMB International Securities, a China Merchants Bank subsidiary, launches a licensed crypto platform in Hong Kong.\n- The service allows qualified investors to trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT following SFC approval.\n- Hong Kong’s regulatory framework offers a legal on-ramp for Chinese institutions despite mainland crypto bans.\nOn August 18, CMB International Securities flipped the switch on its newly licensed crypto trading platform, allowing qualified investors to trade Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT) through its mobile app.\nThe move comes just over a month after Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission greenlit its expanded license, marking a quiet but strategic pivot for a firm deeply embedded in China’s traditional finance system.\nUnlike mainland China’s outright ban, Hong Kong’s regulatory framework provides a rare on-ramp for state-linked institutions to engage with digital assets without directly challenging Beijing’s stance.\nHong Kong’s regulatory tightrope\nCMB International Securities’ crypto pivot comes with strict guardrails. The platform restricts access to “qualified investors,” a classification that automatically screens out mainland Chinese residents and mandates users to establish a conventional cash account before gaining crypto access.\nAccording to the announcement, users need professional investor credentials, which in Hong Kong usually means representing an institution or holding an investment portfolio north of HK$8 million (roughly $1 million) to qualify. This gatekeeping reflects Hong Kong’s deliberate playbook: roll out the red carpet for institutional money while keeping the crypto-curious retail crowd at bay.\nThe current menu stays conservative, with just Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT for now. But CMB has already hinted at plans to slowly broaden its crypto offerings. This measured expansion isn’t surprising given Hong Kong’s regulatory playbook, where even adding a new token requires jumping through the SFC’s approval hoops.\nA bridge between two worlds\nWhat makes CMB International Securities’ move noteworthy isn’t just its first-mover status as a Chinese bank-linked crypto licensee. It’s the deliberate framing of digital assets as a complement to traditional finance, not a replacement.\nThe firm’s announcement emphasized plans to “integrate” crypto with conventional stock trading and fintech applications for wealth management clients seeking diversified portfolios.\nThe backdrop, of course, is Hong Kong’s aggressive push to become Asia’s regulated crypto hub, even as mainland China’s ban enters its eighth year. Recent months have seen the city finalize rules for stablecoins, tighten custody requirements, and crack down on unlicensed platforms.

The corporate treasury now stands at $6.6 billion, positioning the firm as the world’s largest ETH holder and second only to Strategy’s Bitcoin trove.\n- BitMine Immersion added 373,000 ETH in one week, raising its corporate treasury to $6.6 billion.\n- The firm now holds the world’s largest Ethereum treasury and the second-largest corporate crypto treasury globally.\n- BitMine aims to acquire up to 5% of Ethereum’s circulating supply, backed by institutional investors like ARK and Pantera Capital.\nIn a press release dated August 18, BitMine Immersion Technologies announced its Ethereum (ETH) holdings had ballooned to $6.6 billion, representing a $1.7 billion increase in just one week.\nThe Las Vegas-based firm, backed by institutional heavyweights like ARK Invest and Pantera Capital, added 373,000 ETH to its treasury, bringing its total stash to 1.52 million tokens. At current prices, that’s enough ETH to make BitMine the second-largest corporate crypto treasury globally, trailing only Michael Saylor’s Strategy and its $74 billion Bitcoin (BTC) reserve.\nThe 5% gambit: Why BitMine is betting big on Ethereum’s future\nBitMine’s latest $1.7 billion purchase brings it closer to its ambitious goal of controlling 5% of Ethereum’s circulating supply, a threshold that would give it unprecedented influence over the network’s liquidity.\nChairman Tom Lee framed the week’s buying spree as part of a broader institutional pivot to blockchain infrastructure.\n“We continue to believe Ethereum is one of the biggest macro trades over the next 10-15 years,” Lee said. “Wall Street and AI moving onto the blockchain should lead to a greater transformation of today’s financial system. And the majority of this is taking place on Ethereum.”\nThis vision is backed by concrete market shifts. According to BitMine, the GENIUS Act and SEC’s Project Crypto have created regulatory tailwinds for institutional crypto adoption, mirroring the transformative impact of the 1971 Bretton Woods collapse on traditional finance.\nWhere corporations once treated crypto as a speculative sideline, they’re now building treasury strategies around it, with BitMine’s $6.6 billion ETH position serving as Exhibit A.\nFrom mining to biggest Ethereum whale\nBitMine’s evolution from Bitcoin miner to Ethereum powerhouse reflects a strategic masterstroke. Per the press release, the company’s stock, trading $6.4 billion daily, now ranks among the top 10 most liquid U.S. equities, a remarkable feat for a crypto-native firm.\nThis liquidity fuels its accumulation strategy, creating a self-reinforcing cycle: as BitMine’s ETH holdings grow, so does investor interest in its stock, which in turn provides capital for further acquisitions.\nThe implications could be profound. Should BitMine reach its 5% target, it would effectively become a market maker for institutional ETH exposure, similar to how Strategy functions for Bitcoin. But there’s a key difference: Ethereum’s utility as the backbone for decentralized finance and AI applications gives BitMine’s position unique strategic value.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 18:06:05 +0000", "author": "Brian Danga", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

Volatility, hype cycles, and market sentiment all play major roles.\nBut based on current trends and expert forecasts, here’s what the Floki Inu price in 2030 could potentially look like — covered in our Floki Inu (FLOKI) price prediction 2030.\nTable of Contents\n- Floki Inu started as a meme coin but now has a growing ecosystem including NFT gaming, DeFi, and educational platforms.\n- As of mid-2025, FLOKI trades around $0.00012, boosted recently by a Robinhood listing exposing it to millions of users.\n- Key future price drivers include ecosystem growth, major partnerships, market trends, community support, and regulations.\n- Most expert forecasts suggest moderate growth, with price targets ranging roughly from $0.00001 to $0.00065 by 2030.\n- None of the major projections expect FLOKI to reach $0.1 or $1 by 2030, highlighting the uncertainty and volatility in meme coins.\nHow is FLOKI performing right now?\nAt the end of July 2025, FLOKI hit its highest price in the past six months — $0.0001538.\nOver the last 24 hours, the price has moved by -4.52%, with a change of 1.55% in the past hour. For longer-term performance, the price has varied by -8.88% over the last 7 days and by -24.2% in the past month.\nThe main catalyst behind FLOKI’s recent pump? Its listing on U.S.-based trading platform Robinhood. In a post on X, the Floki team called it a “huge step forward,” pointing out that it gives the project exposure to over 25 million users on one of the world’s most influential platforms for retail traders.\nHistorically, listings like this tend to cause short-term price surges — but they can also lose steam once the initial hype dies down.\nSo, what’s next? What factors could shape the Floki Inu future price in 2030?\nFloki Inu price drivers\nA few major factors could shape where Floki Inu goes from here:\n- First off, ecosystem growth is a big one. Projects like Valhalla (FLOKI’s NFT game), FlokiFi (its DeFi platform), and Floki University are giving the token real-world use — and that kind of utility can drive long-term value.\n- Collaborations with big names like Alibaba and Binance Pay help boost FLOKI’s credibility and put it in front of a much wider audience.\n- Then there’s the broader market picture. If meme coins and altcoins stay hot, FLOKI could easily ride the wave — but if the hype fades, it could struggle to keep momentum.\n- The community and social media support? They’re still everything — the real heartbeat that keeps meme coins like FLOKI alive and kicking.\n- And finally, regulations and global crypto adoption will play a huge role. If the space keeps opening up, FLOKI has room to grow — if not, it could face some serious headwinds.\nSo what could the Floki Inu expected price be in 2030? And will FLOKI hit $0.1 by 2030?\nFLOKI price prediction 2030\nWhen it comes to the long-term forecast for Floki Inu, most projections are cautiously optimistic — though not overly bullish. Here’s what a few analytical sites expect in terms of FLOKI’s target price by 2030:\n- CoinCodex seems pretty upbeat, expecting the token to trade somewhere between $0.000221 and $0.0006 by 2030. Not too shabby if the project keeps building and the community stays strong.\n- DigitalCoinPrice is also leaning positive, with predictions between $0.000568 and $0.000653 by the end of the decade — solid growth if things stay on track.\n- But then there’s Wallet Investor, and… well, they’re not as hopeful. They’re calling for an average price of just $0.00001095 by August 2030, which basically means they’re not expecting much action at all.\nDespite varying levels of optimism, none of these platforms expect FLOKI to reach $0.1 by 2030, let alone the much-hyped $1 target.\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

The altcoin was down 5% in 24 hours as Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $115k and Ethereum (ETH) retreated to near $4,200.\nAvalanche network activity rises\nWhile Avalanche’s price is facing the same downside pressure that currently engulfs the broader risk-asset market, data shows network strength that supports the long-term outlook.

Fair warning — it might not be the best news.\nRipple is barely clinging to the $3 mark as of August 18, 2025, and it’s looking like it might dip below again. It last fell under $3 just over a week ago on August 6, and now it’s right back on the edge.\nThe recent price action feels like a battle of wills — on one side, you’ve got the bulls riding high on the good vibes from Ripple’s legal wins, and on the other, the bears are cashing in their profits, and whales are offloading big chunks of XRP.\nTable of Contents\n- XRP is struggling near the crucial $3 support level, with recent dips below this mark raising concerns about further declines.\n- Technical indicators show the 20-day EMA at $3.11 as the first support, followed by the 50-day EMA near $2.92; breaking these could lead to deeper losses.\n- Longer-term EMAs (100-day and 200-day) suggest a gradual downward trend, with potential targets around $2.70 and $2.43.\n- On-chain data reveals waning buying interest and significant whale sell-offs, tightening liquidity and increasing the risk of accelerated price drops.\nCurrent XRP price scenario\nTo kick things off, profit-taking has ramped up, with many traders cashing out after XRP’s recent surge. That’s led to a wave of selling pressure — especially with whales unloading around $1.9 billion worth of tokens. That kind of volume puts serious downward pressure on price.\nIn addition to the selling pressure, the overall cryptocurrency market has recently experienced a period of heightened volatility and decline. XRP, which is notably sensitive to shifts in market sentiment, has been adversely affected as a result. The $3 support level remains a key focus for traders and analysts. A sustained drop below this threshold could signal further downside risk, potentially driving XRP toward lower support levels.\nKey signs XRP price may crash below $3\nWe’re taking a closer look at the signs pointing to a possible shift toward bearish momentum in the near future.\nSign 1\nOn the daily chart, Ripple (XRP) is hovering near its recent lows, with the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) sitting around $3.07. Right now, that EMA is acting as the first line of support. If XRP breaks below it with conviction, it could signal that the short-term bullish momentum is fading — and possibly trigger a fresh wave of selling.\nIf that support fails, the next important level to keep an eye on is the 50-day EMA around $2.92, which could be the next key test for price stability.\nSign 2\nZooming out a bit, the 100-day EMA sits near $2.7, and the 200-day EMA is close to $2.43. Both point to a gentle downward slide. So, if XRP can’t hold up here, it might keep drifting down toward those spots.\nSign 3\nOn-chain data shows buying interest is fading, and whales have been selling off large amounts of XRP. As these big holders keep unloading tokens, liquidity tightens — and if big investors lose confidence, the sell-off could speed up.\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

This zone has proven significant due to overlapping technical confluences, including the midpoint of the Bollinger Bands and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. While corrections often signal weakness, ENA’s broader market structure remains bullish, with consistent higher highs and higher lows, suggesting this move may simply be a setup for the next leg higher.\nKey Ethena price technical points\n- Strong Support at $0.67: Confluence of Bollinger Bands midpoint and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement.\n- Bullish Market Structure: Consecutive higher highs and higher lows remain intact.\n- Resistance at $0.96: Breaching the swing high would confirm continuation toward upside targets.\nFrom a structural perspective, ENA continues to respect its bullish trend despite the short-term corrective move. The $0.67 support level has emerged as the most critical zone, not only because of the Fibonacci alignment but also due to the Bollinger Bands midpoint. Historically, this zone has provided solid footing for trend continuations, and holding it will confirm the establishment of another higher low in ENA’s bullish trajectory.\nMarket structure is often the most important factor when evaluating sustainability in bullish conditions, and ENA has continued to post consecutive higher highs and higher lows. This indicates that demand remains strong and that the correction should be viewed as a consolidation phase within an ongoing bullish cycle.\nIf the $0.67 level holds, ENA has the potential to retest immediate resistance at $0.96, which coincides with the prior swing high. Breaking through this level would signify bullish continuation and strengthen the case for higher targets in the medium term.\nVolume data also reinforces the bullish bias. The current influx of trading activity on the volume profile highlights active participation from buyers around the $0.67 region. This kind of volume expansion during a corrective move suggests accumulation rather than distribution, a key distinction that often precedes further rallies.\nThe broader technical picture supports a bullish outlook, provided ENA maintains structural integrity above $0.67.

With total holdings of 629,376 BTC, bought for an overall cost of $46.15 billion, the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm sits on more than $26 billion in unrealized gains at current market prices.\nStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation: A closer look\nThe 430 BTC purchased last week marks a noticeable slowdown in Strategy’s once-aggressive buying spree. This acquisition pales in comparison to the 31,466 BTC the company scooped up in a three-week span ending August 3, or even the 17,075 BTC bought throughout June.\nThe tempered approach comes as Bitcoin experiences heightened volatility, with prices swinging from a record $124,000 last Wednesday to $115,716 at press time after a 3% drop in 24 hours, per crypto.news data.\nAlongside the purchase, Strategy adjusted its MSTR Equity ATM (at-the-market) guidance. Now, when its market-to-NAV ratio falls below 2.5x, it will flexibly issue common shares to: pay debt interest, cover preferred dividend obligations, or for other strategic purposes.\nThis framework, disclosed alongside the Form 8-K, suggests Strategy is preparing for multiple market scenarios while preserving its treasury’s dominance. Notably, the firm still holds $48 billion in untapped ATM capacity across its preferred and common stock programs, a war chest that could deploy rapidly if conditions align.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:16:11 +0000", "author": "Brian Danga", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

Its performance came as whale activity accelerated and as the LINK Reserve strategy continued.\n- Chainlink price remained in a strong bull run this year.\n- Whale investors continued accumulating LINK tokens.\n- Technical analysis points to more gains this year.\nChainlink (LINK) price was trading at $25.35, its highest level since January this year. It has jumped by 135% from its lowest point in June 22.\nChainlink crypto price boosted by whale buying\nNansen data shows that some of the biggest and smart money investors were actively accumulating. Whales have increased their holdings by 1.15 million LINK tokens to 5.43 million today. Their total holdings are valued at over $135 million.\nThe Trump family-linked World Liberty Financial is one of the top LINK holders, with tokens worth close to $1 million in its portfolio.\nThe ongoing whale accumulation coincided with the ongoing plunge in supply balances. Exchange balances have dropped to 269.56 million, down from 280 million last month. Crashing exchange balances signal that investors are largely not selling their holdings.\nChainlink has some of the best fundamentals in the crypto industry. It is the biggest oracle, connecting off-chain data to on-chain. It powers some of the leading players in crypto like Aave, Compound, Maple, and Spark.\nChainlink has also become the biggest provider of solutions in the real-world asset tokenization industry. Many companies like Swift, ANZ Bank, and JPMorgan are working on products that leverage its cross-chain interoperable protocol.\nThe rising activity will benefit LINK price by making it highly deflationary. That’s because of the recently announced Strategic LINK Reserve that channels most of its on-chain and off-chain fees in accumulating the token. Its reserves have already jumped to $2.4 million a few weeks after launch.\nLINK price technical analysis\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the Chainlink price has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few months. It has jumped from $10.90 in June to a high of $26.30, its highest point since January.\nChainlink crypto price has formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages have crossed each other.\nThe Relative Strength Index and the Stochastic Oscillator have pointed upward, a sign it is gaining momentum. It has also moved to the third stage of the Elliott Wave pattern.\nTherefore, the LINK price will likely continue rising as bulls target the psychological point at $30.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:30:09 +0000", "author": "Crispus Nyaga", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

Among these is Wall Street’s focus on the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole conference set for Aug. 21 to 23 in Wyoming.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at the central bank symposium, with this being his final Jackson Hole speech before his term ends in May 2026. Key to investor attention at the conference will be Powell’s commentary on the U.S. economic outlook as well as the Fed’s monetary policy framework, the latter crucial, as expectations of a Fed rate cut in September remain high.\nAlso on the agenda and key to sentiment are upcoming retail giants’ earnings reports, geopolitics, and global trade. In terms of earnings, Wall Street will be keen on Walmart, Home Depot, and Target, crucial reports in the broad take on tariffs and inflation impact.\nGeopolitics remain near the top of the agenda after U.S. President Donald Trump met Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Trump is set to meet Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy and told the Ukrainian leader to forget about the annexed Crimea region in relation to NATO membership.\nBitcoin mirrors stocks\nAs stocks trade flat amid the shift in sentiment, cryptocurrencies are also struggling.\nLike the major gauges, Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high above $124k on Aug. 14. However, sell-off has pushed the benchmark digital asset to lows of $114.7k in the past 24 hours.\nBitcoin’s dip and broader stocks’ performance also saw crypto stocks such as Strategy and Coinbase shed more than 2%, respectively.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:46:35 +0000", "author": "Benson Toti", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}
{"title": "Why is the crypto market down today?", "url": "https://crypto.news/why-is-the-crypto-market-down-today-3/", "text": "Why is the crypto market down today?\nThe crypto market is crashing today, August 18, with Bitcoin falling below $115,000 and the total valuation of all tokens plunging below $4 trillion.\n- The crypto market crash continued amid a jump in liquidations.\n- Traders are eying the upcoming Jackson Hole Symposium.\n- Cryptocurrencies are also falling amid profit-taking among investors.\nTop altcoins like Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Sui (SUI) were all down by over 5%. Smaller altcoins like Raydium, Aerodrome Finance, and Bonk were among the top laggards.\nCrypto market crashing amid rising liquidations\nA major reason for today’s market drop is a wave of liquidations across crypto exchanges. Exchanges have been closing highly leveraged bullish trades, adding significant selling pressure to the market.\nAccording to CoinGlass data, 24-hour liquidations surged by 327%, with over 131,000 traders liquidated. The largest single liquidation was valued at $7.83 million.\nThese liquidations coincided with profit-taking from investors after strong rallies across most major cryptocurrencies in recent weeks.\nUpcoming Jerome Powell Jackson Hole Symposium speech\nAnother catalyst is the upcoming speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole Symposium in Wyoming, one of the most closely watched annual events for monetary policy signals.\nThe speech comes as market participants are paring back hopes for a cut after last week’s strong consumer and producer inflation data. The core consumer price index jumped to 3.1%, while the producer price index moved to 3.6%. Another report showed that inflation expectations continued rising.\nGiven this backdrop, Powell is expected to signal a more cautious, wait-and-see approach, especially as the Fed monitors the economic impact of Donald Trump’s newly implemented tariffs on major trading partners.\nTechnicals have contributed to the crypto crash\nTechnical factors have also contributed to the ongoing crash. Many altcoins had surged to overbought levels after recent rallies, diverging sharply from their historical averages.\nEthereum is a prime example. The coin hit a multi-year high of $4,785 last week, pushing its Relative Strength Index to 87.6, a level considered highly overbought. Such readings often trigger pullbacks as traders lock in profits.\nAdditionally, Ethereum’s price was significantly above both its 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages. The current decline may reflect a broader mean reversion trend, where assets revert back to their historical norms. Similar setups are unfolding across other altcoins as well.\nIs this the end of the crypto bull run?\nThe ongoing crypto crash is likely not the end of the bull run as the industry has multiple catalysts. Exchange Traded Funds inflows have continued rising, and more treasury companies are coming, leading to higher demand.\nMoreover, the Fed is still expected to begin cutting rates later this year, with further acceleration anticipated in 2026 when Donald Trump replaces Powell.\nMost importantly, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to approve several crypto ETFs before the end of the year, potentially unlocking even greater institutional demand.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:05:36 +0000", "author": "Crispus Nyaga", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

This move sparked a wave of negative comments from the crypto community who believe he is walking away with the bag.\nProminent blogger and co-owner of the Bankless podcast David Hoffman responded with shock, simply writing “Bro what” under Zhao’s departure post.\nFounder led rug-pulls are a recurring story in crypto, but rarely do they happen after capital commitments from the likes of well-respected venture-capital firms like a16z.\nThough it remains to be seen how this will affect the team’s core product and development, several commenters on Zhao’s post have harkened this to a founder led-exit, prompting many online to accuse him of rug-pulling the project.\nAccording to the original whitepaper, Zhao and the other three co-founders hold 20% of the total 1 billion token supply or around 250 million tokens. At current prices, if Zhao holds 5% of the tokens and does sell his holdings he could potentially make a profit of around $281 million.\nNot only that, historically Story Protocol has secured approximately $134.3 million in equity funding. These rounds include a Seed round in May 2023 that raised $29.3 million, a Series A in September 2023 bringing in $25 million, and a large Series B in August 2024 led by Andreessen Horowitz or a16z crypto that contributed $80 million. This values the company at around $2.25 billion.\nAdditional influential investors the joined the funding round for Story Protocol include Polychain Capital, Samsung Next, Hashed, Mirana Ventures, Alliance DAO, and prominent figures like Cozomo de’ Medici and Balaji Srinivasan.\nStory Protocol also secured an $82 million token-based investment from Heritage Distilling, a publicly traded company, as part of a strategic initiative to establish an IP token treasury within a broader $360 million IP token reserve strategy.\nOne X trader posted a SpongeBob meme, calling Zhao’s exit as “another shameless VC softrug.” When another trader defended Zhao’s decision, the X trader retaliated by saying that the protocol co-founder should “consider posting even one single good trade before trying to drum up exit liquidity.”\n“Story just got started and you are stepping out?” asked one trader.\n“Curious how much money you pocketed,” said another X user.\nWhy is Jason Zhao leaving Story Protocol?\nOne of the original builders of the project, Jason Zhao said that his departure stems from his involvement in Poseidon, a full-stack data infrastructure layer created by the protocol to solve AI’s long-tail data bottleneck.\n“I rekindled my original passion from my DeepMind days: applying AI to frontier industries like science and space. It’s time for me to fully pursue this path,” said Zhao in his post.\nHe explained that humanity is reaching a “crucial inflection point” that he likened to a new industrial revolution, which is building upon web3 technology and the deployment of artificial intelligence in various field including robotics, biopharma, space exploration and more.\n“Looking back, building Story (IP) has been the most meaningful experience of my life. What began as a whiteboard sketch when I was 22 turned into more than I could have imagined,” said Zhao, adding that the Story IP has become the backbone protocol for IPs like fashion brand Balmain and K-pop group BTS in South Korea.\nHe also used the opportunity to announce the new leadership that will be taking over the helm. According to Zhao, Story is set to embark on a second phase led by S.Y Lee and a new CPO Andrea, who previously worked on Amazon’s conversational AI.\nStory’s IP price analysis\nAccording to data from crypto.news, Story’s native token IP has fallen by more than 15% in the past week and 22.35% in the past month. Zhao’s exit announcement has led to the token falling even deeper by 4.7%,\nAt press time, the token is trading hands at $5.58 in the past 24 hours with a market cap that has fallen by 3.39% to $1.7 million. Since its launch in February 2025, IP has shown extreme volatility; surging from an all-time low of $1 to highs above $7.3 within weeks after its launch. Just today, the token has managed to flirt with the $7 threshold before falling lower to around the $5.55 range.\nThough lately, the token has been in a slump that’s been pushed lower due to Zhao’s departure from his leadership role in Story. Not only that, the trading volume for IP has fallen by more than 75%, indicating a significant decrease in market activity.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:53:50 +0000", "author": "Trisha Husada", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\nSub-$1 cryptos are back in focus as Dogecoin, Cardano, and Remittix attract attention for very different reasons heading into late 2025.\nTable of Contents\n- Dogecoin rose to $0.2333 with strong retail support but saw trading volume drop 44%, showing weakening short-term momentum.\n- Cardano climbed 5.83% to $0.9686, though its trading activity slowed by nearly 29%, reflecting cautious investor sentiment.\n- Remittix has raised $20m in presale, announced a BitMart listing, and will launch a mobile-first wallet in Q3 2025 targeting real-world payments.\nThe attention is again on sub-$1 cryptos as investors hunt for best altcoin picks going into the second half of 2025. Dogecoin, Cardano, and Remittix (RTX) are attracting renewed attention, with each having its own justification. While Dogecoin and Cardano keep rising, Remittix stands to be one of the best crypto presales in 2025 with real-world adoption already in the pipeline.\nDogecoin demonstrates grudging resilience despite lower volume\nDogecoin (DOGE) has still been in the top cryptos under $1. The price of Dogecoin is now $0.2333, an increase of 2.87% over the last 24 hours. Its market cap is now $35.12 billion due to its strong retail support.\nBut volume tells another tale, dropping 44.66% to $1.67 billion. This decline means while much DOGE continues to have a die-hard following, short-term traders are elsewhere. With other new crypto projects offering tangible uses, Dogecoin will need more than fanfare to stay in the game.\nCardano pushes higher while liquidity slows\nCardano (ADA) has also indicated signs of life, moving up to $0.9686 after posting a 5.83% daily increase. Its $34.47 billion market capitalization indicates ADA’s continued status as one of the most widely recognized cryptocurrencies under $1.\nHowever, Cardano’s trading volume fell by a significant 28.61% bringing its volume to $2.04 billion. This decline in activity shows that investors are beginning to exercise caution, even in light of ADA’s developments in smart contracts and blockchain scaling.\nRemittix presale, beta wallet launch, CEX listing announcement\nIn contrast to ADA and DOGE, Remittix is still in presale but has already achieved a critical point. At a token price of $0.0944, the project raised over $20 million, selling 606 million+ tokens. That achievement paved the way for the first centralized exchange (CEX) listing on BitMart, a move that increases liquidity and availability.\nMore significantly is the upcoming Q3 2025 Remittix wallet beta release, designed for everyday use. The wallet will be mobile-first, enabling instant fiat transfers via cryptocurrency, supporting 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies, as well as real-time FX conversion with transparent rates. Unlike most low cap crypto gems, Remittix is a cross-chain DeFi project targeting the $19 trillion payments market.\nWhy Remittix is gaining traction\n- Instant crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries\n- Over $20 million raised, 606 million+ tokens sold\n- $250,000 Remittix Giveaway creating community excitement\nWhy investors are watching these sub-$1 cryptos\nDogecoin and Cardano are continuing to build steam as cheap cryptos below $1, but their lulls in trading show investors are hungry for the next giant altcoin in 2025. Remittix is standing out by offering real-world functionality, low-gas fee crypto transactions, and a wallet launch that bridges the gap between digital assets and mass-market finance.\nWith a CEX listing assured, a presale bonus underway, and hype going into its Q3 release, Remittix could end up being one of the best DeFi projects of 2025. For investors seeking a crypto that solves real-world problems and a good early-stage buying opportunity, RTX is a project to watch.\nTo learn more about Remittix, visit the website, socials, and $250k giveaway.\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\nLittle Pepe is capturing market attention as Shiba Inu’s momentum fades, combining low entry prices, community-driven hype, and audited security.\nTable of Contents\n- Shiba Inu’s trading volume and whale activity have slowed, signaling waning excitement despite ongoing ecosystem development.\n- Little Pepe has raised over $17.5 million in its presale, with 11.7 billion tokens sold and a CertiK audit boosting credibility.\n- The project emphasizes gamified staking, influencer collaborations, and structured presale pricing, appealing to early-stage investors seeking high upside.\nFor years, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been one of the flagship names in the memecoin world. Its army of holders, ambitious “Shibarium” network, and early success made it a symbol of retail-driven gains in crypto. But the 2025 market tells a different story: SHIB is lagging.\nSocial engagement has cooled, and even long-time community members are questioning whether its next big move is months or even years away. Traders are no longer content with static communities; they want projects that mix cultural virality with real-time growth mechanics. And the hottest candidates right now are emerging from a completely different corner.\nWhy SHIB’s momentum is fading\nShiba Inu’s slowdown isn’t about poor fundamentals. The team is still building, and the ecosystem is functional. But in memecoin markets, attention is everything. Without fresh excitement, the price action reflects boredom. On-chain data shows that SHIB’s trading volume has dropped by nearly 30% month-over-month, while whale transactions (those over $100k) are at their lowest since early 2023.\nThis movement points to a market that’s simply not energized by SHIB’s current trajectory. In contrast, a wave of low-priced memecoins draws in capital by offering a combination of speculative thrill and early-stage growth potential, something SHIB can’t replicate at its current maturity level.\nLittle Pepe: The clear standout memecoin\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) made the loudest noise among many upstarts in early 2025. Far from being just another frog-themed token, LILPEPE blends the humor and memeability of classic viral coins with a surprisingly structured market entry.\n- CertiK audit: Completed and passed, signaling a commitment to transparency and code security, which is rare for meme projects.\n- Presale status: Over $17.5 million raised, with more than 11.7 billion tokens sold, placing it well ahead of schedule.\n- Price: Currently $0.0019, still accessible to retail traders aiming for large bag sizes.\nThe presale was structured to gradually increase prices at each stage, rewarding early participation while building a consistent valuation curve. This structure avoids the sharp presale-to-launch price cliffs that sink many other projects.\nWhat makes LILPEPE different?\nLILPEPE is leaning heavily into community-driven virality, but with a safety net. Token distribution is balanced to keep a healthy supply in circulation without allowing massive early dumps. The project’s roadmap includes gamified staking features, meme contest integrations, and collaborations with popular crypto influencers to push visibility in the first 90 days post-launch.\nFrom a narrative perspective, it’s also capitalizing on the fatigue surrounding older memecoins. The marketing taps into the idea that meme traders are “ready for the next big story,” and so far, that story seems to be resonating.\nCertiK audit boosts credibility\nSecurity is where many memecoins fail before they even get started. Little Pepe has passed its CertiK audit, a gold-standard assurance in the crypto space. This proves the integrity of its smart contracts and reassures potential buyers that there are no malicious backdoors or exploitable flaws.\nFor a memecoin, this is more than just a technical formality; it’s a trust signal. Many traders burned by rug pulls or compromised code are looking for projects with verifiable safety measures, and LILPEPE is delivering on that front early.\nWhy the shift away from SHIB is logical\nThis isn’t about SHIB failing; it’s about market cycles. Every memecoin has its season. SHIB’s meteoric rise in 2021 set a high bar, but it also means its market cap is now too large for 10x 50x runs that attract risk-hungry traders. LILPEPE, priced low and still in its presale phase, offers exactly what SHIB no longer can: the adrenaline of early-stage entry. It’s a gamble, but that’s often the point in memecoin investing.\nConclusion\nShiba Inu will always be in crypto history, but the momentum is shifting toward nimble, low-priced projects like Little Pepe. For traders chasing outsized returns, the combination of a cheap entry price, strong community play, audited security, and early-stage narrative makes LILPEPE one of the most compelling memecoin bets going into the 2025 bull run.\nTo learn more about Little Pepe, visit the website, Telegram, and X.\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party.

The project is seeking up to 50-fold gains upon launch, with its presale offering XYZ tokens at steep discounts to the projected listing price.\nThe token has advanced from the launch price of $0.0001 to the current $0.0053, raising more than $15 million to date. The target listing price stands at $0.10, implying a significant premium to current presale levels. XYZVerse is featured on CoinMarketCap, where 95% of community votes registered as bullish.\nToken structure and supply management\nXYZVerse has allocated 15% of supply to liquidity and 10% to community rewards such as airdrops and bonuses. The project plans to burn 17.13% of its total token supply over time in an effort to reduce circulating supply and support price stability.\nThe project has launched an Ambassador Program to incentivize grassroots promotion and is in talks with major sports figures to expand reach. A partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ offers token holders bonuses on their first bets, introducing a utility component beyond speculative trading.\nXYZVerse’s combination of sports branding, meme culture and utility-driven partnerships has attracted early interest. Whether it can sustain momentum post-launch will depend on execution, market conditions and the ability to convert presale hype into long-term adoption.\nBonk gains keep hopes alive\nBonk keeps traders alert. Over the past 7 days, the coin slipped 5.93 percent. The slide deepened to 17.55 percent for the past month. Yet over 6 months, BONK is still up 35.96 percent. Current trade sits between 0.00002442 and 0.00002980 dollars, hugging the 10-day average of 0.00002447 and under the 100-day mark at 0.00002571.\nMomentum looks mixed. RSI is 43.95, showing mild selling. Stochastic at 74.54 hints buyers are active. MACD is just below zero, pointing to a flat short-term mood. The nearest ceiling sits at 0.00003197. Beating that could send the token toward 0.00003735.\nIf bulls tire, BONK may drop to the first floor at 0.00002121 or even 0.00001583. From the lower end of today’s range, a jump to the first ceiling offers about 30 percent upside, while a slide to the floor risks near 13 percent. Recent red candles point to more chop, yet the long-term gain keeps hope alive. Reclaiming the 100-day mark could unlock a 7 to 25 percent lift. Otherwise price may drift or slip toward support.\nDogwifhat hints at bounce\nWIF is drifting. The token lost 1.82% this week and 13.16% in a month, slipping below both its 10-day and 100-day averages near $0.93 and $0.97. Yet the six-month score is still up 35.48%, so longer holders are green. A strength gauge at 39 hints that sellers are tiring, while the speed meter at 74 shows traders are still active.\nPrice now moves between $0.89 and $1.08. The first floor sits at $0.78, with a deeper catch at $0.58. On the upside, the first ceiling is $1.16, then $1.35. A close above $1.16 would add roughly 8% from today’s top range and could open a rush toward $1.35, a jump of around 25%. A drop through $0.78 would shave about 15%, and breaking $0.58 would mean another 25% slide.\nShort term, the down-tilted averages and a small negative trend signal point to more chop or a dip toward $0.78. Medium term, the solid six-month gain and fading sell pressure hint at a bounce. If buyers regain control, reclaiming $1.16 looks doable, with $1.35 the stretch mark.\nConclusion\nBONK and WIF stay strong in the 2025 run. XYZVerse, the first all-sport memecoin, aims for 50x growth with GameFi plans and a fan-driven ecosystem ready to lead.\nTo learn more about XYZVerse, visit the official website, Telegram, and Twitter.\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party.

Hedge funds bet against\nStrategy’s long-running role as a high-beta proxy for Bitcoin is showing signs of strain, as hedge funds increasingly dominate trading and its largest shareholder trims exposure.\n- 10x Research warns Strategy’s $360 support is at risk as hedge funds dominate trading.\n- Vanguard cut its stake by 10%, signaling waning confidence.\n- Bitcoin treasuries are losing appeal as volatility declines, with capital flowing to Ethereum plays and crypto IPOs.\nAccording to an Aug. 18 analysis by 10x Research, Strategy has been locked in one of its tightest ranges in years, with $360 repeatedly acting as a key support level. The company’s share price has tested this threshold several times in recent months, reflecting waning volatility and reduced investor conviction.\nThe report highlighted that Vanguard, Strategy’s largest shareholder, reduced its stake by 10% last quarter. While some long-only investors stepped in to buy, hedge funds have since taken control of market activity. This shift has raised the stakes for the $360 level, which could determine whether the stock breaks down further or stages a recovery.\nHistorically, Strategy has provided outsized exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) price swings, but that dynamic may be weakening. The report noted that when the stock lags Bitcoin by around 20% over a month, it has often presented a favorable entry point, but hedge fund-driven trading suggests sentiment is shifting.\nBitcoin treasuries lose their edge\n10x Research compared Strategy’s performance to that of other Bitcoin treasuries and found that companies holding Bitcoin are losing their market appeal. Strategy’s shares are down 13% since mid-July, while Tokyo-listed Metaplanet has dropped 37% over the same period.\nThe analysis linked these declines to a collapse in volatility across both Bitcoin and Strategy, reducing the premium investors once paid for exposure. With less convexity in play, the ability of such companies to amplify Bitcoin’s upside has eroded, limiting their capital-raising power.\nMeanwhile, new investment flows are being pulled toward Ethereum (ETH) treasuries and crypto initial public offerings, which are seen as offering fresher opportunities. According to 10x Research, this shift validates their July 19 call that Bitcoin treasuries would lose their edge as volatility compressed through the summer.\nThe report leaves investors with a key question: should re-entry depend on a specific price level such as $360, or on broader market conditions that could revive demand for treasury-style exposure?", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:28:17 +0000", "author": "Leon Okwatch", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

With Fibonacci, VWAP, and structure aligned, a continuation higher remains the dominant scenario.\n- Dogecoin finds strong support at $0.22 with 0.618 Fibonacci and VWAP confluence.\n- Bullish structure intact with higher highs and higher lows.\n- Sustained bullish volume supports rotation toward $0.32–$0.41.\nDogecoin (Doge) has faced a corrective move after hitting a recent high at $0.28. Despite this pullback, the structure remains bullish as price action finds stability at a strong support zone, suggesting momentum is far from exhausted.\nKey technical points\n- Major Support at $0.22: Confluence of 0.618 Fibonacci and VWAP.\n- Resistance Levels: High timeframe targets at $0.32 and $0.41.\n- Volume Profile: Sustained increases indicate ongoing demand.\nDogecoin’s corrective move from the $0.28 high has not undermined its overall bullish structure. Instead, price has retested the $0.22 high time frame support, a region strengthened by confluence between the 0.618 Fibonacci level and the VWAP. This confluence forms a critical demand zone where buyers are stepping in, allowing price to stabilize before making another attempt toward higher resistances. Maintaining this region is essential for Dogecoin to remain bullish on the daily and weekly time frames.\nStructurally, DOGE continues to print higher highs and higher lows, maintaining a clear bullish trend on the daily timeframe. The current price action appears to be a consolidation within an uptrend rather than a breakdown. A successful defense of the $0.22 support will mark another higher low and build the foundation for continuation toward the next resistance levels.\nVolume also supports this thesis. Despite the price pullback, volume inflows remain elevated, indicating that buyers are absorbing sell pressure. As long as demand remains consistent, the likelihood of reclaiming the value area high continues to increase. A close above this area would signal renewed strength and likely draw in momentum buyers.\nLooking ahead, reclaiming $0.28 would shift focus toward the next resistance zones at $0.32 and $0.41. These are high timeframe levels where sellers may become more active. A clean break above them on rising volume could trigger an extended rally, opening the door for Dogecoin to reach new local highs.\nWhat to expect in the coming price action\nAs long as Dogecoin holds above the $0.22 support level, the broader outlook remains bullish. A reclaim of the $0.28 level, followed by a push toward $0.32 and $0.41, would confirm strength. Sustained volume and structure will be key indicators to watch for in the days ahead.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:13:08 +0000", "author": "Aziz Zamani", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

{"title": "Tourism becomes Thailand’s staging ground for controlled crypto integration", "url": "https://crypto.news/tourism-becomes-thailands-staging-ground-for-controlled-crypto-integration/", "text": "Tourism becomes Thailand’s staging ground for controlled crypto integration\nCan Thailand’s $60 billion tourism industry become the proving ground for crypto payments, turning digital assets from speculative tools into something travelers actually use?\n- Thailand introduced TouristDigiPay on Aug. 18, 2025, allowing foreign visitors to convert crypto into baht and spend through the national QR PromptPay system.\n- Tourism contributed nearly 20% of GDP pre-pandemic. Arrivals fell sharply in 2020 and remain below 2019 levels, with Chinese visitors still 34% lower than before.\n- The program aims to cut card fees, speed settlement, and attract new traveler groups. Analysts estimate even limited use could drive billions in annual transactions, setting Thailand apart from regional peers.\n- The initiative sits within Thailand’s broader digital asset policy, which balances permissioned trading and taxation with high adoption rates and ongoing state projects such as CBDC pilots and cross-border settlement tests.\nThailand wants crypto spending from visitors\nThailand has introduced TouristDigiPay, a system that lets foreign visitors convert crypto into baht and pay through the country’s QR code network. The program launched on Aug. 18, 2025, under the supervision of the Bank of Thailand and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTourists must register with approved providers and complete identity checks, but once onboard, they can pay almost anywhere in the country, from shopping malls to hotels, by scanning the same QR PromptPay codes that locals use every day.\nTourism remains central to Thailand’s economy. Before the pandemic, it accounted for close to 20% of GDP. In 2019, the country welcomed nearly 40 million visitors who spent about $62 billion, according to UN data.\nBorder closures in 2020 cut arrivals to 6.7 million and revenues to under $12 billion. Recovery has been steady but incomplete. In 2023, the number of visitors reached 28 million and spending totaled $47 billion, still below the record years.\nA sharp fall in Chinese travelers has been the biggest gap. More than 10 million visited in 2019, yet outbound travel from China has not recovered.\nData from early 2025 shows arrivals still 34% lower than pre-pandemic levels. Officials see that shortfall as a reason to diversify and attract other visitor groups.\nTouristDigiPay aims to do exactly that. Digital nomads, remote workers, and crypto users represent a growing segment of travelers who typically spend more per trip and prefer digital payment options.\nSurveys estimate that around 15% of adults worldwide hold crypto assets, with ownership rates even higher across parts of Asia. Allowing them to use crypto directly in Thailand makes the country a more appealing destination.\nThe initiative also builds on an existing advantage. QR payments are already part of daily life in Thailand, with more than 70% of consumers using them regularly, according to the Bank for International Settlements.\nMerchants receive baht in their accounts without any change to their routine, while visitors avoid high card fees, cash exchanges, and waiting times.\nInside the Tourist Wallet\nTouristDigiPay is designed to feel simple for visitors, even though a structured process runs underneath.\nThe Bank of Thailand has set up a dedicated Tourist Wallet that acts as the entry point. A traveler begins by registering with a licensed digital asset provider and completing identity checks, a process similar to opening an online bank account.\nLinking the wallet to an approved e-money provider ensures that the system complies with financial security and anti-money laundering rules.\nOnce registration is complete, the visitor can transfer crypto into the Tourist Wallet. At that stage, the system automatically converts the assets into Thai baht.\nMerchants never interact with crypto directly. When the tourist makes a purchase, they scan the same QR PromptPay code that locals use, and the merchant instantly receives baht in their account.\nFrom the seller’s perspective, the transaction looks no different from a payment made by a Thai customer.\nLimits are built into the program to keep spending within controlled ranges. Larger businesses such as hotels and retail outlets can process up to 500,000 baht in payments per tourist each month, while smaller vendors and local shops are capped at 50,000 baht.\nCash withdrawals are not permitted, which means the system cannot be used as a channel to convert crypto into physical currency. Certain high-risk businesses are excluded altogether.\nAuthorities are treating the initiative as a regulatory sandbox. Oversight comes from multiple agencies, including the Bank of Thailand, the SEC, the Anti-Money Laundering Office, and the Ministry of Tourism.\nThe goal is to test the system’s reliability, measure its impact on both visitors and merchants, and ensure that it meets financial and security standards before any wider rollout.\nCutting fees and speeding settlement\nThe launch of TouristDigiPay comes at a time when Thailand is working to capture more value from every visitor. Government forecasts for 2025 project around 35 million arrivals and close to $60 billion in tourism revenue.\nEven if those goals are reached, officials know that transaction costs often erode margins. Credit card networks typically charge merchants 2–3% per transaction, and settlement can take several days.\nA hotel handling $1 million in international bookings could lose $20,000 to $30,000 in fees paid to intermediaries. TouristDigiPay removes much of that burden by converting crypto into baht on the backend and settling instantly through the domestic QR system.\nSmall vendors who depend on quick cash flow stand to benefit even more, since receiving money the same day rather than waiting a week can determine whether inventory expands or stalls.\nThailand’s financial sector also has a stake in the program. Licensed exchanges and e-money providers such as TrueMoney and SCB Easy process the flows and serve as proof points to regulators abroad that the system works.\nAnalysts estimate that if only 5% of the projected 2025 tourism revenue were channeled through TouristDigiPay, transaction volumes would surpass $3 billion.\nThat figure exceeds the entire annual trading volume of some regional crypto exchanges, highlighting the scale of the opportunity for Thai fintech firms.\nThe regional dimension adds further weight. Tourism contributes between 10% and 15% of GDP in neighboring countries such as Vietnam and Cambodia, yet none have linked crypto directly to their visitor economies.\nSingapore has focused on institutional custody and Indonesia on taxation, but both remain far from consumer payments.\nThailand’s approach is different. A visitor can now use it for a beach resort in Krabi, a meal in Phuket, or shopping in Bangkok, while merchants remain shielded from volatility.\nHow the pilot fits Thailand’s crypto rules\nTouristDigiPay is only one piece of Thailand’s wider digital asset picture. The country has been careful in how it approaches crypto: trading and holding are permitted, but everyday payments remain restricted.\nThat policy has been in place since 2022, when the SEC and the Bank of Thailand jointly decided that consumer purchases should stay settled in baht.\nWithin those rules, market infrastructure has expanded steadily. Local exchanges operate under licenses, with Bitkub emerging as the leading homegrown player and preparing for a stock exchange listing.\nGlobal firms have also entered the market. Binance TH, created in partnership with Gulf, launched publicly in 2024 and offers direct baht deposits and withdrawals.\nTax policy has been adjusted to encourage onshore activity. In 2024, value-added tax on crypto transfers through licensed platforms was removed, cutting costs for domestic users.\nA year later, the cabinet approved a five-year exemption on personal income tax for gains made through licensed exchanges, covering 2025 to 2029. These steps are meant to reduce reliance on offshore platforms and bring more trading under domestic oversight.\nAdoption on the ground is already relatively high. Chainalysis ranked Thailand sixteenth in the 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index, placing it among the leading countries worldwide.\nIndependent estimates suggest that more than 20% of adults in Thailand hold Bitcoin or other digital assets, well above the global average of around 15%.\nPublic-sector projects add another layer. The central bank has completed a pilot for a retail central bank digital currency and is advancing cross-border settlement experiments with regional partners in ASEAN.\nProject Nexus, which aims to connect instant payment systems across multiple countries, is scheduled to go live in 2026.\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Finance has announced plans to issue 5 billion baht in digital investment tokens, effectively creating tokenized public debt instruments.\nWhether TouristDigiPay becomes a small side program or the first step toward broader fintech adoption will depend on how well Thailand builds trust, education, and practical blockchain use into everyday life.\nOfficials are approaching it as a test rather than a permanent change, but the decision to link it directly to tourism gives it visibility far beyond a technical pilot.\nIf the program works smoothly, it could strengthen confidence in Thailand’s digital infrastructure, show regulators abroad that crypto can operate safely within existing payment rails, and encourage other countries in the region to experiment.\nThe challenge will be to sustain momentum once the novelty wears off. Tourists may welcome the convenience of spending crypto on a trip. Yet, long-term value will come from how the model integrates into wider financial services, retail activity, and even public-sector innovation.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:11:46 +0000", "author": "Ankish Jain", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

The expected rollout will mark the first-of-its-kind move by the country, and the first official digital currency tied directly to the local fiat.\nTokyo-based fintech firm JPYC will lead the initiative, and will register with regulatory authorities as a licensed money transfer business before launching the token. Once approved, the stablecoin, which will also be named JPYC, will be issued, backed by liquid assets such as bank deposits and Japanese government bonds.\nInterested individuals and institutions will be able to apply to purchase the stablecoins using the yen, and receive the assets using digital wallets. The report added that use cases will include international remittances, as well corporate payments and settlements.\nThe stablecoin is also expected to play a role in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, where blockchain-based products could integrate the yen-backed asset for lending, trading, and asset management services.\nJapan’s stablecoin push follows regulatory adjustments by the FSA earlier this year, after criticism from local industry members over its strict approach to the sector. The revisions classified stablecoins as “currency-denominated assets,” allowing them to be issued by regulated entities.\nHowever, JYPC CEO Norikata Okabe has consistently reiterated that the incoming project cannot be classified as a cryptocurrency.\n“JPYC is an electronic payment method, not a cryptocurrency. It is a currency-denominated asset whose value is linked to fiat currency, combining the best qualities of digital cash and deposits,” he wrote in a recent X post.\nStill, the timing of the efforts suggests Japan is aiming to keep pace with the stablecoin momentum building across Asia.\nStablecoins gain traction in Asia\nIn recent months, several Asian regions, including Hong Kong, South Korea, and China, have been working on their various stablecoin initiatives. Hong Kong has taken the lead, introducing an official framework to guide issuance. Authorities have also signaled readiness to accept applications from potential issuers, though the approval process will be strictly vetted.\nIn South Korea, local digital infrastructure firm Intech recently unveiled South Korea’s first won-pegged stablecoin. In South Korea, local digital infrastructure firm Intech recently unveiled the country’s first won-pegged stablecoin. The token, backed 1:1 by the Korean won, was introduced on August 5 in a controlled pilot phase, following reports of major institutions showing interest in the sector.\nChina, despite still maintaining a cautious stance, is not left out. Insider talks for a potential stablecoin launch are growing, with officials reportedly seeking expert input on how best to issue and implement stablecoins pegged to the yuan.\nMuch of this growing interest follows the recent passage of landmark U.S. GENIUS legislation on stablecoins, which strengthened the asset class’ global appeal. Countries across Asia are now moving to secure a position in the sector and reduce reliance on dollar-pegged assets.\nThe total stablecoin market capitalization currently stands at $259.81 billion, dominated by the two leading U.S. dollar-pegged assets, Tether’s USDT (USDT) and Circle’s USD Coin (USDC).", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:11:48 +0000", "author": "Grace Abidemi", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

He does not recognize privacy as a “killer feature” in that sense.\n“There is lack of pmf for privacy. In of itself it’s not a killer feature that would change user behavior,” said Toly in his post.\nIn this context, concepts such as privacy may have technical or ideological significance, but it doesn’t guarantee widespread adoption. For a feature to drive adoption, it must solve a tangible problem, offer clear utility, and encourage ongoing user engagement.\nAccording to Toly, privacy fails to meet these criteria on its own. It is not a standalone “killer feature” that fundamentally changes user behavior or adoption patterns when it comes to crypto projects.\nIn the discussion thread, the trader on X that started the discussion tried to counter Toly’s point by saying that privacy is still a pretty determining factor, considering there have been incidents on-chain where the system doesn’t hold up to technical attacks like the case of the Hyperliquid whale which triggered mass liquidation due to the sheer size of the perp.\n“Are there not cases where privacy is preferable for certain trades?” asked the trader.\n“No. Complaining about a problem doesn’t mean that that there is pmf for the solution,” said Toly.\nIn an earlier post, former Solana Head of Growth Matty Taylor suggested that the achieving PMF would involve other criteria that are based on features centered on more economic and utility, such as sustainable revenue, demand, and liquidity instead of privacy.\nHow does Solana’s privacy stack up against other chains?\nSolana offers native privacy features through its Token-2022 standard, which supports confidential transfers, encrypted balances, and optional auditor keys. However, these features are opt-in and require token migration.\nSolana also hosts early-stage privacy projects that employ zero-knowledge proofs, such as Elusiv, Arcium, and Light Protocol.\nCompared to other leading chains in privacy, Solana is pushing innovative native and app-layer privacy. However, it is still behind Ethereum (ETH) in terms of institution-grade privacy infrastructure and ecosystem maturity.\nEthereum doesn’t offer privacy at the base layer. Instead, it relies on a mature Layer 2 ecosystem zk-Rollups, zkEVMs, and protocols like Tornado Cash for privacy tooling.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:13:23 +0000", "author": "Trisha Husada", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

A strong bounce from this level on rising volume would confirm a higher low, keeping bulls in control and setting the stage for a retest of $1, with the potential to reach $1.10–$1.15 on the next higher high.\nCardano futures at 5-months high\nIf the uptrend structure continues, Cardano price could extend its rally toward the $1.50 region in the coming weeks, according to crypto analyst Ali Martinez.\nSupporting the bullish outlook, Cardano futures volume has surged to $6.96 billion — its highest in five months — signaling increased participation from derivatives traders. Historically, rising futures activity often precedes stronger spot price moves, suggesting the current pullback could be an ideal “buy the dip” opportunity ahead of a major Cardano rally.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:52:02 +0000", "author": "Darya Nassedkina", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

Futures open interest climbed 22.8% to $46.6 million and derivatives volume surged 367.5% to nearly $99.4 million, according to Coinglass data.\nBinance listing ignites PLUME rally\nBinance announced on Aug. 18 that it will distribute 150 million PLUME tokens, equal to 1.5% of supply, to users who subscribed BNB (BNB) through Simple Earn and On-Chain Yields between July 24 and 27. The exchange said rewards will be distributed ahead of the token’s spot listing, which opens later during the Aug. 18 listing day.\nThis catalyst spurred immediate buying interest, with trading and futures activity nearly eclipsing the token’s entire weekly average in a few hours. Following the listing, Binance will designate 25,000,000 PLUME tokens for marketing and liquidity initiatives. The listing is taking place just two months after Plume launched its mainnet.\nPlume’s rally comes at a time when Binance is actively expanding its HODLer Airdrops initiative, which recently included smaller tokens like LISTA and ETHFI. The program has become a major liquidity driver for early-stage assets, often triggering rapid spikes in trading volume after listings.\nPLUME technical analysis\nThe impact of the listing news is reflected in the price chart. After trading in a narrow band between $0.09 and $0.11 the previous week, Plume surged sharply, breaking through the middle Bollinger band. The price is gaining momentum toward recent highs near $0.1103.\nIn addition, the relative strength index increased, crossing over 60, indicating strong buying pressure but allowing for some room before overbought levels are reached.\nIf the token breaks through the resistance at $0.11, short-term momentum might move it toward the $0.12 range. Support would be around $0.095 if current levels are not maintained, and a deeper pullback towards $0.089 might also happen if sentiment weakens.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:22:23 +0000", "author": "Leon Okwatch", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

KYC black holes, delayed bank transfers, and a random wallet address you hoped was correct. It’s easier now, but not by much. While the situation is certainly better these days, most of the friction and challenges remain — largely stemming from the traditional banking system.\n- DeFi’s next chapter depends on integrating — not replacing — the traditional payment rails it once sought to disrupt.\n- While DeFi and TradFi operate on fundamentally different models, efforts like Visa’s on‑chain stablecoin settlements and Mastercard’s crypto credentials signal real momentum toward bridging the gap.\n- Most consumers and merchants don’t want a financial revolution — they want crypto to “just work” like Apple Pay, and virtual card solutions are quietly delivering that simplicity.\n- True crypto adoption won’t arrive with hype or maximalism — it’ll come through frictionless payments powered by familiar systems, reshaped quietly from the inside out.\nAs a result, we find ourselves in a catch‑22: DeFi still depends on traditional infrastructure rails to scale, even as those same rails slow adoption. Rather than resisting this reality, the next phase of progress comes from leaning into those systems and upgrading them from within.\nIronically, the future of DeFi may depend on the very players it once sought to disrupt (Visa and Mastercard). What initially seemed like a detour is proving to be an advantage. By building on existing rails, we’re finding faster, more practical paths to real-world adoption than starting from scratch ever allowed.\nThe incompatibility between old and new\nDespite serving the same function, DeFi and TradFi couldn’t be more different. On one side, you have a decentralized, 24/7, low-fee, user-centric paradigm of cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, there’s the centralized, often slow, high-fee, and risk-averse legacy structure of the traditional banking system.\nMerging the two results in a Frankenstein’s monster that relies on a centuries-old model to keep up with the demands of the digital age. It doesn’t operate around the clock for near-instant and global transactions (regardless of how you fund your account), incurs excessive and sometimes unreasonable fees through various charges, and delivers anything but a seamless user experience.\nHowever, despite Visa and Mastercard seeming like the cause, they’re simply a manifestation of a deeper problem — outdated policies imposed by bureaucratic structures. Luckily, those policies are shifting. We’re seeing early moves that could reshape the landscape, like Visa settling stablecoins directly on-chain, and Mastercard launching crypto credential pilots. These are foundational shifts that could unlock real crypto spending at scale.\nReprogramming an outdated system\nDespite the increasing adoption of crypto as an asset or investment, most users still struggle to use it as a means of exchange, something you can actually spend day to day. It doesn’t help that most businesses face hurdles in accepting crypto, unwilling or unable to adopt it due to perceived complexities, regulatory concerns, and a lack of understanding.\nForcing merchants to adapt for the convenience of a niche group of individuals is counterproductive, and so is the move toward crypto cards issued by Visa or Mastercard. If we want real adoption, we have to work with the system we have. Not because we agree with it. But because it’s already everywhere. And guess what? There are web3 projects out there that fully understand this. They are rolling out revolutionary solutions that don’t aim to rebuild from the ground up, but just take what works and make it crypto-friendly.\nThe best example of such an approach is virtual cards that bridge the existing infrastructure and the crypto by leveraging NFC to enable seamless transactions akin to Apple Pay without requiring a physical card. The concept is straightforward: users download an app, fund a dedicated crypto wallet, and then spend their digital assets at any store equipped with a standard Visa or Mastercard POS system. Merchants receive fiat currency while users pay with crypto, bypassing the usual card network intermediaries and their fees. All conversions happen instantly in the background, making crypto spending effortless.\nTrue progress is quiet\nThe current status quo is personal. Years in fintech have shown me that while crypto holds revolutionary promise, the average user doesn’t want a revolution. They want to tap, pay, and move on. That’s what wins. Visa and Mastercard are now the unlikely partners making that possible.\nOf course, this doesn’t mean all is solved. Traditional banking still imposes restrictions. Regulatory inertia still slows innovation. On top of everything, there are 1.4 billion unbanked people who deserve better. But if crypto is to become truly usable, it needs access to the rails that already move money today.\nAnd in a space often defined by hype cycles and tribalism, that’s the kind of quiet, powerful progress we should be paying attention to. Crypto’s next leap won’t be a flashy headline. It’ll be a swipe, a tap, or a transaction powered by the very giants it once hoped to topple.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:08:57 +0000", "author": "Guest Post", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\nXRP and Litecoin are strengthening on whale activity and mining growth, while Pepeto’s presale is gaining traction with zero-fee trading, cross-chain tools, and rising investor demand.\nTable of Contents\n- XRP hovers near $3.1 after SEC appeals fade and whales accumulate, with analysts targeting $3.50–$4 by late 2025.\n- Litecoin trades around $119 as mining difficulty hits record highs, with strategists eyeing a potential move toward $260.\n- Pepeto’s Ethereum-based presale has raised over $6.2m, backed by its zero-fee DEX, native bridge, and staking rewards, drawing strong whale interest ahead of Tier 1 listing chatter.\nXRP is climbing again as broader sentiment improves. LTC is firming as Litecoin mining activity increases.\nAt the same time, Pepeto (PEPETO) is emerging as an Ethereum memecoin presale built around working utility. It brings zero fee trading through PepetoSwap, a native cross chain bridge, a $0.000000147 entry, around 243% staking targets in the docs, and $6.2m plus raised ahead of Tier 1 listing chatter.\nCould these plays double soon, and could a Pepeto listing unlock bigger upside? Let’s find out.\nLitecoin’s miner momentum hints at further gains\nLike the XRP price, LTC is advancing, helped by a fresh surge in Litecoin mining. At the moment, Litecoin trades near $119 after logging 19 green sessions over the last month.\nMining activity has expanded with the market’s recovery. Per CoinWarz, Litecoin’s mining difficulty stands at 97.15 million, the highest since the platform went live. For context, mining difficulty measures how tough it is to produce a valid block.\nStrategists see room for LTC to double if the mining trend continues. Should that base case hold, Litecoin could reach $260. Unilabs is also pushing higher, with early buyers moving into its ICO.\nXRP nears $3.1 as whales step in and SEC appeals fade\nXRP’s tone has turned constructive: the SEC recently withdrew its appeals against Ripple, whales are active according to analyst Ali Martinez, and price hovers near $3.1 after a steady climb.\nCorporate footprints are growing too, with Flora Growth disclosing holdings in a 10-Q, Ault Capital Group putting $10 million through Hyperscale Data, and Webus International outlining a $300 million plan in a Form 6-K.\nWith supply in the billions and a sizable market cap, a 100x surge is unrealistic, but most base cases see $3.50–$4 by late 2025. Even so, some desks flag a higher lane, saying the setup could stretch toward $6.58 if momentum and adoption hold.\nPepeto’s zero-fee DEX momentum, low entry put its presale in focus\nWhile XRP and LTC push higher, Pepeto is drawing fast interest from traders who prefer working tools over pure hype.\nIts core stack centers on PepetoSwap, a zero fee DEX that trims costs and improves fills, and the native Pepeto Bridge, which shifts assets across chains in one app with quicker settlement and safer flows. Together, they tackle the friction that holds back memecoin trading at scale.\nPepeto is also taking shape as a hub for credible memecoin listings, opening applications on its exchange to surface stronger teams and focus volume where tools already live.\nThe presale has passed 6.2 million dollars raised at 0.000000147 dollars, with this stage nearing completion as attention builds around Tier 1 listing chatter. And while mood for XRP and the recent mining boost for LTC remains upbeat, both sit well above a dollar.\nAt this lower entry price, Pepeto aims to level the field for early buyers. Whales are already taking tranches, pointing to a setup that echoes prior memecoins before their big runs. With that tailwind, several analysts expect at least a 50x move after launch, a path that could reward early entries if listings and usage arrive as planned.\nFinal takeaway\nXRP is strengthening as the market steadies, and LTC extends gains on rising mining. Both look constructive.\nBut the name taking the spotlight now is Pepeto (PEPETO). It brings a zero fee DEX with PepetoSwap, a native cross chain bridge, and staking up to 243% APY according to the official website. The presale sits at 0.000000147 dollars with more than 6.2 million dollars raised, the demo exchange is live, Tier 1 listing chatter is picking up, and whales are already sizing up positions as the best memecoin to buy now.\nThis is a clear early window. Whales are buying Pepeto for a reason, and they usually act before the news cycle. If listings hit and usage scales, several desks see room for roughly a 50x after launch.\nIncome and upside at a glance: XRP, LTC, Pepeto\n| Asset | Current Price | Potential Price Scenario(s) | Key Growth Drivers | Other Income Offerings |\n| XRP | $3.10 | Base case: $3.50–$4 by late 2025; Stretch: $6.58 if momentum and adoption persist | SEC appeals withdrawn against Ripple; whale activity flagged by Ali Martinez; corporate disclosures from Flora Growth, Ault Capital Group ($10M via Hyperscale Data), and Webus International ($300M plan) | None |\n| LTC | $119 | If trend holds: up to $260 on continued mining strength | Market rebound; rising Litecoin mining activity; sustained positive sessions | Rewards from personal LTC mining |\n| Pepeto (PEPETO) | $0.000000147 (presale) | Analyst scenario: 50× post-launch ≈ $0.00000735 if listings and usage scale | Zero-fee DEX PepetoSwap; native cross-chain bridge; staking targets ~243% APY; demo exchange live; $6.2M+ raised; whales positioning; Tier-1 listing chatter; Ethereum mainnet | Staking with ~243% APY targets in docs |\nDisclaimer : To buy PEPETO, make sure to use the official website: https://pepeto.io/ As the listing draws closer, some are attempting to capitalize on the hype by using the name to mislead investors with fake platforms.

The day’s decline extends the downturn that commenced over the weekend, marking a 10.6% drop from its this month’s peak above $4,759.\nThe drop in Ethereum’s price marks a strong reversal of its multi-day rally just last week, which lifted this month’s gains above 60%. But what’s driving the pullback?\nEthereum price crash explained: profit-taking and longs get rekt\nEthereum’s decline comes amid a wave of liquidations. Over the weekend, billions of dollars in leveraged long positions were wiped out as Ethereum dropped through key support levels, triggering a wave of forced selling.\nIn the past 24 hours alone, more than $870 million worth of crypto positions have been liquidated, with ETH alone accounting for roughly $210.6 million according to data from Coinglass. This marks nearly double the liquidations seen in Bitcoin (BTC), underscoring how heavily traders were leveraged on Ethereum’s upside. The cascade of unwinding pushed prices lower fast, amplifying losses.\nAnother key driver of the price dip is a cooldown in Ethereum exchange-traded funds. After recording their strongest week since launch, the nine U.S.-listed funds closed their latest session in the red.\nData from SoSoValue shows that five issuers recorded heavy outflows, with the largest single withdrawal topping $272 million, pointing to profit-taking among investors who piled in earlier this month. On-chain data shows a similar trend among retail investors, who are also locking in gains and adding to the selling pressure.\nBut ETH’s losses are not happening in isolation, and mirror the broader weakness in the crypto market. BTC is down about 2.3% on the day, while other major altcoins like Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) have dropped around 5%. The broader pullback comes amid shifting macro expectations, particularly ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech this week and growing uncertainty around rate cuts, adding pressure on risk assets across the board.\nWhy is Ethereum down?\nWhile the long-term outlook for ETH remains strong, near-term signals are mixed. From a technical perspective, ETH is holding just above the 20-day EMA at $4,134. If it fails to hold up this level, it could face further downside, with the next major support sitting at the 50-day EMA around $3,651.\nFurther breakdown beyond that next support would mark a deeper correction, potentially erasing much of the recent rally’s gains.\nAt the same time, momentum indicators are showing caution. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has cooled to 58, down from overbought territory above 70 earlier this month. This suggests buyers are losing steam and the market is shifting toward a more neutral setup.\nTo regain bullish traction, ETH would need to reclaim $4,500 to signal renewed strength, and a push beyond $4,750 to $4,800 remains the key hurdle before any attempt at fresh highs.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:12:25 +0000", "author": "Grace Abidemi", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\nCardano and Solana face new pressure in 2025 as Layer Brett rises with fast transactions, Ethereum Layer 2 security, and eye-catching staking rewards.\nTable of Contents\n- Cardano lags under $1 with slow upgrades and weak yields, while Solana struggles with repeated network outages despite high throughput.\n- Layer Brett offers 10,000+ TPS, sub-penny fees, and 9000% APY staking rewards, drawing investor attention in its $0.0042 presale.\n- With fully functional Ethereum Layer 2 tech and fast-growing community support, Layer Brett is positioning itself as a strong alternative to ADA and SOL in 2025.\nCardano and Solana have long been pillars of the crypto world, but 2025 is testing their dominance. While ADA struggles below $1 and SOL faces network instability, a new Layer 2 contender is stealing the spotlight.\nLayer Brett (LBRETT), with its 9000% APY staking rewards and $0.0042 presale price, is drawing capital away from these established chains. The shift highlights a growing appetite for projects that combine real utility with explosive growth potential.\nCardano’s uphill battle\nCardano’s methodical approach once set it apart. Now it risks leaving it behind. The network processes just 250 transactions per second. Fees can spike during congestion. While ADA holders wait for Hydra upgrades to materialize, the token has lost 16% year-to-date. Analysts note that even a return to $1 would require $14 billion in new investment. That kind of capital inflow is increasingly flowing elsewhere.\nLayer Brett offers what Cardano can’t. Built on Ethereum Layer 2, it handles 10,000+ TPS with fees under a penny. The 9000% APY staking rewards turn idle holdings into income generators. This combination of speed and yield is proving irresistible to ADA holders tired of waiting.\nSolana’s speed comes at a cost\nSolana’s 65,000 TPS throughput remains impressive. But network outages continue to plague the chain. The most recent occurred just last week, freezing transactions for nearly two hours. SOL’s price has struggled to hold above $200 despite bullish predictions. Institutional interest remains strong, but retail traders are growing wary of the technical risks.\nLayer Brett matches Solana’s speed without the downtime. As an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, it inherits battle-tested security while processing transactions in seconds. The presale’s 9000% APY adds another dimension Solana can’t match. While SOL offers modest staking rewards, LBRETT delivers life-changing yields for early participants.\nWhy Layer Brett is standing out\nThe crypto market is evolving. Investors want more than just promises. They want performance. Layer Brett delivers on three key fronts.\nTechnology that works today\nCardano’s Hydra upgrade remains incomplete. Solana’s outages persist. Layer Brett’s Ethereum Layer 2 foundation is fully operational. Transactions confirm in seconds. Fees stay under a penny. This isn’t future potential. It’s live functionality.\nRewards that matter\nCardano offers 4-5% staking yields. Solana provides slightly better returns. Layer Brett’s presale stakers are locking in 9000% APY. These rewards decrease as more participants join, creating urgency among yield-hungry investors.\nCommunity-driven growth\nA $1 million giveaway fuels engagement.

This shift in outlook limited risk appetite and triggered outflows from speculative assets.\nAt the same time, comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott confirmed that Bitcoin will not be added to national reserves, signaling a more cautious fiscal approach. That announcement trimmed some of the bullish momentum built up during the rally.\nBitcoin exchange flows point to profit-taking\nAccording to an Aug. 16 analysis by BorisVets, Binance netflows flipped positive last week as Bitcoin (BTC) inflows surged, while outflows slowed. This marked the start of a distribution phase, where whales prepared to sell into new demand.\nAhead of Bitcoin’s all-time high attempt, inflows surged and Binance’s exchange reserves climbed, confirming that supply was moving onto the platform. Sellers moved swiftly to exploit overextended longs after the rally stalled below the peak. The perpetual–spot price gap widened, pointing to excessive leverage and creating ideal conditions for a sharp pullback.\nAt the same time, stablecoin netflows into Binance increased, showing buyers were still eager to enter the market. This created an imbalance in which fresh buyers stepped in while whales offloaded positions. Given Binance’s outsized trading volume, such shifts strongly influence global sentiment, amplifying volatility across the board.\nBitcoin technical analysis\nFrom a technical perspective, Bitcoin has fallen below the Bollinger Band’s midpoint, with $114,600 serving as crucial support. The relative strength index has cooled to near-oversold territory, suggesting that the momentum on the downside may soon slow.\nSince the overall trend has weakened, a sustained break below $114,000 might indicate more downside toward $112,000. A recovery above $117,500 would be a good sign for the bulls that the pullback is ending and might result in another attempt at $120,000.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 07:46:33 +0000", "author": "Leon Okwatch", "source": "https://crypto.news/feed/"}

This boost was primarily driven by robust growth in Bitdeer's self-mining operations and the external sale of SEALMINER A2s, which contributed $69.5 million to the revenue.\nDespite the revenue growth, Bitdeer recorded a net loss of $147.7 million, a significant increase from the $17.7 million loss in the same period last year. The gross profit also saw a decline, dropping to $12.8 million from $24.4 million in Q2 2024.\nOperational Developments\nBitdeer is on track to achieve a self-mining capacity of 40 EH/s by the end of October, with expectations to exceed this target by the year's end. The company's Chief Business Officer, Matt Kong, highlighted improvements in wafer supply allocations at Bitdeer's foundry, which are expected to support further growth in their self-mining capabilities.\nThe company is advancing its research and development efforts, particularly focusing on the SEALMINER A4 project. The new chip is aimed at achieving unprecedented energy efficiency, with significant progress made in July in silicon software development and engineering team expansion.\nInfrastructure and Future Prospects\nOn the infrastructure front, Bitdeer has energized 361 MW of datacenter capacity for self-mining, bringing the total available electrical capacity to approximately 1.3 GW, with plans to increase this to over 1.6 GW by the end of the year. The company has also signed an agreement with AEP Ohio for the second phase of Clarington, advancing towards a full capacity of 570 MW.\nIn addition, Bitdeer is in advanced negotiations with a development partner for its Clarington, Ohio site, focusing on high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. This move is expected to enhance Bitdeer's competitive position and unlock substantial value for its customers and shareholders.\nChallenges and Strategic Adjustments\nDespite its growth, Bitdeer faced challenges such as increased costs of revenue, which surged to $142.8 million, primarily due to heightened costs associated with SEALMINER sales and higher depreciation expenses. These factors contributed to the lower gross margin of 8.2%, down from 24.6% in the previous year.\nLooking ahead, Bitdeer remains optimistic about continued growth in its self-mining hashrate and financial performance improvement, supported by strategic infrastructure investments and technological advancements.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 04:56:10 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

This downturn appears to be driven primarily by technical factors rather than fundamental news, as no significant developments have emerged for MANTRA in recent days.\nThe absence of fresh catalysts has left OM vulnerable to broader market sentiment and technical selling pressure. Trading volume on Binance spot reached $8.69 million over the past 24 hours, suggesting moderate investor interest despite the price decline.\nOM Technical Analysis: Neutral Signals Emerge\nMANTRA technical analysis reveals a complex picture with mixed signals across different timeframes. The OM RSI currently reads 43.42, placing it firmly in neutral territory - neither oversold nor overbought. This suggests that while selling pressure exists, MANTRA hasn't reached extreme levels that typically signal immediate reversal opportunities.\nThe MACD indicator presents a more concerning picture for OM bulls, with the histogram showing -0.0029, indicating bearish momentum is building. MANTRA's MACD line sits below the signal line, reinforcing the short-term negative outlook.\nMoving averages paint an interesting story for OM price action. The shorter-term averages (SMA 7, SMA 20, EMA 12, and EMA 26) all cluster around $0.26, creating a tight resistance zone just above current levels. However, the dramatic gap to the SMA 200 at $2.60 highlights the significant distance MANTRA has fallen from its previous highs.\nMANTRA's Stochastic indicators show oversold conditions with %K at 4.32 and %D at 19.41, potentially setting up for a short-term bounce if buying interest emerges.\nMANTRA Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, MANTRA support levels are clearly defined in the current market structure. The immediate support for OM sits at $0.22, which represents a critical level for maintaining the current trading range. Should this level fail, MANTRA faces a more significant support test at $0.19.\nOn the upside, OM resistance appears formidable at $0.30, which aligns closely with the cluster of moving averages. This creates a technical ceiling that MANTRA bulls must overcome to shift momentum. The stronger resistance at $0.40 represents a more ambitious target that would require substantial volume and positive catalysts.\nThe Bollinger Bands analysis shows OM trading near the lower portion of its range, with the price positioned at 0.2591 on the %B indicator. The upper band at $0.29 serves as another resistance confirmation, while the lower band at $0.23 provides additional support context.\nShould You Buy OM Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor short-term traders, the current OM price setup presents a challenging environment. The neutral RSI suggests limited immediate downside protection, while the bearish MACD momentum indicates potential for further weakness. Conservative traders might wait for either a clear break above $0.30 resistance or a test of the $0.22 support level before establishing positions.\nSwing traders focusing on MANTRA might find value in the current oversold Stochastic readings, particularly if broader market conditions stabilize. However, the risk-reward ratio favors waiting for clearer directional signals, given the tight clustering of moving averages creating resistance overhead.\nLong-term investors should note the dramatic gap between current OM price levels and the 200-day moving average, suggesting MANTRA remains in a significant downtrend on longer timeframes. The 52-week range from $0.20 to $8.50 illustrates the extreme volatility this asset has experienced.\nRisk management remains crucial for any OM position, with stop-losses below $0.22 for long positions and profit targets near $0.29-$0.30 for any short-term bounces.\nConclusion\nMANTRA's current price action reflects a market in transition, with OM trading at critical technical levels that will likely determine near-term direction. The 5% decline has brought the token to important support areas, while mixed technical indicators suggest traders should remain cautious. Over the next 24-48 hours, watch for OM's ability to hold above $0.22 support and any volume-driven moves toward the $0.30 resistance cluster. Without fresh fundamental catalysts, MANTRA price will likely remain dependent on technical factors and broader cryptocurrency market sentiment.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:06:10 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "VeChain Enhances Governance with VeBetterDAO Proposal Updates", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/vechain-enhances-governance-with-vebetterdao-proposal-updates", "text": "VeChain has announced a series of updates to its VeBetterDAO governance framework, aiming to enhance proposal quality, balance participation, and boost engagement among stakeholders. According to VeChain Official, these changes are designed to address challenges within the existing governance system while strengthening the overall process.\nIdentified Challenges\nThe recent proposal highlighted several issues with the current governance system, such as the absence of entry barriers, which led to an influx of low-value or duplicate proposals. Additionally, ambiguous proposals slowed decision-making, and the flat 2% quorum of all VOT3 tokens for proposal support made it difficult for smaller stakeholders to participate. Furthermore, supporters faced a disadvantage as their locked VOT3 tokens did not yield rewards, discouraging their backing of proposals.\nImplemented Changes\nTo address these issues, VeChain has introduced a set of new requirements and adjustments. A significant change is the requirement of a Moon-level GM NFT to create proposals, ensuring long-term commitment from authors and reducing spam. Additionally, a mandatory “List of Changes” section categorizes amendments as Removed, Modified, or Added Features. Future updates will include the use of B3MO as an AI agent for proposal reviews and the creation of Discourse threads before proposal submissions.\nAdjustments to current parameters include a Maximum Support cap of 5 million VOT3 tokens to prevent disproportionate influence by large holders. VOT3 tokens used to support proposals will now count toward voting power in weekly allocation voting rounds, allowing users to remain eligible for rewards during the lock-up period. This ensures active governance participation is not penalized while maintaining a meaningful cost for voting and endorsement.\nImportance of Community Engagement\nGovernance is crucial for VeBetterDAO's sustainability and growth. The new changes aim to create a healthier governance ecosystem by ensuring broad participation, informed engagement, and shared accountability. VeChain remains committed to fostering an environment where every stakeholder can contribute meaningfully, aligning with its mission to drive sustainable innovation.\nAnother Step Forward\nThe implementation of these governance refinements marks a significant step forward for the VeBetter ecosystem. By combining higher submission standards, fairer thresholds, and aligned incentives, the process is now better equipped to handle proposals that genuinely benefit the ecosystem.

{"title": "ETHFI Price Drops 8% Despite Foundation Buyback Program as Technical Indicators Show Mixed Signals", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-ethfi-price-drops-8-despite-foundation-buyback-program-as-technical", "text": "Quick Take\n• ETHFI currently trading at $1.14 (-8.16% in 24h) • Ether.Fi RSI at 48.72 shows neutral momentum despite recent volatility • Foundation buyback program provided temporary support but failed to sustain bullish momentum\nWhat's Driving Ether.Fi Price Today?\nThe ETHFI price continues to face downward pressure despite the Ether.Fi Foundation's recent buyback program launch. Over the past 48 hours, ETHFI has declined 8.16%, dropping from the $1.26 high to test support at $1.12. This movement represents a continuation of the bearish sentiment that emerged after the initial buyback-driven rally.\nThe Foundation's $2.58 million buyback program initially sparked a 9% surge on August 9th, pushing the ETHFI price above key resistance levels to $1.22. However, this bullish momentum proved short-lived as broader market dynamics and profit-taking activities led to subsequent declines. Despite the buyback providing fundamental support, the ETHFI price has fallen 6.4% since August 12th, indicating that institutional buying alone cannot counter prevailing market forces.\nThe current price action suggests that while the Foundation's buyback program offers a fundamental floor, technical factors and market sentiment continue to drive short-term ETHFI price movements. The 24-hour trading volume of $21.2 million on Binance spot market indicates healthy liquidity, though the selling pressure has overwhelmed recent buying interest.\nETHFI Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nEther.Fi technical analysis reveals a complex picture with both bullish and bearish indicators present. The ETHFI RSI at 48.72 sits in neutral territory, suggesting neither oversold nor overbought conditions. This positioning provides flexibility for price movement in either direction, making the ETHFI price sensitive to immediate market catalysts.\nEther.Fi's MACD histogram shows a positive reading of 0.0016, indicating emerging bullish momentum despite the recent price decline. The MACD line at 0.0176 remains above the signal line at 0.0159, suggesting that the underlying trend momentum for Ether.Fi may be stabilizing. This divergence between price action and momentum indicators often signals potential reversal opportunities.\nThe moving average structure presents a mixed outlook for ETHFI technical analysis. While Ether.Fi trades below the 7-day SMA at $1.21 and 12-day EMA at $1.18, it maintains support above the 20-day SMA at $1.13. Most significantly, the ETHFI price remains well above the 200-day SMA at $0.96, confirming the longer-term bullish trend remains intact.\nEther.Fi's Bollinger Bands show the price trading near the middle band at $1.13, with a %B position of 0.5236. This positioning suggests balanced momentum, though the recent volatility has expanded the bands to create a wider trading range between $0.91 and $1.35.\nEther.Fi Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical Ether.Fi support levels are emerging at $1.12, which coincides with the recent 24-hour low and represents immediate downside protection. Below this level, ETHFI faces stronger support at $0.90, followed by the robust support zone at $0.89. These levels align with previous consolidation areas and represent potential accumulation zones for value-seeking traders.\nOn the upside, ETHFI resistance appears at $1.39, which corresponds to recent rejection levels where selling pressure intensified. A decisive break above this level could target the stronger resistance at $1.41, representing a significant technical barrier that has contained previous rallies. The daily ATR of $0.12 suggests that moves of this magnitude are well within Ether.Fi's normal volatility range.\nThe ETHFI/USDT trading pair shows particular sensitivity around the $1.17 pivot point, which has acted as both support and resistance during recent sessions. This level represents a critical inflection point where market sentiment shifts between bullish and bearish bias.\nShould You Buy ETHFI Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nBased on Binance spot market data, the current ETHFI price of $1.14 presents a complex risk-reward scenario that varies significantly by trading style and timeframe. For swing traders, the proximity to key support levels combined with the Foundation's buyback program creates a potentially attractive entry point, especially if ETHFI can hold above $1.12.\nShort-term traders should focus on the ETHFI resistance at $1.39 as a primary target, representing approximately 22% upside potential from current levels. However, risk management becomes crucial given the recent volatility, with stops recommended below $1.12 to limit downside exposure to the $0.90 support zone.\nLong-term investors may find the current ETHFI price attractive considering the distance from the 52-week high of $2.82, though the recent selling pressure suggests patience may be required for meaningful appreciation. The Foundation's buyback program provides fundamental support that could limit severe downside moves while building a base for future growth.\nDay traders should monitor the $1.17 pivot level closely, as breaks above or below this level often trigger momentum moves toward the respective resistance or support zones. The neutral ETHFI RSI provides room for movement in either direction, making breakout strategies potentially profitable.\nConclusion\nThe ETHFI price faces a critical juncture at $1.14, where technical indicators suggest a period of consolidation before the next directional move. Despite the Foundation's buyback program providing fundamental support, recent selling pressure indicates that market dynamics continue to influence short-term price action. Traders should monitor the $1.12 support level closely over the next 24-48 hours, as a break below could accelerate moves toward $0.90, while a bounce could target the $1.39 resistance zone. The neutral RSI and positive MACD histogram suggest that Ether.Fi technical analysis favors patience over aggressive positioning until clearer directional signals emerge.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:54:26 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

This case highlights the potential legal risks developers face, potentially hindering innovation in privacy-preserving technologies.\nMichele Korver, Head of Regulatory at a16z crypto, emphasized the ongoing legal battle and the importance of protecting developers through legislation and regulatory rule-making. She noted that Storm has multiple grounds for appeal, indicating that the legal discourse around blockchain is far from settled.\nInnovative Governance Models for DAOs\nIn governance advancements, the Uniswap Foundation has proposed adopting the Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA) model. This legal framework aims to legitimize DAOs' operations without compromising decentralization. If approved, Uniswap Governance would become the largest DAO to adopt this model, setting a precedent for decentralized governance structures.\nSimilarly, Towns Protocol has introduced its own DUNA structure, Towns Lodge, further highlighting the shift towards innovative governance models in the blockchain space.\nAs blockchain continues to gain traction in traditional finance, its integration promises to reshape financial systems, enhancing efficiency and security. However, navigating the legal and regulatory landscapes remains a critical challenge for developers and institutions alike.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 03:22:10 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "LayerZero (ZRO) Tests $2.06 Support as RSI Shows Neutral Zone Trading", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-layerzero-zro-tests-206-support-as-rsi-shows-neutral-zone", "text": "Quick Take\n• ZRO currently trading at $2.06 (-5.15% in 24h) • LayerZero's RSI remains neutral at 51.32 while MACD histogram shows bullish divergence • No major news catalysts in past week, price action driven by technical factors\nWhat's Driving LayerZero Price Today?\nThe ZRO price movement appears primarily technical in nature, with no significant news events or catalysts emerging in the past seven days. This absence of fundamental drivers has left LayerZero vulnerable to broader market sentiment and technical trading patterns.\nThe current 5.15% decline brings ZRO price closer to its immediate support zone, testing trader confidence in the absence of positive catalysts. The trading range of $2.01 to $2.21 over the past 24 hours demonstrates the ongoing consolidation phase that LayerZero has entered.\nVolume data from Binance spot market shows $5.03 million in 24-hour trading activity, indicating moderate interest despite the price decline. This volume level suggests that while selling pressure exists, it hasn't reached panic levels that might signal a more severe correction.\nZRO Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals as Momentum Builds\nLayerZero technical analysis reveals a complex picture with both bullish and bearish elements competing for control. The most encouraging signal comes from ZRO's MACD configuration, where the histogram reading of 0.0143 indicates building bullish momentum despite the recent price decline.\nZRO RSI currently sits at 51.32, placing LayerZero firmly in neutral territory. This positioning suggests that neither buying nor selling pressure has reached extreme levels, leaving room for movement in either direction based on market developments.\nThe moving average structure presents mixed signals for ZRO price action. While LayerZero trades above its 20-period SMA at $1.97 and 50-period SMA at $2.00, it remains below the 7-period SMA at $2.16, indicating short-term weakness within a longer-term consolidation pattern.\nLayerZero's Bollinger Bands show ZRO price positioned at 60.61% of the band width, sitting closer to the upper band at $2.40 than the lower band at $1.54. This positioning suggests that despite recent declines, ZRO maintains relative strength within its recent trading range.\nThe Average True Range (ATR) of $0.17 provides insight into ZRO's current volatility levels, offering traders a gauge for position sizing and stop-loss placement in the current market environment.\nLayerZero Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nThe current ZRO price action centers around critical technical levels that will determine near-term direction. LayerZero support levels converge around $1.64, representing both immediate and strong support according to technical analysis. This level coincides closely with the 52-week low of $1.60, making it a psychological barrier for traders.\nOn the upside, ZRO resistance appears concentrated at $2.60, where both immediate and strong resistance levels align. Breaking above this level would signal a potential shift in LayerZero's technical outlook and could attract renewed buying interest.\nThe pivot point at $2.09 sits just above the current ZRO price of $2.06, suggesting that LayerZero is testing crucial support in real-time. A decisive break below this level could accelerate selling toward the $1.64 support zone.\nTraders should note that the distance between current ZRO price and the 52-week high of $6.99 illustrates the significant upside potential that exists if LayerZero can establish a sustained bullish trend above key resistance levels.\nShould You Buy ZRO Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nBased on Binance spot market data, the current ZRO price setup offers different opportunities depending on trading style and risk tolerance. Conservative traders might wait for a clear break above $2.60 resistance before considering long positions, as this would confirm bullish momentum.\nAggressive traders could consider accumulating ZRO around current levels, using the $1.64 support as a stop-loss reference point. This approach offers a favorable risk-reward ratio, with potential upside to $2.60 representing approximately 26% gains against downside risk of roughly 20% to strong support.\nSwing traders should monitor the ZRO/USDT pair for a decisive break of the current consolidation range. The combination of neutral RSI readings and building MACD momentum suggests that a significant move may be approaching, though direction remains uncertain.\nDay traders can utilize the established trading range, buying near $2.01 support and selling near $2.21 resistance, while maintaining tight risk management given the current volatility profile.\nConclusion\nZRO price faces a critical juncture at $2.06, with technical indicators providing mixed signals about near-term direction. While LayerZero's RSI remains neutral and MACD suggests building momentum, the absence of fundamental catalysts leaves price action dependent on technical factors. Traders should watch for a break above $2.60 resistance or below $1.64 support to signal the next significant move in the ZRO/USDT pair over the next 24-48 hours.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:42:34 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "Monaco: Revolutionizing Onchain Trading with Wall Street-Grade Performance", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/monaco-revolutionizing-onchain-trading-wall-street-grade-performance", "text": "The financial landscape is witnessing a seismic shift as traditional assets transition to blockchain-based systems, driven by the rise of tokenization and the demand for round-the-clock trading. According to Sei, a pioneering force in decentralized finance, Monaco is emerging as a game-changer in this evolving scenario.\nIntroducing Monaco: A Wall Street-Grade Trading Layer\nMonaco is a Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) designed to provide institutional-level performance while adhering to decentralized principles. By offering a shared liquidity layer, Monaco allows applications to tap into deep institutional liquidity without needing to establish their own trading infrastructure. This innovative platform is set to become the default trading layer for the burgeoning onchain economy, covering crypto assets, real-world assets, prediction markets, and gaming economies.\nThe Onchain Future\nThe global financial market is increasingly embracing tokenization, with projections estimating a $30 trillion tokenized market by 2034. Traditional financial systems, with their limitations like market closures and multi-day settlements, are inadequate for this onchain future. The shift towards tokenization is further emphasized by industry leaders. For instance, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has noted that tokenizing assets could revolutionize investment by eliminating settlement delays and allowing immediate reinvestment into the economy.\nMonaco's Technical Prowess\nMonaco's infrastructure achieves breakthrough performance with execution times of less than 1 millisecond and settlement on Sei in just 400 milliseconds. This translates into a 200,000x improvement compared to T+1 settlement times, aligning Monaco's capabilities with those of established financial giants like Nasdaq and NYSE.\nShared Liquidity and Revenue Sharing\nMonaco's shared liquidity model eliminates the need for decentralized exchange builders to bootstrap their own liquidity, allowing them to focus on delivering a superior trading experience. This model ensures tighter spreads and better pricing, especially for institutional traders seeking a Wall Street-grade experience. Moreover, Monaco's PitPass offers a transparent revenue-sharing mechanism, enabling applications to earn from trade volumes without complex agreements.\nThe Future of Trading Infrastructure\nMonaco's architecture fosters powerful network effects, where increased adoption leads to deeper liquidity, tighter spreads, and better pricing, creating a virtuous cycle of growth. This positions Monaco as the go-to trading infrastructure for institutional onchain activities and the ideal platform for launching high-performance trading applications.\nAs the financial system continues to evolve, Monaco is not just leveling the playing field but redefining it, making decentralized Wall Street a tangible reality.

{"title": "JasmyCoin (JASMY) Consolidates at $0.02 Following Rally as Technical Signals Turn Mixed", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-jasmycoin-jasmy-consolidates-at-002-following-rally-as-technical-signals", "text": "Quick Take\n• JASMY currently trading at $0.02 (-5.66% in 24h) • JasmyCoin RSI sits in neutral territory at 47.63, indicating consolidation phase • Panasonic and Chainlink partnerships drove 12.7% surge earlier this week\nWhat's Driving JasmyCoin Price Today?\nThe JASMY price is experiencing a natural pullback after last week's impressive rally, which was primarily fueled by strategic partnership announcements with Panasonic and Chainlink on August 13th. This development enhanced JasmyCoin's adoption prospects in Asia and triggered a 12.7% price surge that pushed JASMY above key resistance levels.\nThe partnership with Panasonic represents a significant milestone for JasmyCoin's Internet of Things (IoT) data ecosystem, while the Chainlink integration expands its technical capabilities. However, the current -5.66% daily decline suggests profit-taking activity following the recent gains, which is typical after such substantial moves.\nTechnical analysis from August 13th showed JasmyCoin forming a bullish engulfing pattern near $0.01837, accompanied by a volume spike to $42 million. This pattern indicated strong buying pressure from institutional investors, particularly whale accumulation that was reported on August 12th when JASMY price recovered above $0.016.\nDespite these positive fundamentals, today's price action reflects natural market dynamics as traders lock in profits from the recent rally.\nJASMY Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nJasmyCoin technical analysis reveals a complex picture with both bullish and bearish elements competing for dominance. The most significant indicator is JasmyCoin's RSI at 47.63, placing it firmly in neutral territory and suggesting the recent rally has cooled without entering oversold conditions.\nThe JASMY MACD shows bearish momentum with a histogram reading of -0.0001, indicating that short-term momentum has shifted negative despite the longer-term uptrend remaining intact. This divergence suggests the recent surge may need more time to consolidate before the next directional move.\nJasmyCoin's Bollinger Bands position shows the %B at 0.4706, meaning JASMY price is trading below the middle band but well above the lower boundary. This positioning typically indicates a pullback within an established uptrend rather than a full reversal.\nThe Stochastic oscillator presents mixed signals with %K at 32.94 and %D at 41.52, both approaching oversold territory but not yet reaching extreme levels. This suggests JasmyCoin may find support soon if selling pressure doesn't accelerate.\nJasmyCoin Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, JasmyCoin support levels are clearly defined with immediate support at $0.01 and strong support at the same level, indicating a critical zone for JASMY bulls to defend. A break below this level could signal a deeper correction toward the 52-week low of $0.01.\nOn the upside, JASMY resistance appears at $0.02, which represents both immediate and strong resistance. This level has proven significant in recent trading and aligns with previous consolidation zones. A decisive break above $0.02 could target the next major resistance around $0.025.\nThe JASMY/USDT pair shows tight consolidation between these levels, with the current price action suggesting a period of accumulation rather than distribution. The relatively narrow trading range indicates reduced volatility as measured by the Daily ATR, which may precede the next significant move.\nTraders should monitor volume closely, as the recent $4.7 million in 24-hour volume on Binance spot represents a significant decrease from the $42 million spike during the partnership announcement.\nShould You Buy JASMY Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor swing traders, the current JASMY price offers an interesting risk-reward setup. The recent pullback has brought JasmyCoin back to more reasonable levels after the partnership-driven surge, while fundamental catalysts remain supportive. A position with stop-loss below $0.015 and targets near $0.025 offers approximately 1:2 risk-reward ratio.\nDay traders should exercise caution as JASMY RSI in neutral territory and mixed momentum indicators suggest continued consolidation. The lack of clear directional bias makes scalping strategies more challenging, though breakouts above $0.021 or below $0.019 could provide short-term opportunities.\nLong-term investors may view current levels as attractive given the recent partnership developments with Panasonic and Chainlink. These collaborations could drive sustained adoption in the IoT sector, potentially supporting higher valuations over time. However, risk management remains crucial with the broader crypto market showing mixed signals.\nThe key risk factor is a break below the $0.01 support level, which could trigger accelerated selling and test the 52-week low. Conversely, sustained volume above 24-hour averages could signal renewed institutional interest.\nConclusion\nJasmyCoin's current consolidation at $0.02 appears healthy following last week's partnership-driven rally. While JASMY price faces near-term headwinds from profit-taking, the fundamental outlook remains constructive with Panasonic and Chainlink collaborations enhancing long-term prospects. Traders should monitor the $0.01-$0.02 range for the next directional catalyst, with volume expansion likely to determine whether JASMY breaks higher or requires deeper consolidation. The neutral RSI provides flexibility for moves in either direction, making risk management essential for all trading strategies.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:31:12 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "ENS Price Drops 6% Despite Ethereum's Rally - Technical Analysis Shows Mixed Signals", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-ens-price-drops-6-despite-ethereums-rally-technical-analysis-shows", "text": "Quick Take\n• ENS currently trading at $25.27 (-5.99% in 24h) • Ethereum Name Service's RSI at 43.58 indicates neutral territory with potential oversold conditions developing • Recent ENS DAO technical updates and Ethereum's surge past $4,400 provide mixed market sentiment\nWhat's Driving Ethereum Name Service Price Today?\nDespite Ethereum's impressive rally past $4,400 driven by institutional investment and favorable SEC stance on ETH ETFs, the ENS price has moved in the opposite direction with a notable 5.99% decline in the past 24 hours. This divergence highlights how individual tokens can disconnect from broader market trends, especially during periods of consolidation.\nThe recent ENS DAO Newsletter released on August 12th highlighted significant technical developments including L2 reverse resolution discussions and enhanced OpenSea integration. While these developments are fundamentally positive for the Ethereum Name Service ecosystem, they appear to have had limited immediate impact on price action. The collaborative efforts with major platforms like OpenSea typically take time to translate into measurable price movements.\nThe broader Ethereum ecosystem's bullish momentum, marked by institutional investment flows, creates a favorable backdrop for ENS in the medium term. However, the current price action suggests traders are taking profits or repositioning ahead of potential technical breakouts.\nENS Technical Analysis: Bearish Momentum Emerges Despite Bullish Trend\nThe Ethereum Name Service technical analysis reveals a complex picture with mixed signals across different timeframes. ENS's RSI currently sits at 43.58, positioning the token in neutral territory but approaching oversold conditions. This RSI level often presents opportunities for contrarian traders, especially when fundamental developments remain positive.\nThe MACD configuration shows concerning momentum patterns for ENS. With the MACD line at 0.1747 and the signal line at 0.6267, the resulting histogram of -0.4520 indicates bearish momentum is building. This divergence between the overall bullish trend classification and current momentum suggests a potential consolidation phase.\nEthereum Name Service's position relative to its Bollinger Bands provides additional context. Trading at $25.27 with a %B position of 0.2018, ENS sits closer to the lower band ($24.00) than the upper band ($30.28), indicating potential oversold conditions in the short term.\nThe Stochastic oscillator reinforces this view with ENS's %K at 4.41 and %D at 16.97, both in deeply oversold territory. These extreme readings often precede short-term bounces, particularly when supported by positive fundamental developments.\nEthereum Name Service Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nThe current ENS price action is testing critical technical levels that will determine the next directional move. Immediate support for Ethereum Name Service sits at $24.04, closely aligning with the Bollinger Band lower boundary. A break below this level could trigger additional selling pressure toward the strong support zone at $17.66.\nOn the upside, ENS faces immediate resistance at $32.21, which also serves as the strong resistance level. This confluence creates a significant barrier that requires substantial volume and momentum to overcome. The 200-day moving average at $21.48 provides additional context, showing that despite recent weakness, ENS remains well above longer-term trend support.\nThe daily Average True Range (ATR) of $1.97 indicates that Ethereum Name Service typically moves within a $4 range on any given day, suggesting the current price level could see volatility in either direction. Based on Binance spot market data, the ENS/USDT pair has shown increased volume at $8.47 million, indicating active participation during this consolidation phase.\nShould You Buy ENS Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor aggressive traders, the current ENS price presents an interesting risk-reward setup. With ENS trading near the lower Bollinger Band and showing oversold Stochastic readings, a tactical bounce toward the $27-28 resistance zone offers approximately 10% upside potential. Stop-loss levels should be placed below $24.04 to limit downside risk.\nConservative investors might wait for clearer confirmation of the trend direction. A break above $27.19 (7-day SMA) with volume would signal renewed buying interest and potentially target the $32.21 resistance level. Conversely, a break below $24.04 could indicate further consolidation toward the $21-22 zone.\nSwing traders should monitor the interaction between ENS price and the 20-day moving average at $27.14. A sustained move above this level, combined with improving momentum indicators, would strengthen the bullish case for Ethereum Name Service. The proximity to the 50-day moving average at $25.28 suggests a critical inflection point is approaching.\nConclusion\nENS price faces a critical juncture as technical indicators show mixed signals despite the overall bullish trend classification. The 5.99% decline contrasts with Ethereum's strength, creating potential opportunities for discerning traders. Ethereum Name Service support levels at $24.04 will be crucial in the next 24-48 hours, while resistance at $32.21 remains the key upside target. The combination of oversold conditions and positive fundamental developments from the ENS DAO suggests patient traders may be rewarded, though immediate volatility should be expected around current levels.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:01:39 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

The token's 3.64% drop reflects broader market uncertainty and profit-taking near resistance levels that have proven difficult to break.\nFTX Token's trading volume on Binance spot reached $1.158 million over the past 24 hours, indicating moderate interest from traders. The absence of major news catalysts suggests that current price movements are largely technical in nature, with traders focusing on chart patterns and indicator signals rather than fundamental developments.\nFTT Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nThe FTX Token technical analysis reveals a complex picture with conflicting signals across different timeframes. FTX Token's RSI at 47.38 sits firmly in neutral territory, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This neutral FTT RSI reading suggests that momentum could shift in either direction depending on volume and broader market sentiment.\nThe MACD indicator presents a more bearish outlook for FTT, with the histogram showing -0.0020, indicating weakening bullish momentum. FTX Token's MACD line at 0.0005 remains above its signal line at 0.0025, but the narrowing gap suggests potential for a bearish crossover.\nFTX Token's position within the Bollinger Bands shows interesting dynamics, with the current price sitting at 36.42% of the band width (%B = 0.3642). This positioning below the middle band at $0.92 indicates slight bearish bias in the short term.\nThe moving average structure presents a mixed picture for FTX Token. While the price trades near the SMA 50 at $0.91, it remains below both the 7-day and 20-day simple moving averages at $0.93 and $0.92 respectively. Most concerning is FTX Token's significant distance below the 200-day SMA at $1.16, highlighting the longer-term bearish trend.\nFTX Token Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical FTX Token support levels are emerging as key battlegrounds for traders. The immediate FTT support sits at $0.86, representing a crucial level that has previously provided buying interest. Below this, FTX Token strong support at $0.76 aligns closely with the 52-week low of $0.72, suggesting this area could attract significant buying if reached.\nOn the resistance side, FTT faces immediate challenges at $1.07, which has proven difficult to break in recent trading sessions. The more significant FTT resistance level at $1.30 represents a major psychological barrier that would need substantial volume and positive catalysts to overcome.\nThe current pivot point at $0.92 serves as a critical decision level for FTX Token. A sustained break above this level could signal renewed bullish momentum, while failure to reclaim it may lead to further downside pressure toward the $0.86 support zone.\nFTX Token's Average True Range (ATR) of $0.06 indicates moderate volatility, providing traders with measurable risk parameters for position sizing and stop-loss placement.\nShould You Buy FTT Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nBased on Binance spot market data, FTX Token presents different opportunities depending on trading style and risk tolerance. Short-term traders might consider waiting for a clearer directional bias, as the neutral FTT RSI and mixed technical signals suggest consolidation may continue.\nFor swing traders, the current FTT price near the pivot point at $0.92 offers a defined risk-reward setup. A long position could target the immediate resistance at $1.07, representing approximately 17% upside potential, while using the $0.86 support as a stop-loss level limits downside risk to roughly 5%.\nConservative investors may prefer waiting for a break above the $1.07 resistance level before considering entry, as this would confirm renewed bullish momentum for FTX Token. Alternatively, accumulation near the strong support at $0.76 could offer attractive risk-adjusted returns for patient investors.\nThe FTT/USDT trading pair's 24-hour range between $0.96 and $0.89 provides active traders with clear boundaries for short-term strategies, though the relatively narrow range suggests limited volatility opportunities.\nConclusion\nFTX Token faces a critical juncture at current levels, with the FTT price testing key technical support near the $0.92 pivot point. The combination of neutral RSI readings and bearish MACD momentum suggests traders should exercise caution and wait for clearer directional signals. Over the next 24-48 hours, watch for either a decisive break below $0.86 support, which could accelerate selling toward $0.76, or a reclaim of the $0.96 high, which might signal renewed buying interest toward the $1.07 resistance level.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:25:07 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

This absence of fundamental catalysts has left the Dydx token vulnerable to broader market movements and technical trading patterns.\nThe current price action reflects typical cryptocurrency volatility, with DYDX trading within its established range but showing some weakness as it approaches key technical levels. Without fresh news or developments from the dYdX protocol, traders are focusing entirely on chart patterns and technical indicators to guide their decisions.\nThe lack of recent announcements, partnerships, or protocol updates has created a vacuum where technical analysis becomes the primary driver of short-term price movements for DYDX.\nDYDX Technical Analysis: Conflicting Signals Create Trading Dilemma\nThe current Dydx technical analysis reveals a complex picture with mixed signals across different timeframes. DYDX's RSI sits at 50.77, placing it firmly in neutral territory and suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This neutral reading provides little directional bias for immediate price movement.\nHowever, DYDX's MACD indicator tells a different story, showing bullish momentum with the MACD line at 0.0173 above the signal line at 0.0158. The positive MACD histogram of 0.0015 reinforces this bullish momentum reading, suggesting underlying strength despite today's price decline.\nThe moving average structure presents another layer of complexity. DYDX trades above its 50-day SMA ($0.61) and 200-day SMA ($0.63), which traditionally indicates a bullish longer-term trend. However, the price currently sits below the 7-day SMA ($0.67), showing short-term weakness.\nDydx's position within the Bollinger Bands offers additional insight, with the token trading at 57.46% of the band width, slightly above the middle band but well below the upper resistance at $0.73.\nDydx Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical Dydx support levels emerge at $0.52 for immediate support, with stronger support establishing around $0.49. These levels represent significant downside risk areas where buyers may step in to defend the DYDX price.\nOn the upside, DYDX resistance appears formidable at $0.76, which serves as both immediate and strong resistance based on Binance spot market data. This level represents a 19% upside potential from current prices but will require significant volume and momentum to break.\nThe current trading range between $0.63 and $0.69 over the past 24 hours provides short-term boundaries for DYDX/USDT traders. Breaking below $0.63 could trigger further selling toward the $0.52 support zone, while reclaiming $0.69 might signal a recovery attempt toward the $0.76 resistance.\nThe daily ATR of $0.05 indicates moderate volatility, suggesting DYDX could experience significant price swings within these established ranges.\nShould You Buy DYDX Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor aggressive traders, the current DYDX price presents a potential opportunity if the bullish MACD momentum can overcome the near-term weakness. The risk-reward setup offers approximately 19% upside to resistance versus 23% downside to strong support levels.\nConservative investors might wait for clearer directional signals, particularly a decisive break above the 7-day moving average at $0.67 or below the immediate support at $0.52. The neutral RSI reading suggests DYDX could move in either direction without being constrained by overbought or oversold conditions.\nDay traders should focus on the $0.63-$0.69 range, looking for breakout opportunities with appropriate stop-loss levels. The absence of recent news means technical levels are likely to hold more significance in the near term.\nRisk management remains crucial given the conflicting technical signals, with position sizing reflecting the uncertainty in current market conditions.\nConclusion\nDYDX price faces a critical juncture with mixed technical signals creating uncertainty for the next 24-48 hours. While the MACD suggests underlying bullish momentum, the recent 6.3% decline and position below short-term moving averages indicate immediate weakness. Traders should monitor the $0.63 support level closely, as a break below could accelerate selling toward $0.52, while recovery above $0.67 might signal renewed bullish interest toward the $0.76 resistance zone.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:48:26 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "PancakeSwap (CAKE) Falls 5.24% Despite $12M Token Burn and Stock Perpetuals Launch", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-pancakeswap-cake-falls-524-despite-12m-token-burn-and-stock", "text": "Quick Take\n• CAKE currently trading at $2.66 (-5.24% in 24h) • PancakeSwap's RSI at 47.39 shows neutral momentum with bearish MACD signals • Stock Perpetuals launch and $12M token burn provide fundamental support despite recent selling pressure\nWhat's Driving PancakeSwap Price Today?\nThe CAKE price is experiencing significant downward pressure today, falling 5.24% to $2.66 as traders take profits following last week's major developments. This decline appears to be a continuation of the profit-taking that began on August 12, when CAKE dropped 3.52% despite the platform's innovation push.\nThe recent selling pressure comes despite fundamentally positive news from August 13, when PancakeSwap launched Stock Perpetuals enabling leveraged trading of tokenized stocks like Apple and Tesla. Simultaneously, the platform conducted a massive token burn of 8.27 million CAKE tokens worth $12 million, which typically creates bullish price pressure by reducing circulating supply.\nHowever, the market's reaction illustrates a classic \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" pattern. While the Stock Perpetuals launch initially drove CAKE price up 4% on August 13, subsequent sessions have seen traders lock in profits, resulting in the current decline below the $2.70 pivot level.\nCAKE Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Point to Consolidation\nPancakeSwap technical analysis reveals conflicting signals as the token navigates between support and resistance levels. CAKE's RSI currently sits at 47.39, placing it in neutral territory and suggesting neither oversold nor overbought conditions. This neutral RSI reading indicates that selling pressure may be moderating.\nHowever, PancakeSwap's MACD tells a more bearish story. With the MACD line at 0.0301 sitting below the signal line at 0.0489, and a negative histogram of -0.0188, momentum indicators suggest continued bearish pressure in the near term. The Stochastic oscillator reinforces this view, with %K at 30.33 below %D at 45.34, indicating potential for further downside.\nFrom a moving average perspective, CAKE price trades below its short-term SMAs but remains above longer-term averages. The current price of $2.66 sits below both the 7-day SMA ($2.76) and 20-day SMA ($2.72), yet maintains position above the crucial 50-day SMA ($2.61) and well above the 200-day SMA ($2.25), preserving the overall bullish trend structure.\nPancakeSwap Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, PancakeSwap support levels are clearly defined with immediate support at $2.48 and strong support at $2.20. The current CAKE price of $2.66 provides a relatively thin cushion above immediate support, making this level critical for bulls to defend.\nOn the upside, CAKE resistance faces immediate hurdles at $2.97, which aligns closely with the Bollinger Bands upper level at $2.93. A break above this level could target the stronger resistance zone at $3.31, though this would require significant buying momentum given current technical conditions.\nThe Bollinger Bands positioning shows CAKE trading near the lower portion of the bands, with a %B reading of 0.3424 indicating the price sits closer to the lower band than the upper band. This positioning often precedes either a bounce from oversold conditions or a breakdown below support levels.\nShould You Buy CAKE Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor short-term traders, the current CAKE/USDT setup presents a challenging environment. The bearish MACD and position below key short-term moving averages suggest waiting for clearer bullish signals before entering long positions. Aggressive traders might consider the $2.48 support level as a potential entry point, with a tight stop-loss below $2.40.\nSwing traders should monitor the $2.61 level (50-day SMA) closely, as a decisive break below this level could signal deeper correction toward the $2.20 strong support zone. Conversely, a recovery above $2.76 (7-day SMA) would indicate the profit-taking phase may be ending.\nLong-term investors may view current weakness as an opportunity, particularly given the fundamental developments including Stock Perpetuals and the token burn. The Daily ATR of $0.16 suggests normal volatility ranges, making current levels potentially attractive for those with longer time horizons and proper risk management.\nThe key risk factors include broader crypto market sentiment and whether the current selling pressure accelerates. Conservative traders should wait for CAKE price to reclaim the $2.72 pivot level before considering positions.\nConclusion\nCAKE price faces near-term headwinds as profit-taking continues following recent positive developments. While PancakeSwap technical analysis shows mixed signals, the neutral RSI suggests selling pressure may be moderating. Traders should watch the critical $2.48 support level over the next 24-48 hours, as a break below could target deeper correction levels. However, the fundamental backdrop remains positive with Stock Perpetuals launch and token burn providing longer-term support for CAKE price recovery once current selling exhausts.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:13:28 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

Total inflows amounted to $3.75 billion, marking the fourth-largest inflow on record and pushing assets under management (AuM) to an unprecedented $244 billion as of August 13.\nEthereum Dominates Inflows\nEthereum emerged as the top performer, attracting $2.87 billion in inflows, which accounted for 77% of the total weekly inflows. This substantial influx propelled Ethereum's year-to-date (YTD) inflows to $11 billion, significantly outpacing Bitcoin (BTC) on a proportional basis. Ethereum's inflows now represent 29% of AuM, compared to Bitcoin's 11.6%.\nRegional and Asset-Specific Insights\nThe United States played a pivotal role in the recent inflow surge, contributing 99% of the total or $3.73 billion. Other regions such as Canada, Hong Kong, and Australia also saw minor inflows of $33.7 million, $20.9 million, and $12.1 million, respectively. Conversely, Brazil and Sweden experienced outflows of $10.6 million and $49.9 million.\nBeyond Ethereum, Bitcoin recorded modest inflows of $552 million.

The recent pullback appears to be profit-taking following the 4% surge on August 13, when Filecoin demonstrated strong bullish momentum alongside the broader Coindesk 20 index.\nThe announcement of Filecoin's first batch of ProPGF grants totaling $3.6818 million to 14 teams represents a significant investment in the network's infrastructure and development tools. However, this positive catalyst has yet to translate into sustained upward price action, suggesting that market participants are taking a wait-and-see approach to gauge the long-term impact of these ecosystem investments.\nEarlier market action on August 11 established crucial Filecoin support levels at $2.49, with resistance identified at $2.68. The current FIL price of $2.47 sits just below this support zone, indicating potential vulnerability to further downside pressure.\nFIL Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nThe Filecoin technical analysis reveals a complex picture with conflicting signals across different timeframes. Filecoin's RSI reading of 47.16 places the token in neutral territory, neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting balanced buying and selling pressure.\nHowever, the MACD indicator presents a more concerning picture for FIL bulls. With the MACD line at -0.0015 and the signal line also at -0.0015, the histogram shows a slight bearish divergence at -0.0001, indicating weakening momentum for Filecoin.\nThe moving average structure provides additional context for FIL price action. Filecoin's current price of $2.47 sits just below the 20-period SMA at $2.48, while trading above the immediate support provided by the 50-period SMA at $2.53 creates a conflicting technical setup. Most notably, FIL remains significantly below the 200-period SMA at $2.77, confirming the longer-term bearish trend.\nFilecoin's Bollinger Bands analysis shows the token trading at a %B position of 0.4767, indicating FIL price is positioned in the lower half of the band range but not yet approaching oversold conditions.\nFilecoin Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, several critical Filecoin support levels and resistance zones are shaping current price action. The immediate FIL resistance sits at $2.76, closely aligned with the recent high of $2.68 mentioned in market reports.\nFor FIL support, traders should monitor the $2.22 level as the immediate downside target, with stronger Filecoin support at $2.18. A break below these levels could expose FIL to a test of the 52-week low at $2.07.\nThe FIL/USDT trading pair shows a daily ATR of $0.16, indicating moderate volatility that provides opportunities for active traders while requiring careful risk management. The pivot point at $2.51 serves as a key decision level, with FIL price currently trading below this threshold.\nShould bulls regain control, the path to the stronger FIL resistance at $3.02 would first require overcoming the immediate resistance barriers and establishing support above the 20-period moving average.\nShould You Buy FIL Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor swing traders, the current FIL price action presents a challenging environment. The mixed technical signals suggest waiting for clearer directional bias before establishing significant positions. Conservative traders might consider dollar-cost averaging near the $2.22 support level while maintaining strict stop-losses below $2.18.\nDay traders can capitalize on the $0.16 daily ATR by trading the range between immediate support and resistance levels. However, the bearish MACD and position below key moving averages suggest favoring short-term bearish setups over bullish plays.\nLong-term investors should weigh the positive ecosystem developments from the ProPGF grant program against the technical deterioration. The $3.6 million investment in 14 development teams could drive future adoption, but the immediate FIL price impact remains muted.\nRisk management remains crucial given Filecoin's proximity to key support levels. Any position should incorporate the significant gap between current levels and the 52-week high of $6.75, highlighting the substantial upside potential if fundamental catalysts align with improved technical conditions.\nConclusion\nFilecoin faces a critical juncture as ecosystem investments clash with bearish technical momentum. While the FIL price of $2.47 reflects recent weakness, the established support at $2.22-$2.18 offers potential stabilization. Traders should monitor whether Filecoin can reclaim the $2.51 pivot point in the next 24-48 hours, as this level could determine whether FIL continues its descent or stages a recovery toward the $2.76 resistance zone.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:55:37 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "EigenLayer (EIGEN) Shows Bullish Momentum Despite 5% Daily Decline - Key Levels to Watch", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-eigenlayer-eigen-shows-bullish-momentum-despite-5-daily-decline-key", "text": "Quick Take\n• EIGEN currently trading at $1.35 (-5.07% in 24h) • EigenLayer's MACD histogram shows bullish momentum despite price decline • EIGEN RSI maintains neutral stance at 50.69, suggesting consolidation phase • No significant news catalysts driving current price action\nWhat's Driving EigenLayer Price Today?\nEigenLayer's price movement appears driven primarily by technical factors rather than fundamental news, as no significant developments have emerged in the past week. The 5.07% decline to $1.35 represents a typical consolidation move within the broader bullish trend that has characterized EIGEN's performance over recent months.\nThe lack of major news events suggests that current EIGEN price action is largely influenced by broader market sentiment and technical trading patterns. This creates an environment where technical analysis becomes particularly valuable for understanding potential price direction.\nEIGEN Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nEigenLayer technical analysis reveals a fascinating divergence between price action and momentum indicators. While the EIGEN price has declined 5% in the last 24 hours, the MACD histogram shows a bullish reading of 0.0068, indicating that buying pressure may be building beneath the surface.\nThe EIGEN RSI at 50.69 sits firmly in neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold. This positioning suggests that EigenLayer has room to move in either direction, making it crucial for traders to watch for the next catalyst. The RSI's neutral stance often precedes significant price movements as the market decides on direction.\nEigenLayer's moving averages paint a complex picture. The current EIGEN price of $1.35 sits above the 20-day SMA ($1.29) and 200-day SMA ($1.30), indicating underlying bullish structure. However, it trades below the 7-day SMA ($1.42), confirming the recent short-term weakness.\nEigenLayer Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical EigenLayer support levels emerge at $1.03, representing both immediate and strong support according to Binance spot market data. This level coincides with the lower Bollinger Band at $1.00, creating a significant zone where buyers may step in aggressively.\nOn the upside, EIGEN resistance appears at $1.67, marking both immediate and strong resistance levels. Breaking above this threshold could trigger momentum toward the upper Bollinger Band at $1.58, though this creates an interesting technical setup where resistance sits above the band.\nThe current EIGEN/USDT trading range of $1.30-$1.46 over the past 24 hours provides short-term boundaries for scalping strategies. The pivot point at $1.37 serves as a key decision level - EIGEN price action above this level favors bullish continuation, while sustained trading below could signal further downside.\nShould You Buy EIGEN Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nConservative traders should wait for a clear break above the 7-day SMA at $1.42 before considering long positions. This would confirm that the recent decline has ended and buying momentum is returning to EigenLayer.\nAggressive traders might consider the current EIGEN price of $1.35 attractive, given the bullish MACD histogram and proximity to key support. However, risk management becomes crucial with stops below $1.30 to protect against a breakdown toward the $1.03 support zone.\nSwing traders should note that EIGEN's position within the Bollinger Bands (%B at 0.6002) suggests the token remains in the upper portion of its recent range, indicating underlying strength despite the daily decline. The 14-period ATR of $0.14 provides context for position sizing and stop-loss placement.\nBased on Binance spot market data, the overall strong bullish trend classification suggests that current weakness may represent a buying opportunity for patient investors willing to hold through short-term volatility.\nConclusion\nEigenLayer's technical setup presents a compelling case for potential reversal despite today's 5% decline. The bullish MACD histogram combined with neutral EIGEN RSI readings suggests accumulation may be occurring at current levels. Traders should monitor the $1.37 pivot point closely over the next 24-48 hours, as a break above this level could signal the resumption of the broader uptrend toward $1.67 resistance. However, failure to hold above $1.30 support could extend the correction toward the critical $1.03 level.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:00:18 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

Most recently, on August 17, Lido DAO achieved a self-reported market capitalization of $1.28 billion, with LDO trading 3.4% higher against the US dollar at that time.\nHowever, this positive momentum was short-lived. The August 14 market overview revealed concerning technical developments, as the LDO/USDT pair experienced high volatility, dropping sharply from $1.528 to $1.318 after breaching key support levels. Technical indicators at that time showed oversold conditions, which appears to be continuing into the current trading session.\nDespite the recent price decline, the underlying fundamentals for Lido DAO remain robust. On August 13, LDO experienced a remarkable 55% price surge driven by increased on-chain activity and anticipation of an upcoming tokenholder update. The same day brought news that Lido DAO's Total Value Locked hit a record $38.17 billion, indicating growing trust from investors and strengthening the protocol's position in the liquid staking market.\nThe disconnect between strong fundamentals and current price action suggests that short-term market dynamics are overshadowing the positive developments in Lido DAO's ecosystem.\nLDO Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Amid Consolidation\nBased on Binance spot market data, Lido DAO technical analysis reveals a complex picture with both bullish and bearish elements competing for control.\nThe LDO RSI currently sits at 56.36, placing it firmly in neutral territory. This reading suggests that neither buyers nor sellers have gained decisive control, despite the recent 5.74% decline. The RSI's position above 50 indicates that bullish momentum hasn't been completely extinguished.\nLido DAO's moving averages paint a more optimistic picture. The token trades above its 50-day SMA at $1.03 and 200-day SMA at $1.03, maintaining its longer-term bullish structure. More importantly, LDO sits above the 20-day SMA at $1.19, though it has fallen below the shorter 7-day SMA at $1.41, indicating recent weakness.\nThe MACD for Lido DAO shows bullish momentum with a reading of 0.1114 above the signal line at 0.1073. The positive MACD histogram of 0.0042 suggests that bullish momentum is strengthening, which could signal a potential reversal from current levels.\nLido DAO's Bollinger Bands analysis shows the token trading in the upper portion of the bands with a %B position of 0.6145. The LDO price sits between the middle band at $1.19 and upper band at $1.66, suggesting room for upward movement if buying pressure returns.\nLido DAO Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical Lido DAO support levels are now being tested as the LDO price faces downward pressure. The immediate support zone sits at $0.85, which represents a significant level that has historically provided buying interest. Below this, the strong Lido DAO support level at $0.69 would mark a more concerning breakdown.\nOn the upside, LDO resistance remains formidable at $1.63, a level that has proven challenging to overcome in recent trading. This resistance level aligns with previous attempts to break higher and represents the gateway to further gains toward the 52-week high of $2.38.\nThe current pivot point at $1.33 sits just above the current LDO price, suggesting that any bounce would need to reclaim this level to shift the near-term bias back to bullish. The 24-hour trading range of $1.42 to $1.28 shows significant intraday volatility, with an Average True Range of $0.12 indicating continued price swings.\nShould You Buy LDO Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor aggressive traders, the current LDO price presents a potential opportunity near key support levels, but with significant risks that must be carefully managed.\nThe risk-reward setup favors buyers if LDO can hold above the $1.28 low from the recent 24-hour range. A stop-loss below $1.25 would limit downside risk, while a target toward the $1.63 resistance offers approximately 25% upside potential. This creates a favorable 3:1 risk-reward ratio for those willing to take calculated risks.\nConservative investors might wait for clearer technical confirmation before entering positions. A decisive break above $1.35 and reclaim of the 7-day SMA at $1.41 would provide stronger bullish signals for the LDO price trajectory.\nLong-term holders should consider that Lido DAO's record TVL of $38.17 billion provides fundamental support for higher valuations over time. The disconnect between strong protocol metrics and current price action may present accumulation opportunities for patient investors.\nBased on Binance spot market data, the high trading volume of $36.8 million indicates significant interest at current levels, suggesting that major moves in either direction could occur quickly.\nConclusion\nThe LDO price faces a critical juncture at $1.30, testing key support levels despite strong fundamental developments for Lido DAO. While the 5.74% decline shows near-term weakness, the combination of record TVL, neutral RSI readings, and bullish MACD signals suggests the selling pressure may be nearing exhaustion. Traders should watch for a decisive break above $1.35 to confirm renewed bullish momentum, while keeping stops below $1.25 to manage downside risk in the next 24-48 hours.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:38:03 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

With no significant developments reported in the past week, the current price action reflects general cryptocurrency market sentiment and technical factors.\nTrading volume on Binance spot reached $19.3 million, indicating moderate interest despite the downward pressure. The lack of major catalysts suggests that technical analysis becomes particularly important for understanding Celestia's near-term direction.\nTIA Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Point to Consolidation\nCelestia technical analysis reveals a complex picture with both bearish and bullish elements competing for control. The most significant signal comes from Celestia's MACD histogram, which shows a reading of 0.0055, indicating early bullish momentum despite the recent price decline.\nTIA RSI sits at 47.96, placing it firmly in neutral territory and suggesting that neither buyers nor sellers have gained decisive control. This neutral positioning often precedes consolidation phases where the asset trades sideways before making its next directional move.\nThe moving average structure tells an interesting story. Celestia's current price of $1.76 sits just above the 20-period SMA at $1.75, providing immediate support. However, the longer-term 200-period SMA at $2.54 remains well above current levels, highlighting the significant distance TIA has fallen from its higher timeframe trend.\nCelestia's Bollinger Bands show the price trading near the middle band at $1.75, with a %B position of 0.5241. This positioning suggests the asset is neither oversold nor overbought, aligning with the neutral RSI reading.\nCelestia Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, Celestia support levels are becoming increasingly critical. The immediate support zone sits at $1.54, which represents approximately 12.5% downside from current levels. Should this level fail, the stronger support at $1.33 becomes the next major target for bears.\nOn the upside, TIA resistance appears formidable. The immediate resistance at $2.04 represents a 16% climb from current prices, while the stronger resistance at $2.29 would require a 30% rally. These levels align closely with previous support zones that have now flipped to resistance.\nThe current trading range between $1.72 and $1.90 over the past 24 hours provides short-term guidance for active traders. Breaking below $1.72 could accelerate selling pressure toward the $1.54 support, while a move above $1.90 might signal a test of the $2.04 resistance zone.\nShould You Buy TIA Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nThe current TIA price action presents different opportunities depending on trading style and risk tolerance. For conservative investors, the neutral technical picture suggests waiting for clearer directional signals before establishing positions.\nActive traders might consider the current level as a potential accumulation zone, given the neutral RSI and bullish MACD histogram. However, risk management becomes crucial with a stop-loss below the $1.54 support level to limit downside exposure.\nThe risk-reward ratio favors cautious optimism if Celestia can hold above its 20-period SMA at $1.75. A successful bounce from this level could target the immediate resistance at $2.04, offering approximately 16% upside potential against 12.5% downside risk to the $1.54 support.\nSwing traders should monitor the TIA/USDT pair closely for volume confirmation of any breakout attempts. The current daily ATR of $0.16 suggests moderate volatility, providing decent movement for position trading while remaining manageable for risk control.\nConclusion\nCelestia's current technical setup suggests a critical juncture where the next 24-48 hours could determine short-term direction. The TIA price sitting just above key moving average support, combined with neutral momentum indicators, creates a setup where patience may be rewarded. Traders should watch for either a decisive break below $1.75 support or a volume-backed recovery above $1.90 to guide their next moves in the TIA/USDT market.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:49:37 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "HBAR Price Faces Correction After Recent Surge - Technical Analysis Shows Mixed Signals", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-hbar-price-faces-correction-after-recent-surge-technical-analysis-shows", "text": "Quick Take\n• HBAR currently trading at $0.25 (-3.74% in 24h) • Hedera's RSI at 48.69 signals neutral momentum with potential for either direction • BlackRock ETF speculation countered by recent profit-taking pressure\nWhat's Driving Hedera Price Today?\nThe HBAR price is experiencing a pullback following last week's volatile trading session. After surging 7.62% on August 14th to reach $0.2625, Hedera has faced selling pressure over the past two days, with a 3.51% correction on August 15th followed by today's 3.74% decline.\nThe recent volatility stems from conflicting market forces. Speculation about BlackRock potentially filing for an HBAR spot ETF generated significant bullish sentiment among institutional investors. However, this positive catalyst has been overshadowed by profit-taking activities as traders capitalize on recent gains.\nYesterday's trading saw HBAR fluctuate between $0.2422 and $0.2524, indicating continued uncertainty among market participants. The 24-hour trading volume of $51,110,947 on Binance spot market suggests sustained interest despite the price correction.\nHBAR Technical Analysis: Neutral Signals Emerge\nHedera technical analysis reveals mixed signals across key indicators. The HBAR RSI currently sits at 48.69, placing it firmly in neutral territory and suggesting the recent selling pressure hasn't reached oversold conditions. This neutral RSI reading indicates that both bulls and bears remain active in the HBAR/USDT trading pair.\nThe MACD histogram shows a bearish reading of -0.0028, confirming short-term downward momentum for HBAR. However, the proximity of the 12-period and 26-period EMAs (both at $0.25) suggests the trend could reverse quickly with sufficient buying pressure.\nHedera's position within the Bollinger Bands provides additional insight, with the current price sitting near the middle band at $0.25. The %B position of 0.3319 indicates HBAR is trading closer to the lower band, suggesting potential oversold conditions in the short term.\nThe daily ATR of $0.02 reflects moderate volatility, which could work in favor of range-bound traders looking to capitalize on predictable price swings.\nHedera Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical Hedera support levels are clearly defined based on recent price action. The immediate support at $0.23 aligns with the lower Bollinger Band and represents the first line of defense for HBAR bulls. A break below this level could trigger further selling toward the strong support at $0.14.\nOn the upside, HBAR resistance faces immediate challenges at $0.28, representing the recent trading range high. The stronger resistance level at $0.30 remains a significant psychological barrier that has yet to be tested during this market cycle.\nThe current pivot point at $0.25 serves as a critical decision level for Hedera traders. HBAR price action above this level favors bullish continuation, while sustained trading below could signal further downside.\nShould You Buy HBAR Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nBased on Binance spot market data, the current HBAR price presents a mixed risk-reward scenario depending on trading timeframe and strategy.\nFor swing traders, the neutral RSI and proximity to key support levels suggest a potential buying opportunity with a stop-loss below $0.23. The risk-reward ratio becomes favorable if targeting the immediate resistance at $0.28, offering approximately 12% upside potential against 8% downside risk.\nDay traders should focus on the $0.24-$0.26 range established over recent sessions. The moderate volatility indicated by the daily ATR provides sufficient movement for scalping strategies within these bounds.\nLong-term investors might consider the BlackRock ETF speculation as a fundamental catalyst that could drive HBAR price significantly higher if materialized. However, the speculative nature of this news requires careful position sizing and risk management.\nThe overall strong bullish trend designation suggests that any short-term weakness could represent a buying opportunity for those with longer investment horizons.\nConclusion\nHBAR price currently sits at a critical juncture, with technical indicators providing mixed signals while fundamental catalysts remain speculative. The immediate focus should be on the $0.23 support level, as a hold above this area could set the stage for a retest of recent highs. Traders should monitor volume patterns and RSI movements for confirmation of the next directional move over the next 24-48 hours. The BlackRock ETF speculation provides a bullish backdrop, but immediate price action will likely depend on broader market sentiment and Bitcoin's performance.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:32:00 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "FLOKI Price Drops 4.44% as Technical Indicators Flash Mixed Signals", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-floki-price-drops-444-as-technical-indicators-flash-mixed-signals", "text": "Quick Take\n• FLOKI currently trading with a -4.44% decline in 24-hour trading • FLOKI RSI at 43.35 indicates neutral momentum territory • Mixed analyst predictions range from $0.000145 to $0.000247 creating market uncertainty\nWhat's Driving Floki Price Today?\nThe FLOKI price has faced significant headwinds over the past week, with recent market analysis revealing a complex landscape of competing forces. On August 17, analysts released varied price predictions for FLOKI, creating market confusion as forecasts ranged dramatically from $0.000145 to $0.000247, while some ambitious long-term targets of $0.01 were deemed unrealistic by market experts.\nThis uncertainty has been compounded by substantial whale activity, contributing to a notable 10.57% price decline in recent trading sessions. The FLOKI/USDT pair has experienced heightened volatility with a 24-hour trading volume reaching $110.7 million, demonstrating continued institutional and retail interest despite the bearish price action.\nMarket speculators remain divided, with some betting on FLOKI's potential to reach $0.000179 by September 2025. However, this optimism is tempered by technical resistance levels that may limit upward momentum and broader market skepticism influenced by Bitcoin's overall performance.\nDespite earlier bullish momentum on August 11 when FLOKI surged past $0.0001185 with strong volume confirmation, the recent price action suggests that overbought conditions triggered the expected pullback that technical analysts had warned about.\nFLOKI Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Create Trading Uncertainty\nThe current Floki technical analysis presents a nuanced picture for traders navigating the FLOKI/USDT market. FLOKI's RSI reading of 43.35 places the token firmly in neutral territory, a significant shift from the overbought levels around 70 that were observed during the August 11 rally.\nThis neutral RSI positioning suggests that FLOKI has worked off its previous overbought conditions, potentially setting up for the next directional move. The FLOKI RSI level indicates neither oversold buying opportunities nor overbought selling pressure, leaving traders to focus on other technical indicators for guidance.\nFLOKI's MACD indicators are currently showing bearish momentum, with the MACD histogram confirming negative momentum in the near term. This bearish MACD signal aligns with the recent price decline and suggests that selling pressure may continue in the short term.\nThe Stochastic indicators paint an even more pronounced picture, with FLOKI's Stochastic %K at 9.16 and %D at 21.31, indicating deeply oversold conditions. This extreme reading often precedes short-term bounces, though the broader trend context remains important for longer-term positioning.\nFLOKI's position relative to its Bollinger Bands shows the token trading near the lower band support with a %B position of 0.1841, confirming the oversold nature of recent price action and suggesting potential support at current levels.\nFloki Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, Floki support levels and resistance zones are critical for understanding potential price movements. While specific numerical levels are currently being recalibrated due to recent volatility, the technical framework suggests that FLOKI faces multiple layers of resistance above current levels.\nThe immediate FLOKI resistance appears to be forming around previous support-turned-resistance levels, where profit-taking from recent buyers may emerge. Traders should monitor volume profiles at these levels to gauge the strength of any potential breakout attempts.\nOn the downside, Floki support levels are being tested as the token approaches oversold territory on multiple timeframes. The convergence of Bollinger Band lower support and deeply oversold Stochastic readings suggests that current levels may offer tactical buying opportunities for risk-tolerant traders.\nThe Average True Range (ATR) for FLOKI indicates elevated volatility, which creates both opportunity and risk for active traders. This heightened volatility environment requires careful position sizing and risk management.\nShould You Buy FLOKI Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor aggressive traders, the current FLOKI price action presents a potential contrarian opportunity given the oversold Stochastic readings and proximity to Bollinger Band lower support. However, the bearish MACD momentum suggests waiting for additional confirmation before establishing new long positions.\nConservative investors should await clearer trend confirmation, particularly given the mixed analyst predictions and ongoing market uncertainty. The wide range of price forecasts from $0.000145 to $0.000247 reflects genuine uncertainty about FLOKI's near-term direction.\nSwing traders might consider a scaled approach, using the oversold conditions as an entry signal while maintaining strict stop-losses below key support levels. The 24-hour trading volume of over $21 million on Binance spot provides sufficient liquidity for most trading strategies.\nRisk management remains paramount given FLOKI's elevated volatility profile. Position sizes should account for the potential for continued downside pressure, particularly if Bitcoin experiences additional weakness that could pressure the broader memecoin sector.\nConclusion\nFLOKI price action over the next 24-48 hours will likely depend on whether oversold conditions can generate a meaningful bounce or if bearish momentum continues to dominate. The neutral FLOKI RSI provides flexibility for movement in either direction, while deeply oversold Stochastic indicators suggest potential for short-term relief rallies. Traders should monitor volume and Bitcoin's performance closely, as these factors will significantly influence FLOKI's ability to establish a sustainable recovery from current levels.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:51:16 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

With no significant news events reported in the past week, the 3.31% drop to $0.88 reflects general cryptocurrency market weakness and profit-taking activity.\nThe lack of fresh positive developments has left dogwifhat vulnerable to technical selling pressure. Trading volume remains substantial at $39.17 million on Binance spot markets, indicating continued interest despite the bearish price action. This volume suggests that current WIF price levels may attract both buyers looking for value and sellers seeking to exit positions.\nWIF Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nThe dogwifhat technical analysis reveals a complex picture with both bearish momentum and potential reversal signals. The WIF RSI reading of 43.91 sits in neutral territory but is trending toward oversold conditions, which historically has preceded bounce opportunities for the token.\ndogwifhat's moving averages paint a bearish short-term picture. The current WIF price of $0.88 trades below all key short-term averages, including the 7-day SMA at $0.93 and 20-day SMA at $0.93. However, the token remains above its 200-day SMA of $0.76, preserving the longer-term bullish structure.\nThe MACD indicator shows bearish momentum with a reading of -0.0227 and a negative histogram of -0.0074. This suggests that selling pressure continues to dominate, though the magnitude appears to be moderating. dogwifhat's Stochastic indicators (%K at 13.51, %D at 20.85) are deeply oversold, often a precursor to short-term reversals.\ndogwifhat Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical dogwifhat support levels are now being tested as the WIF price approaches key technical zones. The immediate support at $0.82 represents the next major level where buyers have historically emerged. A break below this level could accelerate selling toward the strong support zone at $0.78.\nOn the upside, WIF resistance begins at the pivot point of $0.90, just above current levels. The immediate resistance at $1.07 aligns with recent highs and would need to be reclaimed for any meaningful bullish momentum. The Bollinger Bands show dogwifhat trading near the lower band at $0.83, with the upper band providing resistance at $1.03.\nThe WIF/USDT pair's position within the Bollinger Bands (%B at 0.2499) indicates the token is trading in the lower portion of its recent range, which often precedes mean reversion moves back toward the middle band at $0.93.\nShould You Buy WIF Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nBased on Binance spot market data, the current WIF price setup presents different opportunities depending on trading timeframe and risk tolerance. Short-term traders might consider the oversold conditions as a potential bounce opportunity, with immediate upside targets at $0.90-$0.93.\nConservative investors should wait for clearer bullish signals, particularly a reclaim of the $0.90 pivot level with accompanying volume. The risk-reward appears favorable for those willing to use tight stops below $0.82, targeting the $0.93-$0.96 range.\nAggressive traders might view current levels as attractive given the significant discount from the 52-week high of $3.05. However, the lack of immediate catalysts suggests any recovery may be gradual rather than explosive. Position sizing should account for the elevated volatility indicated by the daily ATR of $0.09.\nConclusion\ndogwifhat faces a critical juncture as the WIF price tests support near $0.88 amid bearish technical signals. While the RSI suggests oversold conditions may provide near-term relief, traders should watch for a decisive break above $0.90 to confirm any reversal. The next 24-48 hours will likely determine whether WIF can stabilize or if further declines toward $0.82 are ahead.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:26:03 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "CRV Price Struggles at $0.87 as Bearish Momentum Builds Despite Emission Cuts", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-crv-price-struggles-at-087-as-bearish-momentum-builds-despite", "text": "Quick Take\n• CRV currently trading at $0.87 (-1.02% in 24h) • Bearish MACD histogram signals weakening momentum despite oversold RSI recovery • Recent 15.9% emission reduction conflicts with heavy selling pressure from August 15th decline\nWhat's Driving Curve Price Today?\nThe CRV price action reflects a classic case of conflicting market forces. While Curve Finance's strategic 15.9% emission reduction on August 12th initially sparked bullish sentiment by cutting annual token issuance from 137.4 million to 115.5 million tokens, this deflationary catalyst was quickly overshadowed by intense selling pressure.\nThe August 15th market event proved more impactful in the near term, with CRV experiencing an 8.2% decline to $0.8697 that formed a bearish engulfing pattern. This selling pressure pushed Curve's RSI into oversold territory at 27, though current readings show recovery to 46.26 in neutral zone.\nDespite the positive long-term implications of reduced token emissions creating supply constraints, traders appear focused on immediate technical deterioration rather than fundamental improvements to Curve's tokenomics.\nCRV Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Create Trading Complexity\nThe most significant development in Curve technical analysis comes from the MACD indicator, which shows bearish divergence with a -0.0188 histogram reading. This suggests weakening bullish momentum despite CRV price maintaining levels above the 200-day SMA at $0.64.\nCRV RSI currently sits at 46.26, representing a recovery from the oversold conditions hit during the August 15th selloff. This RSI positioning indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions, leaving room for movement in either direction based on market sentiment.\nThe moving average structure reveals mixed signals for Curve technical analysis. While CRV trades above the critical 200-day SMA ($0.64) and 50-day SMA ($0.83), it remains below shorter-term averages including the 7-day SMA ($0.92) and 20-day SMA ($0.93). This configuration suggests a potential pullback toward longer-term support levels.\nCurve's Bollinger Bands position at 0.2176 indicates CRV price is trading in the lower portion of the band structure, with the lower band at $0.83 serving as immediate technical support.\nCurve Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, Curve support levels are clearly defined with immediate support at $0.83 coinciding with both the 50-day SMA and Bollinger Bands lower boundary. This confluence makes $0.83 a critical level for CRV/USDT traders to monitor.\nThe next major Curve support levels extend down to $0.49, representing the strong support zone that would likely attract significant buying interest. A break below $0.83 could accelerate selling toward this longer-term support.\nOn the upside, CRV resistance appears at $1.07 for immediate overhead pressure, with stronger CRV resistance at $1.16 near the 52-week high of $1.19. The current pivot point at $0.87 aligns closely with today's trading levels, making this a key battleground for direction.\nShould You Buy CRV Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor swing traders, the current CRV price setup offers a challenging risk-reward profile. The emission reduction provides fundamental support for higher prices over months, but immediate technical conditions suggest caution. Conservative traders might wait for a clear break above $0.93 (20-day SMA) or a successful test of $0.83 support.\nAggressive traders could consider positions near current levels with tight stops below $0.83, targeting the $1.07 resistance zone for a potential 23% gain. However, the bearish MACD histogram warns that momentum remains questionable.\nLong-term investors may view current weakness as opportunity, given the deflationary impact of reduced emissions. The 15.9% cut in CRV token issuance creates structural support for higher prices as supply growth slows significantly.\nRisk management remains crucial with CRV's daily ATR at $0.08, indicating substantial intraday volatility that can quickly move against positions.\nConclusion\nCRV price faces a critical juncture at $0.87 as technical bearishness conflicts with fundamental improvements from emission cuts. The next 24-48 hours will likely determine whether Curve support levels at $0.83 can hold or if further weakness develops toward $0.49. Traders should monitor the CRV/USDT pair closely for breaks above $0.93 resistance or below $0.83 support to confirm directional bias. The emission reduction provides medium-term bullish foundation, but immediate price action suggests patience may be rewarded with better entry opportunities.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:57:14 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "SHIB Price Faces Bearish Pressure as Technical Indicators Signal Caution", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-shib-price-faces-bearish-pressure-as-technical-indicators-signal-caution", "text": "Quick Take\n• SHIB currently experiencing -3.73% decline in 24-hour trading session • Shiba Inu's RSI at 45.36 indicates neutral momentum with bearish undertones • Recent Google AI prediction of 16% drop creates negative sentiment despite strong burn rate activity\nWhat's Driving Shiba Inu Price Today?\nThe SHIB price is experiencing downward pressure following a combination of technical weakness and mixed market sentiment. Most recently, Google's Gemini AI delivered a bearish forecast predicting a 16.388% decline to $0.00001 by August 31, citing weak technical indicators and reduced token burns as primary concerns.\nHowever, the Shiba Inu ecosystem showed resilience with a remarkable 181% spike in burn rate and significant whale activity involving 360 billion tokens moved by large holders. This surge in burn rate activity typically reduces circulating supply, creating potential upward pressure on SHIB price over time.\nThe current market reflects this tension between bearish technical predictions and positive fundamental developments. While SHIB demonstrated a 2.98% daily gain when the AI prediction was released, showing market resilience, the broader technical picture remains challenging for bulls.\nTrading volume on Binance spot reached $15,375,562 in the past 24 hours, indicating moderate market participation as traders navigate these conflicting signals.\nSHIB Technical Analysis: Neutral Signals With Bearish Bias\nShiba Inu technical analysis reveals a complex picture with several key indicators pointing toward continued consolidation or potential downside. The SHIB RSI currently sits at 45.36, placing it in neutral territory but closer to oversold conditions than overbought levels.\nThe MACD histogram shows bearish momentum for SHIB, with the indicator remaining in negative territory. This suggests that selling pressure continues to outweigh buying interest in the near term. Shiba Inu's Stochastic oscillator reflects similar sentiment, with %K at 33.76 and %D at 45.44, indicating the token remains in the lower half of its recent trading range.\nShiba Inu's %B position at 0.4175 within the Bollinger Bands confirms the token is trading below the middle band, suggesting bearish momentum. This positioning typically indicates that SHIB price faces resistance at higher levels while support becomes increasingly important.\nThe overall trend classification remains neutral, but the combination of bearish MACD momentum and positioning below key moving averages suggests caution for bullish traders.\nShiba Inu Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, Shiba Inu support levels become critical as the token navigates current market conditions. The recent trading range between $0.00001280 support and $0.00001301 resistance established a tight consolidation pattern that traders should monitor closely.\nSHIB resistance levels emerge as significant hurdles, particularly the crucial downtrend resistance at $0.00001553 that was tested during the recent 12% weekly surge. Breaking above this level would signal a potential trend reversal and could attract additional buying interest.\nFor support, the $0.00001280 level proved effective in containing recent declines and represents a key area where buyers have previously stepped in. A break below this support could accelerate selling pressure and target lower levels.\nThe SHIB/USDT pair's trading range has narrowed, suggesting an impending breakout in either direction. Traders should prepare for increased volatility as the token approaches these critical levels.\nShould You Buy SHIB Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nConservative traders should exercise caution given the current technical setup and bearish MACD momentum. The neutral RSI provides some comfort that SHIB isn't severely oversold, but the overall indicator alignment suggests waiting for clearer bullish signals.\nAggressive traders might consider the 181% burn rate spike as a fundamental catalyst that could eventually override short-term technical weakness. However, position sizing should reflect the high-risk nature of this trade, particularly given the AI prediction creating additional market uncertainty.\nFor swing traders, the key decision point revolves around the $0.00001280 support level. A strong bounce from this area with increasing volume could signal a short-term buying opportunity, while a breakdown would suggest avoiding long positions.\nRisk management remains paramount, with stop-losses below key Shiba Inu support levels essential for any bullish positions. The conflicting signals between fundamental improvements and technical weakness create an environment where quick reversals are possible.\nConclusion\nSHIB price faces a critical juncture as technical indicators signal caution while fundamental developments like the massive burn rate increase provide potential upside catalysts. The next 24-48 hours will likely determine whether the $0.00001280 support holds or if further decline materializes toward the AI-predicted $0.00001 target. Traders should monitor volume closely and prepare for potential volatility as these competing forces resolve.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:39:07 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

On August 13th, Worldcoin successfully completed a significant $135 million token sale, attracting major institutional investors including 16z and Bain Capital. This substantial funding round was specifically earmarked to enhance biometric identity verification operations in the United States, representing a major vote of confidence in Worldcoin's long-term vision.\nHowever, the market's response has been mixed. Despite the positive funding news, WLD experienced a token unlock event on August 14th that created selling pressure. While Worldcoin initially surged following the announcement, market sentiment has since turned cautious. Trading data reveals a higher concentration of short positions compared to long ones, indicating that traders remain skeptical about near-term price appreciation despite the fundamental improvements.\nThe current 5.73% decline reflects this bearish sentiment overriding the positive news flow. Market participants appear to be taking a \"sell the news\" approach following the initial excitement around the token sale, while the token unlock has provided additional downward pressure on the WLD price.\nWLD Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nThe Worldcoin technical analysis reveals a complex picture with both bullish and bearish elements competing for dominance. The WLD RSI currently sits at 43.18, positioning Worldcoin in neutral territory but approaching oversold conditions that could signal a potential bounce.\nWorldcoin's moving averages present a concerning picture for bulls. The current WLD price of $0.95 trades below all major moving averages, with the SMA 7 at $1.02, SMA 20 at $1.01, and SMA 50 at $1.04. This configuration suggests weakening momentum and potential continued downside pressure.\nThe MACD indicator confirms the bearish bias with a reading of -0.0177 and a histogram value of -0.0060, indicating that bearish momentum remains intact for WLD. The Stochastic oscillator shows even more pronounced weakness, with the %K at 15.77 and %D at 30.03, suggesting Worldcoin may be entering oversold territory.\nWorldcoin's Bollinger Bands analysis reveals the token trading in the lower portion of its range. With the current price at $0.95 and the lower band at $0.91, WLD is approaching the bottom of its recent trading envelope. The %B position of 0.2163 confirms this lower-band proximity, which could indicate either continued weakness or an impending reversal.\nWorldcoin Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, several critical Worldcoin support levels emerge that traders should monitor closely. The immediate WLD support sits at $0.91, which aligns closely with the Bollinger Band lower boundary. A break below this level could accelerate selling pressure toward the strong Worldcoin support at $0.84.\nOn the upside, WLD resistance levels present significant challenges for bulls. The immediate resistance at $1.14 represents the first major hurdle, followed by the psychological $1.40 level that serves as strong WLD resistance. The pivot point at $0.98 provides a crucial level to watch, as a sustained move above this threshold could signal a shift in momentum.\nThe current trading range between $0.94 and $1.04 over the past 24 hours illustrates the indecision in the market. The WLD price has found support near the $0.94 level multiple times, suggesting this could serve as a near-term floor for Worldcoin.\nShould You Buy WLD Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nThe current WLD price action presents different opportunities depending on trading style and risk tolerance. For swing traders, the approaching oversold conditions combined with the positive fundamental backdrop from the $135 million funding round create an interesting risk-reward setup. The WLD/USDT pair offers a potential entry near current levels with a stop-loss below the $0.91 support level.\nConservative investors might wait for clearer technical confirmation before entering positions. The bearish momentum indicated by Worldcoin's MACD and the price trading below moving averages suggest patience may be rewarded with better entry points. A break and close above the $1.01 level (SMA 20) would provide the first sign of technical improvement.\nDay traders should focus on the $0.91 to $1.04 range, using the high volatility (ATR of $0.08) to capitalize on intraday swings. The WLD price has shown respect for these levels, providing clear risk parameters for short-term strategies.\nRisk management remains crucial given the conflicting signals between positive fundamentals and bearish technicals. Position sizing should reflect the current uncertainty, with stops placed below the $0.84 strong support level for longer-term positions.\nConclusion\nWorldcoin faces a critical juncture as positive fundamental developments clash with bearish technical indicators. The WLD price at $0.95 represents a potential inflection point, with the $0.91 support level serving as the key battleground for the next 24-48 hours. While the $135 million token sale provides long-term confidence, traders should prepare for continued volatility as the market digests both the funding news and recent token unlock. The approaching oversold conditions in the WLD RSI suggest a bounce could materialize, but confirmation above $1.01 would be needed to signal a meaningful reversal in the bearish momentum that currently dominates Worldcoin technical analysis.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:33:07 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

This disconnect between fundamental news and price action reflects broader market uncertainty and potential profit-taking following recent gains.\nThe most significant catalyst this week came from Sygnum Bank's announcement on August 14th, confirming full support for SUI with custody, trading, staking, and lending services for institutional clients. This Swiss crypto bank partnership represents a major validation of Sui's institutional appeal, yet the SUI price has struggled to maintain momentum.\nAdding to the institutional narrative, Mill City Ventures III reported holding over 81.8 million SUI tokens valued at $316 million as of August 11th. This substantial treasury position demonstrates continued institutional confidence in Sui's long-term prospects. However, the immediate market reaction suggests traders may be taking a \"sell the news\" approach to these developments.\nPerhaps most intriguingly, Canary Capital filed for the first-ever SUI ETF with the SEC on August 11th. While ETF approvals typically drive significant price appreciation, the regulatory timeline remains uncertain, creating anticipation without immediate buying pressure.\nSUI Technical Analysis: Neutral Signals Emerge\nBased on Binance spot market data, Sui technical analysis reveals a mixed picture with the SUI RSI currently at 45.51, sitting firmly in neutral territory. This RSI reading suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, leaving room for movement in either direction.\nThe MACD presents a more concerning signal for SUI bulls, with the histogram showing -0.0230, indicating bearish momentum building. The MACD line at 0.0269 remains below the signal line at 0.0498, suggesting the recent downtrend may continue in the near term.\nSui's moving averages paint a complex picture. The current SUI price of $3.55 sits below the 7-day SMA at $3.78 and the 20-day SMA at $3.68, but remains above the crucial 200-day SMA at $3.13. This positioning suggests short-term weakness within a longer-term bullish structure.\nThe Stochastic indicators show SUI's %K at 25.62, well into oversold territory, while the %D at 43.84 suggests potential for a bounce. This divergence often signals an impending reversal, particularly when combined with the neutral RSI reading.\nSui Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nThe current SUI/USDT trading setup reveals critical levels that could determine the next major move. Immediate resistance sits at $4.18, representing the recent rejection level that sparked today's decline. A decisive break above this level could target the stronger resistance at $4.44.\nSui support levels present a more concerning picture for bulls. The immediate support at $3.27 represents a crucial test, as a break below could accelerate selling toward the strong support zone at $2.65. The 24-hour low of $3.52 serves as an immediate reference point for traders monitoring SUI price action.\nThe Bollinger Bands show SUI trading near the middle band at $3.68, with the %B position at 0.3150 indicating the price sits in the lower portion of the recent range. The upper band at $4.04 and lower band at $3.32 define the current volatility envelope, with the daily ATR of $0.27 suggesting moderate volatility conditions.\nShould You Buy SUI Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor aggressive traders, the current SUI price action presents a potential oversold bounce opportunity. The combination of positive institutional news and oversold stochastic readings suggests a possible short-term reversal. Entry near current levels with a stop-loss below $3.27 offers a reasonable risk-reward setup targeting the $4.18 resistance.\nConservative investors might wait for clearer technical confirmation before entering SUI positions. A break above the 7-day SMA at $3.78 would signal renewed bullish momentum, while maintaining the 200-day SMA support at $3.13 preserves the longer-term uptrend structure.\nRisk management remains crucial given the mixed signals in Sui technical analysis. The recent institutional developments provide fundamental support, but the bearish MACD momentum suggests caution. Position sizing should reflect the current uncertainty, with stops placed below key Sui support levels to limit downside exposure.\nThe regulatory timeline for the proposed SUI ETF adds another layer of complexity. While approval could drive significant price appreciation, the process typically takes months, limiting immediate catalysts for sustained rallies.\nConclusion\nThe SUI price faces a critical juncture as institutional adoption accelerates but technical momentum weakens. Trading at $3.55 with neutral RSI conditions and oversold stochastic readings, SUI presents both opportunity and risk for different trader profiles. The next 24-48 hours will likely determine whether the recent institutional partnerships can overcome the bearish technical momentum or if further consolidation awaits before the next major move.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:27:06 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

This unlock increased the total circulating supply by 2.04%, creating immediate downward pressure on the ARB/USDT trading pair.\nDespite this headwind, the current ARB price of $0.52 shows relative resilience compared to initial expectations. The token unlock was well-telegraphed, with markets anticipating this event since early August when ARB price tested the $0.44 support level on August 12 amid a 4.42% daily decline.\nInterestingly, the period leading up to the unlock saw some positive momentum driven by PayPal's adoption of the Arbitrum network. On August 13, this development helped push the ARB price to $0.47 with a 7% daily surge, demonstrating that fundamental adoption news can temporarily override technical concerns.\nARB Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nThe current Arbitrum technical analysis reveals a complex picture for traders. ARB's RSI stands at 58.79, placing it firmly in neutral territory rather than oversold conditions that might typically follow a major token unlock. This suggests that while selling pressure existed, it hasn't created panic conditions.\nArbitrum's moving average structure tells a bullish story, with the current $0.52 price trading above all major moving averages. The ARB price sits well above the SMA 20 at $0.45, SMA 50 at $0.42, and significantly above the SMA 200 at $0.39. This configuration typically indicates an uptrend remains intact despite short-term volatility.\nThe MACD indicator shows bullish momentum for Arbitrum, with a positive histogram value of 0.0076 and the MACD line at 0.0290 above its signal line at 0.0215. However, traders should note that ARB resistance appears near current levels, as indicated by the Bollinger Bands analysis.\nArbitrum Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, Arbitrum support levels and resistance zones are clearly defined in the current market structure. The immediate ARB resistance sits at $0.58, which aligns closely with the Bollinger Band upper boundary at $0.56. This creates a clear ceiling for short-term price action.\nThe ARB price currently trades near the upper band with a %B position of 0.8044, indicating potential for mean reversion toward the middle band at $0.45. For bullish continuation, Arbitrum would need to break above the strong resistance at $0.58 with conviction.\nOn the downside, Arbitrum support levels offer substantial cushion. Immediate support at $0.36 represents a significant level that held during previous corrections. Strong support at $0.31 aligns with longer-term technical levels and would represent a more serious test of the uptrend if reached.\nThe daily Average True Range (ATR) of $0.05 suggests typical volatility, meaning moves of 10-15% in either direction remain within normal parameters for ARB.\nShould You Buy ARB Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor swing traders, the current setup presents interesting opportunities. The ARB price has absorbed the token unlock selling pressure while maintaining position above key moving averages. Conservative traders might wait for a pullback toward the $0.45-$0.47 range, which would offer better risk-reward ratios.\nAggressive traders could consider the current $0.52 level as an entry point, with stops below $0.48 and targets toward the $0.58 resistance. The risk-reward ratio favors this approach given the proximity to technical resistance levels.\nLong-term investors should note that ARB remains significantly below its 52-week high of $1.03, suggesting substantial upside potential if market conditions improve. However, the recent token unlock reminder highlights the importance of monitoring scheduled token releases that could impact future price action.\nDay traders should focus on the $0.51-$0.56 range established in the recent 24-hour trading session, with volume of $134.4 million on Binance providing adequate liquidity for position management.\nConclusion\nThe ARB price at $0.52 reflects a market that has successfully navigated a major token unlock while maintaining technical strength. With Arbitrum technical analysis showing neutral RSI conditions and bullish moving average alignment, the setup favors cautious optimism over the next 24-48 hours. Traders should monitor the $0.58 resistance level closely, as a breakout could signal renewed bullish momentum despite recent supply increases.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:14:51 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "NEAR Protocol Price Drops 8% After Network Upgrade Despite Institutional Interest", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-near-protocol-price-drops-8-after-network-upgrade-despite-institutional", "text": "Quick Take\n• NEAR currently trading at $2.57 (-8.22% in 24h) • NEAR RSI at 46.25 suggests neutral momentum with potential for reversal • Network upgrade completed successfully but institutional selling pressure dominates\nWhat's Driving NEAR Protocol Price Today?\nNEAR Protocol completed a major network upgrade and hard fork at 01:00 UTC on August 18, 2025, marking a significant technical milestone for the blockchain. However, this positive development has been overshadowed by the lingering effects of heavy institutional selling that began on August 14.\nThe recent price decline stems primarily from institutional sell-offs and South Korean exchange deposit suspensions that occurred during the network upgrade preparation. This selling pressure resulted in a 7% drop earlier in the week, with NEAR price struggling to recover despite the successful technical implementation.\nDespite earlier positive momentum from $7.6 million in institutional inflows on August 13 that drove NEAR price from $2.75 to $2.91, the subsequent institutional selling has created a challenging environment for bulls. The contrast between institutional buying and selling over the past week highlights the volatile nature of institutional flows in the NEAR Protocol ecosystem.\nNEAR Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nNEAR Protocol technical analysis reveals a complex picture with conflicting indicators. NEAR Protocol's Daily RSI sits at 46.25, placing it in neutral territory but approaching oversold conditions. This NEAR RSI reading suggests the recent selling pressure may be creating an opportunity for potential reversal.\nThe MACD histogram shows -0.0097, indicating bearish momentum for NEAR in the short term. However, the relatively modest negative reading suggests the downtrend may be losing steam. NEAR Protocol's Stochastic %K at 27.26 supports this view, approaching oversold levels that often precede bounce attempts.\nNEAR Protocol's moving averages paint a mixed picture. The current NEAR price of $2.57 sits below the 7-day SMA of $2.75 and slightly below the 20-day SMA of $2.64, but remains close to the 50-day SMA of $2.60. This positioning indicates NEAR is testing crucial support levels while maintaining proximity to medium-term trend lines.\nNEAR Protocol Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical NEAR Protocol support levels emerge at $2.30 for immediate support and $2.02 for strong support. The current NEAR price of $2.57 provides a reasonable buffer above immediate support, offering potential downside protection.\nOn the upside, NEAR resistance appears at $3.06 for immediate resistance, with strong NEAR Protocol resistance at $3.10. These levels represent significant hurdles for any recovery attempt, particularly given the recent institutional selling pressure.\nThe Bollinger Bands show NEAR trading in the lower half of the range, with the upper band at $2.95 providing additional resistance context. NEAR Protocol's %B position of 0.3929 confirms the token is trading in the lower portion of its recent range, potentially setting up oversold bounce conditions.\nShould You Buy NEAR Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nBased on Binance spot market data, different trading strategies suit various risk profiles. Conservative traders should wait for NEAR price to establish clear support above $2.64 (20-day SMA) before considering entry, with stops below $2.30.\nAggressive traders might consider the current NEAR price attractive given the oversold technical conditions and successful network upgrade completion. However, risk management becomes crucial with tight stops below $2.45 to limit downside exposure.\nFor swing traders, the key lies in watching institutional flow data and monitoring whether the selling pressure from South Korean exchanges subsides. A return of net institutional inflows could quickly reverse the current NEAR Protocol technical analysis bearish signals.\nThe daily ATR of $0.19 indicates normal volatility levels for NEAR/USDT, suggesting manageable risk for position sizing. However, traders should remain aware that institutional flows can quickly amplify volatility beyond historical norms.\nConclusion\nNEAR Protocol faces a critical juncture with successful network infrastructure improvements offset by institutional selling pressure. The NEAR price at $2.57 sits at important technical levels where bounce attempts often emerge. Traders should monitor the next 24-48 hours for signs of institutional selling exhaustion and potential oversold recovery, while maintaining strict risk management given the mixed technical signals and ongoing institutional flow volatility.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:02:59 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "TON Price Holds Above $3.30 as Technical Indicators Signal Mixed Momentum", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-ton-price-holds-above-330-as-technical-indicators-signal-mixed", "text": "Quick Take\n• TON currently trading at $3.37 (-3.30% in 24h) • Toncoin's RSI sits in neutral territory at 50.57, suggesting balanced momentum • No major news catalysts driving recent price action, with technical factors taking precedence\nWhat's Driving Toncoin Price Today?\nThe TON price movement over the past 24 hours appears driven primarily by technical factors rather than fundamental developments, as no significant news events have emerged in the past week. The 3.30% decline from yesterday's high of $3.54 reflects broader market consolidation patterns typical during periods of low news flow.\nToncoin's trading volume on Binance spot reached $25.1 million over the past 24 hours, indicating moderate but not exceptional interest from traders. This volume level suggests the current price action represents normal market fluctuations rather than panic selling or aggressive accumulation.\nThe absence of major announcements or partnerships has left TON price action dependent on technical levels and broader cryptocurrency market sentiment, creating an environment where chart patterns and indicator signals carry increased weight for short-term direction.\nTON Technical Analysis: Neutral Signals Emerge\nThe most significant technical development for Toncoin centers on the TON RSI reading of 50.57, placing the indicator squarely in neutral territory. This Toncoin technical analysis suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, indicating potential for movement in either direction depending on broader market catalysts.\nToncoin's moving average structure presents a mixed picture. The current TON price of $3.37 sits below the 7-day SMA at $3.46 and 20-day SMA at $3.43, suggesting short-term bearish pressure. However, TON maintains its position above the critical 50-day SMA at $3.20, preserving the intermediate-term bullish structure.\nThe MACD histogram shows a bearish divergence at -0.0103, with the MACD line at 0.0582 trading below its signal line at 0.0685. This configuration suggests weakening momentum for TON, though the relatively small magnitude indicates the bearish pressure remains modest.\nToncoin's Bollinger Bands reveal the current price position at 35.73% of the band width (%B = 0.3573), placing TON closer to the lower band at $3.23 than the upper resistance at $3.62. This positioning suggests room for upward movement within the current volatility range.\nToncoin Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nThe most critical Toncoin support levels emerge at $3.14 for immediate support, representing a 6.8% decline from current levels. This level aligns with recent swing lows and could provide the first test of buying interest if selling pressure continues.\nFor TON resistance, the immediate level sits at $3.75, requiring an 11.3% advance from current prices. This resistance level coincides with both recent highs and technical projection levels, making it a significant hurdle for any near-term rally attempts.\nThe TON/USDT pair shows strong support much lower at $2.72, representing the major support zone that would likely attract significant buying interest. Conversely, a break above $3.75 could open the path toward retesting higher levels near the 52-week high of $6.39.\nToncoin's daily ATR of $0.19 suggests typical daily moves of approximately 5.6% from current price levels, providing context for normal volatility expectations and stop-loss placement for active traders.\nShould You Buy TON Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nBased on Binance spot market data, the current TON price setup presents different opportunities depending on trader timeframes and risk tolerance. Conservative investors might wait for a clearer directional break, either above $3.75 resistance or below $3.14 support, before establishing positions.\nSwing traders could consider the neutral RSI and oversold Bollinger Band position as potential entry signals, with stops below $3.14 and targets at $3.75. This approach offers a roughly 1:2.5 risk-reward ratio, though traders should monitor volume for confirmation of any directional moves.\nDay traders should focus on the $3.33-$3.54 range established over the past 24 hours, using the range extremes for quick scalping opportunities. The moderate volume and ATR suggest sufficient movement for intraday strategies while maintaining manageable risk levels.\nRisk management remains crucial given the mixed technical signals. Position sizing should account for potential moves to either $2.72 support or $3.75 resistance, representing significant percentage moves that could impact portfolio allocation.\nConclusion\nThe TON price currently reflects a market in transition, with technical indicators providing mixed signals and no immediate fundamental catalysts driving direction. The neutral Toncoin technical analysis suggests patience may reward traders more than aggressive positioning in either direction. Key levels at $3.14 support and $3.75 resistance will likely determine the next significant move for TON over the coming 24-48 hours, making these levels critical for both entry and exit strategies.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:45:02 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

This price movement comes as analysts continue to project modest upside potential for the remainder of August 2025.\nRecent market predictions published on August 18th suggest PEPE could target $0.0000115 by the end of August, representing approximately 15% upside from current levels. However, these optimistic forecasts have not translated into immediate buying pressure, as evidenced by today's negative price action.\nThe disconnect between bullish predictions and current price performance highlights the challenge facing PEPE traders. While analysts maintain confidence in near-term upside potential, with some projections even targeting $0.000017 by month-end, the actual market response has remained subdued throughout the week.\nPEPE Technical Analysis: Conflicting Signals Emerge\nPepe technical analysis reveals a complex picture that explains the current price uncertainty. The PEPE RSI reading of 44.32 places the token firmly in neutral territory, neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting the market lacks clear directional conviction.\nThe MACD indicators paint a more concerning picture for PEPE bulls. With the MACD line, signal line, and histogram all showing negative values, the momentum indicators suggest bearish pressure may be building beneath the surface. This bearish momentum reading contrasts sharply with the overall bullish trend classification, creating confusion for traders attempting to time entries.\nPEPE's Stochastic oscillators add another layer of complexity, with the %K at 29.30 and %D at 37.73. These readings suggest the token is approaching oversold conditions but hasn't quite reached the traditional oversold threshold of 20, indicating potential for further downside before a meaningful bounce occurs.\nThe Bollinger Bands position shows Pepe's %B at 0.3649, placing the price in the lower half of the band range. This positioning typically indicates selling pressure has been dominant recently, aligning with the negative 24-hour price performance.\nPepe Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, PEPE traders should monitor several critical levels that could determine the token's near-term direction. The technical setup suggests a challenging environment for bulls despite the overall bullish trend classification.\nPepe support levels become crucial in the current environment, as the token's ability to hold key areas will determine whether the recent weakness represents a temporary pullback or the beginning of a more significant correction. The immediate support zones will likely be tested if selling pressure continues.\nPEPE resistance levels present the primary obstacle for any recovery attempt. Given the mixed technical signals and recent analyst predictions targeting higher prices, these resistance zones will be critical battlegrounds for determining whether bullish forecasts can materialize.\nThe wide range between strong support and resistance levels indicates elevated volatility expectations, which aligns with the substantial daily trading volume of over $110 million. This high volume suggests institutional and retail interest remains strong despite the recent price decline.\nShould You Buy PEPE Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor aggressive traders, the current PEPE price action presents a potential opportunity if the RSI neutral reading and approaching oversold Stochastic levels signal an impending bounce. However, the bearish MACD momentum suggests caution is warranted before committing significant capital.\nConservative investors might prefer waiting for clearer technical signals before entering PEPE positions. The conflicting indicators between the bullish overall trend and bearish momentum readings create an environment where patient traders may be rewarded with better entry points.\nSwing traders could consider the analyst predictions targeting $0.0000115 as a potential profit target, but should implement strict stop-loss levels given the current technical uncertainty. The PEPE/USDT pair's high volatility requires careful position sizing to manage risk effectively.\nDay traders should focus on the substantial volume and volatility, which creates opportunities for quick profits but also amplifies risk. The mixed technical picture demands flexible strategies that can adapt quickly to changing momentum conditions.\nConclusion\nPEPE price faces a critical juncture as technical indicators provide conflicting signals about near-term direction. While analyst predictions maintain optimism for August targets, the immediate price action suggests caution is warranted. Traders should monitor the RSI for potential oversold bounces while respecting the bearish momentum indicated by MACD readings. The next 24-48 hours will be crucial in determining whether PEPE can stabilize and begin moving toward the predicted $0.0000115 target or if further weakness lies ahead.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:20:09 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

With no significant news events emerging in the past week, technical factors and general market sentiment are driving the current sell-off.\nThe 5.02% drop brings ATOM price closer to its daily low of $4.38, testing trader confidence in the immediate support zone. Volume remains moderate at $8.5 million on Binance spot, suggesting the selloff lacks conviction from major market participants.\nATOM Technical Analysis: Bearish Signals Emerge\nThe Cosmos technical analysis reveals mixed signals with a bearish lean. ATOM's RSI reading of 46.81 sits in neutral territory but shows downward momentum from recent highs. This suggests selling pressure is building without reaching oversold conditions yet.\nThe MACD histogram at -0.0020 confirms bearish momentum for ATOM, with the signal line crossing above the main MACD line. This technical divergence often precedes further downside moves, making it a key indicator for short-term traders to monitor.\nCosmos's position within the Bollinger Bands shows concerning signs. With ATOM trading below the middle band (SMA 20) at $4.46 and a %B position of 0.4626, the token is in the lower half of its recent trading range.

The immediate ATOM support sits at $4.01, representing a critical psychological level that could determine near-term direction.\nIf this level fails to hold, Cosmos strong support at $3.90 becomes the next major battleground. This level aligns closely with the 52-week low of $3.58, making it a zone where longer-term investors might consider accumulation.\nOn the upside, ATOM resistance levels present significant challenges. The immediate resistance at $4.92 represents nearly 11% upside from current levels, while the stronger Cosmos resistance at $5.32 would require substantial buying pressure to reach.\nThe ATOM/USDT pair's daily ATR of $0.26 indicates moderate volatility, providing opportunities for swing traders but requiring careful position sizing.\nShould You Buy ATOM Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor aggressive traders, the current ATOM price offers a risk-reward setup favoring patient buyers. With Cosmos trading near support levels and RSI avoiding oversold territory, a bounce could target the $4.92 resistance level.\nConservative investors should wait for clearer bullish signals. The weak bullish overall trend suggests Cosmos lacks strong directional momentum, making timing crucial for entries. A break below $4.01 would likely trigger stops and accelerate selling toward the $3.90 strong support.\nDay traders can utilize the current volatility, but should respect the bearish MACD momentum and set tight stops below the $4.38 daily low. The moderate volume suggests moves could be swift once key levels break.\nRisk management remains paramount given the technical uncertainty. Position sizes should reflect the current weak bullish trend classification and the proximity to key Cosmos support levels.\nConclusion\nATOM price faces a critical juncture at current levels, with technical indicators suggesting further weakness could emerge. The next 24-48 hours will likely determine whether Cosmos can hold above the $4.01 support or if deeper selling toward $3.90 develops.

Most recently, on August 17, Injective defied broader market trends with a significant bullish breakout, achieving a remarkable 20% weekly gain. This surge was primarily attributed to increased infrastructure adoption and integration by major trading platforms, signaling growing institutional confidence in the protocol.\nHowever, this positive momentum followed a dramatic setback just days earlier. On August 13, INJ experienced a sharp 30.85% decline in a single 24-hour period, plummeting to $16.21. Market analysts attributed this severe correction to profit-taking activities and emerging regulatory concerns that spooked investors who had benefited from the prior month's substantial gains.\nThe week's volatility was further amplified by positive fundamental developments. On August 12, Injective announced a new financial primitive designed to expand its DeFi capabilities, which immediately translated into a 9% daily price gain, pushing INJ to $16.39. Additionally, the protocol achieved a significant milestone by surpassing 4,000 unique wallets on August 7, coinciding with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) filing for an INJ-based ETF proposal.\nINJ Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Point to Consolidation\nThe current Injective technical analysis reveals a market in transition, with several indicators suggesting near-term consolidation. INJ's RSI reading of 53.91 places it firmly in neutral territory, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This neutral positioning suggests that the recent volatility may be settling into a more stable trading range.\nInjective's moving averages paint a cautiously optimistic picture. The current INJ price of $14.77 sits above the key 20-day SMA at $14.01 and well above the 50-day SMA at $13.28, indicating that the medium-term trend remains intact despite recent pullbacks. The 200-day SMA at $11.94 continues to provide strong foundational support, reinforcing the overall bullish structure.\nThe MACD indicator for Injective shows bullish momentum with a reading of 0.4633 above the signal line at 0.4092, generating a positive histogram of 0.0541. This suggests that upward momentum is still present, though it may be weakening from recent peaks.\nInjective's Bollinger Bands reveal that INJ is currently positioned at 69% of the band width (%B = 0.6902), indicating the price is closer to the upper band at $16.01 than the lower band at $12.00. This positioning suggests potential for either a breakout above resistance or a pullback toward the middle band.\nInjective Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, several critical Injective support levels emerge as key areas for traders to monitor. The immediate support zone sits at $11.91, which aligns closely with historical price action and represents a logical area for buyers to step in. Should this level fail to hold, the stronger support at $10.07 becomes the next major defensive line for INJ bulls.\nOn the resistance side, Injective faces its most significant challenge at $16.55, which serves as both immediate and strong resistance. This level has proven difficult to break decisively, as evidenced by the recent rejection that led to the current pullback. A sustained break above this level could open the door to testing higher ranges.\nThe current INJ/USDT trading range of $16.19 to $14.20 over the past 24 hours provides short-term boundaries for active traders. The daily Average True Range (ATR) of $1.28 indicates that Injective typically moves within this volatility range, helping traders set appropriate position sizes and stop-loss levels.\nShould You Buy INJ Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor conservative traders, the current INJ price presents a challenging entry point given the mixed technical signals. The neutral RSI and recent volatility suggest waiting for either a clear break above $16.55 resistance or a pullback to stronger support levels around $11.91 might offer better risk-adjusted opportunities.\nAggressive traders might consider the current level attractive, given that INJ remains above key moving averages and shows bullish MACD momentum. However, position sizing should account for the elevated volatility, with stop-losses placed below the $11.91 support level to manage downside risk.\nSwing traders could benefit from the current consolidation pattern by playing the range between $12.00 and $16.00, though they should remain alert to news catalysts that could drive breakouts in either direction. The recent ETF filing and infrastructure developments suggest that positive news flow could provide upside catalysts.\nLong-term investors might view any weakness toward the $11.91 support as an accumulation opportunity, especially given the growing institutional interest evidenced by the CBOE ETF proposal and increasing wallet adoption. However, they should be prepared for continued volatility as the market digests recent gains.\nConclusion\nINJ price action suggests a market in consolidation mode following the recent 20% weekly surge and subsequent pullback. With technical indicators showing mixed signals and the price hovering near key levels, the next 24-48 hours will likely determine whether Injective can maintain its bullish momentum or requires further consolidation. Traders should monitor the $16.55 resistance level for potential breakout opportunities while keeping the $11.91 support zone in focus for any defensive action. The combination of positive fundamental developments and volatile technical conditions creates both opportunity and risk for INJ traders in the immediate term.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:03:21 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

With no significant news events reported in the past week, traders are focusing on technical levels and general cryptocurrency market dynamics.\nThe 4.68% decline brings ALGO price closer to key support levels, but the absence of fundamental negative catalysts suggests this could represent a buying opportunity for those following Algorand technical analysis patterns. The current trading range between $0.28 and $0.25 indicates consolidation behavior typical of assets preparing for their next directional move.\nMarket participants are likely taking profits after previous gains, as evidenced by the $14.9 million trading volume on Binance spot markets - a healthy level that suggests continued interest despite the price decline.\nALGO Technical Analysis: Neutral Signals Point to Consolidation\nAlgorand's RSI currently sits at 49.18, placing it squarely in neutral territory and suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This ALGO RSI reading indicates potential for movement in either direction, making it a critical level to monitor for breakout signals.\nThe MACD presents a more cautious picture with the histogram showing -0.0011, indicating bearish momentum in the short term. However, the relatively small magnitude suggests this bearish pressure is modest rather than severe.\nAlgorand's moving averages paint an interesting picture with the current price of $0.25 sitting right at the 20-period and 50-period SMAs, both at $0.25. This convergence often signals a decision point for the asset. The 200-period SMA at $0.22 provides a longer-term bullish backdrop, as ALGO price remains above this critical level.\nThe Bollinger Bands show ALGO trading near the middle band with a %B position of 0.4959, indicating the price is roughly centered within the recent range. This positioning often precedes significant directional moves once volatility returns.\nAlgorand Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on current Algorand technical analysis, several critical levels emerge for ALGO/USDT traders. The immediate resistance sits at $0.29, representing the upper boundary of the recent consolidation range. A break above this level could target the stronger resistance at $0.34.\nAlgorand support levels show more immediate concern at $0.22, which aligns closely with the 200-period moving average. This confluence makes it a particularly important level to hold for maintaining the overall bullish structure. Should this level fail, the stronger support at $0.17 represents a significant downside target.\nThe current pivot point at $0.26 serves as a near-term directional indicator. ALGO price action above this level favors bullish scenarios, while sustained trading below it could signal further downside pressure.\nThe daily ATR of $0.02 suggests normal volatility levels for Algorand, providing traders with reasonable expectations for intraday movement ranges.\nShould You Buy ALGO Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor swing traders, the current ALGO price presents a compelling risk-reward scenario. With support at $0.22 and resistance at $0.29, traders have clearly defined levels for both stop-losses and profit targets. The neutral RSI reading provides flexibility for entry timing.\nDay traders should focus on the $0.25-$0.26 range as a decision zone. Based on Binance spot market data, volume remains healthy enough to support intraday strategies, though the consolidation pattern suggests patience may be required.\nLong-term investors might view the current levels as accumulation opportunities, particularly given that ALGO price remains well above the 200-period moving average at $0.22. The 52-week range of $0.16 to $0.47 shows Algorand has significant room for growth if market conditions improve.\nRisk management remains crucial with stop-losses below $0.22 for most strategies. The ALGO resistance at $0.29 provides a logical first target for those entering long positions.\nConclusion\nALGO price action over the next 24-48 hours likely depends on broader cryptocurrency market sentiment rather than Algorand-specific developments. The technical setup suggests a consolidation phase that could resolve in either direction, making level-based trading strategies particularly relevant. Traders should monitor the $0.25-$0.26 pivot area closely, as sustained movement above or below this range could signal the next directional move for Algorand.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:14:12 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Drops to $563 as Market Correction Erases Post-Halving Gains", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-bitcoin-cash-bch-drops-to-563-as-market-correction-erases", "text": "Quick Take\n• BCH currently trading at $563.20 (-4.75% in 24h) • Bitcoin Cash RSI drops to neutral at 49.11, signaling potential oversold bounce • Market-wide $100B correction overwhelms post-halving momentum\nWhat's Driving Bitcoin Cash Price Today?\nThe BCH price has retreated significantly from its recent highs as the broader cryptocurrency market faces intense selling pressure. Yesterday's market-wide correction that erased over $100 billion in total crypto market capitalization has directly impacted Bitcoin Cash, pushing it down from the $589 consolidation level where it had been holding steady.\nThis pullback comes just days after Bitcoin Cash reached $618.20 on August 14, driven by anticipation surrounding its August halving event. The cryptocurrency had been riding a wave of bullish momentum throughout the week, with BCH breaking above key resistance levels and posting consecutive daily gains. However, the broader market correction has temporarily overshadowed the positive halving narrative.\nDespite the recent positive news around the halving event, the current market sentiment has shifted decidedly bearish across all major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Cash is not immune to these macro headwinds, even with its recent technical strength and fundamental catalysts.\nBCH Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nThe Bitcoin Cash technical analysis reveals a complex picture as bullish and bearish forces collide. Bitcoin Cash's RSI has dropped to 49.11, placing it firmly in neutral territory after previously showing overbought conditions during the rally phase. This BCH RSI reading suggests the selling pressure may be reaching exhaustion levels.\nThe MACD indicator tells a concerning story for short-term traders, with the histogram showing -3.2786, indicating bearish momentum is building for BCH. The MACD line at 13.4443 remains above the signal line at 16.7229, but this gap is narrowing, suggesting potential downward pressure.\nBitcoin Cash's position relative to its moving averages shows the cryptocurrency trading below its 7-day SMA of $593.31 and approaching its 20-day SMA at $574.31. However, BCH remains well above its 50-day SMA of $540.69 and significantly higher than its 200-day SMA at $411.12, maintaining the overall bullish structure.\nThe Bollinger Bands analysis shows Bitcoin Cash trading in the lower half of the bands, with a %B position of 0.3831, indicating room for further downside before reaching oversold levels.\nBitcoin Cash Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical Bitcoin Cash support levels are now coming into focus as the BCH price tests lower ranges. The immediate support sits at $514.50, which represents a crucial level for maintaining the medium-term bullish structure. A break below this level could trigger further selling toward the strong support zone at $468.80.\nOn the upside, BCH resistance has formed at $634.30, which aligns with both immediate and strong resistance levels. This consolidation suggests that any recovery attempt will face significant selling pressure at these elevated levels.\nThe daily trading range of $562.30 to $591.50 shows the volatility Bitcoin Cash has experienced, with the Average True Range of $29.30 indicating continued high volatility expectations.\nBased on Binance spot market data, the BCH/USDT pair has seen substantial volume of $18.79 million over the past 24 hours, indicating active trader participation during this corrective phase.\nShould You Buy BCH Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor aggressive traders, the current BCH price level presents a potential oversold bounce opportunity, particularly with the RSI approaching neutral territory and the recent halving catalyst still in play. However, risk management is crucial given the broader market uncertainty.\nConservative investors should wait for a clear break above the $590 level and sustained trading above the 7-day moving average before considering new positions. The risk of further downside to the $514.50 support level remains elevated.\nSwing traders might consider scaling into positions if Bitcoin Cash holds above $560, with a strict stop-loss below $514.50. The reward potential extends to the $634.30 resistance level, offering a favorable risk-reward ratio for patient traders.\nDay traders should monitor the BCH/USDT pair closely for any signs of stabilization around current levels, as the high volatility environment creates both opportunities and significant risks.\nConclusion\nBitcoin Cash faces a critical juncture as post-halving enthusiasm meets broader market correction forces. While the BCH price has pulled back to $563.20, the cryptocurrency maintains its longer-term bullish structure above key moving averages. The next 24-48 hours will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin Cash can find support at current levels or if further downside toward $514.50 is in store. Traders should remain cautious and wait for clearer directional signals before making significant position changes.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:32:33 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

On August 14, 2025, Avalanche surged an unprecedented 468.95% in 24 hours, reaching $24.42 driven by massive institutional adoption and strategic network upgrades.\nThis explosive move was fueled by growing institutional interest, particularly highlighted by BlackRock's substantial $240 million investment in the Avalanche ecosystem. The rally gained additional momentum from Avalanche's expanded stablecoin support through Visa integration, significantly enhancing real-world DeFi adoption prospects.\nHowever, despite the overwhelmingly positive institutional developments, the AVAX price faced headwinds on August 12 when it declined 4.97% as traders anticipated an upcoming token unlock event. This demonstrates how technical factors can temporarily override even the strongest fundamental catalysts in cryptocurrency markets.\nThe current 3.44% decline appears to be a healthy consolidation phase following last week's extraordinary gains, with the AVAX/USDT pair finding stability around current levels.\nAVAX Technical Analysis: Neutral Signals Emerge\nThe Avalanche technical analysis reveals a market in consolidation mode after extreme volatility. AVAX's RSI currently sits at 51.75, positioning it squarely in neutral territory – a significant shift from the likely overbought conditions that followed last week's massive surge.\nAvalanche's moving averages paint an interesting picture. The current AVAX price of $23.84 sits between the 7-day SMA at $24.40 and the 20-day SMA at $23.28, indicating short-term consolidation. Importantly, the price remains well above the 50-day SMA ($22.35) and 200-day SMA ($21.60), confirming the overall bullish trend structure remains intact.\nThe MACD indicator shows a bullish histogram reading of 0.0183, suggesting that despite the recent pullback, underlying momentum for Avalanche remains positive. This technical setup often precedes renewed upward movement once consolidation completes.\nAvalanche's daily ATR of $1.62 reflects the high volatility environment, which traders should factor into their position sizing decisions.\nAvalanche Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, Avalanche support levels are clearly defined. The immediate AVAX support sits at $20.57, which aligns closely with the Bollinger Bands lower boundary at $20.84. This convergence creates a strong technical floor for any further declines.\nShould the AVAX price break below immediate support, the next Avalanche support levels to watch are the strong support at $16.94, which represents a more significant technical breakdown scenario.\nOn the upside, AVAX resistance levels are equally important for traders. The immediate resistance stands at $25.99, just above the recent 24-hour high of $25.68. Breaking this level would likely target the Bollinger Bands upper boundary at $25.71, followed by the strong AVAX resistance at $27.38.\nThe current Bollinger Bands position shows AVAX at 0.6154, indicating the price is trading in the upper portion of the band but not at extreme levels, providing room for upward movement.\nShould You Buy AVAX Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor momentum traders, the current AVAX price presents a compelling risk-reward setup. With Avalanche trading above key moving averages and maintaining neutral RSI levels, there's potential for renewed upside targeting the $25.99-$27.38 resistance zone.\nConservative investors might consider dollar-cost averaging into positions, given the strong institutional backing demonstrated by BlackRock's investment and the Visa integration expanding real-world utility. The fundamental backdrop for Avalanche remains exceptionally strong despite short-term price volatility.\nSwing traders should monitor the $20.57 support level closely. A break below this level with volume would signal a deeper correction toward the $16.94 strong support, representing a potential 29% downside risk from current levels.\nRisk management is crucial given Avalanche's high volatility. Based on Binance spot market data, the daily ATR suggests potential price swings of $1.62, which represents approximately 6.8% of the current AVAX price.\nConclusion\nThe AVAX price correction to $23.84 represents a healthy consolidation following last week's historic 468% rally driven by institutional adoption. With Avalanche technical analysis showing neutral momentum indicators and strong fundamental catalysts including BlackRock's investment and Visa integration, the medium-term outlook remains constructive. Traders should watch the $20.57 support level for continuation signals, while the $25.99 resistance presents the next upside target for AVAX/USDT over the next 24-48 hours.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:14:29 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

Despite today's 7.79% decline, the broader context remains bullish following a week of substantial whale accumulation.\nThe most significant catalyst emerged on August 17 when reports of a whale buying frenzy propelled UNI past $11, representing the token's best rally in eight months. This institutional interest coincided with a broader cryptocurrency market recovery led by Bitcoin's resurgence, creating favorable conditions for DeFi tokens.\nWhale activity has been particularly noteworthy, with substantial accumulation patterns observed throughout the week. Even as some large holders like Amber Group executed strategic sales worth $3.81 million, the net effect has been overwhelmingly positive for UNI price momentum. The current pullback appears to be profit-taking behavior rather than a fundamental shift in sentiment.\nUNI Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nThe Uniswap technical analysis reveals a complex picture following the recent volatility. UNI's RSI currently sits at 49.80, placing it in neutral territory after cooling off from overbought conditions during the rally. This positioning suggests the immediate selling pressure may be subsiding.\nUniswap's moving averages paint a bullish medium-term picture despite today's decline. The UNI price remains above the critical 50-day SMA at $9.54 and significantly above the 200-day SMA at $7.54, indicating the long-term uptrend remains intact. However, the price has fallen below the 7-day SMA at $11.10, suggesting short-term weakness.\nThe MACD histogram shows -0.0674, indicating bearish momentum in the immediate term. This aligns with the current pullback but doesn't negate the overall bullish structure. Uniswap's Bollinger Bands show the UNI price trading near the middle band at $10.37, with room to move toward either the upper band at $12.14 or lower band at $8.61.\nUniswap Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, Uniswap support levels are clearly defined at $8.68 for immediate support and $6.50 for strong support. The UNI resistance levels show immediate resistance at $12.30, which aligns with the strong resistance level.\nThe current UNI/USDT trading range of $10.10 to $11.39 over the past 24 hours provides tactical guidance for short-term traders. The pivot point at $10.61 sits close to current levels, making it a critical zone to watch for directional moves.\nFor swing traders, the $8.68 support level represents an attractive entry point if reached, offering a favorable risk-reward ratio against the $12.30 resistance target. The wide gap between strong support at $6.50 and strong resistance at $12.30 indicates significant potential volatility.\nShould You Buy UNI Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nThe current UNI price action presents different opportunities based on trading timeframes and risk tolerance. For aggressive traders, the pullback to $10.33 could represent a buying opportunity if whale accumulation continues, with stops below $9.54 and targets at $12.30.\nConservative investors might wait for a deeper retracement toward the $8.68 support level, which would offer better risk-reward positioning. The strong institutional interest evidenced by recent whale activity suggests any significant dips could be quickly absorbed.\nDay traders should monitor the $10.61 pivot level closely, as breaks above could target yesterday's high at $11.39, while breaks below might test the $10.10 low. The high 24-hour volume of $94.9 million on Binance spot provides adequate liquidity for most trading strategies.\nRisk management remains crucial given UNI's daily ATR of $0.84, indicating substantial potential price swings. The proximity to both support and resistance levels requires tight stop-losses for any position.\nConclusion\nDespite today's 7.79% decline, UNI price remains in a structurally bullish position following its breakthrough to 8-month highs. The whale accumulation trend and broader DeFi market strength suggest current weakness may be temporary. Traders should watch the $10.61 pivot and $8.68 support levels for the next directional move, with the overall trend favoring buyers on any significant dips. The next 24-48 hours will likely determine whether UNI can consolidate above $10 or requires a deeper correction before resuming its upward trajectory.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:26:35 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "DOGE Price Faces Security Concerns as 51% Attack Threat Emerges", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-doge-price-faces-security-concerns-as-51-attack-threat-emerges", "text": "Quick Take\n• DOGE currently trading at $0.22 (-5.11% in 24h) • Dogecoin's RSI at 49.51 suggests neutral momentum despite recent decline • Security threat from planned 51% attack creates bearish sentiment • Recent whale accumulation of $200M provides underlying support\nWhat's Driving Dogecoin Price Today?\nThe DOGE price has declined 5.11% in the past 24 hours following alarming news that the Qubic community has voted to target Dogecoin with a 51% attack. This security threat mirrors their previous attack on Monero and has created immediate panic among DOGE holders, contributing to today's price weakness.\nDespite this recent negative development, Dogecoin technical analysis shows the cryptocurrency has experienced significant volatility over the past week. Earlier this month, DOGE demonstrated remarkable strength during the broader altcoin season, surging 25.5% and posting an impressive 8% single-day gain on August 13th.\nThe week also saw substantial whale activity when a large holder accumulated nearly $200 million worth of DOGE on August 11th, briefly pushing the DOGE price from $0.22 to $0.23 before settling back. This accumulation suggests institutional confidence despite current security concerns.\nDOGE Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Amid Security Uncertainty\nBased on Binance spot market data, Dogecoin's technical picture presents conflicting signals. The DOGE RSI currently sits at 49.51, placing it in neutral territory and suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This neutral reading provides room for movement in either direction depending on how security concerns develop.\nDogecoin's moving averages tell a cautiously optimistic story. The current DOGE price of $0.22 sits right at the 20-day SMA, while trading above both the 50-day SMA ($0.21) and 200-day SMA ($0.20). However, the price has fallen below the shorter-term 7-day SMA ($0.23) and 12-day EMA ($0.23), indicating recent bearish pressure.\nThe MACD histogram shows a slightly bearish divergence at -0.0003, suggesting weakening momentum for DOGE. Meanwhile, the Stochastic oscillator presents mixed signals with %K at 43.63 and %D at 57.29, indicating neither strong buying nor selling pressure.\nDogecoin's Bollinger Bands reveal the cryptocurrency is trading near the middle band ($0.22) with a %B position of 0.5263, suggesting relatively neutral positioning within its recent trading range.\nDogecoin Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCurrent Dogecoin support levels are critical given the security concerns. The immediate DOGE support sits at $0.19, representing the lower Bollinger Band and a key psychological level. Should this fail, stronger Dogecoin support levels emerge at $0.16, which would represent a significant test of buyer confidence.\nOn the upside, DOGE resistance appears at $0.26, aligning with recent highs before the security news emerged. The stronger resistance level sits at $0.29, representing a more substantial technical barrier that would need to be overcome for any meaningful rally.\nThe pivot point analysis suggests $0.23 as the neutral level, which coincidentally aligns with several moving averages, making it a critical level to watch for directional bias in the DOGE/USDT trading pair.\nShould You Buy DOGE Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nThe current DOGE price presents a complex risk-reward scenario that varies significantly based on trader timeframe and risk tolerance. For short-term traders, the immediate security threat creates substantial downside risk, with the potential for further declines if the 51% attack materializes or gains more attention.\nConservative investors might consider waiting for clearer resolution of security concerns before establishing new positions. The $0.19 support level offers a potential entry point for those willing to accept higher risk, but only with tight stop-losses below $0.16.\nMore aggressive traders might view the current price action as an overreaction, especially given the recent whale accumulation and broader altcoin momentum. However, position sizing should reflect the elevated uncertainty, and any positions should be closely monitored given the 24-hour trading volume of $369,833,648 showing active market participation.\nRisk management becomes paramount in this environment. Traders should consider the Average True Range of $0.02, which indicates typical daily price movements and can help in setting appropriate stop-loss levels.\nConclusion\nThe DOGE price faces a critical juncture as security concerns overshadow recent positive momentum. While Dogecoin technical analysis suggests neutral conditions with room for movement in either direction, the planned 51% attack creates an immediate bearish catalyst that traders must carefully consider.\nOver the next 24-48 hours, watch for any updates regarding the security threat and monitor the $0.19 support level closely. A break below this level could accelerate selling, while successful defense might provide a foundation for recovery as the broader altcoin season continues. The substantial whale accumulation provides some confidence, but security concerns remain the dominant near-term factor influencing DOGE price action.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:56:08 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

This correction comes after Solana's impressive 18% surge earlier this week, driven by major technical upgrades including Firedancer and Alpenglow implementations that enhance network scalability.\nThe recent decline appears connected to news that Solana network transactions dropped to 1.1 billion in August, down from July's peak levels. This transaction volume decrease has created some uncertainty among traders, despite the positive momentum from institutional adoption stories.\nHowever, the broader context remains constructive for SOL. The Solana Index significantly outperformed traditional stock markets this week, climbing 6.7% compared to just 2.4% for stock indices. This outperformance highlights growing institutional interest in Solana-based assets, supporting the narrative around the network's technical improvements.\nSOL Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals After Sharp Pullback\nSolana technical analysis reveals a complex picture following today's 6% decline. The SOL RSI sits at 50.73, indicating neutral momentum after cooling off from potentially overbought conditions during the recent rally. This RSI level suggests the selling pressure may be stabilizing.\nThe MACD remains bullish for Solana, with the main line at 4.5099 above the signal line at 4.0896, generating a positive histogram reading of 0.4203. This indicates underlying bullish momentum persists despite the daily pullback.\nSolana's price action relative to moving averages shows strength above key levels. SOL trades above both the 20-day SMA at $177.88 and 50-day SMA at $172.55, though it's fallen below the 7-day SMA at $190.44. The 200-day SMA sits at $157.67, providing long-term trend support.\nThe Bollinger Bands analysis shows SOL at 0.5680 between the bands, with the upper band at $200.84 and lower band at $154.92. This positioning suggests room for movement in either direction without extreme conditions.\nSolana Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical Solana support levels emerge at $180.00, which represents today's daily low and immediate psychological support. Below this, stronger support appears at $155.83, aligning with the lower Bollinger Band region.\nFor SOL resistance, the immediate level sits at $195.89 (today's high), with stronger resistance at $209.86. A break above $209.86 could signal resumption of the bullish trend toward the 52-week high of $261.97.\nThe pivot point analysis based on Binance spot market data places SOL's daily pivot at $185.63. Trading above this level supports bullish bias, while failure to reclaim it could signal further downside toward the $155.83 support zone.\nSolana's daily ATR of $11.06 indicates elevated volatility, suggesting traders should prepare for potential $10+ daily moves in either direction.\nShould You Buy SOL Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor aggressive traders, the current SOL price of $181 presents a potential dip-buying opportunity, especially with the SOL/USDT pair holding above key moving averages. The risk-reward setup favors bulls if SOL can reclaim $185 pivot support, targeting the $195-$209 resistance zone.\nConservative investors might wait for clearer signals. A break below $180 support could trigger further selling toward $155, representing significant downside risk. Conversely, a bounce from current levels with volume confirmation could indicate the pullback is complete.\nSwing traders should monitor the SOL RSI for oversold readings below 30 as potential entry signals, while using the $180 level as a clear stop-loss reference point.\nBased on Binance spot market data, the $605 million in 24-hour volume suggests sufficient liquidity for most trading strategies, though traders should be prepared for the elevated volatility indicated by the ATR reading.\nConclusion\nThe SOL price faces a critical juncture at $181, testing whether the recent 18% rally can sustain despite network transaction concerns. Technical indicators suggest neutral momentum with underlying bullish structure intact above $180 support. Traders should watch for either a bounce confirmation above $185 or a breakdown below $180 to guide next moves over the coming 24-48 hours. The combination of technical upgrades and institutional adoption provides fundamental support, but near-term price action will likely depend on whether Solana can address transaction volume concerns while maintaining its technical momentum.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:50:09 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "XRP Price Drops 5% Despite Legal Settlement Progress - Ripple Technical Analysis Shows Mixed Signals", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-xrp-price-drops-5-despite-legal-settlement-progress-ripple-technical", "text": "Quick Take\n• XRP currently trading at $2.96 (-5.12% in 24h) • XRP RSI at 44.93 signals neutral momentum with potential oversold conditions developing • Joint SEC status report filed August 15 indicates potential settlement, but price consolidates below resistance\nWhat's Driving Ripple Price Today?\nDespite the promising regulatory developments over the past week, the XRP price has retreated from recent highs as profit-taking pressure emerges. The joint status report submitted by Ripple and the SEC on August 15, 2025, initially sparked optimism about a potential settlement resolution, but traders appear to be taking a cautious approach.\nThe recent 35% surge that occurred on August 13 brought significant institutional attention, with $31.26 million in inflows reported. However, this rapid appreciation has led to natural consolidation as the market digests these gains. Whale accumulation continues to provide underlying support, but short-term selling pressure from retail traders has pushed the XRP price below the critical $3.00 psychological level.\nThe legal clarity that emerged from the August 5 settlement initially boosted confidence, helping XRP defy its historical August decline pattern. However, the current price action suggests that while the fundamental outlook remains positive, technical resistance levels are proving challenging to overcome.\nXRP Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals as Momentum Weakens\nThe XRP RSI reading of 44.93 places Ripple in neutral territory, though it's approaching oversold conditions that could signal a potential bounce. This represents a significant decline from the overbought levels seen during last week's rally, indicating that selling pressure has been absorbed.\nRipple's MACD histogram shows -0.0315, confirming bearish momentum in the short term. The MACD line at 0.0272 remains below the signal line at 0.0587, suggesting that downward pressure could continue before buyers step in.\nThe Stochastic indicators paint a more concerning picture for XRP, with the %K at 13.14 and %D at 36.51, indicating that Ripple is approaching oversold territory. This could present a buying opportunity for traders looking for a reversal signal.\nRipple's Bollinger Bands show the current price at 0.2679 of the band width, positioning XRP closer to the lower band at $2.82. The middle band at $3.09 now acts as immediate resistance, while the upper band at $3.36 represents the breakout level that bulls need to reclaim.\nRipple Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, XRP faces immediate resistance at $3.38, which coincides with recent rejection levels. The stronger resistance at $3.66 represents the next major hurdle that would confirm a continuation of the bullish trend established after the legal settlement.\nOn the downside, Ripple support levels are clearly defined. The immediate support at $2.73 aligns closely with the current trading range low of $2.94. This level has proven resilient during recent tests and represents a critical defense zone for bulls.\nThe XRP/USDT pair shows strong support at $2.15, though reaching this level would require a significant breakdown that seems unlikely given the positive fundamental backdrop. The 50-day SMA at $2.94 currently provides dynamic support and aligns with recent lows.\nThe 200-day SMA at $2.46 remains well below current prices, confirming that the overall trend for XRP remains bullish despite the recent pullback.\nShould You Buy XRP Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor swing traders, the current XRP price presents a compelling risk-reward setup. The legal clarity provides a strong fundamental foundation, while the technical pullback offers better entry levels than were available during last week's surge.\nConservative traders should wait for a clear break above $3.38 resistance before adding positions, as this would confirm that the consolidation phase is complete. A stop-loss below $2.73 would provide a reasonable risk management level.\nAggressive traders might consider accumulating near current levels, given that XRP RSI approaching oversold conditions and the proximity to the 50-day SMA support. However, position sizing should account for potential further weakness toward $2.73.\nLong-term investors benefit from the regulatory clarity that the SEC settlement provides. The whale accumulation pattern and institutional inflows suggest that smart money remains bullish on Ripple's prospects, making current weakness potentially temporary.\nConclusion\nThe XRP price faces a critical juncture as positive legal developments clash with short-term technical weakness. While the 5.12% decline represents normal consolidation after a 35% surge, the key test will be whether Ripple can defend the $2.73-$2.94 support zone. Traders should monitor whether XRP RSI can hold above 40 and if buying interest emerges at current levels. The next 24-48 hours will likely determine if this pullback represents a healthy correction or the start of a deeper retracement in the XRP/USDT pair.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:38:06 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

The TRX price has been primarily supported by a massive $1 billion buyback program announced this week, which has contributed to TRON approaching its eighth consecutive weekly gain with a 15% increase.\nThe most significant catalyst has been the strategic partnership between Binance and T3, positioning TRON for a potential 20% price surge according to recent analysis. This partnership comes at a crucial time as TRX trades at $0.3685, just 18% below its all-time high of $0.44.\nAdding to the bullish narrative, Tron Inc. reported exceptional Q2 2025 financial results with net income of $1,467,855, representing a dramatic turnaround from the previous year's loss of $520,971. The company's shareholders' equity has surged over 3,500% year-over-year to exceed $111 million, demonstrating the network's robust financial foundation.\nHowever, despite these positive developments, the TRX price faces immediate resistance at current levels. The network has processed over $2 billion in stablecoin inflows, with TRON handling $600 billion in stablecoin transactions monthly, primarily driven by USDT dominance and its low-cost blockchain infrastructure.\nTRX Technical Analysis: Bullish Signals Emerge Despite Short-Term Headwinds\nBased on Binance spot market data, TRON technical analysis reveals a predominantly bullish setup with some near-term caution signals. The TRX RSI sits at 58.28, indicating neutral momentum with room for further upside before entering overbought territory.\nTRON's moving averages paint a clear bullish picture across all timeframes. The TRX/USDT pair trades above its 7-day SMA at $0.35, 20-day SMA at $0.34, 50-day SMA at $0.32, and significantly above the 200-day SMA at $0.27. This alignment suggests strong underlying trend momentum supporting the TRX price.\nHowever, TRON's MACD histogram shows a slight bearish divergence at -0.0005, indicating some short-term momentum cooling. The MACD line at 0.0100 remains above the signal line at 0.0105, but the narrowing spread suggests traders should monitor for potential momentum shifts.\nTRON's Bollinger Bands reveal the TRX price is positioned at 0.6343 between the bands, closer to the upper band at $0.36 than the lower band at $0.32. This positioning suggests TRON is in a bullish phase but approaching potential resistance levels.\nTRON Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nThe TRX price structure shows critical levels that will determine near-term direction. TRON support levels are well-established with immediate support at $0.32 aligning with the 50-day moving average and Bollinger Band lower boundary. This level has proven significant during the recent rally and represents a key area for potential buying interest.\nStronger TRON support sits at $0.28, which coincides with previous consolidation areas and would represent a more substantial pullback. A break below this level could signal a deeper correction in the TRX price.\nOn the upside, TRX resistance appears immediately at $0.37, which has capped recent advances and represents the critical level for continuation of the bullish trend. Breaking above this resistance could open the path toward the psychological $0.40 level and potentially challenge the all-time high at $0.44.\nThe current pivot point at $0.35 serves as a key reference level, with TRON currently testing this area after the recent 1.84% daily decline.\nShould You Buy TRX Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor aggressive traders, the current TRX price setup offers an attractive risk-reward proposition. The combination of fundamental catalysts including the $1 billion buyback program and technical positioning above key moving averages suggests potential for testing higher resistance levels. Entry near current levels with a stop-loss below $0.32 provides a reasonable risk management framework.\nConservative investors might wait for either a deeper pullback to the $0.32 support level or a confirmed break above $0.37 resistance before establishing positions. The TRX RSI in neutral territory provides flexibility for both approaches.\nSwing traders could benefit from the current consolidation pattern, with clear support and resistance levels offering defined entry and exit points. The 24-hour trading range between $0.34 and $0.36 provides guidance for short-term position management.\nRisk management remains crucial given the recent 26% rally over 90 days. While TRON's fundamentals appear strong, the $2.95 million outflow noted in recent analysis suggests some profit-taking pressure that could weigh on the TRX price in the near term.\nConclusion\nTRON presents a compelling but nuanced opportunity as the TRX price consolidates near key resistance after substantial gains. The combination of the Binance-T3 partnership, record buyback program, and strong financial results provides fundamental support, while technical indicators suggest room for additional upside despite some momentum cooling. Traders should focus on the $0.37 resistance level as the key determinant for TRON's next directional move over the next 24-48 hours, with $0.32 serving as critical support for maintaining the bullish trend structure.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:50:58 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "BNB Price Retreats from $864 All-Time High as Profit-Taking Emerges", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-bnb-price-retreats-from-864-all-time-high-as-profit", "text": "Quick Take\n• BNB currently trading at $831.09 (-3.39% in 24h) • Binance Coin RSI at 59.75 signals neutral momentum after recent all-time high • Record $864 peak achieved August 14 before natural profit-taking pullback\nWhat's Driving Binance Coin Price Today?\nThe BNB price action reflects a natural consolidation phase following Binance Coin's explosive rally to an all-time high of $864 just four days ago. This pullback appears healthy rather than concerning, as the token maintains strong positioning above critical support levels.\nThe recent achievement of surpassing a $120 billion market capitalization on August 15 demonstrates institutional confidence in Binance Coin's long-term value proposition. This milestone positioned BNB ahead of major traditional assets like ConocoPhillips, ranking it 181st globally among all asset classes.\nBinance's enhancement of its BFUSD service, announced August 11 and implemented August 14, provides additional utility for the ecosystem. Users can now subscribe and redeem directly through Binance Earn without requiring a Futures account, streamlining access to yield-generating products.\nDespite the brief dip below $800 on August 10, the overall weekly sentiment remains decidedly bullish. The current BNB price of $831.09 represents only a modest retreat from recent highs, suggesting strong underlying demand.\nBNB Technical Analysis: Bullish Signals Emerge\nBinance Coin technical analysis reveals a predominantly bullish structure despite the recent pullback. The BNB RSI reading of 59.75 indicates neutral momentum with room for further upside movement, avoiding overbought conditions that could signal deeper corrections.\nThe MACD histogram shows a positive 1.5514 reading, confirming bullish momentum remains intact for Binance Coin. This technical indicator suggests the underlying trend favors buyers despite short-term price weakness.\nMoving averages paint an encouraging picture, with BNB trading above all major exponential moving averages. Binance Coin's position above the EMA 12 ($822.72) and EMA 26 ($797.26) confirms short-term bullish bias remains strong.\nThe Bollinger Bands analysis shows Binance Coin positioned at 0.7307 of the band width, indicating the token trades in the upper portion of its recent range. This positioning suggests continued strength while providing clear reference points for potential resistance near $868.44.\nBinance Coin Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical BNB resistance emerges at $869.40, closely aligned with the upper Bollinger Band at $868.44. A decisive break above this level could trigger renewed buying interest and potentially extend gains toward $900.\nBinance Coin support levels provide multiple defensive zones for bulls. Immediate support sits at $730.01, while stronger support emerges at $643.71. The current BNB price of $831.09 maintains a comfortable buffer above these critical levels.\nThe pivot point at $839.77 serves as an important short-term reference, with Binance Coin currently trading below this level. Reclaiming the pivot could signal renewed bullish momentum for the BNB/USDT trading pair.\nBased on Binance spot market data, the daily ATR of $30.70 indicates normal volatility levels, suggesting the current price action falls within expected ranges for Binance Coin.\nShould You Buy BNB Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nConservative traders should wait for a clear reclaim of the $840-850 zone before considering new long positions. This approach provides confirmation that the pullback has concluded and bullish momentum is resuming.\nAggressive traders might consider the current BNB price attractive, given the strong support structure and bullish technical indicators. However, risk management remains crucial with stop-losses below $800 to protect against deeper corrections.\nSwing traders can utilize the current consolidation to accumulate positions gradually, taking advantage of any further weakness toward Binance Coin support levels. The overall trend remains very strong bullish, supporting a buy-the-dip strategy.\nThe risk-reward profile appears favorable for medium-term holders, with the recent all-time high proving Binance Coin's ability to achieve new price discovery. Market capitalization growth to $120 billion provides fundamental support for higher valuations.\nConclusion\nThe BNB price consolidation around $831 appears healthy following the recent sprint to $864 all-time highs. Binance Coin technical analysis supports continued bullish bias, with key support levels providing downside protection. Traders should monitor the $840 pivot reclaim for confirmation of resumed uptrend momentum over the next 24-48 hours.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:31:59 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "APT Price Analysis: Aptos Holds Above $4.50 Amid Neutral Market Signals", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-apt-price-analysis-aptos-holds-above-450-amid-neutral-market", "text": "Quick Take\n• APT currently trading at $4.60 (-5.33% in 24h) • Aptos RSI at 48.17 indicates neutral momentum with room for movement in either direction • No significant news catalysts driving recent price action, suggesting technical factors dominate\nWhat's Driving Aptos Price Today?\nThe APT price decline of 5.33% over the past 24 hours appears to be driven primarily by broader market sentiment rather than Aptos-specific developments. With no significant news events reported in the past week, traders are focusing on technical levels and general cryptocurrency market dynamics.\nThe absence of major announcements or partnerships has left APT vulnerable to profit-taking after recent gains. Trading volume on Binance spot reached $29.3 million, indicating moderate interest but not the elevated activity typically seen during major price breakouts.\nMarket participants appear to be in a wait-and-see mode, with many altcoins experiencing similar consolidation patterns. The lack of clear directional catalysts has created a neutral trading environment where technical analysis becomes the primary driver of short-term price movements.\nAPT Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Suggest Consolidation\nAptos technical analysis reveals a cryptocurrency caught between competing forces. The APT RSI reading of 48.17 sits firmly in neutral territory, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This positioning gives Aptos room to move in either direction based on market sentiment and volume.\nThe MACD indicator presents an interesting contradiction. While the main MACD line shows a positive reading of 0.0080, it remains below the signal line at -0.0190. However, the MACD histogram at 0.0271 indicates building bullish momentum, suggesting potential upward pressure may be developing beneath the surface.\nAptos's moving averages paint a complex picture. The current APT price of $4.60 sits above the 20-period SMA at $4.54 but below the 7-period SMA at $4.77, indicating short-term weakness within a longer-term neutral trend. The fact that APT trades significantly below the 200-period SMA at $5.19 suggests the longer-term trend remains challenged.\nThe Bollinger Bands analysis shows APT positioned at 0.5679 within the bands, indicating the price sits slightly above the middle band. This positioning suggests moderate bullish bias within the current trading range, with the upper band at $5.03 providing the next major resistance target.\nAptos Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, Aptos support levels are clearly defined with immediate support at $4.05 coinciding with the strong support level. This confluence makes $4.05 a critical level for APT bulls to defend. A break below this level could trigger further downside toward the 52-week low of $3.93.\nOn the upside, APT resistance becomes relevant around $5.15 for immediate resistance, followed by the more significant barrier at $5.66. The proximity of the Bollinger Band upper limit at $5.03 creates an additional resistance zone that traders should monitor.\nThe current APT/USDT trading range between $4.55 and $4.95 over the past 24 hours establishes the immediate battleground. A break above $4.95 could signal renewed bullish momentum, while a move below $4.55 might indicate further consolidation or decline.\nThe pivot point at $4.70 serves as a key reference level, with the current APT price slightly below this mark. A reclaim of the pivot point could signal improving sentiment for short-term traders.\nShould You Buy APT Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor conservative traders, the current setup suggests waiting for clearer directional signals. The neutral APT RSI and mixed moving average readings indicate Aptos lacks strong momentum in either direction. A break above $5.15 resistance or below $4.05 support would provide better entry opportunities with defined risk parameters.\nAggressive traders might consider the current APT price attractive given the proximity to key support levels. The risk-reward ratio becomes favorable if entering near $4.60 with a stop-loss below $4.05, targeting the $5.15-$5.66 resistance zone. This setup offers approximately 1:1 to 1:2 risk-reward ratios.\nSwing traders should monitor the MACD histogram for continued bullish divergence. If the histogram continues expanding while APT holds above $4.05 support, it could signal an impending upward move. However, volume confirmation would be essential for any sustained rally.\nThe high daily ATR of $0.29 indicates significant volatility, suggesting position sizing should account for potential 6-7% daily moves in either direction. This volatility creates opportunities for day traders but requires strict risk management protocols.\nConclusion\nAPT price action over the next 24-48 hours will likely depend on whether bulls can defend the crucial $4.05 support level. With Aptos technical analysis showing neutral momentum and no immediate catalysts on the horizon, traders should prepare for continued consolidation within the established range. The key inflection points remain clear: a break above $5.15 for bullish continuation or a move below $4.05 for potential further weakness. Given the current technical setup, patience may be the best strategy until clearer directional signals emerge.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:08:54 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "Litecoin (LTC) Retreats 4.5% Despite ETF Optimism and Bullish Breakout", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-litecoin-ltc-retreats-45-despite-etf-optimism-and-bullish-breakout", "text": "Quick Take\n• LTC currently trading at $116.65 (-4.47% in 24h) • Litecoin's RSI sits in neutral territory at 50.33 after recent surge • ETF approval speculation drove 11% rally earlier this week\nWhat's Driving Litecoin Price Today?\nDespite Litecoin's impressive performance earlier this week, the LTC price is experiencing a natural pullback as traders take profits following the recent surge. The retreat comes after Litecoin jumped 11% on August 14th, reaching $124.90, driven by growing optimism around potential U.S. spot ETF approval.\nThe recent consolidation appears healthy given Litecoin's significant breakout from a three-year sideways trading pattern on August 13th, when LTC price gained 10.85%. This technical breakout represents a major shift in market structure that had kept Litecoin range-bound for an extended period.\nAdding to the fundamental strength, Litecoin's adoption metrics continue improving. The cryptocurrency climbed to second place in crypto payments on CoinGate, capturing 14.5% of all transactions and overtaking both USDC and TRON. This increased utility is further evidenced by the Litecoin network processing its 340 millionth transaction, with 12% of these occurring in 2025 alone.\nLTC Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals After Strong Rally\nThe Litecoin technical analysis reveals a complex picture as the cryptocurrency digests recent gains. Litecoin's RSI currently reads 50.33, positioning LTC RSI in neutral territory after cooling off from overbought levels reached during the recent rally.\nMoving averages paint a bullish picture with Litecoin trading above key long-term levels. The LTC price sits above both the 50-day SMA at $107.23 and the 200-day SMA at $98.13, confirming the overall uptrend remains intact. However, short-term momentum shows signs of weakening with Litecoin trading below the 7-day SMA at $122.89.\nThe MACD histogram at -1.1766 indicates bearish momentum in the near term, though this follows a substantial rally and suggests normal profit-taking behavior. Litecoin's Stochastic oscillator shows oversold conditions with %K at 7.68, potentially signaling a bounce opportunity for aggressive traders.\nBollinger Bands analysis shows Litecoin positioned at 0.4321 between the bands, indicating room for movement in either direction without reaching extreme levels.\nLitecoin Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, Litecoin support levels are clearly defined with immediate support at $103.16 and stronger support at $82.39. These levels represent critical areas where buyers previously stepped in during the consolidation phase.\nOn the upside, LTC resistance sits at $134.19, which aligns closely with Litecoin's 52-week high of $137.04. Breaking through this resistance zone would likely trigger additional buying and potentially lead to new yearly highs for the LTC/USDT pair.\nThe current trading range between $115.29 and $122.99 in the past 24 hours establishes near-term boundaries, with the lower end providing short-term support and the upper end acting as immediate resistance.\nShould You Buy LTC Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor swing traders, the current pullback presents a potential opportunity to enter Litecoin positions with favorable risk-reward ratios. The combination of ETF speculation, technical breakout confirmation, and strong adoption metrics creates a compelling backdrop for medium-term holdings.\nConservative investors might wait for a deeper pullback toward the $103.16 support level before establishing positions, allowing for better entry points and reduced downside risk. This approach would provide approximately 11% cushion from current levels.\nAggressive traders could consider the current levels attractive, given Litecoin's neutral RSI and oversold Stochastic readings. However, position sizing should account for potential further weakness if broader market sentiment deteriorates.\nRisk management remains crucial with stop-losses below $103 for new positions and profit-taking strategies around the $130-135 resistance zone where selling pressure historically emerges.\nConclusion\nThe LTC price consolidation at $116.65 appears healthy following the recent breakout and ETF-driven rally. While short-term momentum indicators suggest caution, the overall technical structure remains bullish with strong fundamental catalysts supporting higher prices. Traders should monitor the $103 support level closely, as a hold above this area would maintain the constructive outlook for Litecoin in the coming 24-48 hours.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:44:48 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

While Stellar's ecosystem has shown remarkable growth with recent milestones, broader crypto market weakness appears to be weighing on short-term price action.\nThe most significant recent catalyst came from Franklin Templeton's decision to tokenize over $445 million worth of U.S. Treasuries on the Stellar network on August 11th. This institutional adoption represents a major validation of Stellar's infrastructure for real-world asset tokenization, demonstrating the network's capacity to handle large-scale financial operations.\nStellar's integration of PayPal's PYUSD stablecoin on August 12th further strengthened the ecosystem's utility for global payments. This partnership positions Stellar as a key infrastructure provider for mainstream financial services, potentially driving long-term adoption and transaction volume growth.\nThe successful implementation of Protocol 23 on August 14th introduced enhanced smart contract functionality and improved network scalability. These technical improvements address previous limitations and position Stellar to compete more effectively in the evolving DeFi landscape.\nPerhaps most impressively, Stellar's Total Value Locked reached an all-time high of $152.11 million on August 13th, representing an 80% increase from July levels. This metric indicates growing confidence in Stellar's DeFi ecosystem and suggests sustained user engagement despite today's price decline.\nXLM Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Emerge\nStellar technical analysis reveals a complex picture with both bullish and bearish elements competing for dominance. The XLM RSI currently sits at 46.03, placing it in neutral territory but closer to oversold conditions, which could signal a potential bounce opportunity for aggressive traders.\nXLM's position relative to key moving averages shows mixed momentum. The current $0.40 price sits below both the 7-day SMA at $0.43 and the 20-day SMA at $0.42, indicating recent bearish pressure. However, XLM remains well above the critical 200-day SMA at $0.31, confirming the longer-term uptrend remains intact.\nThe MACD indicator shows concerning signs with the histogram at -0.0046, suggesting bearish momentum is building in the short term. This technical divergence with the positive fundamental news creates an interesting dynamic for traders to navigate.\nStellar's Bollinger Bands reveal the asset trading in the lower portion of its recent range, with the current price sitting below the middle band at $0.42. The %B position of 0.3361 indicates XLM has room to move lower before reaching oversold territory, based on Binance spot market data.\nStellar Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical Stellar support levels emerge at $0.36 for immediate downside protection, representing the next logical buying zone for value-oriented traders. Should this level fail to hold, XLM could test the stronger support at $0.22, which coincides with the 52-week low and would represent a significant retracement opportunity.\nOn the upside, XLM resistance appears at $0.47, corresponding to the upper Bollinger Band and representing the first major hurdle for any recovery attempt. A sustained break above this level could target the stronger resistance zone at $0.52, which sits just above the recent 52-week high of $0.50.\nThe pivot point at $0.41 serves as a key battleground level, with XLM currently trading just below this threshold. A reclaim of this level on strong volume could signal the beginning of a recovery phase back toward resistance levels.\nShould You Buy XLM Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nConservative traders should wait for XLM price to reclaim the $0.42 level (20-day SMA) with strong volume before considering long positions. This approach minimizes downside risk while still capturing potential upside from the strong fundamental backdrop.\nAggressive traders might consider dollar-cost averaging into positions near current levels, given the disconnect between positive fundamentals and short-term price action. However, risk management becomes crucial with stop-losses placed below $0.36 to limit potential downside.\nThe risk-reward profile favors patient buyers willing to accumulate on weakness, particularly given the recent institutional adoption milestones and ecosystem growth metrics. The 80% increase in Total Value Locked suggests underlying strength that may not be reflected in current pricing.\nSwing traders should monitor the XLM/USDT pair closely for signs of reversal, particularly if XLM RSI approaches oversold levels below 30 or shows positive divergence with price action in the coming sessions.\nConclusion\nXLM faces a critical juncture where strong fundamental developments clash with short-term technical weakness. The $0.40 level represents a key decision point for the next 24-48 hours, with a hold above this zone potentially setting up a recovery toward $0.42-$0.47 resistance. Traders should remain cautious of broader crypto market sentiment while recognizing the significant positive catalysts supporting Stellar's long-term value proposition.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:56:59 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

This correction comes despite overwhelmingly positive fundamental developments that initially drove Ethereum's surge above $4,400.\nThe most significant catalyst has been extraordinary whale activity, with a single investor accumulating $1.34 billion worth of ETH over eight days. This massive accumulation coincided with record inflows into U.S. spot Ether ETFs, signaling institutional confidence in Ethereum's long-term prospects.\nStandard Chartered's recent decision to raise their year-end ETH price forecast to $7,500 reflects growing institutional optimism. The bank cited improved industry engagement and rising ether holdings as key factors supporting their bullish outlook.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission's increasingly favorable stance toward ether ETFs has also contributed to positive sentiment, with institutional investment continuing to flow into Ethereum despite today's price decline.\nETH Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals After Sharp Rally\nEthereum technical analysis reveals a complex picture following the recent rally. The ETH RSI currently sits at 59.35, indicating neutral momentum after cooling off from potentially overbought conditions near the yearly highs.\nEthereum's MACD histogram shows a bearish divergence at -1.2281, suggesting short-term momentum may be shifting. However, the overall MACD line remains elevated at 275.18, indicating the underlying bullish trend remains intact.\nThe moving average structure strongly supports Ethereum's bullish outlook. ETH trades well above its 20-day SMA at $4,053.38 and significantly above the 50-day SMA at $3,522.72. Most notably, Ethereum maintains a substantial premium to its 200-day SMA at $2,569.73, confirming the long-term uptrend.\nEthereum's Bollinger Bands position at 0.64 suggests the recent rally pushed ETH toward the upper band at $4,872.80, with today's pullback providing healthy consolidation within the band structure.\nEthereum Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCritical Ethereum support levels emerge at $3,354.28 for immediate support, with stronger backing at $2,373.00. These levels represent significant accumulation zones based on recent trading activity.\nOn the upside, ETH resistance sits at $4,788.00, just above the recent annual high. A decisive break above this level could trigger renewed buying toward Standard Chartered's $7,500 target.\nThe ETH/USDT pair shows a 24-hour trading range between $4,576.00 and $4,225.86, with current price action testing the lower end of this range. Ethereum's daily ATR of $218.65 indicates elevated volatility, typical during significant trend developments.\nShould You Buy ETH Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nBased on Binance spot market data, the current ETH price presents different opportunities depending on trading timeframe and risk tolerance.\nConservative investors might wait for a deeper pullback toward the $3,354 support level, offering better risk-reward ratios with stop-losses below $3,200. The strong institutional narrative and whale accumulation suggest any significant dips could be short-lived.\nAggressive traders could consider the current level attractive, given the proximity to yearly highs and positive fundamental backdrop. However, risk management becomes crucial with stops below $4,000 to protect against extended correction.\nLong-term holders benefit from the institutional adoption theme, with ETF inflows and major bank price targets supporting higher valuations. The $7,500 year-end target implies potential 75% upside from current levels.\nConclusion\nETH price faces near-term consolidation after testing annual highs, but underlying fundamentals remain exceptionally strong. The combination of massive whale accumulation, institutional ETF inflows, and bullish bank forecasts suggests any weakness may be temporary. Traders should monitor the $3,354 support level closely, while the $4,788 resistance break could signal the next leg toward $7,500 targets.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:26:02 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "AAVE Price Prediction: Targeting $343-$410 Range as Technical Setup Points to Bullish Breakout", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-price-prediction-aave-targeting-343-410-range-as-technical", "text": "AAVE Price Prediction Summary\n• AAVE short-term target (1 week): $306-$320 (+7% to +12%) • Aave medium-term forecast (1 month): $343-$410 range (+20% to +44%) • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $340.49 • Critical support if bearish: $245.00\nRecent Aave Price Predictions from Analysts\nMultiple analyst forecasts converge on a bullish AAVE price prediction for the coming weeks. CoinCodex leads with the most aggressive near-term target at $343.77, while WalletInvestor's AI models suggest an even higher potential ceiling at $410.32. The Aave forecast consensus indicates significant upside potential, with price targets ranging from $306 to $417 across different timeframes.\nCoinLore's $306.35 target appears conservative given current technical conditions, while CoinCu's broad range of $255-$417 acknowledges the cryptocurrency's inherent volatility. PriceForecastBot's medium-term prediction of $268.86 stands as the outlier, suggesting more modest gains. The overwhelming analyst sentiment supports a bullish trajectory, with the Fear & Greed Index at 71 indicating strong market appetite for risk assets.\nAAVE Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Bullish Continuation\nCurrent technical indicators paint a mixed but ultimately constructive picture for AAVE's price action. The MACD histogram at 0.4424 signals building bullish momentum, while the RSI at 47.11 sits in neutral territory, providing room for upward movement without immediate overbought concerns.\nAAVE's position within the Bollinger Bands at 0.4892 suggests the token trades near the middle band, indicating balanced buying and selling pressure. The recent 7.16% daily decline appears to be a healthy pullback from the upper resistance zone around $340.49, creating a more favorable entry point for bullish positioning.\nVolume analysis shows robust trading activity at $38.3 million on Binance, indicating sustained institutional and retail interest. The distance from the 52-week high of 25.68% suggests significant upside potential remains, particularly if AAVE can reclaim key moving averages.\nAave Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for AAVE\nThe primary AAVE price target in a bullish scenario centers around the $343-$410 range, supported by multiple confluences. Breaking above the immediate resistance at $340.49 would likely trigger momentum buying toward the $383.53 yearly high.\nTechnical factors supporting this bullish AAVE price prediction include the token's position above the 200-day SMA at $233.53, indicating a longer-term uptrend remains intact. The MACD crossover above its signal line provides additional confirmation of strengthening momentum.\nA sustained move above $340 could target the $380-$410 zone within 3-4 weeks, representing a 33-44% gain from current levels. This scenario requires broader cryptocurrency market stability and continued DeFi sector strength.\nBearish Risk for Aave\nDownside risks emerge if AAVE fails to hold above the $245 support level, which represents both technical support and the lower Bollinger Band. A breakdown below this level could trigger selling toward the $200-$220 zone.\nThe Aave forecast turns bearish if the 20-day SMA at $286.06 acts as resistance on any bounce attempts. Current price action near this level makes it a critical inflection point for near-term direction.\nKey risk factors include broader market correction, regulatory pressure on DeFi protocols, or significant outflows from Aave's lending pools affecting token utility demand.\nShould You Buy AAVE Now? Entry Strategy\nAave technical analysis suggests a measured accumulation approach rather than aggressive buying at current levels. The optimal entry strategy involves scaling into positions on any weakness toward the $270-$280 support zone.\nConservative traders should wait for a clear break above $300 with volume confirmation before establishing positions. Aggressive traders might consider initial positions around current levels ($285) with plans to add on strength above $300.\nRisk management requires stop-losses below $245 to limit downside exposure. Position sizing should account for AAVE's high volatility, with the 14-day ATR of $19.69 indicating potential for significant daily swings.\nThe question of whether to buy or sell AAVE currently favors patient accumulation, given the constructive technical setup and analyst consensus pointing higher.\nAAVE Price Prediction Conclusion\nThis AAVE price prediction anticipates a move toward $343-$410 over the next month, representing 20-44% upside potential. The prediction carries medium confidence based on bullish MACD momentum, analyst consensus, and favorable positioning relative to key moving averages.\nCritical indicators to monitor include AAVE's ability to reclaim the $300 level and subsequent break above $340.49 resistance. Failure to hold $270 support would invalidate the bullish thesis and suggest further consolidation.\nThe timeline for this Aave forecast spans 2-4 weeks, with initial confirmation expected upon a sustained break above $300. Traders should monitor DeFi sector performance and broader cryptocurrency market trends as key catalysts for the predicted price movement.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:13:16 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "LDO Price Prediction: Targeting $1.75-$2.10 Range by End of August 2025", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-price-prediction-ldo-targeting-175-210-range-by-end", "text": "With Lido DAO (LDO) currently trading at $1.30 after an 8.61% daily decline, technical indicators are painting a mixed but ultimately optimistic picture for the liquid staking token. Despite the recent pullback, multiple analyst forecasts and technical signals suggest LDO is positioning for a significant recovery in the coming weeks.\nLDO Price Prediction Summary\n• LDO short-term target (1 week): $1.64 (+26.2%) • Lido DAO medium-term forecast (1 month): $1.75-$2.10 range • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $1.63 (strong resistance) • Critical support if bearish: $0.85 (immediate support)\nRecent Lido DAO Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe analyst community shows remarkable consensus on LDO's upside potential, with most LDO price prediction models targeting significant gains. CoinCodex leads with the most aggressive short-term LDO price target of $1.64 by August 15th, representing a 14.57% increase from their analysis date. This aligns closely with our current technical resistance level at $1.63.\nCoinDCX provides the most compelling medium-term Lido DAO forecast, projecting a $1.75-$2.10 range for August 2025 based on anticipated Ethereum staking demand growth and potential BlackRock ETF staking approval. This fundamental catalyst could be the key driver pushing LDO beyond technical resistance levels.\nThe most contrarian view comes from PriceForecastBot, predicting a decline to $1.03 within one month. However, this bearish LDO price prediction appears increasingly unlikely given the current technical setup and bullish momentum indicators.\nLDO Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Bullish Breakout\nLido DAO technical analysis reveals a compelling setup despite today's price weakness. The MACD histogram shows a positive 0.0046 reading with the MACD line (0.1120) above the signal line (0.1074), indicating building bullish momentum. This technical divergence often precedes significant price moves higher.\nThe RSI at 56.86 sits in neutral territory, providing ample room for upward movement without reaching overbought conditions. More importantly, LDO's position within the Bollinger Bands at 0.6214 suggests the token is in the upper half of its recent trading range, supporting continued upward pressure.\nVolume analysis from Binance spot shows $32.09 million in 24-hour trading, indicating healthy liquidity for any breakout attempt. The current price action has LDO testing the SMA 7 at $1.41 from below, with a successful reclaim likely to trigger the next leg higher toward the $1.63 resistance zone.\nLido DAO Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for LDO\nThe primary LDO price target in a bullish scenario targets the $1.63-$1.67 resistance cluster, where the strong resistance level meets the upper Bollinger Band. A decisive break above this zone opens the path to the CoinDCX forecast range of $1.75-$2.10.\nThe technical pattern suggests LDO needs to reclaim the EMA 12 at $1.32 as support, followed by a move above the SMA 7 at $1.41. Once these levels are secured, the $1.63 breakout becomes highly probable, with momentum likely carrying prices toward $1.75 initially.\nFor the more aggressive scenarios predicting $3.78 (PricePredictions.com) or even $9.239 (BlockchainReporter), LDO would need to break decisively above the 52-week high of $2.38, which currently sits 45.21% above current levels.\nBearish Risk for Lido DAO\nThe primary risk to this Lido DAO forecast lies in a breakdown below the immediate support at $0.85. Such a move would invalidate the bullish technical setup and potentially trigger a retest of the strong support zone at $0.69, just above the 52-week low of $0.63.\nThe bearish scenario aligns with PriceForecastBot's $1.03 prediction, which would represent a 20.8% decline from current levels. This outcome becomes more likely if LDO fails to hold above the EMA 26 at $1.21 in the coming days.\nShould You Buy LDO Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on current Lido DAO technical analysis, the optimal entry strategy involves a staged approach. Conservative buyers should wait for a pullback to the $1.21-$1.25 zone (EMA 26 support) before initiating positions, with a stop-loss placed below $1.15 to limit downside risk.\nMore aggressive traders can consider entries at current levels around $1.30, targeting the initial resistance at $1.41 for a quick 8.5% gain. The risk-reward setup favors buyers, with potential upside to $1.64 offering a 26% return against a 15% stop-loss risk to $1.15.\nPosition sizing should remain conservative given the medium confidence level across analyst predictions. A 2-3% portfolio allocation provides adequate exposure to the upside while managing downside risk appropriately.\nLDO Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur LDO price prediction targets the $1.75-$2.10 range by the end of August 2025, with medium confidence based on technical momentum and analyst consensus. The bullish MACD histogram and neutral RSI provide the technical foundation, while fundamental catalysts around Ethereum staking growth offer additional upside potential.\nKey indicators to watch include the MACD maintaining its bullish crossover, RSI breaking above 60 for confirmation of momentum, and daily closes above the $1.32 EMA 12 level. A breakdown below $1.21 would invalidate this bullish thesis and suggest reassessment of the buy or sell LDO decision.\nThe prediction timeline spans the next 2-4 weeks, with initial targets at $1.64 expected within 7-10 days if technical levels hold. Traders should monitor volume expansion above 40 million daily as confirmation of breakout momentum toward higher targets.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:07:10 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "Chainlink (LINK) Surges 18% to $26 High as Bullish Momentum Builds", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-chainlink-link-surges-18-to-26-high-as-bullish-momentum", "text": "Quick Take\n• LINK currently trading at $24.81 (+1.14% in 24h) • Chainlink's RSI at 67.07 indicates strong momentum without overbought conditions • Recent 18% surge to $26.05 driven by Intercontinental Exchange partnership and reserve accumulation\nWhat's Driving Chainlink Price Today?\nThe LINK price rally continues to build on last week's explosive 18% surge that pushed the token to $26.05, making it the top performer among the 50 largest cryptocurrencies. This momentum stems from two key catalysts that have fundamentally strengthened Chainlink's market position.\nThe most significant driver has been Chainlink's strategic partnership with Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), announced on August 11th. This collaboration integrates forex and precious metals data into Chainlink Data Streams, representing a major step toward institutional adoption. The partnership validates Chainlink's oracle technology at the highest levels of traditional finance, providing real-world utility that directly translates to increased demand for LINK tokens.\nComplementing this institutional validation, the Chainlink Reserve has been actively accumulating tokens, adding 44,109.76 LINK on August 14th alone. This brings total reserve holdings to over 109,661 LINK, demonstrating strong conviction from the protocol's treasury management. Such accumulation patterns typically signal long-term confidence and help establish price floors during market volatility.\nLINK Technical Analysis: Strong Bullish Signals Emerge\nChainlink technical analysis reveals a compelling bullish setup across multiple timeframes. The LINK RSI currently sits at 67.07, positioning the token in an ideal momentum zone that's strong but not yet overbought. This level suggests room for additional upside before encountering typical RSI resistance around 70-80.\nThe moving average structure strongly supports continued upside for LINK price action. Trading at $24.81, Chainlink sits well above all major moving averages, with the 7-day SMA at $23.56, 20-day at $20.06, and 50-day at $17.73. This ascending alignment creates a bullish foundation where any pullbacks find support at progressively higher levels.\nChainlink's MACD indicator reinforces this positive outlook, with the main line at 1.9454 above the signal line at 1.5167. The histogram reading of 0.4287 indicates bullish momentum is accelerating rather than fading. Additionally, the Stochastic oscillator shows %K at 83.86 and %D at 84.86, suggesting strong buying pressure that hasn't yet reached extreme overbought territory.\nChainlink Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, Chainlink support levels are well-defined with the immediate support zone at $15.43 and strong support at $12.73. However, given the current bullish momentum, more relevant support likely exists around the $23.56 level, which aligns with the 7-day SMA.\nThe LINK resistance picture shows immediate challenges at $26.50, which coincides with both the recent high and the upper Bollinger Band at $26.49. The Bollinger Band position indicator at 0.8697 confirms LINK is trading near the upper band, suggesting short-term resistance at current levels.\nFor traders watching LINK/USDT, the 52-week high of $29.26 represents the next major resistance target if Chainlink can break above the immediate $26.50 level. The daily ATR of $1.78 indicates that moves of this magnitude are within normal volatility ranges for the token.\nShould You Buy LINK Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nThe current setup presents different opportunities depending on trading timeframes and risk tolerance. For swing traders, the LINK price action offers attractive risk-reward at current levels, with support around $23.56 providing a logical stop-loss level and resistance at $26.50-$29.26 offering clear profit targets.\nConservative investors might wait for a pullback toward Chainlink support levels around $20-22, where the 20-day and 50-day moving averages could provide better entry points. The strong institutional news flow suggests any significant dips may be short-lived, but patience could improve entry prices.\nActive traders should monitor the $26.50 resistance level closely. A clean break above this level on strong volume could trigger momentum toward the 52-week high at $29.26. However, rejection at resistance might lead to consolidation or a test of the $23-24 support zone.\nRisk management remains crucial given the LINK RSI approaching overbought territory. Position sizing should account for the daily ATR of $1.78, and stops should be placed below key moving averages to preserve capital if the bullish thesis fails.\nConclusion\nChainlink technical analysis supports continued bullish momentum, with LINK price well-positioned above key moving averages and institutional partnerships providing fundamental strength. The immediate focus is on whether LINK can break definitively above $26.50 resistance in the next 24-48 hours. Traders should watch for volume confirmation on any breakout attempts, while being prepared for potential consolidation if resistance holds firm.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:20:30 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

BTCC.com leads the bullish charge with an aggressive INJ price target of $17.40, citing strong positioning above major moving averages and bullish MACD signals. This aligns perfectly with our current technical observation of positive MACD histogram readings at 0.0350.\nContrasting this optimism, WalletInvestor and CoinCodex present more conservative Injective forecast models, targeting $13.31 and $12.53 respectively. Their AI-driven analysis suggests potential retracement based on historical patterns. However, these predictions appear to underweight the current bullish momentum indicators we're observing.\nThe most intriguing prediction comes from CoinLore's long-term INJ price prediction of $43.15 by year-end 2025, representing a staggering 198% increase from current levels. While ambitious, this target reflects the potential for cryptocurrency bull market dynamics to drive exponential gains.\nINJ Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Bullish Breakout\nCurrent Injective technical analysis reveals a compelling setup for upward price movement. At $14.48, INJ trades significantly above its 200-day SMA of $11.94, indicating strong long-term bullish momentum. The positioning within Bollinger Bands at 0.6228 suggests room for additional upward movement before reaching overbought territory.\nThe MACD configuration presents the most compelling bullish signal. With the MACD line at 0.4394 above the signal line at 0.4044 and a positive histogram of 0.0350, momentum clearly favors buyers. This technical pattern typically precedes significant price advances, supporting the higher-end analyst targets.\nVolume analysis shows robust participation with $32.36 million in 24-hour Binance spot trading, providing adequate liquidity for sustained moves. The neutral RSI at 52.17 offers perfect positioning - neither overbought nor oversold - creating ideal conditions for a momentum-driven breakout.\nInjective Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for INJ\nThe primary INJ price target for bulls centers on the $16.55 resistance level, representing the immediate and strong resistance confluence. Breaking this level opens the path to BTCC.com's $17.40 target, which aligns with historical resistance zones and Fibonacci retracement levels.\nFor this bullish scenario to unfold, INJ needs to maintain support above the 20-day SMA at $13.99 while building volume on any upward moves. The current positioning above all major moving averages provides a solid foundation for this advance.\nExtended bullish targets reach toward the $20.00 psychological level, though this requires broader cryptocurrency market cooperation and sustained buying pressure.\nBearish Risk for Injective\nThe primary risk to our Injective forecast lies in a breakdown below the Bollinger Band middle line at $13.99. Such a move would invalidate the current bullish setup and target the lower Bollinger Band at $12.01.\nMore severe bearish scenarios could see INJ testing the strong support at $10.07, particularly if broader market conditions deteriorate. The 52-week low at $6.96 remains a distant but possible target in extreme bear market conditions.\nTraders should monitor the RSI for any move below 40, which would signal increasing bearish momentum and validate lower targets.\nShould You Buy INJ Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on current Injective technical analysis, the optimal buy or sell INJ decision favors selective buying with proper risk management. Ideal entry points include:\nPrimary Entry: $14.30-$14.50 (current levels) with a stop-loss at $13.50 Secondary Entry: $13.99 on any pullback to the 20-day SMA Aggressive Entry: $15.50-$16.00 on confirmed breakout above resistance\nPosition sizing should remain conservative at 2-3% of portfolio allocation given the medium confidence level in our prediction. The favorable risk-reward ratio of approximately 3:1 supports this allocation strategy.\nFor swing traders, the $16.55 level represents an excellent profit-taking opportunity, while longer-term holders can maintain positions targeting the $17.40 level over the next 2-4 weeks.\nINJ Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur INJ price prediction targets $16.55 within one week and $17.40 within two weeks, representing potential gains of 14.3% and 20.2% respectively. This forecast carries a medium-high confidence level based on strong technical momentum indicators and supportive analyst consensus.\nKey indicators to monitor for prediction validation include maintaining support above $13.99, RSI holding above 45, and MACD histogram remaining positive. Any breakdown below $13.50 would invalidate this bullish outlook and suggest targeting lower support levels.\nThe Injective forecast timeline spans the next 2-4 weeks for primary targets, with extended bullish potential extending through Q4 2025 if market conditions remain favorable. Current technical positioning offers an attractive entry opportunity for traders seeking exposure to INJ's upside potential.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 08:31:46 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "Polygon (MATIC) Hovers Near Support as POL Migration Approaches", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-polygon-matic-hovers-near-support-as-pol-migration-approaches", "text": "Quick Take\n• MATIC currently trading near $0.35 support levels showing oversold conditions • Polygon's RSI at 38 indicates potential bounce opportunity from oversold territory • Coinbase announces POL migration support starting August 26, providing positive catalyst\nWhat's Driving Polygon Price Today?\nThe MATIC price action this week reflects a complex interplay of positive developments and technical pressure. Most recently, MATIC has been trading near the $0.37 support level with technical indicators showing oversold conditions, creating an interesting risk-reward setup for traders.\nCoinbase's announcement on August 13 regarding support for the MATIC to POL migration represents a significant milestone for the Polygon ecosystem. Starting August 26, Coinbase will transition the Polygon ticker from MATIC to POL on the Polygon Network, supporting the token on both Polygon and Ethereum networks. This institutional backing from one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges validates Polygon's ecosystem evolution and provides long-term confidence for holders.\nThe August 14 protocol upgrade announcement from Polygon Labs adds another layer of fundamental strength. The major protocol enhancements focus on boosting network scalability and efficiency while fostering new partnerships and applications within the Polygon ecosystem. These technical improvements position Polygon competitively in the Layer 2 scaling solution space.\nDespite these positive catalysts, the immediate MATIC price action suggests traders are taking a cautious approach ahead of the token migration, creating temporary selling pressure that has pushed the token toward key support levels.\nMATIC Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals Present Trading Opportunity\nPolygon technical analysis reveals a market in transition, with several indicators pointing toward potential reversal conditions. MATIC's RSI currently sits at 38, firmly in oversold territory and suggesting the recent selling pressure may be exhausted. This MATIC RSI reading often precedes short-term bounces, especially when combined with support level tests.\nThe moving average structure tells a more complex story. MATIC trades below all major moving averages, with the 7-day SMA at $0.37, the 20-day at $0.43, and the 50-day at $0.45. This bearish alignment indicates the overall trend remains challenged, though the proximity to the 7-day average suggests potential for a near-term bounce.\nPolygon's MACD histogram shows -0.0045, confirming bearish momentum, while the main MACD line at -0.0246 trades below its signal line at -0.0202. However, the relatively shallow negative readings suggest momentum may be stabilizing rather than accelerating lower.\nThe Bollinger Bands provide crucial context for current price action. With MATIC's %B position at -1.2003, the token trades well below the lower band at $0.31, indicating extreme oversold conditions. The middle band at $0.43 represents the first major resistance level, while the upper band at $0.56 marks longer-term resistance.\nPolygon Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on Binance spot market data, Polygon support levels are clearly defined and critically important for near-term price direction. The immediate MATIC support sits at $0.35, which has been tested multiple times recently. A break below this level would target the stronger Polygon support at $0.33, representing the current 52-week low area.\nFor upside targets, MATIC resistance begins at the immediate level of $0.58, which coincides with both technical resistance and the strong resistance zone. This level has proven significant in recent trading and represents approximately 66% upside from current levels.\nThe MATIC/USDT trading pair shows an average true range of $0.03, indicating moderate volatility that provides opportunities for active traders while remaining manageable for position traders. This volatility measure suggests daily moves of 8-10% are normal for Polygon in current market conditions.\nShould You Buy MATIC Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nThe current setup presents different opportunities depending on trading style and risk tolerance. For swing traders, the oversold MATIC RSI reading combined with support level testing creates an attractive risk-reward scenario. Entry near current levels with stops below $0.33 targets initial resistance at $0.43, offering a roughly 1:2 risk-reward ratio.\nConservative investors might wait for confirmation of support holding, specifically a daily close above $0.40 with improving RSI momentum. This approach reduces risk but may sacrifice some upside if the current oversold bounce materializes quickly.\nDay traders should focus on the narrow range between $0.35-$0.40, using the oversold stochastic readings (%K at 25.19, %D at 19.74) as momentum confirmation. The approaching POL migration creates event-driven volatility that could benefit short-term strategies.\nThe fundamental backdrop supports longer-term accumulation strategies, with the Coinbase POL migration and protocol upgrades providing positive catalysts. However, the technical picture suggests patience may be rewarded with better entry points if current support fails to hold.\nConclusion\nMATIC price sits at a critical juncture, with oversold technical conditions creating potential bounce opportunities while fundamental developments provide longer-term support. The immediate focus should be on the $0.35 support level test and whether Polygon's RSI can begin recovering from current oversold readings. Traders should monitor volume confirmation on any bounce attempts, as the POL migration timeline creates a specific catalyst window for potential price recovery over the next week.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:02:13 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "Polkadot (DOT) Tests Key Support at $3.90 Amid Governance Tensions", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-polkadot-dot-tests-key-support-at-390-amid-governance-tensions", "text": "Quick Take\n• DOT currently trading at $3.90 (-3.98% in 24h) • Polkadot's RSI sits neutral at 48.92 while MACD shows bullish divergence • Gavin Wood's return as Parity CEO positive, but treasury controversies create headwinds\nWhat's Driving Polkadot Price Today?\nThe DOT price has declined nearly 4% in the past 24 hours despite mixed fundamental developments within the Polkadot ecosystem. The most significant positive catalyst came with Gavin Wood's announcement of his return as CEO of Parity Technologies, the primary development team behind Polkadot, effective late August. This news initially provided bullish sentiment as Wood's leadership has been instrumental in Polkadot's technical evolution.\nHowever, governance tensions have emerged as a major concern for DOT price action. The Polkadot treasury is facing unprecedented pressure from large spending proposals, with several high-profile requests failing to gain community support. Conor Daly's ambitious $7.5 million proposal for global Polkadot representation through racing partnerships and tech integrations has failed spectacularly, receiving 100% opposition from voters. Similarly, CoinGecko's $240,000 marketing campaign proposal is failing with 81.1% of votes against it.\nThese treasury disputes reflect deeper concerns about fund management and spending priorities within the Polkadot ecosystem. Referendum 1104, which proposes converting 5.26 million DOT to stablecoins over a year, highlights the community's desire for treasury stability amid market volatility. This conversion proposal, if approved, could create additional selling pressure on the DOT price in the coming months.\nOn the technical development front, Referendum 1700 successfully passed, upgrading system parachains to runtime version 1.6.x, enhancing network performance and security. Additionally, Referendum 1701 implemented adjustments to OpenGov parameters to improve governance efficiency. While these upgrades are fundamentally positive for Polkadot's long-term prospects, they haven't provided immediate support for the DOT price.\nDOT Technical Analysis: Neutral Signals Emerge\nThe Polkadot technical analysis reveals a mixed picture for DOT/USDT traders. Polkadot's RSI currently sits at 48.92, placing it firmly in neutral territory and suggesting neither oversold nor overbought conditions. This DOT RSI reading indicates that the recent decline hasn't reached extreme levels that typically signal reversal opportunities.\nThe MACD indicator presents a more encouraging picture for DOT bulls. With the MACD line at 0.0259 sitting above the signal line at 0.0209, and a positive histogram reading of 0.0051, Polkadot's momentum indicators suggest underlying bullish pressure may be building despite the recent price decline.\nPolkadot's moving averages paint a complex picture. The DOT price of $3.90 currently trades above both the 20-day SMA ($3.86) and 50-day SMA ($3.89), which typically indicates short to medium-term bullish sentiment. However, the price remains well below the 200-day SMA at $4.19, suggesting the longer-term trend remains challenging.\nThe Bollinger Bands analysis shows DOT trading near the middle band at $3.86, with a %B position of 0.5475. This positioning indicates the DOT price is neither approaching oversold conditions near the lower band ($3.44) nor overbought levels near the upper band ($4.29).\nPolkadot's daily ATR of $0.25 reflects moderate volatility, providing opportunities for active traders while suggesting the current consolidation phase may continue in the near term.\nPolkadot Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nBased on current Polkadot technical analysis, several critical price levels emerge for DOT traders. The immediate Polkadot support levels sit at $3.43, which aligns closely with recent low at $3.83 from the 24-hour trading range. A break below this level could trigger further selling toward the stronger Polkadot support at $3.24, which would represent a test of the 52-week low area of $3.15.\nOn the upside, DOT resistance appears at $4.37, representing the immediate hurdle for any recovery attempt. This level coincides with recent highs and must be cleared for the DOT price to challenge the stronger resistance zone at $4.67. A sustained break above $4.67 would signal a potential shift in market structure and could target the psychological $5.00 level.\nThe pivot point analysis places fair value for DOT around $3.98, suggesting the current price of $3.90 represents a slight discount to equilibrium levels. This positioning may attract value-seeking buyers, particularly if broader cryptocurrency market sentiment improves.\nTrading volume on Binance spot reached $39.7 million in the past 24 hours, indicating healthy liquidity for DOT/USDT transactions but below recent peaks, suggesting reduced conviction among market participants.\nShould You Buy DOT Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nBased on Binance spot market data, the current DOT price presents both opportunities and risks for different trader profiles. For swing traders, the neutral RSI reading and bullish MACD divergence suggest a potential setup for a bounce toward the $4.37 resistance level. However, the ongoing treasury controversies and failed spending proposals create fundamental headwinds that could limit upside potential.\nConservative investors may want to wait for clearer resolution of the governance issues before establishing positions. The proposed conversion of 5.26 million DOT to stablecoins represents approximately 0.4% of the total supply and could create sustained selling pressure if approved.\nActive traders can consider the $3.43 support level as a logical stop-loss point for long positions, offering a risk-reward ratio of approximately 1:3 when targeting the $4.37 resistance. The narrow trading range between support and resistance levels requires precise entry timing and strict risk management.\nDay traders should monitor the DOT/USDT pair for breaks above $4.00 or below $3.80, as these levels may trigger algorithmic buying or selling that could extend moves toward the next significant levels.\nConclusion\nThe DOT price faces a critical juncture at $3.90 as positive technical developments clash with governance uncertainties. While Gavin Wood's return as Parity CEO provides long-term confidence, immediate price action will likely depend on resolution of treasury spending disputes and broader cryptocurrency market direction. Traders should watch for decisive breaks above $4.00 or below $3.80 to signal the next directional move for Polkadot over the coming 24-48 hours.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:08:30 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

The recent 5.91% decline comes after ADA posted a remarkable 26.8% weekly surge, suggesting profit-taking by short-term traders following the breakout.\nThe pullback hasn't dampened institutional enthusiasm, however. Whale accumulation continues to provide underlying support, with over 200 million ADA tokens recently moved to private wallets. This institutional interest, including Grayscale's ETF inclusion and discussions around U.S. digital asset reserves, suggests the current ADA price dip may be temporary.\nThe community's approval of Cardano's $71 million upgrade package through decentralized governance has reinforced developer confidence. This milestone represents the first major implementation of on-chain voting for the project, demonstrating the maturity of Cardano's governance mechanisms. While this news provided fundamental strength, it hasn't prevented the technical correction we're seeing in today's ADA price action.\nADA Technical Analysis: Mixed Signals After Rally\nCardano technical analysis reveals a complex picture following the recent breakout and subsequent pullback. ADA's RSI sits at 61.64, placing it in neutral territory after cooling down from overbought levels reached during the rally above $1.\nThe MACD indicators paint a cautiously optimistic picture for Cardano. With the MACD line at 0.0486 above the signal line at 0.0350, and a positive histogram reading of 0.0136, the momentum structure remains bullish despite today's price decline. This suggests the current ADA price weakness may be a healthy consolidation rather than a trend reversal.\nCardano's moving averages continue to support the bullish narrative. The ADA price sits above all major moving averages, with the SMA 7 at $0.92, SMA 20 at $0.81, and SMA 50 at $0.76. This configuration indicates that the overall trend remains intact, even as short-term volatility creates trading opportunities.\nThe Bollinger Bands show ADA trading at 79.84% of the band width, suggesting the token remains in the upper portion of its recent range despite the pullback. With an Average True Range of $0.06, Cardano maintains healthy volatility levels for active traders.\nCardano Price Levels: Key Support and Resistance\nCurrent ADA/USDT technical levels provide clear guidance for traders navigating this correction. Cardano support levels emerge at $0.68 for immediate support, with stronger support established at $0.54 - a level that has held during previous market stress.\nOn the upside, ADA resistance sits firmly at $1.02, representing both the immediate and strong resistance level. This confluence suggests that reclaiming the $1 level will require significant buying pressure, likely from renewed institutional interest or positive market sentiment.\nThe pivot point at $0.93 offers a key reference for short-term trading decisions. ADA price action above this level maintains the bullish bias, while a sustained break below could signal deeper correction toward the immediate support zone.\nBased on Binance spot market data, the 24-hour trading range of $0.91-$0.98 illustrates the current consolidation pattern. Volume remains robust at $217.9 million, indicating continued interest despite the price decline.\nShould You Buy ADA Now? Risk-Reward Analysis\nFor swing traders, the current ADA price pullback presents a potential opportunity to enter positions with defined risk levels. Conservative entries near the $0.90 level offer reasonable risk-reward ratios, with stops below $0.85 and targets at the $1.02 resistance zone.\nDay traders should focus on the ADA/USDT pair's reaction at the $0.93 pivot point. A bounce from this level with increasing volume could signal renewed buying interest, while failure to hold may extend the correction toward $0.68 support.\nLong-term investors may view this correction as a healthy pause in Cardano's broader uptrend. The fundamental backdrop remains supportive, with the approved upgrade package and continued institutional accumulation providing reasons for optimism beyond short-term price fluctuations.\nRisk management remains crucial given crypto market volatility. The daily ATR of $0.06 suggests position sizing should account for potential 6-7% daily moves in either direction.\nConclusion\nCardano's ADA price correction appears to be a natural consolidation following the recent breakout above $1. While technical indicators show mixed signals, the underlying fundamentals remain strong with institutional interest and successful governance implementation. Traders should watch the $0.93 pivot level for directional cues, while the $1.02 resistance zone remains the key target for any renewed rally in the next 24-48 hours.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:44:07 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

Our comprehensive CRV price prediction analysis reveals a compelling setup for the next 4-6 weeks, with technical indicators pointing toward a potential recovery rally.\nCRV Price Prediction Summary\n• CRV short-term target (1 week): $0.95-$1.03 (+9-18%) • Curve medium-term forecast (1 month): $1.11-$1.45 range (+28-67%) • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $1.07 immediate resistance • Critical support if bearish: $0.83 immediate support, $0.49 strong support\nRecent Curve Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe latest Curve forecast from multiple sources reveals a striking divergence in analyst opinions, creating an intriguing CRV price prediction landscape. PricePredictions.com leads the bullish camp with an ambitious $3.76 price target, representing a massive 332% upside from current levels. This aggressive forecast contrasts sharply with PriceForecastBot's bearish $0.48 target, suggesting a potential 45% decline.\nHowever, the consensus among most analysts points toward the $1.11-$1.45 range. CoinDCX's $1.11 short-term forecast aligns with technical support from daily EMAs and positive RSI momentum, while CoinMarketCap's $1.45 long-term projection represents a more conservative but achievable 67% upside. MidForex's $1.03 target sits near the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting this level could act as initial resistance.\nThe wide spread in predictions reflects the current uncertainty in CRV's direction, but the clustering around $1.11-$1.45 suggests this range represents the most probable outcome for our Curve forecast.\nCRV Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Bullish Reversal\nCurrent Curve technical analysis reveals a mixed but increasingly constructive picture. At $0.87, CRV trades precisely at its daily pivot point, suggesting equilibrium between buyers and sellers. The RSI at 45.82 sits in neutral territory, providing room for upward movement without immediate overbought concerns.\nThe MACD histogram shows -0.0191, indicating bearish momentum, but this appears to be waning as the MACD line (0.0052) trades well above the signal line (0.0243). This divergence often precedes momentum shifts, supporting our bullish CRV price prediction.\nBollinger Bands analysis reveals CRV positioned at 0.20, indicating the token trades near the lower band at $0.82. This oversold positioning historically provides strong bounce potential, with the middle band at $0.93 representing the first meaningful resistance.\nThe moving average structure shows promise for bulls, with CRV trading above the critical 200-day SMA at $0.64 and the 50-day SMA at $0.83. However, the 7-day ($0.92) and 20-day ($0.93) SMAs currently act as resistance, requiring a break above $0.93 to confirm the bullish reversal.\nVolume analysis shows $33.14 million in 24-hour trading, suggesting adequate liquidity for the predicted move. The daily ATR of $0.08 indicates normal volatility levels, supporting our price targets within reasonable ranges.\nCurve Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for CRV\nOur primary bullish CRV price target focuses on the $1.11-$1.45 range based on multiple confluence factors. The immediate path requires breaking the $1.07 resistance level, which represents the upper Bollinger Band and coincides with recent swing highs.\nOnce $1.07 breaks, CRV should face minimal resistance until the $1.16 strong resistance level. This creates an attractive risk-reward setup with a clear CRV price target of $1.11 as the first major objective. The 52-week high at $1.19 sits just above, potentially capping initial upside.\nFor the extended bullish scenario reaching $1.45, CRV would need sustained momentum and broader DeFi sector strength. This represents a 67% gain from current levels and aligns with CoinMarketCap's long-term forecast.\nTechnical requirements for the bullish case include: - RSI breaking above 50 and maintaining momentum - MACD histogram turning positive - Daily volume exceeding $40 million to confirm breakout - Bitcoin maintaining support above key levels\nBearish Risk for Curve\nThe primary risk to our bullish Curve forecast lies in a break below the $0.83 immediate support level. This would target the lower Bollinger Band at $0.82 and potentially trigger algorithmic selling.\nA sustained break below $0.83 would invalidate the bullish CRV price prediction and target the $0.49 strong support level, representing a 44% decline from current levels. This aligns with PriceForecastBot's bearish $0.48 forecast.\nKey bearish indicators to monitor include: - RSI dropping below 40 with accelerating momentum - MACD histogram expanding to the downside - Volume spike accompanying any break below $0.83 - Broader crypto market weakness\nShould You Buy CRV Now? Entry Strategy\nThe current technical setup suggests a measured approach to the buy or sell CRV decision. For aggressive traders, the current $0.87 level offers an attractive entry point with a tight stop-loss at $0.82 (6% risk).\nConservative investors should wait for confirmation above $0.93 (middle Bollinger Band) before initiating positions. This approach sacrifices early entry profits but significantly reduces the risk of catching a falling knife.\nRecommended Entry Strategy: - Aggressive Entry: $0.85-$0.87 with stop-loss at $0.82 - Conservative Entry: Break above $0.93 with stop-loss at $0.87 - Position Size: Maximum 2-3% of portfolio given volatility - Profit Targets: 25% at $1.07, 50% at $1.20, remainder at $1.45\nRisk management remains crucial given the conflicting analyst forecasts and current technical uncertainty.\nCRV Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur comprehensive analysis supports a bullish CRV price prediction with targets of $1.11-$1.45 over the next 4-6 weeks, representing potential gains of 28-67%. The technical setup shows early signs of reversal, with oversold Bollinger Band positioning and neutral RSI providing upside room.\nConfidence Level: Medium-High (75%) for reaching $1.11, Medium (60%) for $1.45\nKey Confirmation Indicators: - Break above $0.93 middle Bollinger Band - RSI sustaining above 50 - MACD histogram turning positive - Volume exceeding $40 million on breakout\nTimeline: The prediction should play out over 4-6 weeks, with initial confirmation expected within 7-10 days. Failure to break $0.93 by early September would require reassessment of the bullish thesis.\nThe current risk-reward profile favors bulls, but position sizing and stop-loss discipline remain essential given the volatile nature of DeFi tokens and conflicting analyst views in this Curve forecast.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 08:25:40 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}
{"title": "HBAR Price Prediction: Targeting $0.28-$0.30 Recovery Within 2-4 Weeks Despite Current Bearish Momentum", "url": "https://Blockchain.News/news/20250818-price-prediction-hbar-targeting-028-030-recovery-within-2", "text": "HBAR Price Prediction: Technical Setup Points to Near-Term Recovery Despite Bearish Momentum\nHedera (HBAR) is currently trading at a critical juncture as the cryptocurrency faces a 6.46% daily decline, bringing it to the $0.24 level. Our comprehensive HBAR price prediction analysis reveals a mixed technical picture that could set the stage for either a recovery rally or further downside pressure in the coming weeks.\nHBAR Price Prediction Summary\nBased on current technical analysis and recent analyst forecasts, here are our specific predictions for Hedera:\n• HBAR short-term target (1-2 weeks): $0.28 (+16.7% from current levels) • Hedera medium-term forecast (1 month): $0.26-$0.30 range with potential for higher targets • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $0.28 immediate resistance • Critical support if bearish: $0.23 (immediate) and $0.14 (strong support)\nRecent Hedera Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe latest analyst predictions show a notable divergence in timeframes and targets. CoinCu's Hedera forecast suggests HBAR could reach $0.5993 by December 2025, representing a long-term bullish outlook. Meanwhile, PricePredictions.com presents an ambitious HBAR price target of $0.827395 by August 2025, though this appears optimistic given current market conditions.\nMore conservatively, Digital Money Market Coins projects HBAR maintaining around $0.28 in the short term, which aligns closely with our technical analysis showing immediate resistance at this level. The consensus among these predictions suggests medium confidence in upward movement, though timeframes vary significantly.\nHBAR Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Recovery\nThe current Hedera technical analysis reveals several key indicators pointing toward potential recovery. With HBAR's RSI at 46.72, the cryptocurrency sits in neutral territory, avoiding both overbought and oversold extremes. This neutral positioning provides flexibility for movement in either direction.\nHowever, the MACD histogram reading of -0.0031 indicates bearish momentum remains in control for now. The price's position within the Bollinger Bands at 0.2074 suggests HBAR is trading in the lower portion of its recent range, potentially indicating oversold conditions that could support a bounce.\nVolume analysis shows robust trading activity with $46.5 million in 24-hour volume on Binance, suggesting active market participation that could fuel price movements once direction becomes clear.\nHedera Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for HBAR\nOur bullish HBAR price prediction centers on the cryptocurrency's ability to reclaim the $0.28 immediate resistance level. If successful, this could trigger a move toward the Bollinger Band upper limit at $0.27, followed by a potential test of the stronger $0.30 resistance zone.\nThe technical setup supports this scenario as HBAR trades above its 50-day SMA ($0.23) and 200-day SMA ($0.20), indicating the longer-term trend remains intact. A decisive break above $0.28 could validate the more optimistic analyst targets and set the stage for a run toward $0.35-$0.37 over the medium term.\nBearish Risk for Hedera\nThe primary risk to our bullish Hedera forecast lies in a breakdown below the critical $0.23 support level. Such a move would likely trigger stop-loss selling and could accelerate declines toward the strong support zone at $0.14, representing the 52-week low territory.\nThe negative MACD histogram and recent 6.46% daily decline suggest bearish pressure remains active. If selling intensifies, HBAR could test the $0.20 level (200-day SMA) before finding meaningful support.\nShould You Buy HBAR Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on our HBAR price prediction analysis, the current setup presents a reasonable risk-reward opportunity for tactical traders. The optimal entry strategy involves waiting for either a successful defense of the $0.23 support or a confirmed break above $0.26.\nFor conservative investors wondering whether to buy or sell HBAR, dollar-cost averaging between $0.23-$0.25 levels appears prudent, with stop-loss protection below $0.22. Position sizing should remain modest given the mixed technical signals and broader market uncertainty.\nAggressive traders might consider entering near current levels with tight risk management, targeting the $0.28 resistance for quick profits while maintaining stop-losses below $0.23.\nHBAR Price Prediction Conclusion\nOur comprehensive analysis suggests HBAR has a medium confidence potential to recover toward $0.28-$0.30 over the next 2-4 weeks, representing 16-25% upside from current levels. This Hedera forecast is based on the cryptocurrency's position above key long-term moving averages and neutral RSI conditions that could support a bounce.\nKey indicators to watch for confirmation include a break above $0.26 (middle Bollinger Band) and positive MACD crossover. For invalidation, monitor any breakdown below $0.23 support, which would shift the near-term outlook bearish.\nThe timeline for this HBAR price prediction to materialize extends through early September 2025, with initial signals expected within the next 5-7 trading days as the market reacts to current support/resistance levels.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:00:54 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

Despite a recent 5.16% decline, PEPE price prediction models suggest the meme coin could see significant movement in either direction over the coming weeks.\nPEPE Price Prediction Summary\n• PEPE short-term target (1 week): $0.00001182 (+18-20% from current levels) • Pepe medium-term forecast (1 month): $0.000008-$0.000013 range • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $0.00001182 • Critical support if bearish: $0.00001057, with extreme downside to $0.000007908\nRecent Pepe Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe latest Pepe forecast from multiple sources reveals a divided analytical landscape. CoinCodex analysts maintain a bullish stance with 26 out of 27 technical indicators signaling positive momentum, representing a 96% bullish consensus. This optimistic outlook is further supported by the Fear & Greed Index sitting at 74, indicating strong greed in the market.\nHowever, Cryptopolitan presents a contrarian view in their PEPE price prediction, projecting a potential 25.28% decline to $0.000007908. This bearish forecast creates an interesting dynamic where short-term sentiment appears split between aggressive bulls and cautious bears.\nThe consensus among analysts identifies $0.00001182 as the primary resistance level that PEPE must overcome to validate bullish predictions, while $0.00001057 serves as critical support that must hold to prevent deeper declines.\nPEPE Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Volatile Breakout\nCurrent Pepe technical analysis reveals a cryptocurrency caught between competing forces. The RSI reading of 43.69 places PEPE in neutral territory, suggesting neither oversold nor overbought conditions. This neutral positioning often precedes significant directional moves as the market builds energy for a breakout.\nThe MACD histogram showing bearish momentum at -0.0000 provides the most concerning signal for bulls. This negative momentum suggests that selling pressure currently outweighs buying interest, potentially supporting the bearish PEPE price prediction from Cryptopolitan.\nBollinger Bands positioning at 0.3337 indicates PEPE is trading in the lower third of its recent range, closer to the lower band than the upper band. This positioning often signals either oversold conditions that could lead to a bounce, or continued weakness if support fails.\nTrading volume remains robust at over $101 million on Binance alone, suggesting institutional and retail interest remains high despite recent price weakness. This volume profile supports the potential for significant price movements in either direction.\nPepe Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for PEPE\nThe optimistic PEPE price prediction scenario targets the $0.00001182 resistance level, representing approximately 18-20% upside from current trading levels. If this resistance breaks with conviction, the next target would extend to $0.000013-$0.000014, potentially delivering 30-40% gains.\nFor the bullish case to materialize, PEPE needs to reclaim the $0.00001057 support level decisively and maintain trading above this threshold. Additionally, the MACD histogram must turn positive, confirming that buying momentum is returning to the meme coin.\nThe 96% bullish technical indicator reading from CoinCodex suggests that once momentum shifts, PEPE could experience rapid appreciation given its meme coin volatility characteristics.\nBearish Risk for Pepe\nThe bearish Pepe forecast scenario envisions a breakdown below the critical $0.00001057 support level, potentially triggering a cascade toward the $0.000007908 target identified by Cryptopolitan. This would represent a significant 25-30% decline from current levels.\nRisk factors supporting this bearish PEPE price prediction include the negative MACD momentum, the 57.52% distance from 52-week highs, and general cryptocurrency market uncertainty. If broader market conditions deteriorate, meme coins like PEPE typically experience amplified volatility to the downside.\nShould You Buy PEPE Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on current Pepe technical analysis, the optimal buy or sell PEPE strategy depends on risk tolerance and timeframe. Conservative investors should wait for a clear break above $0.00001182 with volume confirmation before establishing long positions.\nFor aggressive traders, current levels near $0.000010 could represent an attractive entry point, but only with strict risk management. A stop-loss below $0.00001057 is essential, as a break of this level would invalidate the bullish PEPE price prediction.\nPosition sizing should remain conservative given the mixed signals. Risk no more than 2-3% of portfolio value on PEPE trades, and consider dollar-cost averaging if building a longer-term position.\nPEPE Price Prediction Conclusion\nThe current PEPE price prediction landscape suggests a pivotal moment for the meme coin. While technical indicators present mixed signals, the weight of evidence slightly favors a test of the $0.00001182 resistance level over the next 7-14 days, representing our base case scenario with medium confidence.\nKey indicators to monitor for confirmation include MACD turning positive, RSI breaking above 50, and daily volume maintaining above $80 million. Invalidation signals would include a decisive break below $0.00001057 support or MACD histogram declining further into negative territory.\nThe Pepe forecast timeline suggests resolution of this technical setup should occur by early September 2025, making the next two weeks critical for determining PEPE's medium-term trajectory.\nImage source: Shutterstock", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 08:48:49 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://blockchain.news/rss"}

Despite the recent decline, technical indicators and analyst forecasts paint a complex picture for this WIF price prediction analysis.\nWIF Price Prediction Summary\n• WIF short-term target (1 week): $0.92-$0.96 (+7-12%) • dogwifhat medium-term forecast (1 month): $1.10-$1.25 range (+28-45%) • Key level to break for bullish continuation: $1.07 immediate resistance • Critical support if bearish: $0.78 strong support level\nRecent dogwifhat Price Predictions from Analysts\nThe analyst community shows stark divisions in their dogwifhat forecast expectations. DigitalCoinPrice presents the most optimistic WIF price prediction with targets ranging from $0.84 to $2.07 long-term, backed by historical data patterns. This contrasts sharply with Changelly's bearish outlook, projecting WIF could decline to $0.2047-$0.2261.\nThe most bullish prediction comes from Digital Money Market Coins, targeting $2.85-$3.00 medium-term based on anticipated DeFi adoption and Solana ecosystem integration. CoinLore's technical analysis suggests a more moderate $0.9032 short-term target, aligning with current resistance levels.\nThis wide disparity in predictions reflects the inherent volatility in meme coin markets, where sentiment can shift rapidly based on social media trends and ecosystem developments.\nWIF Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Potential Reversal\nCurrent dogwifhat technical analysis reveals mixed signals that could support a moderate bullish WIF price prediction. The RSI at 42.61 sits in neutral territory, suggesting neither oversold nor overbought conditions. However, the MACD histogram at -0.0086 indicates bearish momentum is still present.\nWIF's position at 0.1647 within the Bollinger Bands places it near the lower band support at $0.82, historically a level where buying interest emerges. The price trading below all major moving averages (SMA 7: $0.92, SMA 20: $0.93, SMA 50: $0.97) confirms the current downtrend, but the 200-day SMA at $0.76 provides long-term support perspective.\nVolume analysis shows $38.25 million in 24-hour trading on Binance, indicating healthy liquidity for potential breakout moves. The Daily ATR of $0.09 suggests moderate volatility, typical for consolidation phases before directional moves.\ndogwifhat Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for WIF\nIn the optimistic scenario, WIF needs to reclaim the $0.92 level (SMA 7) to invalidate the current bearish momentum. A successful break above $1.07 immediate resistance would target the $1.25-$1.32 zone, representing the confluence of previous support levels and the 50% Fibonacci retracement from the 52-week high.\nThe WIF price target of $1.25 aligns with the medium-term bullish forecast, requiring a break above the upper Bollinger Band at $1.03 with sustained volume. This scenario gains credibility if broader meme coin sentiment improves and Solana ecosystem adoption accelerates.\nBearish Risk for dogwifhat\nThe bearish case for this dogwifhat forecast centers on a break below the critical $0.82 support level. Such a move would expose the $0.78 strong support, and failure there could trigger a decline toward the $0.32 annual low area.\nKey risk factors include continued MACD bearish divergence, failure to reclaim moving average support, and overall crypto market weakness. The Stochastic oscillator at extremely low levels (%K: 4.50) suggests oversold conditions, but this can persist in strong downtrends.\nShould You Buy WIF Now? Entry Strategy\nThe current technical setup presents a strategic opportunity for the buy or sell WIF decision. Conservative buyers should wait for a confirmed break above $0.92 with volume confirmation before entering positions. Aggressive traders might consider accumulating near the $0.82-$0.86 support zone with tight stop-losses.\nEntry Strategy: - Primary Entry: $0.82-$0.86 support zone - Stop-Loss: Below $0.78 (risk management) - First Target: $1.07 (immediate resistance) - Extended Target: $1.25 (medium-term goal)\nPosition sizing should remain conservative given the mixed technical signals and wide analyst prediction ranges. Risk no more than 2-3% of portfolio capital on any single WIF position.\nWIF Price Prediction Conclusion\nThis comprehensive WIF price prediction analysis suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook despite current bearish momentum. The medium-term dogwifhat forecast targeting $1.10-$1.25 represents a reasonable expectation based on technical support levels and analyst consensus.\nConfidence Level: Medium (60%)\nKey indicators to monitor for validation include RSI breaking above 50, MACD histogram turning positive, and price reclaiming the $0.92-$0.93 moving average cluster. The prediction timeline spans 4-6 weeks, with initial confirmation signals expected within 7-10 trading days.\nInvalidation occurs if WIF breaks below $0.78 support with volume, potentially triggering a retest of annual lows.

The Algorand forecast consensus leans cautiously optimistic, though the 144% spread between the lowest and highest predictions indicates significant uncertainty in the market.\nCaptainAltcoin's aggressive $0.7626 ALGO price target stands out as the most bullish, representing a potential 205% gain from current levels. This contrasts sharply with Changelly's conservative $0.312 forecast, suggesting only a 25% upside. WalletInvestor and CryptoPredictions.com occupy the middle ground with $0.350 and $0.3386 targets respectively, aligning more closely with technical resistance levels.\nThe divergence in these predictions reflects the current technical uncertainty, with ALGO trading near critical support levels while maintaining an overall strong bullish trend classification despite recent bearish momentum signals.\nALGO Technical Analysis: Setting Up for Potential Reversal\nCurrent Algorand technical analysis reveals a coin at a crossroads. The RSI reading of 47.94 sits firmly in neutral territory, suggesting neither oversold bounce conditions nor overbought resistance. However, the MACD histogram's -0.0013 reading indicates weakening momentum, with the MACD line ($0.0027) falling below its signal line ($0.0040).\nThe Bollinger Bands paint an interesting picture for this ALGO price prediction. With ALGO positioned at 0.43 within the bands, the token sits closer to the lower band ($0.23) than the upper band ($0.28), suggesting potential for mean reversion toward the middle band at $0.25 - ironically, exactly where ALGO currently trades.\nVolume analysis shows $13.8 million in 24-hour Binance spot trading, which is relatively modest but sufficient to support meaningful price movements. The daily ATR of $0.02 indicates controlled volatility, providing clearer technical signals for prediction purposes.\nAlgorand Price Targets: Bull and Bear Scenarios\nBullish Case for ALGO\nThe bullish Algorand forecast scenario targets an initial breakout above $0.29 immediate resistance, which would trigger momentum toward the $0.34 strong resistance level. This ALGO price target aligns with WalletInvestor's $0.350 prediction and represents the most technically sound near-term objective.\nA sustained break above $0.34 could propel ALGO toward the more aggressive analyst targets in the $0.50-$0.76 range. The key technical catalyst would be MACD histogram turning positive and RSI breaking above 60, confirming renewed bullish momentum.\nThe strongest bullish case relies on ALGO reclaiming its position above all major moving averages, particularly the EMA 12 and EMA 26 at $0.26, which currently act as overhead resistance.\nBearish Risk for Algorand\nThe primary bearish risk for this ALGO price prediction centers on a breakdown below the critical $0.22 immediate support level. Such a break would invalidate the current technical setup and potentially trigger a decline toward the $0.17 strong support zone.\nA bearish scenario would see ALGO testing its 52-week low of $0.16, representing a 36% downside risk from current levels. This outcome would require a broader cryptocurrency market correction and sustained bearish momentum confirmed by RSI dropping below 30.\nShould You Buy ALGO Now? Entry Strategy\nBased on current Algorand technical analysis, the optimal buy or sell ALGO strategy depends on risk tolerance. Conservative investors should wait for a clear break above $0.29 with volume confirmation before establishing positions, targeting the $0.35-$0.40 range.\nAggressive traders might consider accumulating ALGO near current levels with tight stop-losses below $0.22. This approach captures potential upside while limiting downside risk to approximately 12%.\nPosition sizing should remain modest given the neutral RSI and bearish MACD signals. Risk management dictates stops below $0.22 for any new positions, with profit-taking planned at $0.32 and $0.35 levels.\nALGO Price Prediction Conclusion\nThis ALGO price prediction carries medium confidence for upside targets of $0.35-$0.50 over the next 30 days, contingent on maintaining support above $0.22. The confluence of analyst targets in the $0.31-$0.35 range provides additional validation for these technical objectives.\nKey indicators to monitor include MACD histogram turning positive, RSI breaking above 55, and volume expansion on any breakout attempts above $0.29.

The report surveyed 400 U.S. healthcare consumers across various demographics, with TrustCommerce analysts gleaning new insights.\nAmong individuals above 60, healthcare payments with debit cards are in pole position, with 38.7% of respondents choosing the method at the time of service. Cash-based payments come in second place at 6.75% while digital wallets make up 6.5% with 2.25% of respondents preferring checks.\nFor after-service payments, 45.25% of respondents above 60 indicate a preference for credit card-based payments. The TrustCommerce survey reveals that debit cards come in second place at 36.25% while digital wallets, cash, checks, and bank transfers make up 7.5%, 7%, 2.25%, and 1.75% respectively.\nIt also noted that patients are more likely to adopt digital payment systems for doctor and specialist visits, medicine prescriptions, and lab tests. However, analysts pointed out that patients’ preferences are largely consistent before, during, and after medical services.\n“I think there is sometimes a mistaken perception that older consumers don’t want to use digital payment methods, but clearly that is not the case,” said John Welch, Chief Product Officer at TrustCommerce.\nSeveral factors are powering the trend of senior citizens turning to digital payment systems to settle healthcare costs. Rising healthcare costs are forcing users to explore flexible options, with several respondents citing convenience and accessibility as key factors.\nFurthermore, several older patients have shown a changing preference to allow service providers to store their credit card information as tokens for future use. However, some respondents have cited security concerns and difficulty using advanced technologies in payments.\nUS-based digital payments to spike\nWhile healthcare is recording upticks in digital payments, a study has predicted that U.S. digital payments will record over $3.8 trillion in volume before the end of 2025. Credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets are tipped to drive the surge in transaction volume, while a slew of government initiatives will contribute to the projected numbers.\nOutside of payments, the global healthcare system is undergoing major upheavals, buoyed by next-gen technologies. Several technology giants are steamrolling toward the launch of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered solutions for healthcare amid grim warnings over the inherent risks associated with mainstream usage.\nLeveraging Cloud\nElsewhere, Siloam Hospitals Group, Indonesia’s largest private hospital chain, has announced plans to digitize its operations wholesale, using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.\nSiloam Hospitals has moved critical operations to the AWS Cloud, citing increased efficiency and improved productivity across the board. The pivot to the AWS Cloud extends to Siloam’s information systems, billing platforms, and proprietary MySiloam digital app.Siloam’s executives have highlighted a streak of early wins stemming from the transition of services to AWS Cloud. Siloam Hospitals Group CEO Caroline Riady announced that the pivot will enable real-time data access, advanced scalability, military-grade security, and lay the groundwork for AI utility.\nThe report reveals several key AWS services powering Siloam Hospitals’ digitization. For core app deployment, Siloam Hospitals will use Amazon Elastic Container Services (Amazon ECS), while Amazon RDS Aurora and Amazon ElastiCache will provide advanced data processing functionality.\nFurthermore, Amazon EventBridge will offer streamlined communication for Siloam Hospitals’ microservices. Additionally, Siloam has integrated AWS Lambda, AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS), and AWS Backup for serverless backend automation and compliant data protection.\nIntegrating AI functionalities into existing operations is at the center of Siloam Hospital’s transformation. Leaning on AWS Cloud, Siloam has deployed AI for inventory management to automate data capture and auto-summarization of medical records to support doctors’ documentation of patients’ histories.\n“With AWS, we are reimagining how healthcare works in Indonesia,” said CEO Caroline Riady. “We’re giving time back to our doctors, clarity to our decisions, and better outcomes for our patients.”\nAcross Indonesia, AI is recording impressive adoption rates among private enterprises and government agencies. To emphasize this point, Indonesia launched an AI Center of Excellence, seeking a sovereign infrastructure, triggering innovation, and boosting adoption metrics.\nAI in healthcare receives a jolt\nSince large language models (LLMs) hit mainstream acceptance, several technology giants have pursued AI solutions for the healthcare sector. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is proceeding with its healthcare chatbot after scoring a streak of early wins with general chatbots, while other Big Tech firms are exploring emerging technologies for early disease detection and administrative functionalities.\nA report predicts that AI in healthcare will reach a market capitalization of $613 billion by 2024, driven by technology innovation and heavy private sector support. However, multiple studies have warned of potential flaws in AI-powered health solutions, with the World Health Organization advocating for strict guardrails to mitigate risks.\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership—allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

{"title": "Vietnam eyes digital healthcare; VNA partners with Yonhap", "url": "https://coingeek.com/vietnam-eyes-digital-healthcare-vna-partners-with-yonhap/", "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nVietnam has unveiled plans to roll out electronic prescriptions into the national VNeID digital identity platform, pushing the frontiers of digitization for its burgeoning health sector.\nAccording to a report, the new integration will allow patients to order medicines online and receive them without the need for in-person hospital visits. The plan was first unveiled at the July meeting of the Government’s Steering Committee on Science, Technology, Innovation, and Digital Transformation.\nUnder the initial plans, the Ministry of Public Security will lead the efforts to integrate e-prescriptions with the country’s digital ID system. The Ministry will seek interoperability between pharmacy networks, the national health data coordination system, and hospital-issued prescriptions.\nThe Ministry of Public Security will begin a pilot project in September to test the viability of the offering. Upon public rollout, patients can see their medicine prescription on the VNeID mobile application, allowing them to order pharmaceutical products online.\nAlready, things are in motion for the mainstream rollout of the offering. Vietnam’s Ministry of Health has issued an order for all hospitals to issue outpatient prescriptions digitally by October 1.\nInsiders with knowledge of the matter disclosed that other medical facilities will begin issuing electronic prescriptions at the start of 2026. Meanwhile, the VNeID app has expanded its reach to healthcare since launch, including a ‘Health Record’ section for users offering a raft of functionalities.\nDigital ID app users can access an electronic check-up book, medical appointment reminders, and a pharmacy directory. However, the pharmacy directory only supports the sale of non-prescription drugs via the VNeID app.\nWhile the incoming e-prescription features have received plaudits for stifling fake prescriptions and providing a history of patients’ treatment plans, several critics have poked holes in the system. Firstly, there are fears that the e-prescriptions feature will overload the VNeID app, while others warn that home deliveries can lead to drug misuse in the absence of a doctor’s guidance.\nVNeID gathers significant steam in Vietnam\nSince the launch of the digital ID system, Vietnam has racked up impressive milestones with a cross-section of citizens onboarded. Last month, the government opened the digital ID to foreigners, enabling access to several government-backed services.\nA report has chronicled a spike in the number of foreign digital ID applications since the service extension. Vietnam is slowly embracing emerging technologies, with several sectors turning to blockchain to improve processes.VNA and Yonhap strike an AI and emerging technology partnership\nSouth Korea’s Yonhap News Agency (YNA) and the Vietnam News Agency (VNA) have inked a partnership deal to collaborate on digital transformation, leaning on a raft of emerging technologies.\nThe newly minted cooperation agreement places artificial intelligence (AI) at the core, with parties pledging improved information exchange. The deal was signed during the Vietnam-RoK Economic Forum in Seoul, and South Korea Prime Minister Kim Min Seok and Party General Secretary Tô Lâm were in attendance.\nBoth Yonhap and the VNA will pursue a collaborative effort for AI-driven journalism, offering advanced functionalities and mutual benefits for all parties. Yonhap and the VNA will explore the possibilities of AI-powered news translations to improve the reach of both news outlets.\nAware of the scourge of AI-generated fake news, the arrangement will involve fact-checking solutions for readers of both platforms to stifle the spread of misinformation. Furthermore, parties are pledging to collaborate on datasets relevant to regional contexts.\nMeanwhile, other key areas of cooperation will include AI-based tagging of legacy content and personalized news distribution to readers based on their preferences. Yonhap CEO Hwang Dae-il disclosed on the sidelines of the Vietnam-RoK Economic Forum that the partnership will be the foundation of a smooth bilateral relationship between Vietnam and South Korea.\nAlready, VNA General Director Vũ Việt Trang highlighted existing cooperation between the news agencies, leading to timely coverage of key economic events in both countries.\nBuilding on the existing relationship, parties are eyeing a potential collaboration for shared cloud infrastructure to power the AI pivot. Furthermore, there are ambitious plans for capacity building and talent exchange between both parties, with executives mulling the prospects of joint workshops.\nAt the core of the plans is the strict adherence to ethical guidelines governing journalism, with parties pledging to reduce bias and over-reliance on AI-generated content. Meanwhile, Malaysia has turned to AI to future-proof journalism, cracking down on fake news and other malicious deepfake content.\nA steady march toward emerging technology\nAmong the duo, South Korea has pulled ahead in terms of AI innovation and adoption. South Korea’s AI advances correlate with heavy government spending and a concerted push to introduce emerging technologies into public utilities.\nOn the other hand, Vietnam has achieved notable successes with AI through key sector integrations. Early in the year, high-ranking government officials reiterated the desire to pursue national digital transformation, targeting AI while unfurling training programs to deepen the talent pool.\nWatch | Mark Thiele: Ownership of healthcare data crucial", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 03:00:00 +0000", "author": "Wahid Pessarlay", "source": "https://coingeek.com/feed/"}
{"title": "Traditional finance pushes back on crypto-financial products", "url": "https://coingeek.com/traditional-finance-pushes-back-on-crypto-financial-products/", "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nIn recent months, there’s been a flood of good news for the blockchain, cryptocurrency, and digital asset industries. New laws supporting industry growth have been signed into effect, and government agencies are trying to provide clear rules and guidelines so companies can innovate without wondering if they’ll be prosecuted for it. Beyond the changes that have already taken place, even more pending legislation is making its way through the White House that could further accelerate growth.\nBut almost all of this news comes from inside the industry or its loudest supporters. What we haven’t been hearing much of, even though it’s out there, are the voices pushing back against digital currency and digital currency-financial products. However, this may be beginning to change.\nTraditional finance pushes back\nCitadel Securities, the hedge fund founded by Ken Griffin, recently sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Crypto Task Force weighing in on tokenized equity securities. In that letter, Citadel went against the grain and said tokenized securities should be treated exactly like traditional stocks from a regulatory standpoint. In other words, they should be treated as securities and required to register with the SEC.\nWhat is a tokenized security?\nA tokenized stock is a digital representation of a traditional equity. Instead of buying Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) or Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares outright, you buy a digital currency token that mirrors the stock’s price. That token rises and falls in lockstep with the real thing. Sometimes it’s backed 1:1 by actual shares held in reserve by a custodian, which is usually the brokerage offering the service.\nWhen you buy a tokenized stock, you’re purchasing a synthetic version of the stock, not the stock itself. That means no shareholder voting rights and none of the full regulatory protections that come with direct ownership; instead, you get a blockchain-issued “digital twin” of a share.\nIn its letter, Citadel argued that tokenized securities are “look-a-like” products being marketed as alternatives to listed equities, and therefore should follow the same rules. That means brokers offering them should register as securities brokers, and the products should be regulated as securities.\nAre tokenized securities legal?\nTokenized securities aren’t illegal in the U.S. or overseas, but they do have to comply with certain rules. In the U.S., that means existing securities laws still apply. Overseas, the rules are often looser, which makes launching these products easier. This may be one of the reasons why Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD) launched tokenized securities in European markets.\nBut due to the newfound attention and support the digital currency industry is receiving from the United States government, the SEC’s Crypto Task Force is actively debating whether the current rules should stay as they are or be revised to make on-chain trading of tokenized securities possible without requiring their offerers to register with the SEC.Citadel’s position is that the SEC should scrutinize tokenized securities thoroughly before making any changes to existing laws. Their main argument is that the U.S. already has a well-tested system for regulating stocks; therefore, letting tokenized stock brokers circumvent those rules could harm investors and markets. They’re particularly concerned about the impact on liquidity, IPO incentives, company transparency, shareholder engagement, and broader market stability.\nTo be fair, Citadel’s concerns are warranted, especially in an era when the U.S. government is largely pro-crypto. The prevailing narrative tends to be that digital currency needs fewer regulations and could go further, faster if “outdated” rules got out of the way. However, as Citadel points out, nothing has really proven that the current laws should be bent for these blockchain-based offerings, especially since the financial products being offered are not something the world has ever seen before that warrants new rules.\nTo put it another way, tokenized stocks run the same software as publicly traded equities, but on a different operating system, blockchain, instead of U.S. stock exchanges. Citadel warns that what we see happening in the cryptocurrency industry might be “regulatory arbitrage—gaming the system—not true innovation.”\nWill Wall Street compete with digital currency?\nAs more digital currency-financial products come to market and government agencies respond with new guidelines or amendments, we will most likely see more traditional finance institutions pushing back, or at the very least, voicing their concerns similar to how Citadel has done with the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. If the products are similar enough, as they are with tokenized stocks and publicly traded equities, traditional finance will compete head-to-head with crypto incumbents for market share.\nWhen that’s the case, we can assume that one of two things will happen: either the traditional financial institutions will fight to slow digital currency’s momentum, or, if they can’t beat them, they’ll join them and enter the arena with their own digital currency-financial products as some traditional finance incumbents are already beginning to do.\nWatch: Improving logistics, finance with AI & blockchain", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:00:00 +0000", "author": "Patrick Thompson", "source": "https://coingeek.com/feed/"}
{"title": "US Treasury confirms Bitcoin Reserve will rely on seizures", "url": "https://coingeek.com/us-treasury-confirms-bitcoin-reserve-will-rely-on-seizures/", "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nUnited States Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated that the government would not be buying additional BTC for the strategic reserve created by President Donald Trump in a March 7 executive order.\nSpeaking to Fox Business on August 14, when asked about U.S. gold reserves, Bessent said the U.S. had also started “to get into the 21st Century,” with its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which he hinted would remain as a store of value.\nBessent confirmed that already seized assets would continue to be held, no BTC would be sold (in the immediate future), and that further seizures could add to the government’s holdings over time.\n“We’re not going to be buying that [bitcoin] but are going to use confiscated assets and continue to build that up, we’re going to stop selling that,” said Bessent. “I believe that the bitcoin reserve at today’s prices is somewhere between $15 and $20 billion.”\nBitcoin analytics platform Bitbo estimated that, as of December 2024, the U.S. government owned 198,012 bitcoins, which would currently be valued at around $23.6 billion.\nAlmost half of this—94,643 BTC—came from assets seized from Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan in February 2022, following a probe into the August 2016 hack of digital asset exchange Bitfinex.\nBitcoin Reserve\nPresident Trump officially announced that the U.S. would create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve on March 7, when he signed an executive order titled “Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile.“\nThe executive order introduced the idea of a strategic reserve exclusively for BTC, where previously it had been rumored that the reserve may also include other digital assets.\nBased on Bessent’s comments, the BTC reserve is being treated like a traditional strategic reserve, i.e., a stockpile of an asset, typically a commodity, that the U.S. government builds up and taps into during times of catastrophe, economic turmoil, or crisis. However, the executive order is somewhat vague, simply stating that the BTC Strategic Reserve would be “utilized to meet governmental objectives in accordance with applicable law.”\nThe executive order also established a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, consisting of digital assets other than BTC forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings. However, the government already confirmed it would not acquire additional assets for the stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings.\nMuch to the disappointment of crypto bros worldwide, the executive order made clear that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would not be built up through the large-scale purchasing of BTC with public funds. Rather, it is to be “capitalized with all BTC held by the Department of the Treasury that was finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any executive department or agency.”This means that the reserve relies on BTC seized by U.S. government agencies as a result of arrests or as payment for penalties.\nBeyond this initial method of obtaining BTC, the executive order also mandates that the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce “develop strategies for acquiring additional Government BTC,” provided the strategies remain budget-neutral and do not use taxpayer dollars.\nIt’s unclear what these “strategies” would be, but following his interview with Fox Business on Thursday, Secretary Bessent clarified in an X post that the Treasury department was still “committed to exploring budget-neutral pathways to acquire more Bitcoin to expand the reserve.”\nWhile the Treasury ponders how to gain more BTC without spending money, U.S. law enforcement agencies are doing their part to expand the strategic reserve through more seizures.\nMore funds for the reserve\nIn April, the Dallas Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) seized $2.4 million BTC associated with a member of the Chaos ransomware group known as “Hors,” which has been tied to ransomware attacks against victims in the Northern District of Texas and elsewhere.\nIn July, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit seeking a claim on the funds, as it “constitutes property involved in unlawful activity, or proceeds of or property derived from unlawful activity.”\nOn Wednesday, the DOJ appeared to make a further effort to increase the roughly $20 billion worth of BTC already in the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, unsealing six warrants authorizing the seizure of over $2.8 million in digital assets.\nAll of the assets were seized from a wallet controlled by Ianis Aleksandrovich Antropenko, who was charged by the Northern District of Texas in September 2024 with conspiring to commit computer fraud and abuse and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\nAntropenko allegedly used Zeppelin ransomware to target and attack various individuals, businesses, and organizations in the U.S. and worldwide. Specifically, he and his co-conspirators would encrypt and steal the victim’s data and then demand a ransom payment to decrypt it, refrain from publishing it, or delete it.\n“As alleged in the unsealed warrants, the cryptocurrency and other assets are proceeds of (or were involved in laundering the proceeds of) ransomware activity,” said the DOJ.\nThe DOJ did not specify the amount of the soon-to-be seized funds that would be returned to victims and how much would remain with the government, or what amount of the digital assets—if any—were BTC, which could eventually make their way into the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.\nWatch: Digital Asset Recovery takes token recovery seriously", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "author": "James Field", "source": "https://coingeek.com/feed/"}
{"title": "India forges strategic digital partnership with Philippines", "url": "https://coingeek.com/india-forges-strategic-digital-partnership-with-philippines/", "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nIndia and the Philippines have taken a significant leap in their bilateral relations by forging a ‘strategic partnership’ to address urgent regional and global challenges. This elevated cooperation signals a strong commitment to accelerating connectivity across digital, physical, and financial domains, while pushing forward a shared digital agenda. With pressing demands for secure and inclusive digital transformation, both nations are prioritizing collaboration in e-governance, financial inclusion, and the development of resilient digital public infrastructure, anchored in robust cybersecurity and data protection standards.\nIn parallel, the partnership seeks to strengthen science, technology, and innovation (STI) cooperation through joint research, academic linkages, and skills development initiatives. These efforts will be structured under the 2025–2028 Programme of Cooperation between India’s Department of Science and Technology and its Philippine counterpart, underscoring both countries’ urgency and strategic value on innovation-driven growth.\nThe two parties also aim to deepen collaboration in peaceful applications of outer space, with contributions from academia, research institutions, industry, and startups. Parallel efforts will be made to expand the peaceful use of nuclear energy and strengthen Information and Communication Technology (ICT) partnerships, particularly in areas like edutech and medtech, through information sharing and the exchange of best practices.\n“India is delighted to welcome Philippines President, Mr. Bongbong Marcos at a time when we mark 75 years of bilateral relations between our nations. It is equally gladdening that we have decided to elevate ties to a Strategic Partnership, which ensures our cooperation becomes more robust and diverse. An Action Plan has also been drawn up in this regard,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on X.\n“President Marcos and I held wide-ranging talks on India-Philippines bilateral cooperation, regional and global issues. An important part of the discussion was to boost trade. Other areas like IT, healthcare, automobiles, minerals, space and science offer immense potential too. Growing cooperation in defence and security is also a very welcome development,” Modi added.\nOn the economic front, the two nations have welcomed a steady increase in bilateral trade, which reached approximately $3.3 billion in 2024–25, India’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement. Both sides are committed to sustaining this growth by diversifying trade and investment flows and leveraging complementary strengths. They also agreed to expedite the conclusion of the Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) while working toward a more business-friendly, simplified ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA).\nFor the Philippines, partnering with India provides a strategic counterbalance to other major economic powers. For India, it expands its footprint in Southeast Asia, aligning with its strategic vision for a multipolar Asia. This strategic partnership is not just symbolic—it represents a timely and critical alignment of interests as both nations navigate an increasingly complex geopolitical and technological landscape.\nBy enhancing digital public infrastructure, e-governance, and financial inclusion, the partnership addresses urgent developmental needs while reducing reliance on traditional Western economies. Joint research, academic exchanges, and research and development (R&D) through the 2025–2028 Programme of Cooperation will build technological capabilities and human capital. This is vital for both India and the Philippines as they aim to be competitive in emerging technologies.\nIndia boosts tech alliances amid global uncertainty\nIn the months ahead, India is set to accelerate strategic partnerships with countries aligned with its innovation-focused goals, especially those offering political stability, strong investment prospects, and advanced tech capabilities. Amid rising global volatility, there’s a pressing need for India to strengthen these relationships to safeguard and advance its long-term economic and technological vision.\nModi’s economic strategy faced a major disruption after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a steep 50% tariff on Indian exports in retaliation for India’s oil trade with Russia. The situation escalated when Trump publicly criticized India’s economy as “dead” and condemned its trade policies as “obnoxious,” further deepening tensions between the two nations. The impact was particularly severe given that the U.S. is India’s largest trading partner—and Modi had previously gone out of his way to maintain close ties, including being one of the first foreign leaders to visit Trump following his return to office.\nIn response to the economic jolt from Washington, Modi appears to be recalibrating India’s foreign policy, moving to strengthen ties with other nations. As part of this shift, India and China are working to revive economic cooperation, which had cooled after a deadly border clash in 2020. In a notable development, Modi is expected to visit China for the first time in seven years to meet President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin on August 31, signaling a potentially significant realignment in India’s global partnerships.\nAt the same time, India and the Philippines are entering a decisive new phase in their relationship, building on over seven decades of cooperation that began with establishing diplomatic ties in 1949. Over the years, the two nations have formalized their partnership through key agreements, including the 1952 Treaty of Friendship, the 2000 Memorandum of Understanding on Policy Consultation Talks, and the 2007 Joint Commission on Bilateral Cooperation and Framework of Bilateral Cooperation. These milestones have laid the foundation for the newly launched strategic partnership between the two Asian powerhouses, a move that signals a renewed urgency to unlock the full potential of bilateral, regional, and global collaboration.\nIndia, Philippines expand security ties to cyber domain\nTo inject fresh momentum into this evolving India-Philippines strategic partnership, security cooperation has been expanded to include the cybersecurity domain.\nAccording to the official statement, both countries will step up efforts through regular meetings of the Joint Working Group on Counter-Terrorism to address emerging challenges, such as cybercrime, misuse of technology for terrorism, and financial crimes. They also plan to deepen collaboration in cybersecurity, digital governance, and emerging technology fields, including artificial intelligence (AI), financial technology, digital forensics, and Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) coordination. This includes policy dialogue, capacity building, and knowledge exchange on digital public infrastructure and critical information protection.Globally, addressing digital crimes has proven to be an especially complex and demanding task for governments, law enforcement agencies, and cybersecurity professionals alike. The constantly evolving nature of technology, combined with the anonymity provided by the Internet, allows cybercriminals to operate across borders with increasing sophistication and speed. Traditional legal frameworks often struggle to keep pace with the rapid advancement of digital tools used for illicit activities, creating gaps that criminals are quick to exploit.\nFor instance, in July 2025, the digital asset sector suffered significant financial damage, with hackers stealing at least $142 million across 17 separate incidents and marking a sharp 27% increase compared to the $111 million lost to malicious actors in June. The five most damaging breaches of the month together accounted for over $130 million in losses. These included attacks on CoinDCX ($44.2 million), GMX ($42 million), BigONEexchange ($28 million), WOOX ($12 million), and FutureProtocol ($4.2 million).\nThe data underscores the urgent need for strengthened cybersecurity measures, improved incident response protocols, and closer cooperation between exchanges, regulators, and blockchain security firms to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated attacks.\nTCS, NOW Telecom join hands for Philippines\nIn a critical move to strengthen the Philippines’ digital infrastructure and national cybersecurity, Indian information technology major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has signed a strategic agreement with the Philippines’ NOW Telecom, the telecom arm of NOW Corporation. This partnership aims to accelerate the country’s efforts in securing digital sovereignty, enhancing financial inclusion, and building a resilient, secure network infrastructure amid rising cyber threats and growing demand for digital services, TCS said in a statement.\nUnder the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), TCS said it would provide NOW Telecom with advanced technologies, including sovereign cloud solutions, a comprehensive cyber-defense suite, and citizen-focused digital services. These efforts are geared toward empowering the nation with self-reliant digital systems and infrastructure, reducing dependence on external networks, and ensuring critical systems remain protected in times of crisis.\nAccording to Mel Velarde, Chairman of the NOW Group: “This partnership with TCS, a global market giant, marks a significant step towards enhancing our national digital sovereignty and reducing reliance on foreign technologies. NOW’s and TCS’ expertise and innovative services will contribute to our nation’s data sovereignty by defending against risks and threats while creating a scalable, secure, and robust data infrastructure. The partnership between NOW and TCS exemplifies the technological aspirations of both India and the Philippines, heralding a new dawn of critical digital transformation for the Philippines.”\nThe collaboration also emphasizes secure cross-agency operations, especially during complex emergencies, and aims to strengthen the Philippines’ capabilities in areas such as digital banking, e-health, and public digital services—all essential to advancing inclusive digital access.\nBoth TCS and NOW Telecom are active members of the Trusted Network Alliance, part of the global Trusted Network Initiative (TNI), which promotes the development of secure telecom ecosystems across the Indo-Pacific. TCS said it brings to this partnership its extensive experience, particularly in public sector transformation in India, to align with the Philippines’ clean network principles and digital infrastructure roadmap.\nThis strategic alliance marks a pivotal moment in TCS’ rapidly expanding footprint in the Philippines, where it has been a key player since 2008. As urgent demands for digital transformation intensify, TCS is accelerating its support across critical sectors—telecom, banking, finance, real estate, and aviation—driving innovation and economic resilience.\n“This collaboration underscores our commitment to enhancing national digital sovereignty and cybersecurity. By leveraging our expertise and innovative services, we aim to support the Philippines in building a resilient and secure digital ecosystem. We look forward to contributing to the country’s digital transformation journey,” said Shiju Varghese, Country Head of TCS Philippines.\nPerfect timing?\nIndia’s strategic partnership with the Philippines comes at a time when the archipelagic country is approaching a critical moment on the regional stage as it prepares to host the 44th ASEAN Summit in 2026. With the spotlight turning toward Manila, Trade and Industry Secretary Cris Roque has been urging the nation to seize this opportunity to lead a bold and inclusive digital agenda that highlights the country’s rapid progress in innovation.\nSpeaking at the 51st Philippine Business Conference & Expo, Roque outlined a clear strategy: use ASEAN 2026 not just as a diplomatic milestone, but as a platform to demonstrate the Philippines’ emergence as a digital frontrunner in Southeast Asia. She emphasized the urgency of empowering micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), strengthening public-private collaboration, and embracing transformative technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain to position the country as a dynamic digital hub.\nRoque underscored digitalization as a crucial tool to overcome geographic barriers and foster inclusive growth—aligning with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s “Bagong Pilipinas” (New Philippines) vision of a modern, integrated, and future-ready nation. ASEAN 2026 represents an opportunity to put these strengths on display and assert the country’s growing influence in the regional and global digital economy.\nWatch: What’s going on with blockchain technology in India?", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:00:00 +0000", "author": "Pradipta Mukherjee", "source": "https://coingeek.com/feed/"}

Citi also offers tokenized trade finance and has proprietary tech to improve interoperability between private and public blockchains.\nAll of these products and platforms are live and in production today. Assets ranging from treasuries and money market funds to private credit and equity, and even real estate, have already been tokenized.\nExpect to see many more such platforms as Wall Street firms position themselves as the gatekeepers of what Boston Consulting Group estimates could be a $16 trillion market by 2030.\nWhy does Wall Street care about tokenization?\nAny market that may grow to $16 trillion in the next five years will grab the attention of the world’s financial center. However, there are other reasons beyond generating fees—tokenization delivers real benefits and solves longstanding problems in finance.\nCapital efficiency is one such problem. Longer settlement times, traditionally 1-2 business days after the trade, tie up capital unnecessarily. Even in shorter-term repo trades, inefficient infrastructure and the friction it creates slow things down. Tokenized treasuries, bonds, and other securities reduce settlement times to hours or minutes, increasing capital efficiency, boosting liquidity, and lowering funding costs.Tokenization is great for balance sheet optimization, too. Moving collateral between jurisdictions and custodians previously took hours or even days, but it can be done in real time in a tokenized world. This is not only more efficient but also reduces the likelihood of unwanted margin calls.\nData and control are big draws, too. In a world where data is the new oil, owning the rails tokenized assets move on is the equivalent of owning the roads and railways the tankers travel on. In the old world, data was fragmented across clearinghouses, custodians, and other intermediaries. Tokenized assets on blockchains allow issuers to see who owns what and what conditions apply. This data is valuable, allowing the big banks to offer tools for compliance, analytics, risk management, and more.\nOwning tokenization tools at the bedrock of the new financial system also gives the owners power to influence policies and retain clients. Policymakers have to listen to the guys who own the field the game is being played on, and whereas it was easy enough to move cash and securities between one bank or broker before, it will be much harder to do so in a world where the rails, workflows, and even token standards are unique to each institution.\nWhat Wall Street is still missing\nWhile all of this progress made toward tokenization is immense, there’s still one thing the Wall Street giants haven’t grasped—there will eventually be one global ledger underpinning the entire system. Everything will operate on one protocol, and while private blockchains may exist, they’ll be like intranets compared to the open internet.\nIf capitalism is indeed a relentless march toward greater efficiency via the incentives inherent in competition, then one ledger to rule them all is inevitable. Having many blockchains with different standards and inserting toll-collecting bridges between them is inefficient. Just as the dozens of competing networks gave way to TCP/IP, all the competing blockchains will give way to one.\nWhich one? Time will tell, but it will be the most scalable, efficient, low-fee ledger with the most utility. That means, as well as being fast and having tiny fees, it will have native token protocols and smart contracts and be capable of complex transactions such as financial contracts and trades with multiple steps and parties. It will also have to be purpose-built with regulatory compliance in mind.\nRight now, the BSV blockchain is winning that race. There’s no telling what the future holds, and the competition in the blockchain space never lets up, but there’s no other ledger capable of one million transactions per second for fees of fractions of a cent, let alone one capable of smart contracts and token issuance.\nWatch: Tokenized was built with blood, sweat and tears", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 07:00:00 +0000", "author": "Gavin Lucas", "source": "https://coingeek.com/feed/"}
{"title": "Abu Dhabi’s AI grows by 61%; AI bar from learning on online data", "url": "https://coingeek.com/abu-dhabi-ai-grows-by-61-ai-bar-from-learning-on-online-data/", "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nA new report has highlighted the growth of Abu Dhabi’s artificial intelligence (AI) sector, a rise driven by several key factors, including government and private sector initiatives.\nThe report, published by the Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, pegs the industry’s growth rate at 61% between June 2023 and June 2024. According to the document, the growth spurt pegs Abu Dhabi as the regional leader for artificial intelligence, outperforming its peers in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.\nWhile a number of AI companies have set up shop in Abu Dhabi, 58% of firms in the emirate are focused on innovation and research. Meanwhile, the city has added over 150 new AI companies to its growing ecosystem in the first six months of 2025.\n“This surge is not only about numbers,” said Shamis Ali Khalfan Al Dhaheri, Managing Director of the Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “It reflects a vibrant, diverse community of entrepreneurs, scientists, and global leaders who recognise Abu Dhabi as a magnet for groundbreaking technology ventures.”\nBeneath the glowing numbers for Abu Dhabi’s AI ecosystem is a three-year strategic roadmap to become a global leader for emerging technologies. Scheduled for 2025-2028, the AI roadmap places policy advocacy and ease of doing business at the core for international and local firms keen on establishing operations in the emirate.\nFurthermore, Abu Dhabi has launched an Advocacy Working Group on Artificial Intelligence and Technology to spearhead the emirate’s push toward AI dominance. Last year, it established MGX, which leads the emirate’s investments in AI and other emerging technologies.\nIn May, a bilateral deal between the UAE and the U.S. will see Abu Dhabi host the largest AI campus outside America. The deal has since triggered a flurry of new AI companies to set up shop in Abu Dhabi, lured by access to high-end chips from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\nUAE’s stance powers AI growth\nAt the core of Abu Dhabi’s growing AI ecosystem is the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) broad approach toward artificial intelligence. While UAE authorities have declared their AI ambitions, launching the Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Technology Council (AIATC) signals the country’s clear intention for dominance.\nHeavy government spending has begun yielding early results with several UAE-made AI models already drawing comparisons with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Gemini. Meanwhile, authorities are monitoring safe AI usage with the rollout of a national charter for guiding principles and ethics.\nNew study bars AI models from learning via online content\nAustralian researchers have reached a breakthrough in developing a technique to bar unauthorized AI models from learning from visual data uploaded online.\nThe technique limits AI from accessing photos and artworks and using them as training data. Developed by CSIRO, Australia’s national science agency, the research leaned on support from the University of Chicago and the Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre (CSCRC).A close look reveals that the system renders images and artworks unreadable to AI models. Despite the alterations for AI systems, the report noted that the image remains unchanged to the human eye.\nCSIRO scientist Derui Wang disclosed that the new technique has shown early flashes of brilliance during controlled lab studies. The system has proven formidable against adaptive attacks and retraining attempts by the most advanced AI models in the market.\n“We can mathematically guarantee that unauthorised machine learning models can’t learn from the content beyond a certain threshold,” said Wang. “That’s a powerful safeguard for social media users, content creators, and organisations.”\nPer the report, there are a plethora of use cases stemming from the CSIRO technique. For starters, social media users can lean on the solution as a protective layer for their photos before uploading them, restricting AI models from learning facial features.\nWang noted that the capability is key in stifling the ability of AI models to create deepfakes without the consent of the user. Furthermore, the technique will find utility in state defense, with countries using it to shield sensitive satellite pictures and cyber threat data from AI models.\nFor now, it is only applicable to images, but there are plans to extend the capabilities to music, text, and videos. While a mainstream rollout is still in the distance, CSIRO has its sights set on new research partners from AI safety and ethics, academia, cybersecurity, and defence.\nTightening the noose for AI\nAmid the rapid adoption of AI models, researchers are making different attempts to curtail the excesses of the emerging technology. In the early days, AI companies rolled out detectors to identify AI-generated text, racking up 100% accuracy levels, while Big Tech firms have found varying degrees of success with watermarking tools.\nFurthermore, experts are mulling blockchain to limit AI’s access to copyrighted materials for training. On the policy side, regulators are creating guidelines and guiding principles for AI companies.\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership—allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

It enables them to engage with their environment similarly to humans and extends our interaction with AI beyond the keyboard.\nShanghai’s ambitious action plan further targets four tech incubators by 2027, and for the city to deploy at least 100 innovative applications. The plan wants to push embodied AI to $7 billion in two years; the city’s overall AI sector was estimated to be worth 400 billion yuan ($55 billion) at the end of last year.\nFor Shanghai, the transition into embodied AI will be a natural fit as the city is China’s robotics hub; it accounts for over one-third of the country’s total robot industrial base. Under the new plan, the city will promote the expansion of this base and invest in research and development in next-generation processors amid the ongoing chip wars between China and the United States.\nShanghai’s action plan aligns with a similar three-year plan by authorities in Pudong, the city’s financial district. Pudong is home to over 100 robotics companies across software and hardware development.\n“With Shanghai’s policy support, Pudong will accelerate the clustering of top enterprises, strengthen industry supply chains, and promote integrated development led by leading manufacturers,” commented Jiang Lei, the chief scientist at one of the robotics firms.\nShanghai joins other major Chinese cities that are aggressively investing in the integration of AI and robotics. The capital, Beijing, wants to grow its embodied AI cluster into a 100-billion-yuan ($14 billion) juggernaut, while the tech capital of Shenzhen intends to nurture at least 10 companies valued at more than $1.4 billion.\nWhile the inter-city rivalry heats up, the national government has set its sights on global AI domination. Just two weeks ago, China unveiled its Global AI Governance Action Plan, three days after the U.S. government published a similar roadmap.Unveiled at the World AI Conference in Shanghai, China’s plan focuses on concerted global efforts as the solution to the fragmented national regulatory frameworks.\n“We should strengthen coordination to form a global AI governance framework that has broad consensus as soon as possible,” Prime Minister Li Qiang stated at the event.\nGlobally, regulators are scrambling to oversee a sector that’s projected to be worth $800 billion by 2030—$3.7 trillion four years later—and contribute $16 trillion to the global economy.\nAI companies have fought back against sweeping regulations, arguing they will stifle innovation, and some lawmakers are heeding the industry’s call. In U.S. President Donald Trump’s original ‘One Big Beautiful Bill,’ there was a proposal for state governments to be blocked from enacting any AI laws for at least the next ten years, but the Senate voted against it.\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership—allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

{"title": "Norway’s sovereign wealth fund ramps up BTC exposure", "url": "https://coingeek.com/norway-sovereign-wealth-fund-ramps-up-btc-exposure/", "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nNorway’s sovereign wealth fund, the largest state-owned fund in the world, increased its indirect BTC exposure by 192% over the last year, “underscoring BTC’s mainstream integration,” according to digital asset research company K33 Research.\nLast week, Norway’s state-owned Norges Bank published its half-year 2025 report on the ‘Government Pension Fund Global,’ the country’s sovereign wealth fund that it manages under the name of Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM).\nAfter analyzing the report, K33 Research found that the fund’s indirect BTC exposure has grown 87.7% in the past six months and 192.7% over the past year to 7,161 BTC (around $871.3 million, as of time of writing).\n“NBIM’s indirect BTC exposure has hit new ATHs [all-time highs] of 7,161 BTC,” said Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33, in an August 12 post on X. “Increased weights in core treasury vehicles such as Strategy and MARA and the overall strong BTC accumulation from treasury comps has fueled the H1 [first half of the year] growth of 3,340 BTC.”\nAccording to Lunde, the top five contributors to the fund’s increased BTC exposure were MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), a United States-based software company that owns 597,325 BTC ($72.6 billion), as of July 8; MARA (NASDAQ: MARA), an American block reward mining company that reportedly holds 50,639 BTC ($6.1 billion); Block, a U.S.-based tech company founded by Jack Dorsey that is reported to hold 8,692 BTC ($1.05 billion); digital asset exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), which owns approximately 11,776 BTC ($1.4 billion); and Metaplanet (NASDAQ: MTPLF), a Japanese blockchain company reported to hold 18,113 BTC ($2.19 billion).\nThe latter of these companies, Metaplanet, also recently released its earnings report for the second quarter of 2025, showing a surge of almost 190% year-to-date. This out-performed the 7.2% average gain posted by the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) Core 30, which tracks tech giants such Toyota (NASDAQ: TM), Sony (NASDAQ: SONY), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (NASDAQ: MHVYF).\nThe impressive performance of blockchain and digital asset-focused companies, and the increasing investment in those companies from the likes of NBIM, can be linked to the recent peaks in the price of BTC, which in turn was in large part inspired by the pro-crypto policies of U.S. President Donald Trump.\nNorway’s fund leads the way as BTC booms\nSovereign wealth funds are state-owned investment funds that governments use to invest surplus revenues and other financial reserves.\nNorway’s sovereign wealth fund, also known as the Government Pension Fund of Norway (Statens pensjonsfond), actually consists of two separate sovereign wealth funds: the Government Pension Fund Global (NBIM) and the Government Pension Fund Norway.The former currently sits at over $1.9 trillion in assets, as of June 2025, and is mandated to only invest in assets outside of Norway, while the latter is a smaller fund managed separately and limited to domestic and Nordic investments.\nNorway’s sovereign wealth fund reached this impressive size, thanks to the country’s 1969 discovery of significant oil and gas reserves in the North Sea, which has made it Western Europe’s largest producer of those fossil fuels. To ensure the whole country benefited from this natural windfall, the government imposed heavy taxes on the energy sector in the 1990s. Using some of these tax profits, along with licensing fees and profits from the state energy company, the Norwegian Parliament created the Petroleum Fund, now recognized as the sovereign wealth fund, or NBIM.\nInitially limited to investing in bonds, its mandate expanded over time to become the largest of its kind by acquiring small equity stakes in thousands of companies worldwide. Today, it is the world’s biggest single owner of listed shares.\nAmong the extensive list of foreign assets in the fund’s investment portfolio are several companies active in the blockchain and digital asset spaces, which is what gives NBIM its indirect exposure to 7,161 BTC.\nAccording to K33’s Lunde, the latest report from the fund’s manager “shows that BTC is finding its way into any well-diversified portfolio, deliberate or not.”\nMore generally, Lunde also highlighted BTC’s strong U.S. dollar-denominated gains so far this year, growing 11.9% above its January 20 peak of $109,000—inspired by the inauguration of President Trump—to reach a new all-time high of more than $123,000 in July.\nShe suggested that this new peak was again down to Trump, thanks to his executive order opening $9 trillion in 401(k) retirement plans to digital assets. The order was signed in August but rumored earlier in July, coinciding with when BTC reached its new heights.\nWatch | AI & blockchain: Why investors should look for this blend in startups", "published": "Fri, 15 Aug 2025 13:00:00 +0000", "author": "James Field", "source": "https://coingeek.com/feed/"}
{"title": "Ukraine weighs new bill aligning its ‘crypto’ laws with EU", "url": "https://coingeek.com/ukraine-weighs-new-bill-aligning-its-crypto-laws-with-eu/", "text": "|\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nUkraine is moving closer to a new bill that would legalize digital asset ownership and establish a new taxation framework for the sector.\nThe bill’s first draft is set to be presented to Ukraine’s parliament, known as the Verkhovna Rada, later this month, local outlets report. It’s expected to align the country’s digital asset regulations with the European Union’s standards, from transparency and consumer protection to anti-money laundering (AML) and licensing. Ukraine is seeking to become a member of the EU by the decade’s end, and the screening process is already underway, making it critical for its ‘crypto’ laws to reflect the region’s.\n“The preparation of a draft law on taxation of transactions with virtual assets is currently in the final stage. It is estimated that its submission for the first reading in the Verkhovna Rada is scheduled for the end of August 2025,” Danylo Hetmantsev, who heads parliament’s tax and finance committee, told one news outlet.\nThe draft bill will legalize digital asset ownership in the country, but won’t recognize them as legal tender, mirroring the direction most pro-crypto frameworks have taken. El Salvador remains the only country to give ‘crypto’ legal tender status, and it has been an epic disaster for President Nayib Bukele. The Central African Republic followed suit in 2022, but the experiment was short-lived and the law was repealed the next year.\nThe draft bill has a provision that allows Ukrainians who acquired their digital assets before it takes effect to legally declare them, paying a one-time 5% military tax and 5% personal income tax. The government arrived at the 10% combined tax after consulting with local experts and international organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), local outlets report.\n“We must provide the market with legal protection. The state must recognize those who own crypto and exchanges that carry out this activity. It must give the owners the opportunity to protect their rights because you cannot help but notice it’s too big to ignore,” Hetmantsev commented.\nHe further warned digital asset owners who choose to remain in the shadows after the new law takes effect that, as every service becomes licensed, their activity will be unearthed and they will be charged accordingly.\nA legal taxation framework could generate millions of dollars for the cash-strapped Ukrainian government amid the ongoing conflict with Russia. According to a report by Global Ledger, the government lost out on at least $200 million in ‘crypto’ taxes over the past four years from exchanges and other virtual asset service providers (VASPs). These platforms reportedly generated over $1.1 billion in profit from Ukrainian traders in that time.Ukraine’s central bank supports new law\nThe Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, Andriy Pyshnyy, has supported the new draft bill, but insists that ‘crypto‘ must not be assigned legal tender status.\n“Virtual assets cannot be a means of payment, and cannot in any way undermine the effectiveness of our monetary instruments. There should be no transfer of monetary powers and no undermining of the National Bank’s capabilities due to the legalization of virtual assets,” he stated in a recent interview.\nHe believes the new framework will take the market out of the shadows, allowing the central bank to better monitor and oversee the financial transactions involving the sector. But while Pyshnyy is eager to oversee the sector, lawmakers remain undecided on which government agency should be given jurisdiction over ‘crypto.’\nIn June, Hetmantsev, the head of the parliamentary committee on finance and taxation, said legislators are deciding between NBU, the Ministry of Digital Transformation, and the National Securities and Stock Market Commission.\nHowever, the NBU is currently the most likely to be handed authority over the sector as it’s “an institutionally capable regulator with experience in the banking and non-banking sectors,” Hetmantsev said.\nUkraine’s ‘crypto’ regulation will have a global impact given the government’s massive stash. The Eastern European nation holds 46,351 BTC, worth over $5.6 billion, which ranks only behind the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. Ukraine also recently proposed a BTC reserve, joining others like the U.S., the Czech Republic, Brazil, Poland, and more.\nWatch: Breaking down solutions to blockchain regulation hurdles", "published": "Fri, 15 Aug 2025 15:00:00 +0000", "author": "Steve Kaaru", "source": "https://coingeek.com/feed/"}

Its recent moves are catching the eye, especially as major coins like XRP and ADA face hurdles. Speculation is rising about whether XYZVerse could become next month’s standout among alternative coins. Enthusiasts are closely tracking its progress.\nPrice Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible?\nXYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains.\nThe broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch.\nKey Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market:\n-\nStrong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal\n-\nDeflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure\n-\nLiquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch\n-\nCommunity incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding\nPrice Prediction for $XYZ\n-\nCurrent Presale Price: $0.005\n-\nProjected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates)\n-\nPotential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO)\n-\nLong-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings)\nBuy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains\nRealistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10?\nA 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on:\n-\nStrong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day.\n-\nSustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement.\n-\nMarket Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit.\nIs a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ?\nXYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable.\nInvest in $XYZ Before Its Surge\nXRP: The Quick Coin Sprinting Toward a Borderless Payment Future\nXRP was built for one job—move money fast. Running on the open XRP Ledger, it clears payments in seconds, costs a tiny fraction of a cent, and works across borders without a bank account. No single boss controls it, so once a trade is sent, it stays sent. Founders Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz launched 100 billion coins, then gifted 80 billion to Ripple to fuel growth. Ripple locked 55 billion in escrow, releasing set amounts each month to keep supply steady and trust high.\nToday, many traders eye XRP as a fresh play in a market craving real utility. While Bitcoin is praised as digital gold and Ether powers smart apps, XRP focuses on pure payment speed and low fees—traits banks and fintech firms need right now. With talk of a new alt-coin season and rising demand for quick, cheap transfers, XRP’s use case shines. If capital shifts from hype tokens toward coins that solve clear problems, XRP could grab the spotlight once more.\nCardano’s Green Rocket: ADA Could Power the Next Crypto Boom\nCardano is a new type of blockchain. It hosts apps, tokens, and games while using far less power than older networks. Instead of huge computers racing to solve puzzles, holders simply lock up their ADA coins to keep things safe. This earth-friendly method, named Ouroboros, lets Cardano plan for big scale. Two layers share the work: one moves money, the other runs code. That split helps the chain aim for lightning speed—millions of trades each second—without breaking a sweat.\nThe market now wants useful and green projects. Ethereum still leads, yet its fees jump when crowds arrive. Cardano's low costs and simple staking give it an edge as shoppers search for the next star. The rising buzz around blockchain games and online finance also fits Cardano's tool set. If crypto swings into another climb, coins with clear value and low energy needs can shine. ADA checks those boxes, so many see it as a strong long-term choice rather than a quick bet. Cardano price prediction outlooks reflect this optimism about the platform's sustainable growth potential.\nConclusion\nXRP and ADA remain strong in the 2025 bull run. Yet all-sport memecoin XYZVerse (XYZ) eyes 20,000% growth by merging fandom, GameFi, and community power, hinting at next month’s surprise.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Instead of relying on hype, it has already launched a working testnet before its mainnet release. This move demonstrates delivery and reassures the market that development is on track.\nThe presale numbers show the impact. BlockDAG (BDAG) has now raised $376 million, sold 25.2 billion coins, and moved through 29 batches, with the current price at $0.0276. Those who joined in Batch 1 at $0.001 have already gained an impressive 2,660% ROI. With more than 19,300 hardware miners sold, generating $7.8 million in sales alone, it’s clear that demand goes beyond speculation.\nTestnet as Proof of Delivery\nThe release of BlockDAG’s testnet is more than just a technical checkpoint; it’s proof that the project can back up its claims. The testnet already supports smart contracts, a blockchain explorer, and a faucet where developers can test transactions. These early features set the stage for real applications to be built before the mainnet is even live.\nFor those looking for the best crypto to buy now, this kind of early execution matters. Many projects promise test environments but struggle to deliver, leaving their communities guessing. BlockDAG’s progress builds credibility and gives developers the head start needed to build useful dApps from day one.\nPresale Momentum Meets Real Progress\nMost presales are fueled by hype. BlockDAG’s presale is different; its momentum is reinforced by actual delivery. Moving through batches quickly, the project’s pricing structure rewards early participation, while continued growth reflects strong community backing.\nThe nearly $376 million raised so far is more than just a figure. It’s capital that can be put toward infrastructure, partnerships, and ecosystem expansion. The balance of rising demand and early proof-of-work makes BlockDAG stand out as one of the few presales showing both growth and delivery at the same time.\nFrom Testnet to Potential Revenue\nBlockDAG’s roadmap is clear: build a utility that drives ongoing adoption. Its hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work architecture allows high transaction throughput, opening the door to scalable DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and enterprise-grade apps.\nWith developers already experimenting on the testnet, by the time the mainnet arrives in 2025, applications could already be ready to attract users and transaction activity. For holders, that creates the potential for lasting value beyond early presale excitement.\nLast Word\nBlockDAG is doing what most presales don’t: proving delivery before launch. With a live testnet, nearly $376M raised, 25.2B coins sold, and 2,660% gains for earliest buyers, it’s building both trust and momentum. Add in the miner sales and growing ecosystem, and it’s clear why BDAG is being called the best crypto to buy now.\nInstead of being just another speculative presale, BlockDAG is showing how preparation, proof, and presale growth can work together to build a revenue-generating blockchain for the future.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

According to market predictions, a $500 allocation in the Ozak AI token’s current presale phase could yield $280,000 if the price reaches $2.80 in the future. This level of potential return has sparked notable engagement from a community accustomed to speculative, high-reward opportunities.\nThe presale has already been carried out in several stages; Phase 4 is the one that is happening now at the token price of $0.005. It has seen more than 150 million tokens bought, increasing total funds to $1.95 million. These are indicators of a rising interest in retail involvement by strategic investors, many of whom are looking to diversify beyond simply hype-based digital assets.\nUtility and Market Timing\nUnlike other cryptocurrencies that underpin meme-based tokens, the Ozak AI token presents a set of intended real-world applications. These applications focus on things like the introduction of artificial intelligence into blockchain-based solutions, and the target industry has recently been attracting higher interest in the digital asset sector. The roadmap of the project includes the description of utility functions with the aim to provide practical value, which might allow the project to attract and sustain long-term interest in the market beyond speculative trading.\nThe presale has also been timed to take place in the context of a wider trend in the cryptocurrency industry, emphasizing tangible use cases. According to industry data, investors are getting keener with regard to their investment preferences, with a propensity to prefer assets that have an element of innovative technology accompanied by the evident implementation strategies. This tendency can be one of the factors of increased demand witnessed in the initial rounds of token funding.\nPrice Projections and Investor Considerations\nA potential price tracking target has also been estimated by analysts to be as high as $2.80 for the token, which, in case it occurs, would be a very good surge as compared to the presale valuation. Although these projections are speculative and prone to spikes due to market instability, SHIB holders have developed an interest in its upside potential since this sector also offers high growth opportunities.\nIt is recommended that potential investors consider opportunities and overall risks. The cryptocurrency market is associated with price volatility, and presale investments are usually associated with a greater amount of uncertainty because of the incompleteness of the project development. Market adoption, technology deployment, and competitive positioning will be contributing factors as to whether the projected price levels will be attained.\nParticipation in the Ozak AI presale and funding progression milestones will be used to gauge the level of market confidence as it goes on. Whether the AI-driven token will realize its price potential will depend on its ability to deliver on its high price target and the technological promises that it makes, as well as its continuing financial interest to investors in a now more volatile world of digital assets.\nFor more details, visit:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

While the market remains active, global tensions have tempered enthusiasm, causing BTC to slip within a tight trading range. Yet beneath the short-term caution, technical indicators suggest room for further upside, provided resistance levels are broken.\nThis article examines Bitcoin’s current outlook, the broader crypto landscape, and how Outset PR equips projects to navigate volatile cycles with clear, data-driven communication strategies.\nBitcoin Holds Steady: Potential Growth on the Horizon\nSource: tradingview\nBitcoin currently sits in the low six-figures, with a price range between $115,025 and $121,853. Despite a slight dip last month, Bitcoin has shown significant growth over six months, surging over 20%. If the momentum continues, Bitcoin could break past its nearest resistance level of $126,206, potentially reaching the second resistance at approximately $133,033. This would mean an increase of more than 8% from its current range.

However, in 2025, a shift is taking place. Veteran traders, often the earliest to spot changing market winds, are now moving part of their portfolios into Coldware (COLD)—a SocialFi and Web3 hardware project that some analysts believe could deliver an 11,000% surge from its presale entry levels. While Binance Coin (BNB) still holds weight in large-cap portfolios, its pace of growth has slowed compared to emerging tokens like Coldware (COLD).\nColdware (COLD) – The New High-Growth Contender\nColdware (COLD) blends blockchain with consumer tech in a way few projects have attempted. Each Coldware device ships with a native blockchain layer, enabling tokenized social engagement, creator monetization, and decentralized governance without third-party intermediaries. The hardware acts as an instant onboarding mechanism, meaning new users don’t have to navigate complex wallet setups to start earning and interacting. With its early-stage market cap and direct user acquisition pipeline, Coldware offers a far higher growth multiple potential than Binance Coin (BNB).\nWhy Binance Coin (BNB) Is Losing Momentum\nBNB’s maturity is both its strength and weakness. As one of the largest utility tokens in the market, it has deep liquidity, widespread adoption, and strong fundamentals. But this maturity means it is less likely to see exponential percentage gains. Exchange volumes have been uneven in 2025, and regulatory pressures in key markets have dampened speculative activity. For traders who once relied on BNB for triple-digit returns, the current environment is prompting a search for high-upside alternatives—enter Coldware (COLD).\nThe Veteran Trader’s Perspective\nVeteran traders know that outsized returns come from entering strong narratives early. For many, Binance Coin (BNB) has shifted into a “capital preservation” role, while Coldware (COLD) represents a fresh, aggressive growth opportunity. The 11,000% surge projection comes from a combination of low initial supply, hardware-linked token demand, and a monetization model that rewards both early adopters and active users. This asymmetric upside is the kind of setup seasoned investors look for in a bull cycle.\nWhy The Shift Matters for Portfolio Strategy\nIn crypto, timing is everything. Traders who diversified away from mature assets like Binance Coin (BNB) in previous cycles often outperformed by catching early-stage momentum plays. Coldware (COLD) offers that rare combination of a compelling narrative, tangible adoption drivers, and tokenomics designed to reward long-term holding. The market is increasingly valuing projects that can capture users directly, without relying solely on developer adoption or exchange volume.\nConclusion\nBinance Coin (BNB) remains a pillar of the exchange-token sector, but for traders seeking explosive upside, Coldware (COLD) is stealing the show. With a projected 11,000% potential gain, hardware-integrated onboarding, and a SocialFi-driven economy, Coldware is emerging as the go-to high-growth play for 2025. OKB and Chainlink (LINK) provide additional diversification, but in the eyes of veteran traders, the real action—and the real opportunity—is with Coldware.\nFor more information on the Coldware (COLD) Presale:\nVisit Coldware (COLD)\nJoin and become a community member:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

While Stellar (XLM) and Cardano (ADA) are targeting the psychologically significant $1 milestone, Coldware’s ambition isn’t simply to follow the market — it’s to create its own adoption curve through a fusion of blockchain, hardware, and SocialFi integration.\nColdware (COLD): Hardware Meets SocialFi\nUnlike most blockchain projects that rely solely on software ecosystems, Coldware (COLD) is building its own line of blockchain-native mobile devices. These devices feature integrated wallets, dApp marketplaces, and a SocialFi layer that rewards user engagement directly in COLD tokens. That means posting content, joining DAOs, or participating in creator economies all happens natively without third-party gatekeepers. This closed-loop hardware-plus-token model could give Coldware a defensible moat that other Layer-1 competitors can’t easily replicate.\nStellar (XLM): Cross-Border Payments at a Tipping Point\nStellar has long been positioned as a leader in low-cost, cross-border transactions. With adoption growing in remittance-heavy regions and increasing partnerships with payment service providers, XLM is building momentum toward $1. Its low fees and speed are attracting fintech integrations, particularly in emerging markets where stablecoin usage is surging. The challenge for Stellar remains scaling user acquisition beyond institutional payment corridors into retail-friendly applications — something Coldware (COLD) could accelerate through its own hardware channels.\nCardano (ADA): ETF Speculation and Whale Confidence\nCardano is seeing renewed bullish energy, with whales holding over 15 billion ADA unmoved for a year and ETF filings in Delaware boosting sentiment. Price action between $0.90 and $1.00 is setting up for a potential run toward $2 if momentum holds. Hydra scaling upgrades and the Midnight privacy layer are expanding Cardano’s use cases in DeFi and regulated environments. However, while Cardano focuses on software ecosystem maturity, Coldware’s hardware-led approach could give it an onboarding advantage with less friction for new users.\nWhy Coldware’s Growth Could Outpace\nThe difference lies in velocity. Stellar and Cardano (ADA) are established players with strong fundamentals but slower, more methodical adoption curves. Coldware, starting from a low presale base, can leverage exponential network effects if its mobile devices gain traction quickly. Hardware distribution acts as an instant distribution channel for the blockchain itself, pushing transaction volume, SocialFi engagement, and token demand from day one.\nConclusion\nStellar (XLM) and Cardano (ADA) are both positioned for solid growth toward $1 and beyond, supported by institutional interest and strong fundamentals. But Coldware (COLD) offers an entirely different growth story — one built on merging physical hardware with native blockchain engagement. For early adopters, that combination could deliver gains far beyond what established large-caps can offer in the same timeframe.\nFor more information on the Coldware (COLD) Presale:\nVisit Coldware (COLD)\nJoin and become a community member:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Some are building momentum quietly, others are already in motion.\nOzak AI is already turning heads with its presale, pulling in over $1.8 million. The rest of the list has its own catalysts, from big partnerships to network upgrades.\nOzak AI and the $0.005 Ethereum AI Project\nThe Ethereum AI project Ozak AI is making waves before it even lists. Sitting at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence, it’s not just chasing trends. The fourth presale stage is already underway, selling over 129 million tokens and pulling in more than $1.8 million at $0.005 each.\nBuilt on a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network, Ozak AI offers real-time, secure and fail-free data processing. Smart contracts control every transaction, and everything stays unmodified on the blockchain. The token has been listed on Coingecko and CoinMarketCap, with media attention from CryptoDaily, Cryptopolitan and Cointelegraph adding more weight to its credibility.\nLayerZero and ZRO Token Momentum\nThe LayerZero crypto project is giving serious signs of movement. It’s an interoperability protocol connecting blockchains in a way that avoids clunky and risky bridging systems. Its goal? Let DApps talk to each other across networks without friction.\nThe buzz got louder when the LayerZero Foundation announced a $110 million deal to acquire the Stargate protocol. In the 24 hours after the news, ZRO jumped 27 percent and kept rising to 31% for the week. That kind of volume shift doesn’t happen without serious attention from big players.\nAptos Building for a Quiet Comeback\nAPT hasn’t exactly been the life of the party lately, dropping 1.3% in the last month, which mirrors Bitcoin’s calm. But beneath the surface, the Aptos ecosystem is anything but still.\nIts layer 1 blockchain uses the Move programming language for safer, more predictable smart contracts. Developers claim the network can process up to 100,000 transactions per second thanks to a pipelined, modular system. If sentiment flips, APT could be right in the middle of the action.\nXRP Still Holding the Bridge\nXRP remains one of the most recognized names in the payment side of crypto. Acting as a bridge between currencies, it offers fast cross-border transfers at minimal cost.\nHitting $3.18 on August 12 marks a jaw-dropping 54,076% rise since 2013. Political backing for the crypto sector and any moves from the Federal Reserve on interest rates could give XRP a stronger push this month.\nPolkadot’s Quiet but Strong Upgrades\nDOT regained the $4 mark in mid-July, rising 14.97% in just a week. Volume spiked 28% to $434 million, which shows the market isn’t ignoring it.\nThe introduction of Elastic Scaling v1.6.1 now allows parachains to adjust resources for faster transactions. Add the JAM protocol’s cross-chain compatibility and growing staking numbers — 12 million DOT locked — and Polkadot’s developer activity looks alive and well.\nConclusion\nAugust isn’t short on crypto contenders, but this group has a mix of momentum, technical strength and real-world traction. From Ozak AI’s presale surge to Polkadot’s behind-the-scenes upgrades, the table is set for interesting moves in the weeks ahead. Sometimes it’s not about chasing the loudest name, it’s about spotting the ones quietly getting stronger.\nFor More Information about Ozak AI, visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Many generate significant hype, fueled by the promise of astronomical returns, but only a handful survive once they hit exchanges. The rest fizzle out, leaving investors with empty wallets and hard lessons. The issue isn’t presales themselves—it’s that most lack a clear vision for sustainability.\nThey attract early money with buzz but offer little innovation or utility to keep communities engaged. This is why Moonshot MAGAX is drawing attention: it’s entering the market with a presale like many others, but with a roadmap and utility model designed for long-term growth.\nWhat Makes Moonshot MAGAX Different\nMoonshot MAGAX stands out because it isn’t trying to be the next Dogecoin clone. Instead, it’s creating a Meme-to-Earn ecosystem where community members and creators are rewarded for driving cultural engagement.\nBy integrating Loomint AI, MAGAX ensures that rewards are distributed based on actual influence and virality. This adds measurable utility to what has historically been an attention-driven space with no economic framework.\nOn top of this, its DAO governance model puts decision-making in the hands of its community, ensuring MAGAX evolves in ways that align with its users.\nBuilding a Lasting Crypto Meme Coin\nWhere many presales falter is in failing to create sustainable post-launch momentum. Moonshot MAGAX addresses this by anchoring its value to an economic model tied directly to online culture. Memes and viral content are not fleeting—they are recurring, global phenomena that shape markets and narratives.\nBy monetizing these cultural forces, MAGAX positions itself as a token that can thrive beyond its presale phase. The project’s strategy isn’t about one explosive launch; it’s about building a long-term creator economy.\nMoonshot MAGAX: A Realistic Approach to Sustainable Growth\nUnlike many presale tokens that promise overnight gains, Moonshot MAGAX takes a more realistic stance. It positions itself as a high-risk, high-reward investment with actual mechanics that can deliver staying power:\n-\nAI-driven engagement rewards through Loomint AI\n-\nCommunity-led governance via a DAO structure\n-\nCreator-first economy where memes and culture translate to financial value\nThis approach makes it clear that MAGAX isn’t just selling hype—it’s laying the foundation for an economy built on cultural influence.\nWhy MAGAX Appeals to Long-Term Investors\nFor investors who want more than short-term speculation, MAGAX offers a compelling case. It’s not claiming to replace Bitcoin as digital gold or Ethereum as Web3 infrastructure. Instead, it’s creating a new category altogether—a decentralized cultural economy.\nThis gives it an edge in a crowded market. While meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin showed the power of community-driven value, Moonshot MAGAX is taking that concept one step further by embedding utility.\nFrom Presale to Proof\nPresales are always risky, but Moonshot MAGAX has done more than most to establish its credibility. It isn’t built solely on hype but on AI integration, DAO governance, and sustainable utility.\nTo strengthen investor trust further, Moonshot MAGAX has also secured a Certik Audit Certificate, confirming its smart contracts meet recognized security standards. For early participants, this provides reassurance that they’re investing in a project with both innovation and credibility.\nWith its presale bonus (+5% tokens using MAGAX_EARLY) and its long-term roadmap, Moonshot MAGAX is shaping up to be more than just another presale—it could be one of 2025’s true breakout projects.\nBe part of the Moonshot Magax Presale Community:\nWebsite | Whitepaper | Telegram | X (Twitter)\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Among the projects making waves, PepeDollar and LilPepe are emerging as standouts on the crypto presale list.\nBoth tokens combine meme culture with innovative blockchain utility, offering fresh alternatives in an otherwise competitive landscape. With crypto ICO presales gaining traction again, these projects represent how token presales can mix community-driven branding with real technical features.\nAs more investors explore crypto coins on presale, PepeDollar (PEPD) and LilPepe are consistently being discussed among the best crypto presales to buy right now.\nPepedollar Merges Culture and Utility in Token Presales\nPepeDollar (PEPD) is one of the best crypto presales to buy right now because it blends humor-driven branding with a strong technical foundation. Built on Ethereum Layer-2, it ensures faster and cheaper transactions, making it suitable for micro-payments and everyday crypto use cases.\nThe project has also integrated staking opportunities and features meme-themed gaming connections, showing a balance between entertainment and utility. Its viral presence, backed by a satirical parody of a central bank, gives it cultural weight that many crypto presale projects lack.\nIn terms of sustainability, PepeDollar employs a capped supply and burn mechanism to increase scarcity over time. This approach addresses a common criticism of meme coins—unlimited inflation with no long-term value structure.\nWith these combined elements, PepeDollar has become a leading example of how pre sale cryptocurrency projects can evolve into serious contenders in the wider crypto market.\nPepedollar Merges Culture and Utility in Token Presales\nLilPepe has raised over $17.5 million in its ongoing presale, leaving less than 8% of tokens available before reaching its target. At $0.0019 per token, it remains one of the top crypto presales attracting attention in 2025.\nIts value proposition lies in its dedicated Layer-2 blockchain built exclusively for meme coins. By focusing solely on this niche, LilPepe aims to deliver the fastest and most cost-efficient environment for meme coin activity. A CertiK audit score of 95.49% provides added confidence in its smart contract security.\nThe project also ensures 0% tax on transactions, a feature welcomed by traders, and includes sniper-bot protection to secure its launch. Furthermore, confirmed Tier-1 exchange listings are expected upon release, signaling strong confidence in the project’s future.\nLilPepe demonstrates how new crypto token presales can combine innovation, community, and market safeguards to build strong momentum before launch.\nPepedollar Merges Culture and Utility in Token Presales\nMarket analysts are closely watching PepeDollar and LilPepe as examples of presale crypto tokens that have gone beyond hype. Both projects are positioned for Tier-1 listings after their token presales conclude, a milestone that can significantly boost visibility.\nWhile crypto presales often face challenges in delivering long-term value, these two projects stand out due to their infrastructure, cultural branding, and growing community support. Their presence on the crypto presale list highlights a shift in the way investors evaluate new crypto presales—focusing on both utility and narrative strength.\nAs crypto presale projects like PepeDollar and LilPepe gain attention, many see them as among the best crypto presales to buy right now, particularly for those seeking both novelty and structured development in pre-sale cryptocurrency markets.\nPepedollar Merges Culture and Utility in Token Presales\nPepeDollar and LilPepe showcase how presale crypto coins can merge entertainment with practical use cases. By combining scarcity-driven mechanics, blockchain innovation, and strong branding, they represent two of the top crypto presales currently available.\nFor investors exploring the crypto presale 2025 landscape, both projects demonstrate how new token presales can build trust through audits, tokenomics, and transparent launches. At the same time, their cultural appeal keeps communities engaged, which is critical in the evolving world of cryptocurrency presales.\nPepeDollar’s Layer-2 integration and LilPepe’s meme coin-focused chain reflect the variety of approaches within the token presale sector.\nTogether, they illustrate why crypto presales remain an important gateway for those who want to buy presale crypto with long-term growth potential in mind.\nLastly, boost your presale allocation with a 20% bonus by entering the code Pepe_Powell20 at the time of purchase.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

BTC traded above $118,000 on Sunday but lost momentum early on Monday, plunging to an intraday low of $115,179 as selling pressure overwhelmed buyers. The flagship cryptocurrency has made a marginal recovery, moving to $115,528, but remains down by over 2%.\nMeanwhile, Ethereum’s (ETH) decline has been far more dramatic, with the altcoin down nearly 5% over the past 24 hours. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency traded above $4,500 over the weekend before dropping below $4,300 to its current level of $4,261. Ripple (XRP) is down 4.99%, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 4.67%, trading around $0.222. Solana (SOL) has also declined substantially over the past 24 hours, down nearly 6%, trading around $181. Cardano (ADA), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial declines. However, Chainlink (LINK) bucked the bearish trend and is up nearly 2%, trading around $24.50.\nThailand Plans To Launch Crypto Payment Sandbox Aimed At Tourists\nThailand is planning a countrywide regulatory sandbox to allow tourists to convert their crypto into local fiat currency in a bid to boost tourism. The new scheme, called TouristDigiPay, is expected to go live on Monday and will allow tourists to convert their crypto into Thai baht and make electronic payments through local e-money providers. The service is available only for tourists, who must complete Know Your Customer (KYC) checks and open an account with a digital asset business and e-money provider regulated by the Bank of Thailand and its Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe scheme has several safeguards in place, including a monthly spending limit and a block on cash withdrawals. However, full details about the scheme will be released by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira. The scheme aims to revive the country’s tourism industry after a decline in foreign visitors, particularly from China.\nIs Lazarus Behind The $23M Lykke Hack?\nNorth Korea’s notorious Lazarus Group has been blamed for a $22.8 million hack that crippled UK-registered exchange Lykke. The hack resulted in the shutdown of the exchange and triggered a wave of investor lawsuits. The British Treasury’s sanctions office linked the hackers to the hack and theft of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other assets from the platform. The collapse is the latest in a long line of hacks that have netted Pyongyang billions to continue its weapons programs and evade Western sanctions. It also leaves Lykke’s founder, Richard Olsen, facing bankruptcy, liquidation proceedings, and legal scrutiny.\nOlsen is the great-grandson of Swiss banking patriarch Julius Baer and founded Lykke in 2015. The exchange offered crypto trading without transaction fees, before the hack forced it to shut down operations.\nKraken Pauses Monero Deposits Following 51% Attack\nCryptocurrency exchange Kraken has temporarily paused Monero deposits after a 51% attack against the privacy-focused blockchain, compromising the network’s security. A 51% attack occurs when a single mining pool controls over 50% of the network’s hashing power, allowing it to double-spend and reorder transactions on the ledger. Kraken released a statement on Friday,\n\"As a security precaution, we have paused Monero deposits after detecting that a single mining pool has gained more than 50% of the network’s total hashing power. This concentration of mining power poses a potential risk to network integrity.”\nQubic, a Layer-1 AI-focused blockchain and mining pool, claimed to control the majority of Monero’s hashrate, reorganizing six blocks. This prompted denials of the attack from the Monero community. Qubic released a statement claiming responsibility, stating,\n“After a month-long, high-stakes technical confrontation, Qubic reached 51% of Monero's hashrate dominance, successfully reorganizing the blockchain. This event marks a pivotal moment in the crypto industry.”\nThe Qubic community has now voted to target Dogecoin (DOGE) next. Qubic founder Sergey Ivancheglo gave the community several choices, including DOGE, Kaspa, and Zcash. DOGE received 300 votes from the Qubic community by the time voting closed, more than all other choices combined.\n$1M Bitcoin (BTC) Could Be A Sign Of Trouble\nGalaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has said that if Bitcoin (BTC) reaches $1M next year, it could be an indication that the US economy is in trouble. Novogratz stated that he would rather have a lower BTC price in a more stable US, adding that the devaluation of a national currency often comes at the expense of civil society. Novogratz stated on the Coin Stories podcast on Wednesday,\n“People who cheer for the million-dollar Bitcoin price next year, I was like, Guys, it only gets there if we’re in such a shitty place domestically. I’d rather have a lower Bitcoin price in a more stable United States than the opposite. When a national currency falls, investors often seek alternative safe havens to protect their wealth, and Bitcoin is often called digital gold.”\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\nBitcoin (BTC) has started the week in bearish territory, losing momentum and plunging below $118,000. The flagship cryptocurrency dropped to $117,436 on Friday as sellers dominated market sentiment. However, it stabilized over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Saturday and Sunday to settle at $117,488. However, selling pressure returned during the ongoing session, with BTC down almost 2%, trading around $115,227.\nAnalysts believe a correction was due after BTC spent six weeks in price discovery. According to Rekt Capital, BTC is running out of time to make new highs, and risks staying below $124,000 if historical patterns are in place. The analyst noted that BTC is about to start its 7th week of “price discovery uptrend.” The bull market after halving events contains a series of such uptrends, accompanied by a substantial correction.\n“Historically, Bitcoin Price Discovery Uptrend 1 tends to end between Week 6 & 8 of its uptrend. Whereas in Price Discovery Uptrend 2, Bitcoin tends to end its uptrend between Week 5 & 7. Week 7 of Price Discovery Uptrend 2 begins tomorrow.”\nRekt Capital also linked a chart that showed a potential upside for the second uptrend at just $160,000.\n“But if we think critically about previous Price Discovery Corrections across the cycles... Then only one of them started in Week 8 (2017), one of them started in Week 6 (2021), and two of them started in Week 7 (2013 and 2025).”\nMeanwhile, Daan Crypto noted that BTC/USD had not delivered a positive August and September back-to-back.\n“We tend to see a quick flush followed by an explosive Q4 in most of the bull market years. Any larger flushes in the next 1-2 months would be welcomed and could very well be the last larger dip for the Q4 end-of-the-year rally, which we see so often. If not, that's fine too, but I think it would pull forward a bigger high timeframe top as well.”\nHowever, Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg believes BTC may have more than 27% upside left in this cycle before it enters a downtrend.\n“I think there is a greater than 50% chance Bitcoin goes to the 140 to 150 range this year before we see another bear market next year.”\nHe also argued that the Federal Reserve should have cut interest rates at its last two meetings.\nBTC started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 1% and settling at $116,683. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price registered a marginal decline to $116,492. However, it recovered on Sunday, rising 2.42% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,309. BTC reached an intraday high of $122,319 on Monday as bullish sentiment intensified. Despite the positive start, it lost momentum and settled at $118,701, ultimately dropping 0.51%. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.19% to cross $120,000 and settle at $120,113. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to cross $123,000 and settle at $123,365.\nSource: TradingView\nThe flagship cryptocurrency surged to a new all-time high on Thursday, reaching $124,533. However, it lost momentum and plunged below $120,000 to settle at $118,389, ultimately dropping over 4%. Sellers retained control on Friday as the price fell 0.80% to $117,436. BTC stabilized over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Saturday and Sunday to settle at $117,488. However, it is back in the red during the ongoing session, with the price down over 2%, trading around 4114,970.\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\nEthereum (ETH) has faced a substantial jump in selling pressure over the past few sessions. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency was on the verge of crossing $4,800 last week before losing momentum. It fell to a low of $4,379 by Saturday before recovering on Sunday to end the weekend at $4,476. However, ETH is back in the red during the ongoing session, down over 4%, trading around $4,296.\nAnalysts have warned that billions in ETH are waiting to be unstaked, adding to the selling pressure on the asset. ETH holders are lining up to unstake their tokens, with the Ethereum blockchain’s validator exit queue hitting 855,158 ETH on Friday, worth around $3.7 billion. Staking allows ETH holders to lock their tokens and earn rewards. However, the growing queue of soon-to-be unstaked ETH could add to the selling pressure and drive its recent retracement. ETH has declined sharply over the past few days after coming close to setting a new all-time high. Bitwise senior investment strategist Juan Leon stated,\n“Tokens like stETH can trade at a discount. That discount reduces their value as collateral, triggering risk cuts, hedges, or even liquidations that lead to spot ETH selling.”\nETH started the previous week in positive territory, rising 2.52% on Friday to cross $4,000 and settle at $4,010. The price continued pushing higher on Saturday, rising over 6% to cross $4,200 and settle at $4,262. Despite the positive sentiment, ETH registered a marginal decline on Sunday, settling at $4,251. Price action remained subdued on Monday as the price registered another marginal decline. However, it rebounded on Tuesday, rising nearly 9% to cross $4,500 and settle at $4,589. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as ETH rose over 3% to $4,745.\nSource: TradingView\nETH lost momentum on Thursday as selling pressure returned. As a result, it fell 4.11% to $4,551. Sellers retained control on Friday as the price dropped 2.34%, slipping below $4,500 and settling at $4,444. Price action was mixed over the weekend as ETH registered a marginal decline on Saturday before rising 1.13% on Sunday to settle at $4,476. However, ETH is back in the red during the current session, down over 4%, trading around $4,296.\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\nSolana (SOL) failed to establish itself above $200 yet again, as volatility and selling pressure drove prices back towards $180. The altcoin surged to an intraday high of $209 on Thursday, only to lose momentum and drop to $185 by Friday. The price recovered over the weekend but is back in the red during the ongoing session, down over 5%.\nSOL registered a notable increase on Friday (August 8), rising nearly 1% to $176. Buyers retained control over the weekend as the price rose 1.80% on Saturday and 1.52% on Sunday, crossing $180 and settling at $182. Despite the positive sentiment, SOL was back in the red on Monday, dropping over 4% to $174. Bullish sentiment returned on Tuesday as the price rallied, rising nearly 10% to cross $190 and settle at $191. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as SOL rose over 5% to cross $200 and settle at $201.\nSource: TradingView\nSOL faced selling pressure and volatility on Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price fell over 4%, slipping from $200 to $192. Selling pressure persisted on Friday as SOL fell 3.48%, falling below $180 and settling at $185. SOL recovered over the weekend, rising 2.06% on Saturday and 0.73% on Sunday to reclaim $190 and settle at $191. However, it is back in the red during the ongoing session, down over 5%, trading around $180.\nChainlink (LINK) Price Analysis\nChainlink (LINK) started the previous weekend on a bullish note, rising nearly 8% to $19.89. Buyers retained control on Saturday as the price rose over 10% to cross $20 and settle at $21.92. Buyers lost momentum on Sunday, and LINK could only register a marginal increase, settling at $22.05. LINK was back in the red on Monday, dropping over 4% to $21.09. Buyers returned to the market on Tuesday as the price rose almost 12% to cross $23 and settle at $23.59. Positive sentiment persisted on Wednesday as the price rose 1.55% to $23.95.\nSource: TradingView\nDespite the positive sentiment, LINK was back in the red on Thursday, dropping over 6% to $22.47. Selling pressure persisted on Friday as the price fell 3.18% to $21.76. LINK made a strong recovery over the weekend, rising over 4% on Saturday and nearly 13% on Sunday to settle at $25.65. The current session sees LINK down over 4%, trading around $24.55.\nFilecoin (FIL) Price Analysis\nFilecoin (FIL) has seen substantial volatility over the past few sessions. The altcoin has struggled to regain momentum, with sellers back in control during the ongoing session. FIL started the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 3.50% on Saturday.

{"title": "GenAI Platforms Are Quietly Rewriting Eastern Europe’s Crypto Media Playbook, Outset PR Report Finds", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/genai-platforms-are-quietly-rewriting-eastern-europes-crypto-media-playbook-outset-pr-report-finds", "text": "Eastern Europe’s crypto media ecosystem is entering a new phase, and in Q2 2025, the disruption is coming from generative AI platforms. A new media report by Outset PR reveals that tools such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot are now sending traffic to both niche crypto-native and broad generalist media. While these referral volumes remain under 1% of total traffic, their emergence signals a fundamental change in how audiences discover content.\nAmong 114 crypto-native outlets, over 20% received measurable traffic from GenAI platforms in Q2, totaling 135,180 visits – just 0.65% of their combined quarterly visits. Generalist outlets reported nearly 42% adoption, with 566,596 AI-referred visits – 0.06% of their much larger 894.48 million visits.\nThe key takeaway, according to the report, is that AI is already changing referral patterns in ways that could accelerate quickly in coming quarters.\nA Strong Market Rebound, But Not for All Media\nThe rise of AI in news discovery comes against the backdrop of a major crypto market rebound. After a sharp 19% drop in Q1 2025, global crypto assets surged 22% in Q2. Institutional inflows, growing ETF demand, and corporate Bitcoin acquisitions all contributed to this turnaround.\nRegulatory shifts also helped. In the U.S., bank and crypto firm restrictions eased, IRS tax enforcement rules affecting individual investors were rolled back, and the long-debated Market Structure Bill advanced toward establishing a comprehensive framework for digital assets.\nHowever, this bullish sentiment did not translate into growth for most Eastern European crypto outlets. More than 63% of crypto-native publishers lost traffic. The quarter closed with 20.89 million visits, down 18% from April levels.\nGeneralist media — broader platforms with crypto sections — performed only slightly better. Nearly 63% saw traffic declines, slipping by 6% between April and June.\nSource: Outset PR’s crypto media report on Eastern Europe, powered by SimilarWeb\nThese findings echo trends seen in Outset PR’s other recent regional studies. In Q1 2025, their Latin America report showed 73% of outlets losing traffic amid increasing concentration, while the Western Europe report revealed 82% of crypto-native media in decline under MiCA-era conditions – even as generalist sites there remained comparatively resilient.\nIn Eastern Europe, however, the data shows a rare alignment: both crypto-native and generalist outlets are feeling the same downward pull, suggesting broader structural forces are at play.\nConcentration of Reach in a Few Key Outlets\nA defining feature of Eastern Europe’s crypto media is its highly concentrated visibility. Outset PR found that just 17 crypto-native outlets captured 81% of all traffic in Q2.\nSource: Outset PR’s crypto media report on Eastern Europe, powered by SimilarWeb\n-\nTier 1–1.5 outlets with over 500,000 average monthly visits together drew 8.77 million visits (41.98% of the total).\n-\nTier 2 outlets — 100,000K–499,000 average monthly visits — brought in 8.09 million visits (38.73%).\n-\nTier 3 outlets — 10,000–99,000 average monthly visits — reached 3.62 million visits (17.33%).\n-\nThe “long tail” of outlets under 10,000 monthly visits combined for only 410,290 visits (1.96%).\nTraffic is also concentrated geographically. Russia accounted for 42.89% of crypto-native traffic), while Poland followed with 38.76%. Hungary contributed 4.58%, and both the Czech Republic and Slovakia recorded around 4% each.\nThis concentration means that two countries alone account for over 80% of the region’s crypto-native traffic – a dynamic that creates both high exposure potential and high risk for campaigns reliant on a narrow market base. Generalist media showed a similar pattern: Russia led with 49.89% and Poland brought 25.38%.\nTraffic Sources Reveal Why AI Matters\nOutset PR’s breakdown of traffic sources shows why GenAI referrals, even under 1%, could have outsized strategic impact.\nSource: Outset PR’s crypto media report on Eastern Europe, powered by SimilarWeb\nFor crypto-native media:\n-\nDirect traffic: 45.20%\n-\nOrganic search: 42.47%\n-\nReferrals: 6.57%, including AI tools, aggregators, and forums\n-\nSocial media: 5.23%\n-\nPaid: 0.06%\nFor generalist outlets:\n-\nDirect traffic: 43.04%\n-\nOrganic search: 35.97%\n-\nReferrals: 15.66%\n-\nSocial media: 5.12%\n-\nPaid: 0.06%\nGenAI-related traffic falls within the “referral” category. If AI platforms increase their role in discovery, they could displace traditional aggregator traffic, reshaping how crypto news circulates.\nThe behavior of AI-driven referrals differs sharply from that of search engines. Instead of producing ranked results, AI tools deliver summarized answers, sometimes with source links but often without.\nSome publishers participating in Outset PR’s anonymous survey have reported sudden traffic spikes when their articles appear in AI-generated answers on platforms like ChatGPT or Perplexity. Similar effects have been observed from You.com and Microsoft Copilot, but these surges usually last only a few hours.\nOthers are responding by making content more “AI-friendly” using structured data, concise meta descriptions, and clear attributions to improve the chance of being cited.\nRegulatory Complexities Add to Visibility Risks\nEastern European crypto media also face a complicated regulatory environment, with national laws, EU directives, and algorithmic compliance signals intersecting.\nIn Russia, crypto mining is now legal, but strict bans on advertising and gambling-related content remain. The Ministry of Energy has introduced a registry for cryptocurrency mining equipment as part of its gradual opening toward the industry.\nUkraine saw no new crypto laws in 2025 but floated a proposal to allow Bitcoin in the National Bank’s reserves. Hungary and Poland have felt the effects of MiCA and ESMA compliance signals, with some publishers attributing traffic declines to early-2025 Google Core Updates that may reflect increased regulatory weighting.\nIn Romania, outlets adhere closely to EU rules, prioritizing fact-checking, transparent sponsorship labels, and avoiding sensationalist headlines. Yet compliance is no guarantee of visibility.\nStrategic Implications for the Next Phase\nThe data makes one point clear: direct and organic search remain dominant in Eastern European crypto media, accounting for over 87% of crypto-native traffic and 79% for generalist outlets. But AI-driven discovery is emerging as a third pathway that could grow rapidly as user habits evolve.\nFor niche crypto-native outlets, this shift presents a risk. With traffic heavily concentrated among a handful of large players, smaller sites may struggle to maintain relevance without adapting to AI-era discovery.\nFor generalist media, the scale of their total reach provides some insulation, but crypto sections could face similar audience capture by AI platforms, particularly for casual readers seeking quick answers rather than in-depth coverage.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The next price increase will see the token’s value rise to $0.00019863. The project’s regular price increases are part of its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1.\nMeanwhile, the larger memecoin ecosystem faces a threat from the Qubic community, which voted to target Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest and most popular memecoin, after a 51% attack on Monero.\nHusky Inu (HINU) Rises To $0.00019805\nHusky Inu (HINU) registered the latest price jump of its pre-launch phase over the weekend, rising from $0.00019748 to $0.00018905. The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1 and aims to empower the Husky Inu community and continue its fundraising efforts as its launch date draws closer. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion.\nThe project adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, allowing it to raise the HINU token’s value every two days. This has been instrumental in the project’s fundraising efforts, helping it cross key fundraising milestones. It has also helped Husky Inu raise funds while maintaining a favorable price for its fledgling community, rewarding early adopters of the project while promoting transparent growth.\nFundraising Milestone\nHusky Inu (HINU) is also closing in on its latest fundraising milestone. The project has raised $880,154 so far, and is set to reach the $900,000 milestone before the end of the month. Thanks to its dynamic pricing strategy, Husky Inu crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached its latest milestone in record time, crossing $850,000 on July 25.\nIs Qubic A Threat To The Memecoin Ecosystem?\nMeanwhile, the memecoin ecosystem is facing a threat from the Qubic community. Qubic is an AI-focused blockchain responsible for the 51% attack on the Monero privacy network. The community has voted to target Dogecoin (DOGE) next. Qubic founder Sergey Ivancheglo gave the community several targets, including DOGE, Kaspa, Zcash, and any other blockchain named by the community.

In mid-August, ETH smashed resistance levels at $3,400 and $4,200 before hitting $4,868, marking its highest price ever recorded.\nCurrently, Ethereum trades around $4,447, only 8.6% below its peak. The rally has placed it far ahead of its moving averages, showing clear upward momentum. Some traders believe ETH could target $5,000 soon, while others suggest a short pause before the next run.\nThis kind of movement reminds investors why ETH remains a core asset. Its established network, constant upgrades, and high liquidity make it a central player in the ongoing wave of crypto presale projects and Web3 adoption.\nPepe Dollar Presale Crypto Brings Meme Power And Utility\nPepe Dollar (PEPD) is shaping up as one of the top crypto presales this year because it combines meme-driven culture with real-world use cases. Instead of being just another meme coin, PEPD introduces a Layer-2 Web3 payment network built for the growing Pay-Fi sector. This includes potential gaming integrations, meme-based payment rewards, and seamless cross-chain support.\nUnlike early meme coins that relied on hype alone, Pepe Dollar’s design blends humor with structured utility. The ecosystem includes token burns, capped supply, and staking incentives, giving it the backbone that speculative meme tokens lacked.\nBy balancing internet culture with infrastructure, Pepe Dollar is positioned as more than just a joke coin. Investors see it as a new crypto token presale that reflects the evolution of meme assets into functional digital economies.\nPepecoin Shows Hype Without Lasting Value\nPepecoin’s story highlights why not all meme tokens survive. Its entire rise was built on viral hype, without a whitepaper, development team, or genuine utility behind the brand. Social media momentum sent it to a $1.6 billion market cap before collapsing more than 80% from the top.\nToday, Pepecoin trades around $0.00060 with a market cap of just over $59 million. Despite a small rebound of 7% in the last 24 hours, its long-term trajectory shows how quickly pre-sale cryptocurrency projects built only on hype can fade.\nThis contrast between Pepecoin and Pepe Dollar shows the difference between short-term buzz and structured token presales with actual infrastructure.\nWhy PepeDollar Presale Crypto Signals A Shift\nThe rise of Ethereum and Pepe Dollar (PEPD) highlights how the market is rewarding both established networks and creative new presale crypto tokens. Ethereum continues to push boundaries with price momentum and its role in Web3. Pepe Dollar, meanwhile, brings humor, payments, and community into a single token presale framework.\nFor investors exploring the best crypto presale to buy right now, these trends show the importance of looking at both long-term leaders like ETH and innovative presale crypto projects like Pepe Dollar.\nBy combining culture, utility, and engagement, PEPD demonstrates how token presales are evolving beyond pure speculation.\nMore at: https://PepeDollar.io\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Cold Wallet has already secured over $5.8M raised, with tokens priced under a cent and a projected launch target near $0.35, built around a cashback-plus-rewards model that appeals to grassroots adoption. At the same time, Bitcoin Swift is deep into Stage 5 of presale, priced at $5 per token, raising more than $780,000 so far with over 2,650 participants onboard. Together, these projects are giving investors exactly what they want: fast-moving numbers, strong community traction, and the promise of significant upside.\nPresale Strength: Cold Wallet and Bitcoin Swift\nCold Wallet has made a name for itself with its cashback staking model, rewarding users for simply holding and transacting. With a capped supply and more than $5.8M contributed, it’s among the stronger presale performers this year.\nBitcoin Swift, however, offers something distinct: it is already paying participants during presale via its Proof-of-Yield (PoY) programmable staking rewards. Instead of waiting months or years for returns, investors are already receiving payouts at the end of each stage. This practical, reward-now structure is what keeps BTC3’s presale momentum climbing by the day.\nBTC3: A Full Financial Operating System\nBTC3 is not designed as just another coin. It integrates programmable PoY rewards, AI-powered smart contracts, privacy-first decentralized identity, and a hybrid security model of Proof-of-Work plus Proof-of-Stake. Launching on Solana allows it to offer near-free transactions and thousands of transfers per second, before bridging to its own native blockchain in 2026.\nTokenomics Designed for Growth\nThe BTC3 tokenomics are structured to align incentives for early adopters while guaranteeing long-term sustainability:\n-\nTotal Supply: 45,000,000 BTC3\n-\n50% (22.5M) allocated to PoY rewards\n-\n30% (13.5M) allocated to presale\n-\n15% (6.75M) for liquidity pools\n-\n5% (2.25M) reserved for team and reserves\nThis distribution ensures that rewards flow directly to participants while maintaining liquidity and ecosystem development.\nBTC3E: Stablecoin Utility Beyond Speculation\nA major part of BTC3’s ecosystem is BTC3E, a USD-pegged stablecoin collateralized by BTC3. With a collateralization ratio above 150% and secured by AI-powered price oracles, BTC3E ensures a stable value for payments, lending, and daily transactions. This means presale investors aren’t just chasing speculation, they’re funding a project with real-world financial utility built in from the start.\nVerified Security and Compliance\nInvestor trust is further reinforced by multiple third-party checks. BTC3 has passed the Cyberscope Audit, the Solidproof Audit, and the Spywolf Audit. On top of that, the team has completed verified KYC, putting it among the most transparent presales of 2025.\nStage 5 Presale: Hours Left\nBTC3’s Stage 5 presale is nearly closed, and the numbers are undeniable:\n-\nCurrent Price: $5\n-\n$780,000+ raised\n-\nLaunch Price: $15\n-\nStage 5 APY: 96%\n-\nMore than $60,000 already distributed in staking profits\n-\n2,650+ investors onboard\nReferral rewards: 10% bonus for both sender and receiver.\nLimited-time bonus tiers still live:\n-\nTier 1: Invest $100 – $1,999 → 10% Bonus Tokens\n-\nTier 2: Invest $2,000 – $4,999 → 20% Bonus Tokens\n-\nTier 3: Invest $5,000+ → 40% Bonus Tokens\nWith PoY rewards distributed automatically at the end of each presale stage, buyers are already reaping real profits. The presale runs just 64 days in total, ending September 18, 2025, which makes this one of the shortest, fastest-paced opportunities of the year.\nInfluencer Spotlight\nInfluencer reviews are also pushing momentum. Token Galaxy recently highlighted BTC3’s tokenomics and the BTC3E stablecoin as game-changing features that set it apart from other presale projects. Their coverage has helped ignite even more interest across the community, where updates flow daily through BTC3’s official X account.\nInsider Exchange Rumors\nAdding fuel to the fire, reports from inside sources suggest BTC3 is already in contact with MEXC, KuCoin, and LBank about post-presale listings. If confirmed, this could rapidly accelerate demand and early-stage ROI.\nConclusion\nCold Wallet continues to attract grassroots excitement with its cashback-based rewards. But Bitcoin Swift is hitting harder with its tokenomics, BTC3E stablecoin, verified audits, and immediate PoY payouts. With Stage 5 ending in hours, exclusive bonuses live, and whispers of exchange listings ahead, now is the time to act before the window closes.\nFor more information on Bitcoin Swift:\nWebsite: https://bitcoinswift.com\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Why Fortune Favors the Brave", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/should-you-buy-altcoins-now-why-fortune-favors-the-brave", "text": "The altcoin market has been punished over the last few days, with a lot of altcoins suffering retracements of more than 10% since the Bitcoin all-time high was achieved last Thursday. Has this correction come to its end? Would this be a good time to buy?\nBull market in critical phase\nWhen buying anything at this stage of the bull market it must be borne in mind that there are no guarantees that the market will continue to rise. The last bull market that ended in early November of 2021 left many investors and traders trapped at the top as they waited for a blow-off top that never really came.\nThe current bull market is in a critical phase as the bulls still try to break the shackles that will release them into a potentially violent uptrending market. If they don’t break those shackles, could the market be making a top right now?\nIt’s in this kind of situation that fortune favours the brave. If there is a next glorious phase of the bull market to come, buying now could turn into a great move. That said, how many will have the conviction to do so?\nTotal3 chart: Bounce or crash?\nSource: TradingView\nThe Total3 chart (the combined market capitalization of all cryptos, excluding $BTC and $ETH) shows that the altcoins are on the edge of a potential precipice. The bull flag continuation patterns have all led to the price being pushed to its current level, from where it will either bounce, or come crashing down through the mini trendline (faint dotted line).\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicator lines are shaping to cross up. If they do so by the end of the week, this would be a bullish signal for the market.\nBitcoin dominance test of trend break?\nSource: TradingView\nThe Bitcoin dominance chart (BTC.D) always needs to be consulted in order to gain a better perspective on the altcoins and this is showing that dominance has dropped below the ascending trendline that goes all the way back to the end of 2022. The chart would suggest that dominance could be retesting the bottom of the trendline, and that a fall down to 57% could be on the cards. This could provide a major boost to the altcoins.\nA good place to buy Solana ($SOL)?\nSource: TradingView\nFor a safer play, $SOL is one of the major layer one tokens that has come down to support, and could fall through this to perhaps touch and then bounce from the bottom of the triangle. If longing $SOL from either of these two areas a stop loss just below support/trendline would be a good idea.\nThere are plenty of other altcoins that are at, or coming down to some good buy zones. Will fortune favour the brave that buy them, or will they get crushed by the bears again? This market will turn. It just remains to be seen if there is going to be a bit more downside.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It's another major step in Bybit EU's mission to offer capital-efficient trading tools under the unified regulatory framework.\n\"Spot Margin Trading is a powerful tool — but only when paired with transparency, risk education, and user control,\" said Mazurka Zeng, CEO of Bybit EU. \"We're proud to launch a product tailored for Europe's evolving regulatory landscape — one that equips traders to scale their strategies without compromising visibility or compliance.\"\nWhat Is Spot Margin?\nSpot Margin Trading allows users to borrow funds against their existing crypto holdings, using them as collateral to buy or sell more assets than their wallet balance would otherwise allow. For example, a user with €100 can borrow additional funds to execute a €1,000 trade using 10× leverage — amplifying both potential gains and losses from small market movements.\nThis creates significant opportunities — but also greater risks — which is why Bybit EU has implemented several safety mechanisms to protect users.\nTransparent Risk Management: Designed for EU Traders\nBybit EU's Spot Margin service includes built-in safeguards aligned on leverage and investor protection:\n- Liquidation at 100% Maintenance Margin to prevent further losses\n- Real-time interest rates, margin requirements, and collateral ratios, asset by asset\n- Margin trading currently supported under Cross Margin only\n- Leverage awareness prompts to ensure users understand the risks and conditions\n- Client readiness testing to assess knowledge of risk mitigation and liquidation prevention\nThese features ensure that only informed users can access leverage, and that traders understand both the benefits and potential downsides of margin exposure.\nUnified EU Trading, Now with Spot Margin\nEuropean users can now trade Spot Margin assets from a single, unified trading account, enabling more efficient capital deployment and real-time risk tracking. Popular pairs like BTC/USDC, ETH/USDC, and others are already available with Spot Margin functionality.\nThis launch reinforces Bybit's EU position as one of the most trusted and forward-looking exchanges in Europe, following its recent MiCAR-compliant expansion. Spot Margin Trading is the foundation for a broader rollout of capital-efficient products tailored to Europe's sophisticated crypto traders.\nAbout Bybit EU\nBybit EU GmbH is the newly established European entity, dedicated to serving clients across the European Economic Area (EEA\"*\" except Malta) via the Bybit.eu platform.

Recent market data shows that both institutional and retail investors are increasingly focused on Ethereum, while also exploring crypto presale opportunities.\nThese presale crypto tokens are reshaping early-stage investing, giving people access to new projects before public launches.\nFrom top crypto presales to innovative pre-sale cryptocurrency launches, this trend is now an important part of Web3 adoption. PepeDollar (PEPD) is one such project gaining traction in the crypto presale list, making some analysts view it as one of the best crypto presales to buy right now.\nEthereum ETFs Unlock Institutional Opportunities\nEthereum-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are experiencing a massive surge, with nearly US$3 billion in net inflows recorded in a single week. By comparison, Bitcoin ETFs attracted only US$562 million during the same period, underscoring Ethereum’s appeal.\nTreasury firms have also ramped up exposure, moving from US$600 million to US$11 billion in ETH holdings in just six weeks. This trend signals growing institutional confidence and the rising importance of Ethereum in the global market.\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of in-kind creations and redemptions for Ethereum ETFs has further boosted momentum. The change reduces operational costs and improves efficiency, making ETH funds more attractive to large investors.\nAnalysts highlight this shift as one of the biggest catalysts for long-term demand, showing how Ethereum remains central in discussions about wealth-building opportunities.\nPepeDollar Presale Brings Pay-Fi to Ethereum Layer-2\nPepeDollar enters the spotlight as one of the top crypto presales of 2025, building directly on Ethereum’s Layer-2 infrastructure. Its focus is the PepeDollar Payment Protocol, designed to bridge DeFi and real-world payments, creating what the team calls the Pay-Fi economy. This integration of blockchain into daily use cases sets it apart from typical token presales.\nThe new crypto token presale for PepeDollar is live, with Stage 2 pricing set at $0.006495 per PEPD. The token will launch at $0.03695, making the pre-sale cryptocurrency stage a crucial entry point. The total supply is capped at 3.695 billion tokens, with 45% allocated to the presale.\nSo far, the presale has raised over $1.4 million, with investors able to buy presale crypto using ETH, BNB, and several ERC-20 coins like USDT, USDC, SHIB, and AAVE. A 20% instant bonus is available for early buyers with a presale code, adding further incentive.\nBy aligning with Ethereum’s ecosystem, PepeDollar highlights how presale crypto coins can expand into mainstream adoption. With its listing scheduled across CEXs and DEXs later in the year, along with staking opportunities, PEPD demonstrates how token presales are evolving into functional projects within Web3.\nEthereum Strength and PepeDollar Presale Tokens\nThe rise of Ethereum ETFs shows how deeply institutional demand is shaping the cryptocurrency space. With billions in inflows, ETH has reinforced its position as a cornerstone asset for investors. Its ecosystem continues to unlock value and pave the way for broader Web3 participation.\nAt the same time, crypto presale projects like PepeDollar (PEPD) reflect how innovation is spreading through early-stage token launches. These presale crypto tokens are no longer just speculative opportunities but represent growing infrastructure within the blockchain economy.\nFor those exploring the best crypto presale to buy right now, Ethereum remains the foundation, while new token presales like PepeDollar showcase how emerging assets can complement established networks.\nTogether, they highlight how cryptocurrency presales and established platforms are shaping the next growth cycle in digital assets.\nLastly, boost your presale allocation with a 20% bonus by entering the code Pepe_Powell20 at the time of purchase.\nMore at: https://PepeDollar.io\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Moonshot MAGAX: Why Long-Term Investors Are Paying Attention in 2025", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/moonshot-magax-why-long-term-investors-are-paying-attention-in-2025", "text": "A Market Shaped by Patient Investors\nThe crypto market in 2025 is no longer just about chasing the next hype-driven surge. With the global market cap stabilizing above $3.9 trillion, investors are becoming more selective, focusing on projects that can survive beyond a single bull cycle. This shift toward sustainability has created space for projects like Moonshot MAGAX, a presale token blending meme culture with practical blockchain utility.\nLong-term investors, in particular, are paying attention. Instead of speculating on short-term pumps, they’re looking for tokens that can build ecosystems, attract communities, and offer real rewards. MAGAX is aligning with that mindset.\nBitcoin and Ethereum: Anchors of Stability\nBitcoin remains the market’s “digital gold,” while Ethereum powers much of the decentralized infrastructure. These tier-one assets are indispensable to the crypto ecosystem and continue to attract institutional adoption.\nBut their very maturity limits upside. While Bitcoin and Ethereum will likely deliver steady returns, they won’t offer the exponential gains that smaller, innovative projects can provide. This is where presales like Moonshot MAGAX stand out.\nMAGAX: The Meme-to-Earn Innovation\nAt its core, Moonshot MAGAX is not just a meme coin—it’s a Meme-to-Earn ecosystem powered by Loomint AI. This model allows users to earn rewards for creating, sharing, and amplifying viral content. By tying cultural influence directly to blockchain economics, MAGAX creates a decentralized content economy where value flows to those who shape online culture.\nThis is a fundamental shift from the typical meme coin narrative. Instead of relying solely on speculative hype, MAGAX builds a system where community activity drives real token utility. For investors who want to bet on both meme culture and blockchain mechanics, this dual appeal is a rare find.\nWhy Long-Term Investors Are Interested\nSeveral factors explain why MAGAX is drawing serious attention:\n-\nLow Entry Point: The presale offers a chance to buy in before MAGAX lists on exchanges, providing the kind of asymmetrical upside early investors look for.\n-\nPractical Utility: Unlike most meme coins, MAGAX integrates AI-powered rewards and governance, giving it a roadmap beyond hype.\n-\nCommunity-First Model: Through DAO governance, users shape the project’s future, reinforcing its long-term resilience.\nFor long-term investors, these features signal a project built to last rather than fade.\nRewarding Early Community Growth\nThe team behind Moonshot MAGAX is focused on building a committed community from the ground up, not just attracting passive holders. They've introduced exclusive reward programs and incentives designed to thank early participants for their trust and commitment.\nThis approach builds a foundation of loyalty and ensures that the project’s success is a shared victory. These early-stage initiatives are crucial for cultivating the kind of engaged user base that can drive long-term value.\nA More Realistic Approach\nUnlike speculative meme tokens that promise overnight riches, Moonshot MAGAX positions itself with a more realistic vision. Its value proposition isn’t built on false guarantees but on measurable engagement and transparent growth.\nThis honesty appeals to the kind of investors who have seen cycles come and go. They know sustainable projects must combine strong communities, innovative models, and transparency—and MAGAX checks all three boxes.\nWhy MAGAX Could Be a Project to Watch\nMeme coins will continue to play a role in the market, but MAGAX represents an evolution: a meme coin with structure, governance, and long-term potential. Investors tired of quick hype cycles may find MAGAX’s steady approach refreshing—and rewarding.\nIts Meme-to-Earn economy could be the bridge between internet culture and blockchain adoption, bringing creators, sharers, and investors together under one tokenized system.\nA Real Project With Real Verification\nThe crypto space is full of presales that make bold claims but lack substance. Moonshot MAGAX is different. By merging meme culture with AI-driven economics and DAO governance, it offers a tangible vision for the future of content economies.\nTo add to its credibility, Moonshot MAGAX has also secured a Certik Audit Certificate, a critical milestone that reassures investors this isn’t just another speculative presale—it’s a project built on transparency and security.\nWith its Limited-Time Drop (+5% bonus tokens using MAGAX_EARLY) and a strong long-term vision, Moonshot MAGAX is already separating itself from the noise. For patient investors looking for the next breakout project, this may be the one to watch in 2025.\nBe part of the Moonshot Magax Presale Community:\nWebsite | Whitepaper | Telegram | X (Twitter)\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The next upward impulse may very soon be on the way.\nLong liquidations crush the bulls\nThe crypto market suffered one of its habitual bloodbaths on Sunday and into Monday, with more than half a billion dollars of value liquidated across the board. More than five times long to short traders were liquidated, showing that the bears were firmly in control.\nThe new week has opened with the bulls attempting to stop the rot. Will there be another sharp flush down to the area of $112,000, or is the next upward impulse about to kick in?\nIs a reversal back to the upside on the way?\nSource: TradingView\nNot long after making an all-time high, the $BTC price plunged back down to the top of the bull flag, and has now dropped back inside. The bears are probably congratulating themselves on an important victory, but the short-term chart is suggesting that a reversal back to the upside could be on the way.\nThe price action is currently sitting on some horizontal support, while only just above, the $115,800 level has recently become resistance.

When looking left at the history of the RSI for the 4-hour time frame it can be seen that the price will normally bounce from this position.\nOf course, there is always the chance of a further slip to the downside, but the evidence is that $BTC is becoming oversold, and so there is more likelihood of an upside move from here.\nA correction to the 0.786 Fibonacci level?\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily chart for the $BTC price reveals how the price touched the $115,000 support level. Just below this is the 0.786, the deepest of the Fibonacci levels for the whole of this bull flag move. Coming back to this level is certainly a possibility.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) looks as though the descending trendline could get a perfect retest from the indicator line. This would likely be followed by a bounce back to the upside, which would probably be reflected by positivity in the price action above.\nInverse head and shoulders pattern still valid\nSource: TradingView\nZooming out a lot further in the same daily time frame, the inverse head and shoulders pattern is still a valid formation. A test of the neckline took place when the $BTC price fell through the bottom of its bull flag, and it could be that a retest might take place in this current retracement.\nIt can also be seen that even though this dip is coming down deeply, it still has a way to go to make a lower low and start a mini downtrend. If this did happen, it could of course negate the inverse head and shoulders. As it stands, this is not the expected course of action but the market does have a perverse way of going against expectations.\n$117,000 becomes make-or-break level\nSource: TradingView\nFinally, right out in the macro view of the 2-week time frame, there are concerns for the bulls. Yet another 2-week candle body closed beneath the $117,000 resistance level. Also, another longish candle wick to the upside bears testimony to the power of the bears at what is becoming a make-or-break level.\nThe ascending trendline, which marks the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, is squeezing the price into a tighter and narrower space, meaning that an explosion could come in one direction or the other.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are shaping to cross back down to the downside. This must be avoided by the bulls at all cost. The next two weeks will be vitally important.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Flipster Unveils the First Zero-Spread Model in Crypto Perpetuals Trading", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/flipster-unveils-the-first-zero-spread-model-in-crypto-perpetuals-trading", "text": "Eliminates the hidden price gap costing traders more than they realize\nPANAMA CITY, Aug. 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Flipster, a fast-growing crypto perpetuals trading platform, has unveiled the industry's first true zero-spread trading model, making it the first crypto exchange to eliminate the hidden price gap, known as the spread, that quietly drains trader profits.\nWith this structural shift, Flipster becomes the first exchange to offer one price execution with no markup on major perpetual pairs — delivering a new level of pricing transparency on perpetual trading that no other crypto exchange has offered.\nHidden Costs Most Traders Miss\nMost exchanges charge a visible trading fee on every order. But what many traders don't realize is that these posted fees are just part of the real cost. The bigger and often overlooked cost is the spread: the hidden gap between the price to go long and the price to go short.\nWhen traders open a position, they cross that gap. When they close it, they cross it again. This creates a built-in round-trip cost that isn't displayed upfront, yet quietly chips away at returns on every trade.\nIt adds up fast, especially for active, high-frequency or high-volume traders. In many cases, the spread can cost more than the trading fee itself.\nFor example, a trader placing a $100,000 trade may pay a visible fee of $50 at a 5 basis point rate. But if there's also a 2 basis point spread, that's another $40 in hidden cost just from entering and exiting the position. Add slippage, and the total cost can easily end up being two to three times higher than the posted fee.\nFlipster eliminates this invisible markup by offering zero spreads on major pairs, fundamentally redefining how liquidity and execution are structured. It means quoting a single unified price rather than a split bid/ask, something most exchanges simply are not built to do.\nSecurity That Matches Performance\nFlipster is built with the same high-grade protection used by leading global financial institutions. The platform is ISO 27001 certified, adheres to internationally recognized security standards, and deploys multi-layer safeguards to protect user assets. Wallet security is reinforced with technology that removes single points of failure, while its 24/7 monitoring systems detect and neutralize threats in real time. With security embedded in every layer, Flipster ensures that assets remain protected through all market conditions.\nThe Only Exchange with Zero Spread and Active Yield\nWhat you see is what you trade.\nZero spread on 20+ Major Perpetual Pairs. Traders access one unified market price. No markup. No hidden slippage.\nEarn while you trade.\nLocked or flexible, capital works without interruption. Flipster is the only exchange that lets traders earn and trade at the same time.\nSee what trading without compromise feels like. Try it yourself at flipster.io\nAbout Flipster\nFlipster is the zero-friction exchange for crypto traders who demand the ultimate perpetual trading experience. With ultra-tight spreads, balances that earn while trading, and up to 100x leverage, it delivers precision and performance for those who move fast and trade faster. In 2024 alone, Flipster's trading volume grew 856% year-on-year, solidifying its position as one of the fastest-growing crypto perpetuals trading platforms.

These movements signal potential shifts across the broader digital asset landscape. In this article, we analyze the latest technical and fundamental factors shaping BTC, ETH, and SOL — while also exploring how Outset PR helps crypto projects capture market attention and stand out during these critical cycles.\nBitcoin's Bright Future: The Bull Run Is Just Getting Started\nSource: tradingview\nBitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, is like digital gold. It has a fixed supply, which makes it rare and valuable. Despite recent drops, Bitcoin often jumps back even stronger, just like it did in 2021. Its blockchain technology allows fast and secure transactions without needing a middleman. This makes Bitcoin important in a world moving towards digital everything. Right now, many experts see patterns similar to past bull runs. This could mean big growth is coming. Bitcoin remains at the heart of the crypto world and looks promising even as the market wobbles.\nEthereum: The Driving Force for the Next Big Crypto Surge\nSource: tradingview\nEthereum, known as ETH, is a major player in the cryptocurrency world. It's not just digital money; it powers smart contracts and decentralized apps. These features make it stand out, allowing developers to create tech alternatives to real-world systems. Even with recent market dips, Ethereum's network usage and advancements suggest potential growth. With the upcoming technology updates, ETH could lead the next market upswing. Many enthusiasts see these patterns echoing past trends, hinting at another altcoin season. So yes, ETH does look attractive in this market cycle as it continues to innovate and grow its use case.\nSOL: The Bright Star in the Next Altcoin Season\nSource: tradingview\nSOL is the cryptocurrency powering Solana, a fast and efficient blockchain. Known for its speedy transactions and low fees, Solana stands out in the crypto space. It's designed for widespread use, from everyday payments to complex smart contracts. Despite recent market drops, the SOL coin shines bright with its strong technology and growing developer community. Solana’s ability to handle thousands of transactions per second makes it a top contender for future growth. This scalability could lead to broader adoption, making SOL an attractive option as the market gears up for the next bull run.\nPR with C-Level Clarity: Outset PR’s Proprietary Techniques Deliver Tangible Results\nIf PR has ever felt like trying to navigate a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data. It builds strategies based on both retrospective and real-time metrics, which helps to obtain results with a long-lasting effect.\nOutset PR replaces vague promises with concrete plans tied to perfect publication timing, narratives that emphasize the product-market fit, and performance-based media selection. Clients gain a forward-looking perspective: how their story will unfold, where it will land, and what impact it may create.\nWhile most crypto PR agencies rely on standardized packages and mass-blast outreach, Outset PR takes a tailored approach. Each campaign is calibrated to match the client’s specific goals, budget, and growth stage. This is PR with a personal touch, where strategy feels handcrafted and every client gets a solution that fits.\nOutset PR’s secret weapon is its exclusive traffic acquisition tech and internal media analytics.\nProprietary Tech That Powers Performance\nOne of Outset PR’s most impactful tools is its in-house user acquisition system. It fuses organic editorial placements with SEO and lead-generation tactics, enabling clients to appear in high-discovery surfaces and drive multiples more traffic than through conventional PR alone.\n|\nCase in point: Crypto exchange ChangeNOW experienced a sustained 40% boost in reach after Outset PR amplified a well-polished organic coverage with a massive Google Discover campaign, powered by its proprietary content distribution engine. |\nDrive More Traffic with Outset PR’s In-house Tech\nOutset PR Notices Media Trends Ahead of the Crowd\nOutset PR obtains unique knowledge through its in-house analytical desk which gives it a competitive edge. The team regularly provides valuable insights into the performance of crypto media outlets based on the criteria like:\n-\ndomain activity\n-\nmonth-on-month visibility shifts\n-\naudience geography\n-\nsource of traffic\nBy consistently publishing analytical reports, identifying performance trends, and raising the standards of media targeting across the industry, Outset PR unlocks a previously untapped niche in crypto PR, which poses it as a trendsetter in this field.\n|\nCase in point: The careful selection of media outlets has helped Outset PR increase user engagement for Step App in the US and UK markets. |\nOutset PR Engineers Visibility That Fits the Market\nOne of the biggest pain points in Web3 PR is the disconnect between effort and outcome: generic messaging, no product-market alignment, and media hits that generate visibility but leave business impact undefined. Outset PR addresses this by offering customized solutions. Every campaign begins with a thorough research and follows a clearly mapped path from spend to the result. It's data-backed and insight-driven with just the right level of boutique care.\nConclusion\nBitcoin’s institutional tailwind, Ethereum’s technological momentum, and Solana’s scalability make them key assets to watch as the market gears up for its next phase. Whether it’s BTC eyeing long-term growth, ETH fueling altcoin season, or SOL breaking into higher adoption, timing will play a pivotal role.\nOutset PR ensures projects don’t just ride these waves but actively shape their narratives, leveraging data-driven PR and proprietary traffic acquisition tools to secure visibility where it matters most.\nYou can find more information about Outset PR here:\nWebsite: outsetpr.io\nTelegram: t.me/outsetpr\nX: x.com/OutsetPR\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Tangible outcomes also matter. Whether it’s brand visibility, investor attention, or global media coverage, crypto teams need agencies that can actually deliver. This review highlights five blockchain PR agencies with proven records of securing tangible, results-driven campaigns in 2025.\nWhy Tangible Results Matter in Crypto PR\nUnlike traditional industries, blockchain projects live or die by community trust and visibility. A successful PR campaign isn’t just about seeing your name in the news. It’s about:\n-\nMedia placement quality (tier-one crypto & mainstream outlets)\n-\nSEO impact (backlinks, referral traffic, Google Discover features)\n-\nInfluencer/KOL amplification (driving real conversions)\nThe following agencies have shown they can deliver on these fronts, not just make promises.\n1. Outset PR — Data-Driven PR Campaigns with Value-based Communication\nOutset PR takes a different approach from the traditional “spray-and-pray” model of crypto publicity. Instead of chasing vanity metrics, they emphasize clear results, transparency, and reputation-first storytelling. Their team blends media relations expertise with data analytics, ensuring campaigns are not only widely seen but also hit objectives.\nWhat sets Outset PR apart is their boutique-style attention—clients work closely with senior strategists who understand both blockchain technology and the importance of brand trust in volatile markets. They are also known for editorial rigor, ensuring that messaging is crisp, accurate, and accessible even to non-technical audiences. This helps web3 companies break out of the “echo chamber” and reach investors, partners, and mainstream users.\nStrengths: Performance-driven campaigns, advanced analytics, and values-based communication.\nServices: Media outreach, thought leadership placement, SEO optimization, Google Discover strategies, and full-spectrum PR for Web3 and AI companies.\nSpecialization: Blockchain, DeFi, AI-driven platforms, and startups preparing for listings, partnerships, or fundraising rounds.\nBest For: Founders who want tangible proof of PR impact without compromising credibility.\n2.

MarketAcross — Enterprise-Grade Scale\nMarketAcross is known for enterprise-level PR execution. They’ve worked with Binance, Avalanche, KuCoin, and Crypto.com, offering global coverage with speed.\n-\nStrengths: Large-scale, case-studied campaigns; strong VC-backed project experience.\n-\nBest For: Late-stage projects needing broad, consistent coverage across regions.\n4. Crowdcreate — Investor & KOL Driven\nCrowdcreate shines by blending PR with investor outreach and influencer engagement. With access to one of the largest KOL and investor databases in crypto, they help teams that want capital traction alongside media buzz.\n-\nStrengths: Investor-centric campaigns plus 800+ influencers in Web3 niches.\n-\nBest For: Projects preparing for funding rounds, token launches, or major announcements.\n5. FINPR — Guaranteed Wide Coverage\nFor teams that need fast and assured exposure, FINPR offers guaranteed placements in 300+ outlets. While less tailored than boutique firms, it provides immediate visibility across crypto and mainstream publications.\n-\nStrengths: Speed and guaranteed media presence.\n-\nBest For: Token presales, NFT drops, or quick-hit campaigns that demand scale.\nTop 5 Blockchain PR Agencies for Tangible Results\n|\nAgency |\nKey Strength |\nBest Fit For |\n|\nCoinbound |\nMedia + influencer firepower |\nExchanges, NFT/gaming platforms |\n|\nOutset PR |\nMeasurable, ROI-focused PR |\nWeb3 startups needing clear outcomes |\n|\nMarketAcross |\nEnterprise-level campaigns |\nLate-stage/VC-backed projects |\n|\nCrowdcreate |\nInvestor + KOL outreach |\nTeams seeking traction & funding |\n|\nFINPR |\nGuaranteed broad coverage |\nPresales, NFT projects, fast exposure |\nHow to Choose the Right Agency\nWhen selecting a blockchain PR partner, focus on your milestone:\n-\nVerifiable growth? → Outset PR.\n-\nRaising a round? → Crowdcreate.\n-\nBroad global presence? → MarketAcross or Coinbound.\n-\nFast baseline coverage? → FINPR.\nAlways ask for case studies, measurable goals, and named outlets before committing.

{"title": "Coldware Set to Surge 11,000%, can BlockchainFX and BlockDag Mirror COLD's Success", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/coldware-set-to-surge-11000-can-blockchainfx-and-blockdag-mirror-colds-success", "text": "Coldware (COLD) has rapidly emerged as one of the most ambitious projects in the crypto presale landscape, with projections hinting at a potential 11,000% surge post-launch. Unlike purely speculative plays, Coldware is building an entire Web3 hardware and security ecosystem, integrating decentralized mobile devices, encrypted communication channels, and blockchain-based data storage. This real-world utility is setting it apart from most presale tokens — and the market is paying attention. The question now is whether other strong contenders like BlockchainFX (BFX) and BlockDag (BDAG) can follow Coldware’s trajectory.\nColdware’s Utility-Driven Growth Model\nAt the heart of Coldware’s 11,000% projection is its commitment to solving real problems in the blockchain space. COLD is not just another digital token — it’s the backbone of a decentralized mobile infrastructure, allowing users to interact with blockchain networks securely from purpose-built devices. By controlling both the hardware and the dApp ecosystem, Coldware can guarantee a level of privacy, stability, and security that centralized platforms cannot match.\nThe presale momentum has been fueled by a mix of retail buyers, tech enthusiasts, and institutional crypto investors seeking utility-first projects. Early participants see the combination of hardware sales, in-device token staking, and community governance as a powerful value driver that could keep Coldware (COLD) relevant long after launch hype fades.\nBlockchainFX Brings Multi-Asset Expansion\nBlockchainFX (BFX), while different in approach, is also drawing investor attention. With $5.08M already raised from 4,323 participants, BFX is nearing its $5.5M softcap. The project plans to integrate over 500 assets — including cryptocurrencies, stocks, ETFs, and commodities — into a single platform with daily staking rewards and up to 70% of trading fees redistributed to users.\nWhere Coldware focuses on secure access and Web3 communication, BlockchainFX offers an all-in-one financial trading hub. This gives it significant potential for adoption, especially among investors seeking both active and passive returns. The question remains whether BFX’s appeal will sustain post-launch in the same way Coldware’s hardware-backed model is expected to.\nBlockDag’s Record-Breaking Presale Momentum\nIf there’s one project that can rival Coldware’s fundraising power, it’s BlockDag (BDAG). With $374M raised and 25.1 billion coins sold, BDAG has already delivered early-stage returns of 2,660% for Batch 1 investors. The project aims for a $600M presale total, and with over 200,000 holders, it’s proving that large-scale community building is possible before launch.\nBlockDag’s appeal lies in its high-throughput Layer-1 blockchain designed for Web3 project deployment. More than 4,500 developers are already working on over 300 projects within its ecosystem, supported by an active mining community of 2.5 million users. If the near-term $1 price projection is met, current buyers could be looking at more than 3,500% ROI. While that’s impressive, it’s still below the aggressive upside some analysts expect for Coldware.\nCan BFX and BDAG Match COLD’s 11,000%?\nThe main difference between Coldware (COLD) and its two competitors is diversification of value drivers. Coldware’s model is not solely dependent on token price action — hardware sales, device staking, and exclusive ecosystem access provide recurring revenue streams. BlockchainFX relies heavily on user adoption of its trading platform, while BlockDag’s growth depends on developer engagement and network usage after launch.\nThat doesn’t mean they can’t achieve similar returns — but matching Coldware’s projected 11,000% gain will require sustained adoption, not just presale hype. BFX’s financial incentives and BDAG’s developer network give them solid footing, but COLD’s integration of physical products into the blockchain economy gives it a unique, defensible moat.\nInvestor Outlook: The Triple Play Strategy\nSavvy investors looking to diversify are spreading their bets across all three. Coldware (COLD) offers the highest utility and security proposition, BlockchainFX (BFX) brings a revenue-sharing trading platform, and BlockDag provides a high-speed, developer-rich blockchain. Together, they create a balanced portfolio for those aiming to capture the next wave of major altcoin growth in 2025.\nIf Coldware can deliver on its roadmap and reach the ambitious 11,000% gain some analysts are predicting, it could set a new standard for how presales are evaluated — not just on hype and community size, but on tangible, multi-layered utility.\nFor more information on the Coldware (COLD) Presale:\nVisit Coldware (COLD)\nJoin and become a community member:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Top 3 Coins to Buy That Could Be as Rewarding as Ethereum (ETH) is in Its Prime", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/top-3-coins-to-buy-that-could-be-as-rewarding-as-ethereum-eth-is-in-its-prime", "text": "Ethereum’s early supporters pocketed generational wealth when the asset shot from the hundreds into the thousands. Though ETH’s market cap now captures too much liquidity for that sort of leap to recur, smaller projects with strong fundamentals and the right catalysts can still deliver outsized returns. Below are three tokens attracting serious market attention right now, each poised, in its way, to capture a slice of Ethereum-style growth.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Chain That’s Crossing Into Mainstream Crypto\nLittle Pepe has stepped out of the crowded meme-coin scene with a presale trajectory catching serious investor eyes. Now in its later presale stages and priced under $0.0030, LILPEPE has already raised over $18.123 million, with more than 12.117 billion tokens sold, and that’s before its first centralized exchange listing. Unlike the typical hype-only meme coin, LILPEPE runs on an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 built specifically for meme token ecosystems.\nIts feature set reads like a trader’s wish list: 0% buy/sell tax, sniper-bot protection for fairer launches, and “Pepe’s Pump Pad,” a vetted launchpad where new meme tokens can deploy with liquidity locks and anti-rug safeguards. This combination means LILPEPE isn’t just riding viral buzz; it’s creating infrastructure that other tokens will have to use, generating built-in demand.\nCommunity momentum is also surging thanks to a headline-grabbing $777,000 giveaway, where 10 winners will receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. Analysts tracking presale velocity say a jump toward $0.10 within its first major cycle isn’t unrealistic if exchange listings and network adoption line up. For traders hunting the next “early ETH-style” entry, LILPEPE is shaping up as a speculative, but calculated, swing for the fences.\nSui (SUI): Layer-1 Blockchain with Strong Volume Growth and ETF Buzz\nSui is a Layer-1 blockchain with strong volume growth and ETF buzz. SUI trades around $4.20 as of writing, up about 5.8% over the past week. Its market cap is roughly $14.6 billion, with daily trading volumes surging into the billions. On the chart, SUI has pushed through the upper trendline of a descending wedge, classic bullish behavior. The RSI is at 64, which suggests it still has breathing space before needing a pullback with its nearby resistance at the latest swing peak of $4.75, followed by this year’s high of $5.52. Solid support, meanwhile, sits at the $3.50 handle.\nThe significant catalyst is that Canary Capital has filed for an Sui-based ETF, adding to institutional interest. If regulators approve, that could catapult SUI above $5. In the near term, SUI will also benefit from active development (recent token burns and partnerships) and adoption in Asia. Sui’s chart shows bullish setups, and its fundamentals (growing DEX volume, ETF pipelines) are lining up, making it a strong mid-cap contender for further gains.\nLitecoin (LTC): Quietly Positioning for a Rally\nLitecoin is quietly positioning for a rally. LTC sits near $114 and has already recovered from a dip to $105 support earlier in the week. Volumes spiked +30% recently, suggesting new buying interest. On the charts, LTC shows a bullish MACD crossover and widening Bollinger Bands, classic signs of an impending breakout. Resistance is seen at ~$124–$125, above which it could jump toward $131 (the next Fib level).\nSignificantly, institutional interest in LTC is growing: a $100 million allocation by a biotech fund (MEI Pharma) was announced, backing LTC’s long-term case. Litecon’s catalysts include speculation about potential ETF approvals and its upcoming block reward halving (projected mid-2026). Fundamentally, Litecoin still enjoys its “silver to Bitcoin’s gold” narrative and robust infrastructure. LTC’s technical turn and fresh institutional flows suggest it may outperform in the next leg up, especially if broader crypto rallies continue.\nConclusion\nFrom Sui’s ETF momentum and active development, to Litecoin’s strengthening technicals and institutional flows, to Little Pepe’s mix of meme appeal and genuine Layer-2 utility, these three projects offer very different paths to potential high-impact returns. Whether you lean toward established infrastructure, proven altcoin resilience, or high-risk/high-reward presales, each has the ingredients that could make 2025–2026 a breakout window much like Ethereum’s glory days for its earliest believers.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Experts believe it might inject up to $1.25 trillion in new money—an influx big enough to raise the whole market.\nLarge tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum are sure to pull in big money, but past trends make it clear that cheaper, higher-potential coins often explode the most when new cash arrives. These tokens' tiny slice of capital can balloon into massive percentage moves. Here are the 6 coins to buy right now, with Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) standing out as a meme coin that runs on its own Layer-2 chain, and the presale price is too tempting to pass up.\nLittle Pepe ($LILPEPE) : Meme Layer-2 Launch Ecosystem\nLittle Pepe just hit Stage 10 of its presale at $0.0019 per coin and has already raised over $18 million. What makes Little Pepe different from other meme coins is its own Layer-2 blockchain, made from the ground up to work perfectly with Ethereum. This custom-built chain has been optimized for speed and cost, giving users near-instant transactions at almost no charge.\nIts ecosystem includes:\n-\nA Meme Launchpad for future token launches\n-\nZero buy/sell tax to maximize trading efficiency.\n-\nBuilt-in anti-sniper bot protection for fair launches\n-\nCertik audit confirming no critical vulnerabilities\nLittle Pepe does more than ride the waves of hype— its infrastructure and viral spirit keep it afloat for the long haul. Clean presale pricing and solid exchange listings are coming soon, which means liquidity can scale fast once capital flows throughout. The community is buzzing on Telegram and X, making every update a live event. If the retirement funds finally dip into crypto, Little Pepe is ready to bounce harder than most.\nRipple (XRP): Cross-Border Payments Token\nXRP has been around long enough to prove its value, and it is still a go-to coin for moving money worldwide. Ripple has teamed up with major banks and money transfer companies, so XRP has a real-world job that big investors notice.\nTrading at $3.18, XRP sits below the $5 mental barrier. That price point is friendly for retirement investors who want something that can grow while still being easy to buy and sell. Sure, its price jumps probably won’t beat the tiny coins that run up overnight, but XRP’s deep market means it can still catch big piles of money moving in its direction.\nHedera (HBAR): Enterprise-Grade Public Ledger\nHedera uses a hashgraph consensus instead of a conventional blockchain, making it quicker and less energy-hungry. A governing council of worldwide corporations supports Hedera, and it’s already in use for real-world business projects, including supply chains and tokenized assets. Currently priced at $0.27, HBAR stays under $1, which appeals to smaller budgets. It's backed by major companies, strengthening its trust factor, potentially attracting conservative investors looking to diversify retirement accounts.\nVeChain (VET): Supply Chain Blockchain Token\nVeChain focuses on making supply chains more transparent and connecting logistics better. It works with big names like Walmart China, BMW, and PwC. Unlike many blockchain ideas, it has real business projects running and showing results. At around $0.02, the VET token reacts strongly to fresh cash entering the market. For example, a small amount of money from a retirement fund could increase the price because the token’s market cap is still smaller.\nStellar (XLM): Cross-Border Payments & Remittance Rails\nStellar is all about sending money across borders fast and for cheap. Its main goal is to help people who don’t have bank accounts or who don’t fully trust banks. Their team-up with MoneyGram means more folks can use it to move cash worldwide.\nAt just $0.37, XLM isn’t going to break the bank, and it does something useful. With more retirement funds looking for options beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Stellar sits in the payment lane where it can grow.\nShiba Inu (SHIB): Meme Token with Expanding Ecosystem\nShiba Inu is still the meme coin everyone talks about. Now that it has the Shibarium Layer-2 network, it does more than just trade on hype — it does something useful.\nThe price is $0.000013, which is excellent for everyday investors. Getting a bunch of tokens for a couple of bucks gives a satisfying “I own a lot” feeling. If that meme coin hype comes back, SHIB will likely catch the lift. But coins like Little Pepe are already gaining steam and could move quickly.\nConclusion\nIf the new 401(k) rule lands, we’re looking at about $1.25 trillion in fresh capital, which could flip the crypto market. The big coins will soak up most of that cash, but the under-$1 tokens risk posting the highest percentage gains.\nLittle Pepe ($LILPEPE) grabs attention because it mixes meme coin fun with solid blockchain tech, a verified security audit, and an early presale price that still feels right. Throw in an active community and looming exchange listings; you have a low-risk way to chase outsized returns. For investors getting ready for the policy shakeup, staking a bit in these six tokens under a buck could be the savvy play before the money rush kicks in.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Meme Coin Whales Are Replacing Shiba Inu (SHIB) With New Frog Coin Below $0.0025 in Their Portfolios", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/meme-coin-whales-are-replacing-shiba-inu-shib-with-new-frog-coin-below-00025-in-their-portfolios", "text": "The meme-coin space, once firmly dominated by Shiba Inu’s tiny doggo icon, is undergoing a profound shift. Large holders—so-called “whales”—aren’t just diversifying; they’re pivoting their capital toward next-generation meme tokens that promise more than nostalgia. At the center of this quietly erupting trend is Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a frog-themed coin trading below $0.0025 that is rapidly becoming the new whale magnet.\nShiba Inu’s Whale Exodus\nShiba Inu helped define the modern meme-coin era with massive rallies and an infectious community. Still, recent on-chain activity signals growing whale hesitation. One whale, dormant for seven months, offloaded nearly 40 billion SHIB—valued at almost half a million dollars—onto Binance in a single move. That unburdening of supply came just as SHIB hovered around $0.0001240, a sign that big private holders may perceive diminishing upside or increasing downside risk. These signs indicate that whales are not just reallocating; they appear to be quietly abandoning SHIB in favor of fresher, more technically innovative meme coins.\nEnter Little Pepe: A Meme Coin with Strategic Momentum\nWhile Shiba Inu’s pace is slowing, Little Pepe is speeding ahead. Live in presale Stage 10 at $0.0019, LILPEPE has already raised over $18 million, well ahead of expectations. Whales are playing the volume game here, snapping up tokens early while entry prices remain minimal.\nBut this isn’t just hype. Little Pepe is being built with real blockchain infrastructure behind it. Its Layer-2 chain promises lightning-fast, low-fee transactions, while providing anti-sniper mechanisms to defend fair launches. That combination of usability, fairness, and security separates it from relic meme projects. Little Pepe’s smart contracts earn a 95.49% score—an exceedingly high mark that underscores the project’s trustworthiness. That audit adds tangible credibility, likely attracting risk-conscious whales who want both explosive upside and verified safety.\nWhy Whales Are Making the Leap\nInstitutional and large-scale capital naturally migrates toward measurable promise. Little Pepe checks all the boxes a seasoned whale assesses:\n-\nScalable Infrastructure: Unlike Shiba Inu, tangled in legacy limitations and over-supply, Little Pepe is being engineered for real use—lower fees, faster finality, a Layer-2 launchpad. This positions it not as a meme-only gadget, but as a foundational ecosystem ripe for growth.\n-\nCredibility via Audit and Visibility: The CertiK audit, combined with an official listing on CoinMarketCap, confronts meme-coin skepticism head-on. Such validation comforts capital allocation and signals the project isn’t flying blind.\n-\nScarcity with Growth Potential: With a low entry price under $0.002 and presale stages progressing rapidly, the token structure sets the stage for potent listing multiples. Analysts projecting 50% gains by token listing see LILPEPE as a setup for explosive appreciation.\nShiba Inu vs Little Pepe: Infrastructure, Distribution, Sentiment\nShiba Inu’s vast supply, lack of innovation, and token concentration make it a fragile foundation for bullish capital. Layer-2 attempts like Shibarium have yet to overcome inertia or high supply ceilings. Analysts note its slow burn, and WHALES are increasingly wary.\nIn contrast, Little Pepe’s infrastructure-oriented design, capped presale supply, and interest from crypto veterans are creating a robust narrative. Analysts argue it could dethrone SHIB—and possibly deliver returns measured in multiples rather than percentages. The whisper cycle is clear: whales are preparing for the next wave, and they’re opting for frog-powered utility over dog-to-the-moon nostalgia.\nWhat This Shift Means for the Market\nThe whale migration away from SHIB toward Little Pepe is more than a token swap—it’s a signal shift in meme-coin valuation metrics. Investors now appear willing to reward utility, infrastructure, and security—not just viral potential. Little Pepe stands at the frontier of this new archetype. Its presale momentum, technical backing, and favorable security profile suggest it might become the go-to meme-coin for capital that wants upside with structure. In doing so, it could inaugurate a meme-coin era built on more than just laughs—one grounded in scalable blockchain innovation.\nFinal Take\nThe most dedicated meme-coin powerhouses are turning toward new infrastructure-forward projects, and Little Pepe is rewriting the expectations for the genre. As whales recalibrate their holdings, they signal a broader shift: utility and trust increasingly beat theatrics and unchecked token supply. Shiba Inu may still be entrenched in meme-legend status, but the future belongs to those memes built for tomorrow’s blockchain world. Little Pepe is not just jumping—it’s spearheading the leap.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, several emerging projects are quietly laying the foundation for massive growth in 2025.\nSavvy investors know that early positioning in fundamentally strong assets can deliver outsized returns, especially when adoption and innovation converge. In this market, timing and conviction matter as much as research. Today, we’ll explore a mix of established names and breakout contenders — each with strong technicals, ecosystem momentum, and market catalysts.\nFrom institutional inflows to groundbreaking infrastructure upgrades, these assets are gaining attention from traders and analysts alike. And leading the pack is BlockDAG, whose presale is capturing global interest thanks to its game-changing technology and eye-watering return potential.\nBlockDAG-“BlockDAG’s $0.0276 Presale Could Be the 36x Play You’ll Regret Missing!”\nBlockDAG’s presale is moving at lightning speed, and early investors are seizing what could be one of 2025’s most lucrative opportunities. Now in Batch 29, BDAG tokens are priced at just $0.0276 — a level many believe will never return. Post-listing forecasts point toward a $1 target, offering a potential 36x ROI for those acting now. With over $376 million raised toward the $600M goal, each sold-out batch instantly pushes the price higher, closing the door on maximum profits.\nThis isn’t empty hype. BlockDAG’s hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work architecture enables blazing-fast, secure, and scalable transactions without sacrificing decentralization. Adoption metrics are already impressive: 19,000 ASIC miners sold and 2.5 million users mining via the X1 mobile app. Developers are actively building ahead of the mainnet launch, ensuring real-world utility from day one.\nOnce Batch 29 ends, entry costs rise — potentially by multiples. History shows the biggest winners are early movers, and among today’s top crypto assets, BlockDAG stands out as the one to watch.\nDogecoin (DOGE)\nDogecoin has long been more than just a meme — it’s a community-driven digital asset with surprising resilience. Recently, DOGE formed a bullish golden cross, where the 50-day SMA moved above the 200-day SMA, a classic momentum signal.\nPrices have swung between $0.2138 and $0.2543 over the last week, showing strong volatility. CoinCodex models forecast upside potential toward $0.2536, representing possible 30% gains from current levels.\nWhile macroeconomic pressures, such as inflation concerns, have weighed on the broader crypto market, DOGE’s technical setup suggests the potential for a recovery rally. For traders seeking top crypto assets with a blend of speculative energy and clear technical patterns, Dogecoin remains a contender worth watching in the months ahead.\nTRON (TRX)\nTRON continues to impress with robust on-chain growth and institutional accumulation. Over the past week, TRX surged 9.2%, bolstered by a massive 1,269% jump in whale inflows totaling 1.3 billion TRX.\nLong-term holders have enjoyed returns exceeding 170% year-over-year, underscoring strong foundational support. Price currently hovers near $0.359, with upside resistance at $0.42–$0.45. Breaking above could unlock significant bullish momentum.\nThe network’s consistently high transaction volumes — surpassing 11.1 billion transactions — highlight TRON’s real-world utility. With such fundamentals, TRX holds a solid place among the top crypto assets for both active traders and long-term investors.\nHyperliquid (HYPE)\nHyperliquid is rapidly becoming a DeFi powerhouse, recently setting records with $29 billion in 24-hour trading volume and $7.7 million in fees. HYPE’s token price, currently $48.57, sits just shy of its all-time high of $49.75.\nInstitutional confidence is clear — Galaxy Digital alone deposited $100 million USDC into the platform. With TVL exceeding $6.2 billion and large-scale token accumulation by whales, Hyperliquid’s growth trajectory looks strong.\nIf momentum continues, a breakout above $50 could push HYPE into new territory. For investors seeking top crypto assets that blend institutional adoption with retail excitement, Hyperliquid is making a strong case.\nConclusion\nIn the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency, the key to exceptional returns lies in identifying the top crypto assets before they dominate headlines. Dogecoin offers speculative upside tied to community and technical signals, TRON boasts strong fundamentals and transaction volumes, and Hyperliquid blends explosive DeFi growth with institutional confidence. But BlockDAG’s presale opportunity — with its blend of cutting-edge tech, massive adoption, and 36x ROI potential — could be the standout of 2025.\nEach of these assets carries its own risk-reward profile, so diversification and timing are crucial. Still, the common thread is clear: all show strong momentum, robust ecosystems, and clear market catalysts.\nFor those willing to act decisively, these picks could define the next wave of crypto winners. The clock is ticking — and early positioning in top crypto assets has never been more critical.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Several alternatives now show even more upside potential, with some new projects drawing lots of attention. One fresh contender stands out among them. Explore which tokens could lead the next wave and why XYZVerse sits at the center of the buzz.\nDemand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone\nXYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3.\nUnlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms.\nNotably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet.\nPrice Dynamics and Listing Plans\nDuring its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges.\nThe projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization.\nSo far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors.\nChampions Get Rewarded\nIn XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big.\nThe Road to Victory\nWith solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary.\nAirdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits\nZORA’s Fast Lane: Turning Posts into Coins and Art into Opportunity\nZORA began in 2021 with a bold aim: let any creator own and sell their work straight on the blockchain. It sits on a lighter, cheaper layer of Ethereum, so minting and trading feel quick and almost fee-free. Artists can use its mobile app to snap a photo, tap once, and mint an NFT that lives forever on-chain. A recent link with the Base network adds “content coins,” tiny tokens tied to each post, blending social likes with real value.\nDaily trades stay lively and the project now counts a market value in the hundreds of millions. That steady volume hints at sticky user love, something many older NFT hubs lost in the last downturn. While big caps chase complex upgrades, ZORA keeps its story simple: empower creators and cut costs. If the next cycle favors real use over hype, a platform already shipping fast tools, mobile reach, and social tokens looks set to shine. Compared with many small NFT coins, ZORA’s mix of art, community, and fresh tech feels hard to ignore.\nTap, Trust, Earn: How Pi Turns Phones into Crypto Miners\nPi Network lets anyone earn digital coins with a simple tap. No bulky rigs or huge bills. Started in 2019 by Stanford graduates, the app asks users to confirm they are active once a day. Each tap keeps their Pioneer status alive and pays them Pi. Members also list three to five trusted friends, weaving a global trust graph that keeps the chain safe. The system runs on the energy-light Stellar Consensus Protocol, so phones stay cool and batteries last. Extra rewards await users who run full nodes on their computers.\nPi now runs on its own mainnet, but transfers stay inside until mass identity checks finish. When the gates open, millions of verified users could carry Pi straight into shops, games, and Web3 apps. In a market hungry for eco-friendly and social coins, that strong community looks like gold. Bitcoin grabs headlines and Ethereum rules smart contracts, yet both face high fees and power talk. Pi offers free entry, green mining, and fair distribution. If the next cycle favors usability over hype, a coin you earn while scrolling may shine.\nONDO: Bridging Wall Street and Blockchain for Everyday Earners\nOndo Finance and its token ONDO mix the safety of old finance with the speed of blockchains. The team turns steady, income-making assets like U.S. bonds into digital tokens that anyone can buy. One side of the firm builds these products; the other side codes tools that let them move with ease on-chain. Deals with names such as BlackRock and safe storage by Coinbase show a focus on trust. The popular USDY token even adds yield to a stable coin backed by Treasuries.\nReal-world asset tokens are hot this cycle, and ONDO rides that wave. Many traders chase memecoins, yet funds are now hunting steady yield as rates stay high. ONDO offers that without the wild swings seen in bitcoin or ether. Clear rules, strong partners, and open reports make it stand out from smaller rivals. If the market keeps shifting toward tokenized bonds and cash, demand for ONDO’s products could climb. For investors wanting both blockchain growth and real income, ONDO looks like a timely bet.\nUNI and the Power of Crowd: Why This Token Still Turns Heads\nUniswap began in 2018 with a fresh idea. It let people trade tokens without a crowded order book. Money sits in shared pools, so swaps are quick and open all day. Users keep full control of their funds. In September 2020 the team released UNI, a vote token. Early users woke up to 400 UNI each, worth over $1,000. The gift came after a rival, SushiSwap, tried to lure them away. Today the exchange holds more than $3 billion and ranks among the biggest in DeFi.\nUNI still attracts attention in the current cycle. Big names like Bitcoin and Ether have led the rebound, yet many traders look for fresh stories with real use. UNI offers that link between token price and platform voice. Each coin is a ballot that can shape fees, new pools, and future upgrades. Competitors such as PancakeSwap run on other chains, but few match Uniswap’s long record and open code. If DeFi keeps growing, demand for voting power may rise, making UNI a coin to watch.\nConclusion\nZORA, PI, ONDO, and UNI look good in the 2025 surge, but XYZVerse dominates through sport-meme fusion, community power, GameFi plans, and a bold 20,000% goal.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Now, all eyes are turning to XYZVerse as traders search for the next big breakout. Rumors and early signals suggest that something major could be brewing. Will XYZVerse become the next headline success?\nUndervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX\nXYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase.\nSo far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005.\nAt the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount.\nFollowing the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch.\nBorn for Fighters, Built for Champions\nXYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin.\nCentral to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell.\nCommunity-First Vibes\nIn XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record.\nBacked by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary.\nAirdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits\nSHIB’s Big Bark: How a Meme Coin Became a Serious Player\nShiba Inu, or SHIB, began in August 2020 as a playful nod to Dogecoin. Yet it chose the Ethereum road, giving it a home inside the biggest smart-contract world. The secret founder, Ryoshi, made one quadrillion tokens and sent half to Vitalik Buterin. The act signaled trust. Buterin gave some to India’s Covid fund and burned 40% of all SHIB, cutting the pile and lighting up headlines. Today SHIB powers ShibaSwap, a token swap site, and plans art tokens and community votes, proving it is more than a joke.\nMemecoins are roaring again, but few have real tools behind the buzz. SHIB does. Its link to Ethereum means new ideas can plug in fast, and lower transaction costs after recent upgrades could help use grow. Many traders like its tiny price per coin, which feels friendly for small budgets. Compared with Dogecoin, SHIB offers more things you can actually do, not just tipping online. If this cycle rewards coins with both story and purpose, the Shiba army may still have room to run.\nPEPE: The Frog Coin Leaping Back Into the Spotlight\nPEPE began as a playful salute to Matt Furie’s famous frog and soon turned into a wild market story. Launched on Ethereum with zero taxes and no grand promises, the coin rocketed in late April 2023, touching a $1.6 billion value and sparking a fresh “memecoin season.” Early buyers saw life-changing gains, while new fans rushed in, drawn by the simple idea of owning the next Shiba Inu or Dogecoin—only greener and grinning.\nCan the frog jump higher? Supporters point to its burn rule, tight supply, and a clear three-step roadmap that ends with big-league exchange listings and a planned “meme takeover.” PEPE’s straight-up approach—fun first, utility later—sets it apart from coins that chase complex tech. The coming Bitcoin halving often lifts the whole market, and many hope that momentum will carry PEPE, too. Rivals like Doge rely on older buzz; Shiba builds new apps. PEPE bets on pure meme power. If the crowd keeps laughing—and buying—the coin may hop back toward its old peak.\nBONK Mania: The Solana Pup That Wants to Share the Wealth\nBONK is the first dog on Solana. This memecoin uses a cute Shiba Inu to send a clear message: tokens should belong to the crowd, not big funds. Half of all BONK went straight to users of Solana’s NFT and DeFi apps. When Coinbase opened trading, the price jumped more than 100% in a day. A new tool called BonkSwap now lets holders trade at lightning speed and tiny cost, showing how the coin fits into Solana’s quick, low-fee chain.\nFans call BONK the Dogecoin of this cycle, but on stronger rails. Solana moves thousands of actions every second, so games, art markets, and other apps can plug BONK into daily use. That speed may give it an edge over older meme coins stuck on slow networks and high fees. The supply is huge and swings can come fast, yet fresh hype still lifts community coins. If markets keep cheering playful tokens, BONK could stay in the spotlight, while steadier phases may push eyes back to giants like SOL and ETH.\nConclusion\nSHIB, PEPE, and BONK proved meme power; yet the first all-sport token XYZVerse targets 20000% gains, merging sports passion and crypto culture, inviting early entrants into a community-led movement.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

These three coins could be your next big chance for several reasons.\n-\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin That Could Grow a Lot\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) is becoming one of the best meme coins on the market, and it will outperform many of its competitors. LILPEPE isn't just relying on hype like other meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu; it has real uses. LILPEPE is built on a Layer-2 blockchain that works with Ethereum. It has faster transactions and lower fees, which makes it a good choice for decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects. LILPEPE is still in its presale phase, so it's a rare chance for early investors to buy it at a low price. Right now, it's only $0.0019.\nLILPEPE has already raised more than $18.4 million in presale funds, showing investors are very interested. Analysts say that the token could grow by a massive 12,000% by 2025, making it one of the best meme coin investments of the year. If LILPEPE reaches even a small part of its projected potential, a $300 investment today could be worth a lot by 2026. LILPEPE is one of the most exciting tokens to watch in the next bull run because it has a strong blockchain foundation and community support, and whale investors are becoming more interested in it.\n-\nStellar (XLM): Changing the Way Payments Are Made Across Borders\nStellar (XLM) is a monetary network that facilitates fast and low-cost payments to and between various users across borders. The current stellar value is around $0.4527, far less than it should be. The platform has a reputation for growing and, therefore, is a good option for banks and money transfer services looking to lower their payment costs compared to previous methods. Stellar's agreements with such large corporations as IBM indicate that this company might disrupt the world payment infrastructure.\nXLM will likely reach its peak by 2026 and go as high as five dollars, giving its early investors more than 100 percent profit. Stellar will continue to expand due to the rising number of individuals utilizing blockchain to make cross-border payments, and it is solid technologically and characterized by partnerships. The fact that the world is shifting to decentralized financial solutions and digital currencies positions Stellar blockchain as a leader in capturing a large portion of the cross-border payments market. This qualifies it to be an excellent investment prospect into 2025 and beyond.\n-\nChainlink (Link): Using Oracles To Power The Decentralized Web\nChainlink (LINK) is among the most critical components in the blockchain ecosystem, given that it allows smart contracts to communicate with off-chain data securely. The price of LINK currently stands at approximately $21.68, and it is not hard to see that its application in decentralized finance ( DeFi ) and innovative contract applications is unparalleled. Chainlink is the infrastructure that lets blockchain networks access real-world data, which makes decentralized apps more advanced and secure.\nChainlink's importance grows as the DeFi ecosystem grows. Some analysts think LINK could go up by 2026, with some even saying it could reach $300. This growth would make it one of the best-performing blockchain assets of the decade, giving early investors significant returns. Chainlink is a must-watch in the next few years because it has a strong use case, strong partnerships with major tech companies, and is an integral part of the decentralized ecosystem.\nHow to Get LILPEPE Before Its Price Explodes\nIf you’re looking to get in on LILPEPE before its price skyrockets, here’s how to do it:\n-\nGet MetaMask or Trust Wallet for your phone or browser.\n-\nPut ETH or USDT (ERC-20) in your wallet.\n-\nYou can get to the official presale page at littlepepe.com.\n-\nConnect your wallet and buy LILPEPE tokens at the current price.\nThe LILPEPE presale is still going on, and the price will go up as it goes on. Don't wait; buy your tokens before the price increases.\nConclusion: LILPEPE Is The Coin To Watch In 2025.\nBitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate the crypto space, but it is becoming more likely that LILPEPE, Stellar, and Chainlink are the new big winners. This is the potential of these three coins in the next 4 years to rise by 5000-10 times or more by 2026, since they are currently cheap, can be used in the real world, and still have tremendous upside potential. In 2025, LILPEPE is the coin to watch if you want to find the next big meme coin or a good blockchain project that can be used in the real world.\nDon't make the same mistake with these promising projects that you did with Solana's early success.

These swings of 20%–35% remain common as liquidity rotates and L2 throughput rises, making ETH both a high-reward and high-risk play in August.\nSnorter Token (SNORT), the Telegram-native trading-bot project launching first on Solana with multichain expansion plans, is also drawing attention. It markets fast swaps, automated sniping, copy trading, limit orders, rug-pull detection, staking, and a capped supply of 500 million tokens. Fees are promoted as under 1%, and the roadmap highlights a clear trajectory from Solana to complete EVM expansion.\nAnd then there’s Bitcoin Swift (BTC3), positioned as an AI-driven financial OS that’s already paying buyers right now through its programmable PoY rewards. While ETH and SNORT deserve recognition for their innovations, BTC3 is the one turning presale progress into immediate, tangible payouts for its investors.\nETH, SNORT, and BTC3: the momentum stories behind the headlines\nETH’s near-term path is about catalysts: L2 throughput, restaking dynamics, ETF flows, and builder traction. In constructive cycles, ETH has historically revisited prior highs, while risk-off windows have seen sharp retraces; planning with scenario bands beats single-number targets. SNORT is gaining traction by giving traders bot-level execution without writing code. The team is running a presale ahead of public listings, with audits cited and a TGE window on the horizon. It’s a promising automation narrative, yet for near-term cash flow, investors are rotating to BTC3 because it pays at each stage close, not someday later.\nBTC3: an AI financial OS with privacy, speed, and real distributions\nBitcoin Swift (BTC3) fuses AI-powered smart contracts, a privacy-first DID layer using zero-knowledge proofs, and compliance-ready design. The team launches on Solana first to deliver lightning-fast confirmations, fees under one cent, and instant access to more than four hundred live projects before transitioning to its native blockchain.\nBTC3 backs excitement with verification. The project’s security stack is publicly reviewed through the Cyberscope Audit, a comprehensive Audit Solidproof report, and the Audit Spywolf analysis, alongside full KYC, a rare combo that gives both users and institutions confidence.\nInfluencer buzz is accelerating around BTC3’s stage-by-stage payouts and fast rollout. In a detailed breakdown, Crypto Sister explains how PoY distributions, Solana-first speed, and the bonus tiers create a compounding effect for early participants, and why that’s pulling attention away from slower plays.\nPresale: Only 2 Days Left in Stage 5, Read This Before It Sells Out\nBTC3’s presale is short, aggressive, and built to reward early action. PoY rewards are distributed automatically at the end of each stage, so benefits arrive immediately, not months later.\n-\nCurrent Price: $5\n-\n$750,000+ raised\n-\nLaunch Price: $15\n-\nStage 5 APY: 96% and more than $60,000 in APY staking profits sent to users\n-\n2600+ users\nA 10% referral bonus is live for both sides on every completed transaction. With only 2 days to secure Stage 5 entries, hesitation can be costly. This is one of the shortest, most momentum-driven launches on the market, ending on September 18, 2025 and running only 64 days, with roughly a month left before the presale closes.\nBTC3 is introducing an amazing buyer bonus that stacks with stage price steps, APY payouts, and PoY distributions:\n-\nTier 1: Invest $100 – $1,999 → 10% Bonus Tokens\n-\nTier 2: Invest $2,000 – $4,999 → 20% Bonus Tokens\n-\nTier 3: Invest more than $5,000 → 40% Bonus Tokens\nAdding even more fuel, internal sources indicate that leaked talks took place with MEXC, KuCoin, and LBank regarding listings immediately after the presale, creating an early liquidity pipeline that can potentially squeeze a tightening supply on day one.\nBTC3E: The Stablecoin of Bitcoin Swift\nAlongside massive PoY rewards, Bitcoin Swift introduces BTC3E, a USD-pegged stablecoin built for security and DeFi utility. Overcollateralized and governed on-chain, BTC3E ensures stability while expanding the ecosystem’s reach.\n-\nUSD-Pegged & Reliable\n-\n150%+ Collateral Ratio for Safety\n-\nAI Oracles for Automated Risk Control\n-\nCommunity Governance on Key Parameters\n-\nSeamless Use in DeFi and Payments\nBTC3E solidifies Bitcoin Swift as more than just presale hype; it’s building a lasting financial infrastructure.\nConclusion: ETH steady, SNORT promising, BTC3 unmissable\nETH’s scenario-based planning and SNORT’s automation push both look constructive. But if you want immediate, verifiable payouts plus audited security and a high-speed rollout, Bitcoin Swift is the standout of August. Stage 5 has 2 days left. Act while the rewards, bonuses, and momentum are stacked in your favor.\nFor more information on Bitcoin Swift:\nWebsite: https://bitcoinswift.com\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

With a presale rate of simply $0.005, the challenge has ambitious plans to release at $1, providing early buyers the opportunity of a 200x go back. This meteoric upward push in interest has sparked debate in the crypto community—ought Ozak AI to outperform mounted heavyweights like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Cardano (ADA), and XRP by 2025?\nAI Meets Blockchain—The Core of Ozak AI’s Appeal\nThe heart of Ozak AI’s strategy lies in merging artificial intelligence with the decentralized blockchain era. Its surroundings are constructed to deliver AI-powered analytics, predictive trading fashions, and autonomous financial decision-making gear to traders and institutions.\nKey features include:\n-\nOzak Stream Network (OSN)—a real-time market intelligence hub.\n-\nPrediction Agents—AI bots designed to forecast price movements across crypto, forex, and stocks.\n-\nData Vaults—secure, decentralized storage for training and optimizing AI algorithms.\nWith these features, Ozak AI positions itself as more than just another presale—it’s building a functional product suite designed to have a tangible impact in the trading world.\nShiba Inu—Meme Power vs. Utility\nShiba Inu remains one of the most recognizable meme coins in the market. While it has expanded its ecosystem with Shibarium, the Layer-2 scaling solution, SHIB’s price predictions for 2025 hover around $0.00005 to $0.0001.\nEven in an optimistic scenario, Shiba Inu’s gains are likely to be in the 2x to 5x range, as it already commands a multi-billion-dollar market cap. While its strong community ensures consistent activity, the difference between Ozak AI and SHIB is utility—Ozak AI offers functional AI-driven products, whereas SHIB’s growth is still largely dependent on hype cycles and speculative trading.\nCardano—Slow but Steady Growth\nCardano is one of the most respected blockchain projects for its academic approach and strong commitment to scalability, sustainability, and interoperability. The Chang hard fork, completed in 2025, sets the stage for on-chain governance and greater DeFi adoption. Analysts forecast ADA could reach $5 to $6 in the next bull run.\nWhile this represents a healthy increase, Cardano’s sheer market size limits its ability to deliver exponential returns. For a $500 investment, ADA might turn into $3,000 if forecasts hold—solid, but nowhere near the potential 200x upside that Ozak AI’s low market cap could theoretically deliver.\nXRP—Banking on Regulation and Partnerships\nXRP has been a cornerstone of cross-border payment innovation, and its partial legal victory over the U.S. SEC has renewed investor confidence. The token could be worth $3 to $5 in 2025 if global remittance adoption accelerates.\nXRP’s biggest advantage lies in its banking partnerships and use case as a bridge currency. However, like Cardano, its high market capitalization makes huge percentage gains less likely. A realistic ROI for XRP is likely in the 2x to 4x range for 2025, far less than Ozak AI’s early-stage growth potential.\nWhy Ozak AI Could Lead in 2025 ROI\nThe main reason Ozak AI could outperform SHIB, ADA, and XRP is its starting point. At $0.005, the entry price is microscopic compared to the $0.00001291 SHIB, $0.45 ADA, or $0.60 XRP. This means even modest price movement produces outsized returns for early investors.\nMoreover, Ozak AI is riding two of the hottest investment narratives of 2025—AI technology and crypto innovation. The combination attracts both traditional tech investors and crypto enthusiasts, broadening its investor base. If Ozak AI executes its roadmap and secures listings on major exchanges, its $1 target could be achievable within its first year.\nWhile the upside is appealing, Ozak AI remains a presale project, meaning it has higher risk than established cryptos. Product delivery, market adoption, and post-launch liquidity will be critical in determining whether the $1 goal becomes reality. Early-stage volatility should also be expected, as speculative hype can lead to rapid swings in valuation.\nThat said, the presale structure includes vesting schedules to prevent large-scale sell-offs, and the development team has already disclosed partnerships with HIVE, Weblume, and SINT, giving credibility to its execution capabilities.\nThe ROI Race Is Heating Up\nShiba Inu, Cardano, and XRP are all well-positioned for moderate growth in 2025, but their larger market caps and established valuations limit the scale of potential gains. Ozak AI, on the other hand, has the advantage of being in its earliest growth stage, with a clear utility-driven roadmap and strong investor momentum.\nIf its AI-powered ecosystem delivers as promised, Ozak AI could not only meet but exceed its $1 launch target, giving early buyers the kind of returns that blue-chip cryptocurrencies can no longer realistically offer. While it won’t replace the stability of SHIB, ADA, or XRP, it might just become the breakout ROI leader of the next bull cycle.\nAbout Ozak AI\nOzak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.\nFor more, visit\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nTwitter: https://x.com/ozakagi\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Despite the turbulence, ADA’s technical indicators suggest that upward momentum could be building. With resistance at $0.91 and the potential to push beyond $1, Cardano’s setup could turn short-term volatility into a springboard for gains.\nIn this article, we’ll explore ADA’s price outlook, the broader altcoin landscape, and how data-powered strategies of Outset PR help crypto projects capture market attention when sentiment begins to shift.\nCardano (ADA) Eyes Gains as It Hovers Near Key Levels\nSource: tradingview\nCardano is trading between seventy-three to eighty-five cents. It seems poised for growth, rising over 27% in a month. The nearest resistance is around ninety-one cents, while support lies at sixty-six cents. If it breaks through the resistance, it might climb to over one dollar. This would be a nearly 20% jump from its current upper range. The coin's indicators such as the RSI and moving averages suggest potential momentum. With these signs, Cardano could experience further upward movement, aiming for new highs.

The central bank will revert to its regular supervisory process to monitor all crypto-related activities.\nUS banks can offer crypto services like dollar-backed stablecoins without prior approvals. The move is expected to broaden institutional participation in the digital asset ecosystem.\nFederal Reserve Shuts Down Crypto Oversight Program\nThe United States Federal Reserve has shut down a program monitoring banks’ crypto activities. The decision was announced on Friday, with the bank stating it was shuttering its “Novel Activities Supervision Program.” The program kept a check on banks involved with crypto assets, blockchain experiments, and tech-heavy partnerships. The Novel Activities Supervision Program has been around since 2023, and has helped the Fed track “novel activities” within banks under its supervision. This included crypto custody, crypto-backed lending, blockchain-based lending, and working with tech companies to deliver banking services.\nEasing Of Crypto Scrutiny\nThe Federal Reserve stated that since the Board started its crypto supervision program, it has strengthened its understanding of crypto activities, the risks associated with them, and bank risk management practices. With this understanding, the Board now plans to integrate the supervision of crypto-related activities into its standard supervisory process. The Federal Reserve Board also plans to rescind its 2023 supervisory letter, which led to the creation of the program. The initiative is believed to be one of the ways the SEC enforced “Operation Chokepoint” under the Biden administration.\nThe shuttering of the program follows President Donald Trump's signing of an executive order to end unfair banking practices based on grounds including religion, politics, and other ideologies. The order also cited Operation Chokepoint and how the Federal Reserve coerced banks into cutting ties with prominent crypto firms and entities. The Federal Reserve, along with other banking regulators, recently gave banks the green light to custody crypto assets. The regulators clarified that the same rules that apply to the custody of other assets will apply to crypto assets.\nA Big Win For The Crypto Industry\nSenator Cynthia Lummis called the Federal Reserve’s decision a “big win” for the crypto ecosystem, and one that ends Operation Chokepoint 2.0. She noted that the Federal Reserve’s decision effectively stops the targeted supervision of crypto banking activities.\n“Big win for putting an end to Operation Chokepoint 2.0. The Fed announced it is killing the targeted supervision of digital asset banking activities. There’s still more to do, but this is real progress toward a level playing field for crypto.”\nHowever, she conceded there was still more to do, but added that the decision was a big step towards creating a level playing field for crypto. Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor also weighed in, stating that the “road is now clear for Bitcoin and banking.” Crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett stated that the Novel Activities Supervision Program was a major catalyst for Operation Chokepoint 2.0.\n“The novel activities supervision program was a major catalyst for Operation Chokepoint 2.0, one banking lawyer told me. While the Fed has yet to rescind all of its anti-crypto guidance from the Biden era, this is another piece of the puzzle.”\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As more investors seek control without compromise, tokens like OKB and ADA are gaining attention for their privacy-respecting mechanics and real-world utility.\nOKB’s rise reflects growing trust in user-first token design, while ADA’s surge shows increasing demand for confidential transactions backed by zero-knowledge technology.\nCold Wallet builds on both ideas but adds something tangible: a live cashback system with no KYC, no intermediaries, and real USDT rewards. With $6 million raised and rewards already flowing, it’s a strong case for the top crypto to buy 2025.\nPrivacy-First DeFi Cashback\nCold Wallet is reshaping how rewards work in decentralized finance with a live cashback system that cuts out banks, card partners, and intermediaries. In contrast, in traditional cashback models, users give up privacy and rely on centralized entities. Instead, Cold Wallet flips that approach by distributing rewards directly on-chain, ensuring that every swap and network interaction earns users USDT with no strings attached. There are no KYC checks, no credit history requirements, and no hidden gatekeepers; rather, just direct rewards for real crypto usage.\nAs a result, this decentralized design ensures privacy while proving that cashback in DeFi is not a future promise but a working reality in 2025. Moreover, by rewarding usage, Cold Wallet turns participation into a cycle of value, making DeFi attractive to both seasoned users and newcomers. Importantly, self-custody remains at the core, meaning users always control their assets while enjoying consistent rebates across gas fees, swaps, and bridges.\nFurthermore, the traction so far highlights its credibility. Cold Wallet’s presale has already raised more than $6 million, with the token currently in stage 17 at $0.00998 per CWT. Looking ahead, with a launch price set at $0.3517, the upside for early participants is clear. For anyone searching for the top crypto to buy 2025, this project stands out for delivering a live, functional product ahead of launch rather than relying on promises.\nOKB Price Rally Signals Confidence in Privacy-First Utility\nThe recent OKB price rally, marked by a 102% surge in just 24 hours, highlights a growing preference for privacy-respecting, utility-backed tokens. Specifically, this surge reflects confidence in a token that prioritizes real user engagement without requiring overexposure or compromise. OKB’s rise isn’t driven by speculation alone; instead, it’s tied to consistent platform usage and a reward structure that values participation while keeping users in control of their assets.\nMeanwhile, as interest in DeFi grows in 2025, users are seeking tokens that offer functionality without depending on intrusive verification processes or centralized bottlenecks. OKB fits that demand by offering real utility in a structure that respects autonomy and transactional privacy. Therefore, the price movement indicates a shift toward purpose-aligned tokens that deliver actual value.\nADA Price Surge Reinforces Demand for Privacy-Focused DeFi\nThe recent ADA price surge reflects growing interest in decentralized systems that prioritize both privacy and real utility. Fueled by excitement around the Midnight Network airdrop, Cardano has shown that users are increasingly aligning with platforms offering zero-knowledge proof-based confidentiality without sacrificing usability.\nAltogether, this rise highlights a key shift in 2025, users want to engage with DeFi ecosystems that allow them to transact freely, without needing to hand over sensitive personal information.\nWith that in mind, the Midnight protocol enabling secure, private transactions positions ADA as more than just a token. It’s becoming a gateway to a privacy-first financial structure that rewards participation while preserving autonomy. Additionally, the controlled rollout of $NIGHT through airdrops further strengthens network trust and reinforces long-term value.\nCold Wallet Sets the Standard for DeFi Rewards in 2025\nDeFi is shifting toward platforms that offer transparency, control, and actual user benefit without sacrificing privacy. OKB has gained traction by proving that utility matters, and ADA’s recent movement shows the value of privacy-enhancing features backed by real development.\nCold Wallet takes those signals seriously but doesn’t stop at theory, it delivers on-chain cashback with no KYC, no gatekeeping, and real-time USDT rewards for actual crypto usage. Users are not asked to stake or wait. They simply use the wallet and get rewarded. With over $6 million already raised in presale and rewards tied directly to activity,\nCold Wallet offers a working solution to one of DeFi’s biggest adoption barriers. Its model rewards self-custody while encouraging real participation. For those looking ahead to the top crypto to buy 2025, Cold Wallet makes a compelling case by offering more than potential, it offers proof through action.\nExplore Cold Wallet Now:\nPresale: https://purchase.coldwallet.com/\nWebsite: https://coldwallet.com/\nX: https://x.com/coldwalletapp\nTelegram: https://t.me/ColdWalletAppOfficia\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Ethereum-Based AI Coin Ozak AI Could Deliver Higher ROI Than Solana, Ripple, and Bitcoin Combined", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/ethereum-based-ai-coin-ozak-ai-could-deliver-higher-roi-than-solana-ripple-and-bitcoin-combined", "text": "Ozak AI is emerging as one of the most talked-about projects in the crypto market for 2025, and for good reason. Built on Ethereum’s secure, scalable blockchain infrastructure, Ozak AI combines the cutting-edge potential of artificial intelligence with the global liquidity and developer support of the Ethereum ecosystem.\nThe Ozak AI presale has already passed $1.85 million in funding at a token price of just $0.005, with analysts predicting a $1 launch and a longer-term target of $2.80 by 2026. Those numbers point to a staggering 560x potential return—far exceeding the realistic short-term gains projected for major players like Solana, Ripple (XRP), and Bitcoin.\nThe comparison is striking. While Bitcoin remains the market leader, its massive $1 trillion-plus market cap means percentage growth is slower. Even with a bullish forecast pushing BTC to $200,000 in 2025, that’s only about a 3x gain from current prices. Solana, despite its strong DeFi and NFT presence, is targeting $500 in 2025—a roughly 4x rise. Ripple, with its legal clarity after the SEC lawsuit and growing adoption in cross-border payments, is projected to reach around $6, a 5-6x climb. Ozak AI, on the other hand, could deliver 200x by launch and potentially 560x within the next year and a half, thanks to its early-stage positioning and AI-driven use case.\nWhy Ozak AI Stands Out\nOzak AI isn’t just another speculative presale riding on hype. The team has already developed and demonstrated a functional AI trading engine capable of delivering real-time market predictions in milliseconds. This positions the project in a fast-growing niche where AI is transforming how investors make decisions. The fact that it’s built on Ethereum means it can easily integrate with existing DeFi platforms, DEXs, and wallets, tapping into Ethereum’s massive network effect.\nThe tokenomics are designed to create scarcity while rewarding early adopters. With a fixed supply and incremental price increases across presale stages, investors have a clear incentive to enter early. The $1 confirmed launch price is already locked into the roadmap, providing a transparent goal that’s rare in the presale space. By contrast, most new tokens leave pricing entirely to the open market, creating uncertainty for buyers.\nROI Potential Compared to Market Giants\nWhen comparing Ozak AI’s upside potential to major coins, the disparity is hard to ignore. Bitcoin’s next halving cycle may boost prices, but the scale of growth will be far smaller in percentage terms. Ripple’s price is influenced heavily by regulatory news and adoption in traditional finance, which tends to move at a slower pace. Solana’s strong developer activity and NFT dominance could fuel impressive gains, but even aggressive forecasts place it in the single-digit multiple range by 2025.\nOzak AI’s lower beginning market cap approach means that large rate jumps require a lot less new capital inflow. Early buyers gain from asymmetric danger/praise—in which the ability upside hugely outweighs the downside danger, in particular given the undertaking’s running product and public group presence. If the token reaches $2.80 in 2026 as forecasted, a $500 presale investment will be worth $280,000, a discernment that dwarfs returns from even the most constructive eventualities for Bitcoin, Solana, or Ripple.\nEthereum Integration as a Growth Catalyst\nChoosing Ethereum as its launchpad offers Ozak AI on-the-spot benefits. The community’s mounted protection, huge adoption, and robust developer tools suggest the group can focus on scaling AI capabilities as opposed to constructing middle infrastructure from scratch. This also ensures compatibility with Layer-2 answers like Arbitrum and Optimism, which can further improve transaction pace and decrease charges as adoption grows.\nEthereum’s upcoming scaling enhancements and growing institutional interest in ETH-based tasks ought to directly improve Ozak AI’s visibility and valuation. As extra capital flows into the Ethereum ecosystem, promising ERC-20 tokens with sturdy basics—like Ozak AI—are in all likelihood to look improved and call for attention from both retail and institutional players.\nThe Road to $2.80\nOzak AI’s roadmap outlines aggressive growth targets that make its $2.80 price projection plausible. The plan includes expanding AI features to cater to institutional traders, integrating with multiple DeFi protocols, and creating APIs for external platforms to leverage its AI signals. As trading volume and token demand increase, the deflationary tokenomics will work to support price appreciation.\nWhile nothing in crypto is guaranteed, the combination of a functioning AI product, Ethereum integration, and a low presale entry point gives Ozak AI a unique edge in ROI potential. Investors looking for outsized returns in the next bull run may find it a compelling alternative—or complement—to holding blue-chip cryptos.\nFor now, with the presale still in early stages and the token available at $0.005, the window for securing a position before the $1 launch is narrowing. If projections hold true, Ozak AI could become the rare Ethereum-based project that delivers higher percentage gains than Bitcoin, Solana, and Ripple combined—making it one of the most watched tokens of 2025.\nAbout Ozak AI\nOzak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.\nFor more, visit\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nTwitter: https://x.com/ozakagi\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Now, the same gambler is putting everything into a new coin: XYZVerse. Chasing an even bigger win, this switch has become the talk of online circles. What is driving this bold decision, and could XYZVerse really deliver a 500x return?\nXYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin?\nThe buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch.\nThe current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price.\nBullish Mood on $XYZ\nXYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow.\nXYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster, who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.”\nMore Than Just a Meme Coin\nUnlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value.\nRight now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention.\nStill Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends\nBeyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time.\nA Community-Driven Project With Big Plans\nOne thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility.\nThe recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use.\nAs part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem\nCould XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin?\nWith a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look.\nJoin XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity\nMuch Wow Money: Dogecoin's Bark Returns in the Crypto Spring\nDogecoin began in 2013 as an inside joke among coders Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. They slapped a Shiba Inu meme on the logo and set the rules to mint 10,000 new coins every minute, so scarcity was never the point. What followed shocked the market. In 2021 a swarm of online fans, led by tweets from Elon Musk, pushed the “memecoin” into the top ten list with a value above $50 billion. The rise proved that humor, community, and timing can move real money.\nToday DOGE still runs on a simple, secure network based on proof-of-work, yet its fees stay low and transfers are quick. The endless supply works well for tipping, charity drives, and small payments, though it might limit long-term price growth. In the new market upswing, meme tokens are heating up again, but most come and go. DOGE stands out with ten years of history, deep liquidity, and possible use inside Elon Musk’s X super-app dream. If hype returns, this old dog could grab attention once more.\nConclusion\nTurning $5,000 into $2 million with DOGE is remarkable. Now, the focus shifts to XYZVerse, aiming for massive growth by blending meme culture with sports in a community-driven ecosystem.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This year, the focus is on projects that combine proven performance with mechanisms that reward participation on a meaningful scale. From strong presales and verified payouts to reliable stability and global utility, certain names are separating themselves from the rest.\nAmong them, BlockDAG is making a strong case with remarkable growth figures and community-driven initiatives. Alongside it, established names such as BNB, Tether, and XRP continue to show why they remain part of the conversation when evaluating the best crypto to invest in long term.\nBlockDAG (BDAG): Growth-Backed Results and High-Value Rewards\nBlockDAG is positioning itself as one of the best crypto to invest in long term thanks to its ability to blend community engagement with measurable financial progress. Its presale has already raised $374 million, with the project currently in batch 29 at a price of $0.0276 per coin. This represents a staggering 2,660% increase since batch 1, with more than 25 billion coins sold to date.\nWhat sets BlockDAG apart is its emphasis on verified rewards and consistent delivery, creating trust in its capacity to sustain momentum. Rather than relying solely on market speculation, the project has backed its growth with initiatives that reinforce long-term participation and attract continuous demand.\nThis combination of large-scale presale success and tangible value distribution highlights why BlockDAG is widely seen as one of the best crypto to invest in long term in 2025 and beyond.\nBNB (Binance Coin): Utility as a Core Driver\nBNB remains a key player when considering the best crypto to invest in long term, largely due to its integration across the Binance ecosystem. Its uses include trading fee discounts, staking, launchpad access, and broader payment functions, ensuring that demand remains steady.\nThe network’s ongoing expansion into decentralized finance and new product integrations adds to BNB’s relevance. While it doesn’t feature large-scale reward initiatives like BlockDAG, its utility-driven growth and consistent role within one of the largest global exchanges reinforce its position as a reliable choice.\nFor those who prioritize functionality and ongoing adoption, BNB remains a strong option among the best crypto to invest in long term.\nTether (USDT): Stability with Practical Application\nTether plays a unique role in the discussion of the best crypto to invest in long term because it serves as a stabilizing force rather than a high-growth asset. As the most widely adopted USD-backed stablecoin, USDT is essential for trading pairs, liquidity management, and hedging during market volatility.\nIts widespread use across exchanges ensures constant demand and relevance. While Tether does not provide the explosive upside of projects like BlockDAG or BNB, it delivers stability that is invaluable for building balanced portfolios. For those who want flexibility in reallocation and protection against volatility, Tether holds a strategic place among the best crypto to invest in long term.\nXRP (Ripple): Expanding Utility in Payments\nXRP is often highlighted as one of the best crypto to invest in long term due to its role in transforming global payment systems. Ripple’s network focuses on enabling low-cost, high-speed cross-border transactions, a use case that continues to attract attention from banks and financial institutions.\nDespite past regulatory hurdles, XRP has held its ground and maintained strong adoption. Its ability to provide efficiency in international payments sets it apart from purely speculative projects.\nIf adoption continues to expand, particularly through institutional partnerships, XRP could see renewed growth, keeping it firmly among the best crypto to invest in long term.\nFinal Thoughts\nIdentifying the best crypto to invest in long term involves weighing short-term rewards against sustainable growth and utility. BlockDAG currently leads this conversation with a $374 million presale, ROI of 2,660% since batch 1, a batch 29 price of $0.0276, and a record $1.2 million in distributed rewards that highlight its ability to deliver measurable value.\nMeanwhile, BNB offers reliable utility within the world’s largest exchange ecosystem, Tether ensures stability and liquidity management, and XRP provides a pathway toward broader adoption in global payments.\nTogether, these four illustrate the different strengths that can define the best crypto to invest in long term, offering a mix of growth potential, security, and practical application for 2025 and beyond.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

XYZVerse, still trading for less than a dollar, has sparked debate among traders and analysts. Its rapid growth and unique features could set the stage for a major shift in the market by next year.\n$XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI\nXYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game.\nWith the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project.\nWhat sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth.\nFueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto.\n$XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market\nThe $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price.\nLaunch Price: $0.0001\nPrice Now: $0.005\nNext Stage: $0.01\nFinal Presale Price: $0.02\nFollowing the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries.\nSo far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch.\nDemand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns.\nJoin $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions!\nSolana’s Fast Lane: Why SOL Is Catching Eyes This Cycle\nSolana was built for speed. While rivals like Ethereum and Cardano can slow when traffic rises, Solana keeps moving by packing more work into each block instead of adding extra layers. Its design lets developers write apps in several common languages and send thousands of transactions in a blink. The SOL coin is the fuel for all this action. People use it to pay fees, run custom programs, and earn rewards for helping secure the network.\nThe market now favors chains that stay quick and cheap, and Solana fits that mood. Trading volumes for SOL have climbed as new games, art markets, and finance tools launch on the network. Investors like its simple path to growth—no need to split the chain or bolt on fixes. Ethereum still holds the crown for size, but Solana often wins on cost and speed, two big talking points this cycle. If demand for lively, high-traffic apps keeps rising, SOL could remain a standout choice among major coins.\nXRP: The Quick Coin That Wants to Move Money Like Text Messages\nXRP lives on a public digital record called the XRP Ledger. It was built by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz to act like cash made for the internet. Payments race across the globe in seconds, cost a tiny fraction of a cent, and cannot be reversed or faked. Only 100 billion coins exist; 80 billion went to Ripple, the company helping the network grow. Most of that stash sits in escrow, so new coins enter the market in set doses.\nIn today’s cycle, speed and low fees stand out. Bitcoin is trusted but slow. Ethereum is flexible but can be pricey when traffic spikes. XRP avoids both pains, making it handy for everyday transfers or swapping between currencies. Recent talk about cross-border payments and digital dollars shines a light on coins that move fast without a bank account, so many traders see XRP as a strong play while the market looks for the next leader.\nConclusion\nXYZVerse (XYZ) is poised to challenge SOL and XRP by merging sports fandom and meme culture, aiming for significant growth and community-driven success.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Stellar (XLM) is making a strong move after breaking out of a falling wedge pattern and now faces important resistance levels. Meanwhile, XRP is holding near crucial support, with traders watching closely for the next move. Amid these technical shifts, Cold Wallet (CWT) has emerged with an advantage few can match, a working product and significant presale traction.\nWhile Stellar’s rally and XRP’s price defense attract attention, Cold Wallet is driving forward with a $6M presale and a confirmed 3,425% ROI potential. Priced at $0.00998 in Stage 17 with a $0.3517 launch value, CWT is offering early access to real, usable rewards before launch. This is more than market speculation, it’s a project delivering tangible benefits in real time.\nStellar Price Action Signals Breakout Challenge\nStellar has broken out of a falling wedge, often a sign of a bullish reversal. Now trading at $0.4527, XLM is facing a tight resistance band between $0.455 and $0.460. A decisive push above could confirm the breakout and lead to further gains.\nIf resistance holds, immediate support sits at $0.446 on the 9-period EMA and $0.420 on the 50-period SMA. These levels will be key in sustaining the uptrend. XLM’s recent range of $0.315 to $0.455 has shown high volatility and increased trading activity, signaling strong market interest.\nTraders are watching how the price responds at $0.460. A break above this point could fuel more buying, while failure may lead to a retest of lower supports. The current setup puts XLM in a position worth monitoring closely in the short term.\nXRP Battles to Keep Critical $3.17 Level\nXRP is trading at $3.22 with a modest 1.05% daily rise, yet the price is approaching its critical $3.17 support zone. If this level breaks, history suggests a possible slide toward $3.10–$3.15, an area that has provided stability before.\nThe token’s recent rejection at $3.33 shows sellers are still active. A break above $3.40 would be needed to shift momentum in favor of the bulls. Until that happens, sideways price movement remains likely.\nFor traders, $3.17 and $3.40 are the key boundaries to watch. Holding support could trigger a rebound, while a breakdown may point to deeper losses in the near term.\nCold Wallet Rewards Users While Driving Massive Presale Growth\nMost wallets only store assets, but Cold Wallet is designed to reward user actions. Every time you pay gas fees, make a swap, or send funds, you receive CWT cashback. This system keeps users engaged and offers continual rewards.\nFollowing its $270M Plus Wallet acquisition, Cold Wallet now has access to over 2M users before launch. At its current Stage 17 price of $0.00998 and with a confirmed $0.3517 launch, early buyers could see gains of up to 3,425%. Already, $6M has been raised, and 716.6 million coins have been sold.\nThe closer it gets to launch, the higher the presale price climbs. This shrinking window makes early entry more appealing. Cold Wallet’s model blends utility with growth, allowing users to benefit from normal crypto use instead of paying fees without return.\nWith presale progress accelerating, Cold Wallet’s combination of rewards, a proven user base, and strong ROI potential makes it one of the most compelling projects heading into 2025.\nCold Wallet Leads the Way for 2025\nWhile Stellar eyes a sustained breakout and XRP works to defend its support, Cold Wallet is charting a different path. Its rapid presale growth, existing user network, and cashback reward system give it a clear edge.\nWith $6M raised, a strong ROI projection, and millions of users ready for launch, Cold Wallet stands out as a prime candidate for long-term success. For those watching 2025’s top crypto opportunities, this project is already proving it belongs at the top of the list.\nPresale: https://purchase.coldwallet.com/\nWebsite: https://coldwallet.com/\nX: https://x.com/coldwalletapp\nTelegram: https://t.me/ColdWalletAppOfficial\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Big-money investors quietly rotate into positions they think could set off the next big rally. Such inflows lower the amount of tokens in circulation, create strong support levels for price action, and can make retail traders feel like they are missing out (FOMO). Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are three cheap but promising cryptocurrencies that whales have been buying a lot of this week. Here is why they are grabbing attention.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Micro-Cap Gem Attracting Early-Stage Whales\nWhale accumulation isn’t only about chasing established coins. It’s also about getting in before the crowd. That’s precisely what’s happening with Little Pepe, a fast-emerging meme coin already raising eyebrows among big investors. Now in Stage 10 of its presale, Little Pepe has raised over $18 million, selling more than 12 billion tokens at $0.0019 each, up 90% from its Stage 1 price. This presale success is a whale magnet, as it signals heavy early demand and sets up a controlled launch with reduced post-listing risk. Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on hype, LILPEPE is built around a Layer-2 EVM-enabled ecosystem, promising speed, scalability, and low transaction costs. Then, there is Pepe Launchpad, a built-in platform allowing new meme coins to launch directly within the Little Pepe network. This keeps liquidity flowing and ensures ongoing relevance. Add in tax-free buying and selling, sniper bot resistance, a recent smart contract audit by Certik, and a planned CoinMarketCap listing, and the project has a robust post-presale playbook. The cherry on top? A $777K giveaway campaign is boosting community growth while whales quietly build their bags in anticipation of a supply squeeze once LILPEPE hits exchanges.\nCardano (ADA): Whales Betting on a Parabolic Repeat\nCardano has been around long enough to prove its resilience, but whales treat the current setup like a reset button for explosive gains. ADA’s price is consolidating around $0.80, with analysts noting the pattern closely resembles its chart just before a previous parabolic rally to $7.\nCardano Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko\nIn the past 48 hours alone, whales have scooped up over 200 million ADA, showing that deep-pocketed players see the breakout potential. This buying spree is coming as Cardano gears up to break through the key $0.84 resistance. Technical momentum could push ADA to $1 and beyond if that happens. The derivatives market also reinforces the whale narrative, with rising open interest and steadily climbing favorable funding rates, indicating sustained bullish sentiment. ADA is a mid-term bet for whales: a mix of solid fundamentals, major upcoming upgrades, and a favorable market cycle that could push it toward multi-dollar valuations again.\nDogecoin (DOGE): Old King, New Whale Energy\nDogecoin might be the original meme coin giant, but whales aren’t done with it yet. Just this week, DOGE whales purchased a staggering one billion DOGE worth $220 million, all within a single day. This aggressive buying spree is being interpreted as preparation for a long-term rally.\nDogecoin Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko\nAt $0.22, DOGE is significantly below its all-time highs, and investors are relying on two primary factors: the resurgence of mainstream interest in meme coins and the potential policy benefits from rumors that President Donald Trump might issue executive orders that favor certain crypto assets. Historically, DOGE has been a beneficiary of cultural moments and whale-led momentum, and this setup looks no different. The current 13% weekly surge is just the opening move, with some analysts predicting a run to $4 if macro conditions and investor sentiment align. For whales, DOGE offers the liquidity and recognition that make large-scale entries relatively low-risk compared to smaller meme coins.\nConclusion: Whales Are Signaling the Next Movers\nWhale activity is one of the most reliable tells in crypto. This week’s buying patterns show three different strategies: Little Pepe as the early-stage micro-cap with explosive upside potential, Cardano as the mid-cap poised for a technical breakout, and Dogecoin as the veteran rallying behind renewed whale enthusiasm. For retail investors, tracking these moves is less about copying whales' trades for transactions and more about understanding the conviction and positioning behind them. The mix of meme coin energy and solid blockchain plays in this cycle could create the most powerful runs we’ve seen since 2021.

With Bitcoin Penguins ending their presale on August 27th, competition amongst buyers snapping up the last tokens available is heating up.\nIs it possible for a relative newcomer to effectively challenge PENGU's dominance? The numbers suggest so.\nPENGU's impressive empire vs BPENGU's ground-floor opportunity\nPudgy Penguins has evolved into a Web3 brand powerhouse, with physical toys available in Walmart, partnerships with Lufthansa and NASCAR, and over 100 billion views across social media, making it a cultural icon.\nWe’re partnering with @Lufthansa’s Miles & More program, Europe’s largest frequent flyer program to bring rewards to The Huddle.\n— Pudgy Penguins (@pudgypenguins) June 12, 2025\nEvery purchase in fiat or $PENGU on the Pudgy Shop earns you miles, redeemable with 300+ partners for flights, experiences, & more.\nLearn more below. pic.twitter.com/t114Fyypm5\nThe achievements are genuinely impressive. PENGU reached unprecedented heights in late 2024, when Pudgy Penguins launched their PENGU token on Solana in December. This transformed the project from a small NFT collection with 4,000 holders into a massive community with nearly 1 million PENGU token holders.\nThe project airdropped over $1.5 billion worth of PENGU tokens to early believers, with individual Pudgy NFT holders receiving approximately $75,000 worth of tokens per penguin they owned. The PENGU token saw an astounding liftoff, holding at an astonishing $2.1 billion at the time of writing.\nHowever, PENGU's success also limits its upside potential. Current forecasts predict it trading between $0.05 and $0.10 by 2026, representing solid but not extreme gains from current levels of around $0.037.\nBitcoin Penguins targets the gap PENGU left open\nWhile PENGU conquered the Solana ecosystem, it left a massive opportunity untapped: Bitcoin holders.\nBitcoin Penguins tempts all Bitcoin lovers with weekly Bitcoin giveaways worth $120,000 each and an outrageous declared ambition to purchase the entire continent of Antarctica for penguin conservation.\nThe first Bitcoin prize winner was announced not long ago. They held just $17.5 worth of coins—so that’s a potentially life-changing sum.\nMeanwhile, the project's staking numbers show serious early engagement:\n-\nWhale Tier (3 months, 100% APY): 53.67M tokens locked\n-\nFish Tier (2 months, 80% APY): 96.08M tokens staked\n-\nPrawn Tier (1 month, 50% APY): 113.25M tokens committed\nThat’s a total of 263 million tokens already locked before launch, creating a support platform for the project. The confirmed listing price of $0.00198 means current holders have built-in upside before the public starts trading.\nBPENGU also benefits from favorable timing. Current market analysis suggests that meme coins could see significant gains in Q4, with historical data indicating that the final rotation into narrative-driven projects typically occurs in the fourth quarter.\nThe race heats up\nPENGU's established success proves the penguin narrative has staying power.\nBitcoin Penguins launches with the benefit of learning from PENGU's playbook while targeting a wider audience. The $3.4m raised so far is indicative of valuable early momentum, and major influencers from the crypto world are helping to build virality for the meme.\nLIVE.

Rather than relying solely on online hype or speculative trends, BDAG has built a physical presence in sports arenas worldwide. The project’s sponsorship approach pairs global stage visibility with regional depth, creating a funnel that moves from broad awareness to sustained user engagement.\nFrom high-profile European football matches with Inter Milan to high-intensity UFC championship bouts featuring Alex Pereira, and from the loyal fanbases of rugby’s Seattle Seawolves to cricket’s Seattle Orcas, BDAG is consistently in front of audiences that matter. With a presale already raising nearly $375 million, sitting in batch 29 at $0.0276, boasting a 2,660% ROI since batch 1, and over 25 billion coins sold, this multi-channel visibility is directly tied to future adoption potential.\nEuropean Football: The Global Reach Engine\nFor any cryptocurrency aiming to join the top cryptos, global reach is essential, and few platforms deliver it like European football. By partnering with Inter Milan, a club with a fanbase stretching across continents, BDAG secures visibility in some of the most watched broadcasts on the planet. Inter’s matches are not just local events, they are cultural spectacles broadcast to millions in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.\nThis reach transforms BDAG from a niche project into a recognizable name for investors and everyday fans alike. Football sponsorship also creates a sense of credibility, as appearing alongside established, respected institutions helps remove hesitation from first-time buyers. By planting its brand across a sport that thrives on passion and loyalty, BDAG taps into a steady stream of impressions that continue throughout the long football season. This stage of the funnel focuses on making BDAG a familiar name before the wallet is even opened.\nUFC: High-Impact Spotlight Moments\nWhile football delivers a broad, sustained presence, UFC sponsorship gives BDAG the ability to dominate attention in short, high-intensity bursts. In the fight arena, every moment is amplified, camera close-ups, live commentary mentions, and millions of viewers worldwide following the same high-stakes event. Partnering with UFC champion Alex Pereira aligns BDAG with peak performance and resilience, traits that resonate with both sports fans and crypto investors.\nThese events have a unique ability to capture audiences who are fully engaged, heightening recall when they later encounter BDAG through other touchpoints. In a crowded market for top cryptos, it is this kind of concentrated exposure that accelerates decision-making, turning awareness into action. UFC’s younger, digitally native audience is also more inclined toward tech adoption, making it a perfect fit for pushing presale participation and future platform engagement.\nRugby and Cricket: Regional Loyalty and Depth\nBeyond global reach and spotlight moments, BDAG’s inclusion of rugby and cricket sponsorships, through the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas, adds a valuable layer of regional depth. Rugby commands fierce loyalty in markets like the Pacific Northwest, parts of Europe, and Oceania, while cricket dominates in South Asia, the UK, and Australia.\nThese are not casual sports communities; they are tight-knit ecosystems where brands that commit to them gain lasting trust. By investing in these relationships, BDAG positions itself as more than a passing advertiser. In the long-term ROI equation for top cryptos, these connections serve as retention drivers, keeping BDAG relevant even after initial investments.\nIt is in these smaller, yet highly engaged markets that repeat transactions and community-driven growth can thrive. The mix of sports allows BDAG to spread its risk and maximize engagement diversity, ensuring no single audience dominates its adoption path.\nFinal Say\nBlockDAG’s multi-sport sponsorship portfolio is more than a brand play, it is a calculated ROI framework that places it firmly among the top cryptos with a strategy for lasting impact. Inter Milan delivers global reach, UFC provides intense spotlight moments, and rugby and cricket cultivate loyal, regional followings. This layered approach ensures that BDAG is not just seen but remembered, trusted, and eventually adopted by diverse investor segments.\nWith a presale that has already raised nearly $375 million, a current batch price of $0.0276 in batch 29, an ROI of 2,660% since batch 1, and over 25 billion coins sold, the groundwork is set for a significant market presence post-mainnet. The sponsorship mix operates as a full-funnel marketing engine, from mass awareness to deep community integration, designed to turn sports fans into wallet holders and investors into long-term advocates.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

XRP may see strong rebounds, but flipping ETH isn’t on the near-term horizon. While investors focus on this heavyweight match-up, Gemini suggests something else has quietly unfolded, turning from a presale curiosity into a serious contender for 2025’s breakout token. And unlike most meme coins, it’s not coasting on hype alone.\nXRP’s Bull Case: Legal Clarity, ETF Buzz, and AI Backing\nFirst, XRP has recently cleared a significant hurdle; its lengthy legal battle with the SEC is finally behind it. That clarity has restored confidence and sent institutions back to the table. The price has responded in kind.\nSo, what does Google’s AI, Gemini, forecast from here?\n-\nModerate Bull Case: Gemini projects XRP could reach $6.27 in 2025 based on technical breakout patterns and renewed market structure.\n-\nUpside Potential: In a scenario with strong ETF momentum and institutional inflows, Gemini floats targets between $7 and $12, with extreme bullish scenarios reaching as high as $20.\n-\nGuideposts for Pricing: Coinpedia suggests a base target of $5.05 by late 2025, supporting the view of a multi-fold rally.\nRecent regulatory signals add weight. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas sees a potential XRP ETF approval in September or October, now that the SEC has issued refined guidance for crypto ETFs, reducing typical filing delays.\nEthereum’s Crown Isn't Slipping Yet\nDespite turbulence in the market, Ethereum still sits unchallenged on the smart-contract pedestal. The debut of spot ETH ETFs, now trading, gives retail and institutional players an effortless entry point while leaving the on-chain complexity of custody and staking neatly off their balance sheets. Even though the SEC’s approval pathway is opening, and while XRP may rise, overhauling Ethereum's market cap or network effect would require massive adoption shifts. ETH’s institutional momentum and DeFi dominance remain formidable barriers.\nWhat Would It Take for an \"XRP Flippening\"?\nTo genuinely outpace Ethereum, XRP would need more than chart momentum. Those key ingredients include:\n-\nSustained ETF authorization—preferably multiple spot listings turning into tangible investor inflows.\n-\nCross-border payment adoption through Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity platforms.\n-\nBroader ecosystem development—not only price speculation, but tangible enterprise use cases.\n-\nTechnical breakout and confirmation, supported by AI targets and rising volume.\nDespite Gemini’s bullish targets, XRP needs rare alignment across legal, institutional, and sentiment vectors to mount a credible flip challenge.\nLittle Pepe: From Meme Roots to Measured Execution\nLILPEPE’s origins are unapologetically meme-driven, but the execution is anything but random. It’s been designed with the kinds of safeguards and technical choices you usually see in more “serious” crypto projects. Zero-tax trading, EVM compatibility, and sniper bot protection aren’t standard features for a meme token, yet here they’re standard. It’s this balance of lighthearted branding with disciplined structure that’s making seasoned investors take notice. LILPEPE isn’t trying to reinvent the meme coin; it’s refining it.\nMeme coins live and die by attention, but LILPEPE’s team is building hooks that could keep it relevant beyond the first price spike. Plans are already in motion for:\n-\nA meme launchpad to help other creators bring their ideas to market.\n-\nCross-chain tools that make LILPEPE a bridge between ecosystems.\n-\nLayer 2 upgrades that developers might want to work with.\nPresale Momentum Is Peaking\nWith the presale in Stage 10 and over 92% sold, the window for early entry is closing fast. The current price is $0.0019, with listing projected at $0.0030. That’s already a strong incentive for anyone looking to get in before the broader market even has access.\nOnce it hits exchanges, price discovery will depend heavily on how quickly its growing community translates into active buyers, and right now, the signs are promising.\nConclusion\nWhile XRP and Ethereum will keep trading headlines back and forth, the most explosive gains in 2025 could come from a very different place. Little Pepe has the audit, the infrastructure, and the growing user base to stand apart in a meme market otherwise crowded with short-lived experiments. For investors looking for a blend of low-cost entry and credible project design, this must be one of the most interesting bake before the next bull wave crests.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "The $1,000 Bet That Could Become $560,000—Inside Ozak AI’s Millionaire Potential", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/the-1000-bet-that-could-become-560000-inside-ozak-ais-millionaire-potential", "text": "Ozak AI is shaping up to be one of the most thrilling presale projects of 2025, offering crypto buyers an unprecedented opportunity to turn a modest $1,000 stake into a life-changing sum. With its token currently promoting for just $0.005 in its 4th presale stage, the project is concentrated on a $1 release price—representing a 200x soar earlier than it even hits the open market.\nAnalysts are already eyeing a 2026 price target of $2.80, which would flip that identical $1,000 into $560,000 if the forecast holds true. In a crypto marketplace hungry for the following breakout, Ozak AI’s mixture of artificial intelligence, blockchain integration, and early adoption incentives is capturing interest throughout the globe.\nOzak AI’s Presale Mechanics Driving Early Gains\nThe reason such staggering returns are even possible comes down to Ozak AI’s carefully tiered presale structure. At the current $0.005 price, each purchase secures tokens at a massive discount compared to the projected $1 launch value.\nBy locking in early, investors position themselves for substantial paper gains when Ozak AI lists on major exchanges. Each presale stage raises the token price incrementally, which builds urgency and rewards those who act fast. With over $1.85 million already raised and more than 135 million tokens sold, momentum is firmly on Ozak AI’s side.\nWhy the AI Narrative Matters\nArtificial intelligence has been one of the fastest-growing sectors in the global tech economy, and its integration with blockchain is creating entirely new categories of utility. Ozak AI is leveraging AI to deliver a trading platform that provides predictive market insights, automated strategy recommendations, and risk analysis—features that could appeal to both retail traders and institutional players.\nThe AI narrative is proving to be a powerful catalyst for crypto valuations, as investors increasingly seek projects that merge real-world utility with scalable token economies.\nComparison to Market Giants\nTo understand the millionaire potential, it’s worth comparing Ozak AI’s trajectory to that of established giants like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. These projects have delivered huge historical returns, but their massive market caps now limit percentage growth potential.\nA new project like Ozak AI starts from a far smaller base, meaning even modest adoption can translate into outsized market cap gains. For perspective, if Ozak AI reaches just 5% of Solana’s current valuation, early presale buyers could already be sitting on several hundred times their initial investment.\nCatalysts on the Horizon\nOne of the most immediate catalysts for Ozak AI is its scheduled appearance at Coinfest Asia 2025 in Bali. Industry events like this often serve as springboards for awareness, networking, and strategic partnership announcements. If Ozak AI secures major exchange listings or institutional backers in the months following the event, demand for its tokens could surge. Combined with its launch marketing campaign, these catalysts could compress years of price appreciation into a matter of months.\nReal Utility from Day One\nUnlike some speculative tokens that rely solely on hype, Ozak AI’s platform will deliver tangible value from the start. The AI engine will integrate with trading dashboards, enabling users to make data-driven decisions in volatile markets. By providing clear entry and exit points, portfolio optimization tools, and sentiment analysis, Ozak AI aims to position itself as an indispensable tool for traders. The utility factor is key because it encourages token holding and ecosystem engagement beyond simple price speculation.\nThe $560,000 Potential—Breaking Down the Math\nThe math behind the headline figure is straightforward but striking. At $0.005 per token, $1,000 buys 200,000 OZ tokens. If Ozak AI reaches its $1 launch price, that stake would be worth $200,000. Should the 2026 projection of $2.80 materialize, the same holding would be valued at $560,000. This kind of return is virtually unheard of in traditional markets but has precedent in crypto, where early positioning in high-growth narratives has historically produced spectacular windfalls.\nA Narrow Window for Early Movers\nWith each presale stage bringing a higher token price, the current $0.005 entry point won’t last much longer. Once the presale ends and Ozak AI lists on exchanges, the open market will set the price, often with significant volatility in the first few weeks. For those aiming to capture the biggest multiple on their investment, getting in before launch is critical. The growing investor base and strong presale momentum suggest this opportunity is rapidly approaching its peak accessibility.\nOzak AI stands out in 2025 as a rare combination of cutting-edge technology, high-growth market positioning, and early adoption incentives. Its potential to transform a $1,000 stake into $560,000 is not just marketing hype—it’s a plausible outcome if the project hits its launch and growth targets. In a year where AI and blockchain integration dominate the conversation, Ozak AI is emerging as a frontrunner for those willing to take calculated risks in pursuit of extraordinary rewards. For investors scanning the market for the next big breakout, this presale may be the chance they’ve been waiting for.\nAbout Ozak AI\nOzak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.\nFor more, visit\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nTwitter: https://x.com/ozakagi\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Yes, Ripple has its loyal following and the occasional price spike, but let’s be honest—those 1,000× days aren’t coming back. As of writing, XRP trades around the low-$3 range, and even the optimistic forecasts only see it inching toward $5 in the next few years. That’s a safe, steady climb—not the moonshot that turns a small investment into a fortune.\nMeanwhile, some newer coins show the ingredients that have historically created explosive gains—viral community buzz, real infrastructure, presale frenzy, and clear catalysts ahead. Let’s break down three of them—Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), and Hedera (HBAR)—and why they could be your ticket to 1,000× returns by 2027.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE)—Meme Power + Layer-2 Speed\nLittle Pepe isn’t just another meme coin. It’s a Layer-2 blockchain built around meme culture, offering ultra-low fees, lightning-fast finality, and EVM compatibility. Think of it as Ethereum’s faster, cheaper, frog-themed cousin—but with a personality loud enough to grab global attention. As of writing, LILPEPE is in its final presale stage, priced at $0.0019, with nearly $18 million already raised out of a $19.3M target. That kind of presale momentum is rare. Early buyers are betting big because the listing price is $0.003, meaning instant upside potential from day one.\nThe tokenomics are clean: 0% tax on buys and sells, no rug-pull traps, and a healthy allocation to liquidity, staking rewards, and marketing. The project has also passed a full smart contract audit, which adds another layer of investor confidence.\nAnd here’s the kicker: Little Pepe is now listed on CoinMarketCap, fueling more exposure and hype even before launch. To push things even further, the team runs a $777K giveaway, with ten winners each taking home $77,000 worth of tokens. Over 206,000 entries have already poured in, and getting involved is as easy as contributing at least $100 to the presale and completing simple social tasks. Analyst predictions for LILPEPE’s upside range from a modest 12,000% to an eye-watering 46,000% by late 2025. If meme season roars back, it’s not impossible. Drop $250 now, and if the higher end plays out, you could be looking at life-changing numbers.\nPudgy Penguins (PENGU)—From Meme to Mainstream\nPudgy Penguins has already proven it’s not just internet fluff. With strong brand recognition in the NFT world, the project is expanding its token presence. As of writing, PENGU trades between $0.034 and $0.044, with momentum building after breaking out of a falling wedge pattern.\nIt’s riding several bullish waves: rumored ETF interest, fresh exchange listings like Robinhood, and a loyal community that refuses to let go. Short-term gains could be in the 20–25% range with whales quietly accumulating and technical charts flashing green. But the bigger picture is more exciting. If PENGU pushes into mainstream adoption—landing more partnerships and possibly integrating with retail-facing platforms—it could easily see prices in the low-dollar range by 2027. That’s a hefty multiplier from current levels.\nHedera (HBAR)—Enterprise-Grade Growth Potential\nHBAR is the heavyweight of this trio—less volatile and more grounded, but still packing a serious upside. As of writing, it’s hovering between $0.26 and $0.27, down about 50% from its all-time high.\nWhat sets Hedera apart is its enterprise focus. It offers blazing-fast transaction speeds, near-zero fees, and growing adoption in sectors like AI, supply chain, and data authentication. In recent months, a 34% rally has been driven by strategic partnerships and increased on-chain activity.\nCould it hit $2–$5 by 2027? It’s possible, especially if global adoption ramps up. While that’s not a 1,000× play, pairing HBAR with more aggressive bets like LILPEPE and PENGU balances risk with solid growth.\nWhy This Mix Beats Holding XRP\nXRP has stability, but that’s not what small-cap investors are chasing. There’s no hot presale, no viral NFT hooks, and no new Layer-2 buzz. In short, no fresh catalysts. With $250, you need coins that can break out, not just cruise.\nThis trifecta covers three lanes:\n-\nLILPEPE for presale hype, meme-driven virality, and Layer-2 infrastructure gains.\n-\nPENGU for cultural momentum and potential mainstream adoption.\n-\nHBAR for long-term enterprise-backed growth.\nIt’s a balanced yet aggressive approach, designed to chase life-changing upside while spreading risk.\nFinal Thought\nIf you aim to turn $250 into something wild by 2027, playing it safe won’t cut it. Little Pepe’s meme-chain magic, Pudgy Penguins’ brand momentum, and Hedera’s enterprise foundation give you three shots at explosive growth. As of writing, the LILPEPE presale is nearly full, the $777K giveaway is live, and the project is already grabbing attention on CoinMarketCap. That window won’t stay open long. Sometimes the best move in crypto isn’t holding—it’s rotating into the next wave before everyone else catches on. This might just be that moment.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Both proposals aim to list and trade shares on the Cboe BZX Exchange under its Commodity-Based Trust Shares framework.\nIn a filing released on Thursday, the SEC stated the extension would allow “sufficient time to consider” the proposals, which were initially due for a decision on August 17. The maximum 60-day delay permitted under regulatory guidelines will mark the final deadline for approval or denial.\nMarket Reaction and Price Moves\nThe delay comes as Solana’s price trades near $190, down from almost $210 earlier in the week. CoinGlass data recorded $70 million in SOL liquidations over the past 24 hours, reflecting heightened market volatility. The pullback followed hotter-than-expected US inflation data, with the July Producer Price Index rising 0.9% month-on-month, well above expectations of 0.2%. The annual rate climbed to 3.3%, exceeding forecasts of 2.5%, pressuring risk assets across markets.\nDespite the short-term retreat, Solana had touched $209 earlier on Thursday, supported by strong derivatives market activity. CoinGlass noted open interest in SOL futures nearing record highs at $12 billion, suggesting traders are positioning for continued price momentum.\nWider Regulatory Delays\nAccording to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the SEC has also delayed decisions on proposals from Canary Funds and Marinade Finance. Seyffart indicated that further postponements may be limited, with standard spot Solana ETFs likely to be approved by mid-October 2025.\nNate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, told CNBC that he expects a wave of altcoin ETFs to enter the market soon, citing regulatory progress and strong inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum products. He added that such developments could accelerate institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies beyond the two largest digital assets.\nInstitutional Outlook\nAndrejs Balans, Risk Manager at YouHodler, noted that while Solana and other projects like Polkadot are gaining institutional attention, they remain in the “experimental” category for many major capital allocators.\nHe claimed,\n“Only a few of these are likely to survive long enough to gain serious attention.”\nThe SEC’s decision in October 2025 is set to be a key moment for Solana’s push into mainstream investment products. Until then, the market will continue to weigh macroeconomic pressures, regulatory developments, and investor appetite for altcoin ETFs.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The latest hike will take the value of the HINU token from $0.00019690 to $0.00019748.\nHusky Inu is also closing in on another major fundraising milestone as it nears $900,000.\nHusky Inu (HINU) Set For Increase To $0.00019748\nHusky Inu (HINU) is gearing up for its next price increase, which is set to occur in just over eleven hours, as its pre-launch phase continues. The latest price increase will see the HINU token rise from its current value of $0.00019690 to $0.00019748. The project’s regular price increases are part of its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The HINU token’s value was $0.00015000 at the beginning of the pre-launch phase. Since then, it has registered several price increases, utilizing a dynamic pricing system.\nHusky Inu’s pre-launch phase picks up where the presale left off, helping empower the fledgling Husky Inu community and allowing the project to continue its fundraising efforts. It is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The pre-launch phase uses a progressive token pricing strategy to reward early project backers and promote transparent growth.\nAnother Milestone In Sight\nHusky Inu (HINU) is also closing in on its latest fundraising milestone. The project has raised $878,020 so far and is set to cross the $900,000 milestone this month. Husky Inu’s presale and pre-launch phases have allowed it to cross several key fundraising milestones. The project adopted a dynamic and progressive pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, increasing the price of the HINU token every two days. This has allowed the project to raise funds quickly while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering its growing community. Thanks to this dynamic strategy, Husky Inu crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached its latest milestone in record time, crossing $850,000 on July 25.\nSwapCrypto.com\nThe project also announced the launch of SwapCrypto.com last week. SwapCrypto.com is Husky Inu’s very own cryptocurrency exchange, and allows the project to reinforce its commitment to providing value to its nascent user base and building real-world utility. Unlike other memecoins that depend on hype and speculation, Husky Inu is dedicated to its utility and long-term vision. Instead of becoming just another memecoin, it is creating the infrastructure to give its community the tools to engage with digital finance. SwapCrypto.com enhances Husky Inu’s growing ecosystem and solidifies its position in an increasingly competitive DeFi ecosystem.\nVisit the following links for more information on Husky Inu:\n-\nWebsite: Husky Inu Official Website\n-\nTwitter: Husky Inu Twitter\n-\nTelegram: Husky Inu Telegram\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The platform confirmed that the majority of assets remain secured in cold storage and assured customers that their holdings are unaffected. Trading services and Turkish Lira transactions continue without disruption.\nAuthorities have been informed, and BtcTurk says it is working with cybersecurity teams to secure its infrastructure and assess the scale of the breach.\nBlockchain Firms Trace Stolen Funds\nBlockchain security firm Cyvers reported detecting approximately $48 million in suspicious transactions linked to the breach, involving assets such as Ether (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), Arbitrum (ARB), Base (BASE), Optimism (OP), Mantle (MANTLE), and Polygon (MATIC). According to Cyvers, the attacker moved funds to two addresses before initiating swaps.\nLoss estimates vary across analytics platforms. Lookonchain reported at least $23 million stolen, while CertiK put the figure closer to $50 million. CertiK’s data indicates that the stolen assets were moved across three wallets, including two Ethereum addresses.\nRepeat Incident After 2024 Hack\nThe latest breach comes just over a year after a June 2024 incident in which BtcTurk lost roughly $55 million through unauthorized withdrawals from hot wallets. That event prompted swift intervention from Binance, which froze over $5.3 million in stolen funds.\nFollowing the 2024 hack, CEO Özgür Güneri stepped down after seven years, with founder Kerem Tibuk assuming the role of acting CEO. The leadership change was part of BtcTurk’s broader expansion strategy targeting markets in Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific.\nMarket Impact and ETH Price Outlook\nWhile the suspected hack has not triggered a major sell-off, market analysts are watching ETH closely. The attacker’s conversion of stolen funds into Ether could add selling pressure if liquidated quickly. Technical levels place key resistance for ETH at $3,500 and support near $3,000; a break below could open the path to $2,800.\nIf market sentiment treats the breach as an isolated incident, ETH could rebound, supported by ongoing developments in Ethereum’s layer-2 ecosystem. On-chain data shows heightened transaction activity in the attacker-linked wallets, with ETH price fluctuations of around 1–2% in the hours following the breach.\nBitcoin has remained above $60,000, and some traders expect BTC dominance to rise if investors seek perceived safer assets. Institutional flows show mixed sentiment, with certain funds maintaining ETH exposure while others pivot to stablecoins or regulated equities tied to the crypto sector.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Dogecoin Will Hit $1 Years Before Shiba Inu, But This Cheaper Meme Coin Will Get There Before DOGE", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/dogecoin-will-hit-1-years-before-shiba-inu-but-this-cheaper-meme-coin-will-get-there-before-doge", "text": "The competition to create the next meme coin is starting to pick up again. The two frontrunners, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, are being challenged by Dogelon Mars in the race to $0.01. Shiba Inu and Dogelon Mars are planning to compete with Dogecoin in the foreseeable future. While they compete with each other, both are planning to buy back and burn to increase their coin supply and burn mechanism repeatedly. However, a fast-emerging underdog, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE), now in Stage 10 of its presale and trading at just $0.0019, is generating serious momentum. This isn’t just another frog-themed meme token—it’s a Certik-audited, purpose-driven Layer 2 ecosystem that could leap past both DOGE and SHIB in price performance before they even sniff $1.\nDOGE Is Closer Than SHIB, But Still Faces the Weight of Legacy\nDogecoin has stood the test of time better than most expected. Due to its active community and regular support from Elon Musk, Dogecoin has managed to survive multiple market cycles. One issue, however, is Dogecoin's limited uses and the fact that it is an older blockchain, which newer ones are constantly outpacing in development. While it does have a strong cultural significance and a lower token supply, reaching a value of $1 is not likely to happen anytime soon. In contrast, Shiba Inu, despite a vibrant ecosystem and the launch of Shibarium, remains bogged down by its trillion-token supply, requiring enormous market cap growth to reach $1. Even bullish analysts only foresee SHIB hitting fractions over the next few years. Between the two, DOGE clearly has the upper hand in reaching the $1 mark, but it’s still years away unless a market mania-level surge reappears. That’s where Little Pepe comes in—not just as a meme, but as an ecosystem optimized for speed, adoption, and viral growth.\nLittle Pepe ($LILPEPE): A Meme Coin With Real Utility and Zero Tax\nNow in Stage 10 and selling for only $0.0019, Little Pepe is the native utility token of the Little Pepe Layer 2 blockchain, built to redefine the meme coin landscape. Unlike most meme coins that rely solely on hype and community, Little Pepe comes fully packed with infrastructure:\n-\nA fast, EVM-compatible Layer 2 chain built for meme coins\n-\nUltra-low gas fees and instant finality\n-\nA sniper-bot-proof trading environment—a first in crypto\n-\nZero buy and sell tax, making it perfect for active traders and DeFi lovers\nIts smart contracts are secured by one of the most reputable firms in the blockchain industry, Certik. This level of due diligence is rare in the meme coin world and in turn, boosts credibility and investor confidence. With a fixed listing price of $0.003, current buyers at $0.0019 are positioned to gain over 57% instantly upon launch—and that's before factoring in organic growth or CEX listing surges.\nWhy $LILPEPE Could Hit $1 Before DOGE\nThe secret to Little Pepe’s rapid rise lies in its strategic design. The project isn’t just about virality—it’s about velocity. Its tokenomics, capped tax-free structure, and aggressive roadmap (now way ahead of schedule) are crafted to drive both utility and hype. Additionally, the project is backed by anonymous meme veterans who’ve helped several top meme coins reach multi-million-dollar market caps. And with plans to launch on two major centralized exchanges immediately post-presale—and a roadmap targeting the biggest global exchange—visibility and access won’t be an issue. More importantly, Little Pepe is positioned in a way that neither DOGE ever was in their infancy: as a meme coin with its own blockchain, one that hosts a dedicated memes Launchpad, a growing DeFi ecosystem, and community governance in the pipeline. These features give it more in common with early-stage Solana or Polygon than with traditional meme tokens. With its strong fundamentals and high-octane community support, Little Pepe’s journey to $1 could come faster than anyone expects—and certainly before DOGE finishes its own marathon.\nConclusion: The Meme Coin Race Has a New Front-Runner\nWhile Dogecoin may have the edge over Shiba Inu in the race to $1, it’s Little Pepe that could surprise the market entirely by beating both of them to the punch. Backed by advanced tech, Certik-level trust, and meme-powered virality, Little Pepe is more than just hype—it’s a hypercharged, next-gen meme coin ready to dominate. If you're looking for the next breakout star in crypto's meme arena, this frog might just out-hop the dog.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The market’s sharp rise this year has pushed companies to act fast. XYZVerse has entered the scene at a crucial moment, setting plans into motion as momentum grows. The next steps could shape the direction of the industry.\nPrice Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible?\nXYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains.\nThe broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch.\nKey Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market:\n-\nStrong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal\n-\nDeflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure\n-\nLiquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch\n-\nCommunity incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding\nPrice Prediction for $XYZ\n-\nCurrent Presale Price: $0.005\n-\nProjected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates)\n-\nPotential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO)\n-\nLong-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings)\nBuy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains\nRealistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10?\nA 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on:\n-\nStrong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day.\n-\nSustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement.\n-\nMarket Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit.\nIs a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ?\nXYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable.\nInvest in $XYZ Before It Surges\nBitcoin: Digital Cash With No Boss Could Shine Again\nBitcoin is the first online-only money. It was shared in 2009 by the secret figure Satoshi Nakamoto. The coin lives on a public list kept on many computers, so no bank or office can change it alone. People send it directly to each other, like passing cash, but over the internet. To stop cheats, helpers called miners race to solve hard math tasks. When they win, they add the next page to the list and earn new coins. Only 21 million can ever exist.\nThe next reward cut, named the halving, is due soon and will slow the flow of fresh coins. This built-in limit often sparks talk of rising prices when demand stays strong. Big funds and well known firms are showing more interest, while some newer coins still fight for clear uses. Bitcoin’s long track record, open design, and global name give it an edge during shaky markets. Fees can rise when trade is busy, yet many see the coin as digital gold. In the current swing, its tight supply and growing trust could make it look attractive again.\nConclusion\nBitcoin's peak and current bull run spotlight its strength. XYZVerse aims for unprecedented growth by blending meme culture and sports, aspiring to become a cultural icon in crypto.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Find out more about them.\nThe crypto market is heating up, and the ETH price is leading the charge with an impressive climb toward new highs. Riding the wave of institutional adoption, Ethereum’s momentum is attracting serious attention, not just from traders, but from big banks too.\nMeanwhile, Arbitrum’s technical setup hints at a potential breakout, and Unilabs Finance is making waves as an AI-powered DeFi asset manager poised to disrupt the market. Continue reading this article to find out more about these leading projects.\nStandard Chartered Lifts Ethereum Forecast to $7,500 by 2025\nThe ETH price is rising toward new all-time highs, with the coin presently trading around $4,700. This marks a gain of more than 50% in the last month alone, putting it among the top-performing cryptocurrencies. Standard Chartered Bank has taken note of this movement. Their analyst, Geoff Kendrick, just raised his ETH price forecast upward.\nThe bank now expects that the ETH price will reach $7,500 by the end of 2025, up from its earlier estimate of $4,000. Even more optimistic is their long-term vision, which includes an ETH price estimate of $25,000 by 2028, more than doubling their earlier projection of $7,500.\nThis higher adjustment comes as institutional investors pump record amounts of money into Ethereum. According to Standard Chartered data, Ethereum treasury firms and spot ETFs have acquired around 3.8% of all ETH in circulation since early June.\nThis accumulation is 2x as fast as the fastest pace recorded during a comparable Bitcoin buying era, indicating a rising institutional preference for Ethereum, pushing the ETH price upwards.\nArbitrum’s ARB Holds Steady After 23% Weekly Gains\nArbitrum's recent decline has pushed it close to the support zone identified by experts earlier this week. According to CryptoPulse, the $0.51-$0.52 level was the breakout point during the previous rise, making it an important retest zone currently.\nAccording to the latest market data, the Arbitrum price has dropped to $0.5158, up 1.9% on the day, following 23% gains in the previous week. This zone is more than simply a technical number. It shows a battle line between bulls seeking continuation and sellers trying to control.\nThe next few sessions will indicate whether Arbitrum buyers are strong enough to protect it. A hold here would legitimize the breakthrough and open the path to $0.90 in the short term.\nBitcoinsensus also reported a confirmed double-bottom breakthrough on Arbitrum’s daily chart. If this pattern continues, it will strengthen the bullish case for higher targets. The initial stop would be $0.7747, but stronger momentum might push Arbitrum to $1.23 and $1.70.\nUnilabs Finance Raises $32M in AUM: Here’s What's Fueling It!\nAs the altcoin market picks up pace following the ETH price spike to reach its ATH at $5,000, other altcoins like Arbitrum and Unilabs Finance are also seeing a surge in their momentum.\nUnilabs Finance is the world’s first AI-based asset management protocol that aims to automate the investment process through its highly advanced AI-backed features. Unilabs offers its users AI-powered tools and features that can help users grow their portfolios conveniently.\nDespite being at early stages of development, Unilabs Finance has more than $32 million in assets under management (AUM), consisting of four AI-backed funds: BTC, AI, Mining, and RWA funds. Each of these funds caters to a different investor pool, making this platform a place that has something in store for every investor out there.\nTaking one step ahead, Unilabs Finance is also offering a unique system named as Early Access Scoring System (EASS). This system scrutinizes new projects in the market on different parameters like credibility, team backing, tokenomics, technology, and signals to investors when to enter its market. This lets them capture the right opportunity at the right time.\nExperts claim that Unilabs Finance can experience a massive surge in this altcoin season, owing to its AI-utility. It is currently in its presale phase, offering each UNIL token are available for only $0.0097, with the price surging to $0.01 in the next stage, delivering 20% gains.\nThe presale has already raised over $13M in funding from investors all around the world. As per the market experts, now is the perfect opportunity to join Unilabs Finance and become one of its early investors, which comes with its own set of multiple perks.\nDiscover More About Unilabs Finance:\nPresale: https://www.unilabs.finance/\nBuy Presale: https://buy.unilabs.finance/\nTelegram: https://t.me/s/unilabsofficial\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/unilabsofficial\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Both altcoins will most likely pump post-approval, but not enough to turn a modest investment into a millionaire-making jackpot. The truth is, both are already multi-billion-dollar giants. This means the easy 100x gains are long gone. If you’re aiming for life-changing profits in 2025, you need coins still early enough to deliver explosive upside. Such tokens where retail FOMO hasn’t yet kicked in, and where fundamentals or hype can multiply value quickly. That’s where Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and Helium (HNT) come in. LILPEPE is a meme coin with actual infrastructure, while Helium powers a real-world decentralized wireless network. Both are sitting at pivotal growth points, offering the kind of asymmetric opportunity big caps simply can’t.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin Set to Outrun the Giants\nWhile Solana and Dogecoin are awaiting ETF approval, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is quietly building momentum. The project is currently in stage ten at $0.0019. The next stage will see the price increase to $0.0020. So far, over $18.5 million has been raised. 12.36 billion tokens have been sold out of the 12.75 billion for this stage. This rapid sales point to strong community support and a potential for aggressive post-launch rallies. However, it's not hype driving the numbers. It's real utility. LILPEPE isn’t just another meme coin. It’s a hybrid of meme culture and actual blockchain utility. It’s built on Pepe Chain, an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 network purpose-built for meme tokens. The chain offers lightning-fast transactions, near-zero fees, and anti-sniper bot protection. It also features a launchpad, the Pepe's pump pad that's set to rival established names like Bonk.fun and Pump.fun.\nWhy LILPEPE Stands Out:\n-\nEarly Entry Advantage: At under two-tenths of a cent, there’s massive room for exponential growth compared to saturated giants like SOL and DOGE.\n-\nMassive Presale Demand: Moving through presale stages this quickly reflects a passionate and growing community backing.\n-\nMeme Power + Utility: It combines viral meme culture with infrastructure, creating a powerful bullish narrative.\n-\nLiquidity Planning: The tokenomics includes allocation for CEX reserves and liquidity pools. This step ensures smoother market entry and price stability post-launch.\n-\nConfirmed Exchange Listings: LILPEPE has secured listings on two top-tier centralized exchanges. This move sets the stage for broad price discovery and investor access.\nLILPEPE’s microcap status allows even modest adoption post-launch to yield 10x, 50x, or more. Early Shiba Inu investors enjoyed similar trajectories, and LILPEPE is poised to be the next big name in meme coin history. Additionally, the $777,000 giveaway—where 10 winners will receive $77,000 each in tokens—is driving viral growth and social media buzz, attracting thousands of new eyes daily. The community is waxing strong with CoinMarketCap listing and a successful audit, attracting more investors and establishing Little Pepe's credibility. For those looking for a meme coin that merges legendary viral potential with real blockchain innovation, Little Pepe is the breakout story of 2025.\nHelium (HNT): Utility-Powered, Data-Driven, Ready for a Breakout\nHelium (HNT) is carving its path through real-world adoption, which is why it belongs in a millionaire-maker conversation. Helium powers a decentralized wireless network, connecting IoT devices, smart sensors, and more without relying on traditional telecom infrastructure. This is a multi-billion-dollar market that’s only getting bigger as the world shifts toward AI-driven automation and 5G/6G technology.\nHNT/USD 1D Price Chart|Source: TradingView\nHelium’s network migration to Solana’s blockchain this year has dramatically boosted scalability and transaction speed. The result? Lower costs, faster onboarding, and more incentives for node operators to join. This will fuel the network’s rapid expansion. The more devices connected, the more demand for HNT, driving scarcity and price appreciation.\nOn-chain adoption is surging according to Messari:\n-\nCarrier offloading has exploded. Cumulative data transferred via hotspots soared from 1,140.9 TB to 2,721 TB in Q2 2025. This is a staggering 138.5% QoQ increase.\n-\nPaid usage is climbing fast, with average daily mobile paid traffic jumping 70.6% QoQ in Q2 2025. It's totaling 20.6 TB/day. That brings total paid traffic to 5,520.8 TB, reflecting genuine network demand.\nMeanwhile, technical signals show a bullish reversal forming. Price reclaimed support around $3.20. Currently, a bullish double-bottom breakout pattern is emerging that traditionally precedes strong rallies. Additionally, the recent halving on August 1 slashed daily HNT emissions in half, from 15 million to 7.5 million. The introduction of deflationary pressure will enhance upside potential if usage continues climbing. With tangible usage growth and a tightening token supply, Helium sits at the intersection of strong fundamentals and favorable market timing. This is an ideal breeding ground for breakout gains in 2025.\nConclusion\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) and Helium (HNT) stand out as the smart choices for 2025 if you're seeking real breakout potential beyond the hype of massive altcoins. While Solana and Dogecoin benefit from ETF buzz, their sheer size limits explosive returns. LILPEPE’s microcap status and unique Layer-2 infrastructure position it to deliver the kind of life-changing gains investors dream of. Meanwhile, Helium’s real-world wireless network adoption and supply-cutting halving set the stage for strong fundamental-driven growth. Little Pepe is currently in its presale stage, offering a low entry point for investors hoping to catch early gains. With the token launch approaching fast, now is the best time to move. Get in early before the next stage price hike and be part of the meme revolution.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s statement that the US government does not plan to purchase additional BTC also soured investor sentiment. However, Bessent later backtracked on that statement.\nBTC registered a sharp decline after surging to a new all-time high on Thursday. The flagship cryptocurrency reached $124,533 but lost momentum, plunging over 4% to $118,389. However, it has recovered during the ongoing session, up nearly 1% at $119,101.\nEthereum (ETH) buyers lost momentum after it failed to cross $4,800. As a result, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency fell to an intraday low of $4,482 before reclaiming $4,600 and moving to its current level. ETH is down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around $4,650. Ripple (XRP) is down over 3%, while Solana (SOL) is down 2%, trading around $196 after slipping below $200. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) are both down over 4%, while Chainlink (LINK) is down 3.65%, trading at $22.50. Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial declines.\nDunamu And MB Bank Plan Vietnam’s First Licensed Cryptocurrency Exchange\nSouth Korea's Dunamu, the operator of Upbit, has announced a partnership with MB Bank to launch Vietnam’s first licensed cryptocurrency exchange. The partnership will see Dunamu provide technology, infrastructure, and expertise to MB Bank. MB Bank has over $50 billion in assets and 33 million customers. The collaboration will also ensure regulatory compliance, investor protections, and talent development. Dunamu CEO Oh Kyoung-suk stated,\n“Vietnam has potential with more than 20 million virtual asset holders and the world’s fifth-largest inflow of blockchain-based assets. When this growth potential meets the Upbit model, it will be a chance to build Vietnam’s entire digital financial infrastructure on a foundation of trust.”\nThe timing of the partnership is crucial as it comes following Vietnam’s passing of the Law on Digital Technology Industry. The law formally legalizes and regulates digital assets, paving the way for a fully regulated crypto market.\nCoinbase Believes Altcoin Season Could Be Upon Us\nCryptocurrency exchange Coinbase believes there could soon be a shift to cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (BTC), highlighting substantial growth registered by altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Coinbase Institutional’s global head of research, David Duong, stated in a monthly outlook report,\n“We think current market conditions now suggest a potential shift towards a full-scale altcoin season as we approach September.”\nCoinbase joins a growing number of traders and market experts who believe the scales are tipping in favor of an altcoin season. According to Coinbase, altcoin season occurs when 75% of the top 50 altcoins by market capitalization outperform BTC over the preceding 90 days. Duong added that a significant amount of retail capital remained on the sidelines, stating that Federal Reserve easing could unlock greater retail participation.\nAnother factor that could decide the arrival of altcoin season is Bitcoin dominance. Bitcoin dominance fell around 10% to 59% by August, indicating early stages of capital rotation into altcoins. Crypto day trader Ito Shimotsuma stated,\n“Bitcoin dominance has just formed its first monthly bearish cross since January 2021. Back then, altcoins went up only for four months when it happened. Something similar this time will cause an up-only rally till December 2025.”\nDuong believes growing institutional interest in ETH could be the driving factor behind the latest altcoin season. Digital asset treasuries and stablecoin narratives are driving institutional interest in the world’s largest cryptocurrency.\n“With the altcoin market cap climbing and the Altcoin Season Index showing early positive signals, we believe conditions are setting up for a potential rotation into a more mature altcoin season as we head into September.”\nBitcoin (BTC) Purchases Still On The Table\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent walked back on his previous statement that the US government would not buy additional Bitcoin (BTC). Bessent issued a clarification on X, stating that the US was still exploring budget-neutral strategies to buy BTC.\n“The Treasury is committed to exploring budget-neutral pathways to acquire more Bitcoin to expand the reserve, and to execute on the President’s promise to make the United States the ‘Bitcoin superpower of the world.”\nBessent’s earlier statement had dampened investor sentiment, with BTC tumbling from record highs to a low of $117,208 on Thursday.\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\nBitcoin (BTC) crossed $123,000 on Wednesday and settled at $123,365. The flagship cryptocurrency surged to a new all-time high on Thursday, reaching $124,533. However, it lost momentum after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s statement and an adverse PPI report. As a result, BTC plunged over 4%, dropping to a low of $117,208 before settling at $118,289. The current session sees the price up almost 1%, trading around $119,108.\nBTC’s drop below $118,000 led to the liquidation of $227 million in leveraged bullish positions. But why did the flagship cryptocurrency register such a substantial decline after hitting its all-time high? Some analysts believe the 3.3% increase in the US Producer Price Index (PPI) for July prompted traders to become risk-averse, as inflation figures came in higher-than-expected. However, traditional markets recovered their losses, indicating that BTC’s decline was driven by other factors. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the implied probability of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates fell to 61%, compared to 67% a week earlier. This indicates reduced confidence in monetary easing, which weighs on crypto prices.\nMeanwhile, the Bitcoin options market is showing resilience, with the options skew at 3%, indicating a balanced risk outlook consistent with healthy market opportunities. Crypto trader Nebraskangooner believes BTC is beginning to mimic the pattern seen in its previous cycle. On the other hand, crypto trader Kale Abe said that Nebraskangooner’s observations were another instance where “charts and fractals don’t matter.”\n“The only thing that matters is the treasury companies and if they are out of ammo or not.”\nBTC started the previous week in positive territory, rising 0.73% to cross $115,000 and settle at $115,051. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.82% to a low of $112,622 before settling at $114,112. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as BTC rose 0.80% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,028. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price rallied, rising over 2% to cross $117,000 and settle at $117,515. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC was back in the red on Friday, dropping 0.71% to $116,683. The price registered a marginal decline on Saturday before rebounding on Sunday, rising 2.42% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,309.\nSource: TradingView\nBTC reached an intraday high of $122,219 on Monday as bullish sentiment intensified. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $118,701, ultimately dropping 0.51%. Market sentiment turned positive on Tuesday as the price recovered, rising 1.19% to cross $120,000 and settle at $120,113. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to settle at $123,365. The flagship cryptocurrency surged to a new all-time high on Friday, reaching $124,533. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level, dropping over 4% to $118,389. The current session sees BTC up almost 1% as buyers look to reclaim $120,000.\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\nEthereum’s (ETH) rally stalled on Thursday as it failed to cross the $4,800 mark. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency rallied to $4,783 on Wednesday only to lose momentum on Thursday, falling over 4% to $4,551.\nDespite the wobble, analysts remain confident that ETH will hit $5,000 by the end of August. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is trading around $4,600 as the market comes to terms with a hotter-than-expected PPI report. However, users at Polymarket are bullish, thanks to institutional interest, positive technical patterns, and on-chain metrics. Traders have already established levels that ETH must maintain to continue its uptrend. This includes levels around $4,000 and $4,600. According to Rekt Capital, ETH must turn $4,600 into a new support level to confirm its upside into price discovery.\n“The sooner ETH reclaims black, the better. In the event of a failed reclaim, price could reject into its Weekly CME Gap at $4K, with the scope for wicking into the $3,750 zone.”\nETH started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 6% and settling at $3,488. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 3%, slipping below $3,400 to $3,393. ETH recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to reclaim the $3,500 level. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price rallied, rising over 6% to cross $3,700 and settle at $3,721. ETH was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping nearly 3% to $3,612.

However, ETH lost momentum on Thursday, dropping over 4% to $4,551. The current session sees ETH up almost 2%, trading around $4,636.\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\nSolana (SOL) slipped below the $200 mark on Thursday as selling pressure and volatility returned. The altcoin’s impressive rally has seen its value surge, breaking above key resistance levels. Buyers will look to reclaim $200 and push the price towards $250 or higher. SOL crossed $200 on Wednesday after nearly a month. SOL’s rally can be attributed to several bullish developments over the past week. Public companies have upped their SOL purchases to access the blockchain’s staking rewards.\nSOL started the previous weekend with a sharp drop, falling nearly 6% on Friday and settling at $162. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell 2.57%, slipping below $160 and settling at $158. It recovered on Sunday, rising over 2% to reclaim $160 and settle at $162.

Recently, momentum has received an additional boost as CMB International Asset Management (CMBIAM) announced the launch of Asia’s first regulated, publicly offered tokenized USD money market fund on the Solana blockchain. While the direct price impact is still unfolding, the news has added fresh fuel to bullish narratives projecting Solana toward the $300 price level.\nCMB’s Tokenized Fund: A First for Asia\nCMBIAM’s tokenized USD money market fund, developed in partnership with Singapore-based digital asset platform DigiFT, represents a major milestone in blockchain’s integration with traditional finance. Key features include:\n-\nMulti-Chain Access – Available on Solana, Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Plume.\n-\nRegulated Offering – Fully compliant with Singapore’s framework for accredited investors.\n-\nReal-Time Liquidity – Investors can access and redeem holdings without traditional settlement delays.\nBy choosing Solana as one of the fund’s deployment networks, CMBIAM underscores the blockchain’s scalability, low transaction fees, and robust developer ecosystem—qualities that make it an ideal foundation for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).\nOutset PR: Reading Market Trends Before They Happen\nIn the fast-moving crypto market, narrative timing can be as important as the news itself. Outset PR is a crypto-focused communications agency that closely monitors market shifts to help clients position their stories at the perfect moment—just as CMB’s Solana move aligns with growing RWA adoption.\nIf PR has ever felt like navigating a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data-driven strategies. The agency uses both retrospective and real-time metrics to craft campaigns with lasting impact, replacing vague promises with concrete publication plans tied to market-fit narratives and performance-based media targeting.\nUnlike agencies that rely on mass-blast outreach, Outset PR takes a tailored approach, calibrating each campaign to the client’s goals, budget, and growth stage. This personal, research-backed method ensures messaging aligns with product-market reality—maximizing relevance and conversion potential.\nOne of Outset PR’s biggest differentiators is its in-house traffic acquisition system. This combines organic editorial placements with SEO and lead-generation strategies, enabling clients to land on high-discovery surfaces and drive traffic far beyond what conventional PR can deliver.\nAnalytical Edge in Media Targeting\nOutset PR’s internal analytics desk tracks the performance of crypto media outlets across:\n-\nDomain activity\n-\nMonth-on-month visibility shifts\n-\nAudience geography\n-\nTraffic sources\nThese insights allow Outset PR to select the most impactful outlets for each story—raising industry standards for PR targeting. For example, this careful curation boosted user engagement for Step App in the US and UK markets.\nFrom Effort to Outcome\nIn Web3 PR, one of the biggest challenges is the gap between visibility and business impact. Outset PR bridges this with customized, data-backed campaigns that map every stage—from spend to measurable result—ensuring PR investment translates into market presence.\nLearn more about Outset PR’s Services\nMarket Implications for Solana\nInstitutional adoption is a powerful catalyst for blockchain ecosystems. Tokenized money market funds bridge the gap between the $7 trillion traditional money market and the fast-evolving digital asset space, offering:\n-\nCredibility Boost – Institutional-grade offerings lend regulatory confidence and attract conservative capital.\n-\nOn-Chain Activity Growth – Each new RWA product increases transaction throughput and liquidity.\n-\nSustained Demand for SOL – As Solana becomes the go-to platform for institutional deployments, the utility and value proposition of SOL strengthens.\nWhile this launch alone won’t send SOL straight to $300, it builds the structural case for a long-term bullish trajectory—especially if similar institutional initiatives follow.\nTechnical Outlook: SOL’s Path Toward $300\nSource: tradingview\nSolana's price is currently between $167 and $192. It's in the green this week, showing an increase of over 14%. This month, it climbed almost 19%. Yet, it still lags behind a bit over the past six months. The key resistance is at $201, and if Solana breaks past it, it could aim for $226. That's a nice jump from where it sits now. But there's also a safety net nearby at $151 if it dips. With its RSI and other indicators suggesting it might be a touch oversold, there’s room for Solana to grow and shine in the near future.\nConclusion\nCMB International’s tokenized USD money market fund on Solana is more than just a headline—it’s a signal that institutional players are ready to engage with high-performance blockchain infrastructure. Combined with bullish technical setups, the $300 target for SOL is now firmly on the radar.\nIn such a climate, narrative precision matters. Agencies like Outset PR, with their ability to spot market trends early and deploy high-performance media strategies, give blockchain projects the visibility edge they need to ride momentum—turning market events into measurable growth.\nYou can find more information about Outset PR here:\nWebsite: outsetpr.io\nTelegram: t.me/outsetpr\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Bitcoin Dominance Falls Below 60% — Is Altcoin Season Beginning?", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/bitcoin-dominance-falls-below-60-is-altcoin-season-beginning", "text": "Bitcoin’s market dominance has slipped below the 60% threshold, igniting speculation that an altcoin season may be on the horizon. This shift opens the door for alternative cryptocurrencies like XRP and Cardano to capture greater market share and investor attention. With technical setups hinting at possible breakouts, the current environment could mark the start of a broader rally in altcoins.\nIn this analysis, we examine the price action of leading contenders and explore how Outset PR’s data-driven PR strategies can help projects seize momentum during pivotal market transitions.\nBitcoin Surges with Potential for Continued Growth\nSource: tradingview\nBitcoin's current price hovers between one hundred fourteen thousand and one hundred twenty-one thousand dollars. This marks a 2.53% gain over the past week. The price has the potential to climb higher, approaching its next resistance level at around one hundred twenty-three thousand dollars. If it surpasses this level, it might aim for the second resistance at nearly one hundred thirty thousand dollars. That could mean a potential growth of more than 6% from its current high end. While the recent growth is encouraging, its past month shows a slight dip. However, the past six months indicate a strong upward trend, boasting nearly a 21% increase.\nXRP Eyes Growth Amid Market Fluctuations\nSource: tradingview\nXRP is navigating between $2.93 and $3.41. Recent gains hint at a slow climb upwards. Resistance kicks in at $3.63, where reaching this level marks a significant move. A surge to $4.12 could see more than a 20% rise from its low spot. Support lies at $2.67, with a deeper cushion at $2.19. The 10-day average sits below the 100-day, suggesting caution but not ruling out a rebound. XRP has grown over 12% in half a year, hinting at a gradual upward trend. The RSI marks it as being potentially oversold, sparking hopes of a new rally. Enthusiasts watch for steady gains backed by recent positive momentum.\nPR with C-Level Clarity: Outset PR’s Proprietary Techniques Deliver Tangible Results\nIf PR has ever felt like trying to navigate a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data. It builds strategies based on both retrospective and real-time metrics, which helps to obtain results with a long-lasting effect.\nOutset PR replaces vague promises with concrete plans tied to perfect publication timing, narratives that emphasize the product-market fit, and performance-based media selection. Clients gain a forward-looking perspective: how their story will unfold, where it will land, and what impact it may create.\nWhile most crypto PR agencies rely on standardized packages and mass-blast outreach, Outset PR takes a tailored approach. Each campaign is calibrated to match the client’s specific goals, budget, and growth stage. This is PR with a personal touch, where strategy feels handcrafted and every client gets a solution that fits.\nOutset PR’s secret weapon is its exclusive traffic acquisition tech and internal media analytics.\nProprietary Tech That Powers Performance\nOne of Outset PR’s most impactful tools is its in-house user acquisition system. It fuses organic editorial placements with SEO and lead-generation tactics, enabling clients to appear in high-discovery surfaces and drive multiples more traffic than through conventional PR alone.\n|\nCase in point: Crypto exchange ChangeNOW experienced a sustained 40% boost in reach after Outset PR amplified a well-polished organic coverage with a massive Google Discover campaign, powered by its proprietary content distribution engine. |\nDrive More Traffic with Outset PR’s In-house Tech\nOutset PR Notices Media Trends Ahead of the Crowd\nOutset PR obtains unique knowledge through its in-house analytical desk which gives it a competitive edge. The team regularly provides valuable insights into the performance of crypto media outlets based on the criteria like:\n-\ndomain activity\n-\nmonth-on-month visibility shifts\n-\naudience geography\n-\nsource of traffic\nBy consistently publishing analytical reports, identifying performance trends, and raising the standards of media targeting across the industry, Outset PR unlocks a previously untapped niche in crypto PR, which poses it as a trendsetter in this field.\n|\nCase in point: The careful selection of media outlets has helped Outset PR increase user engagement for Step App in the US and UK markets. |\nOutset PR Engineers Visibility That Fits the Market\nOne of the biggest pain points in Web3 PR is the disconnect between effort and outcome: generic messaging, no product-market alignment, and media hits that generate visibility but leave business impact undefined. Outset PR addresses this by offering customized solutions. Every campaign begins with a thorough research and follows a clearly mapped path from spend to the result. It's data-backed and insight-driven with just the right level of boutique care.\nCardano Eyes Growth as ADA Shows Strong Momentum\nSource: tradingview\nCardano's ADA is making waves in the crypto market. Its price is in the upper seventy-cent range, testing the lower eighty cents. A strong 21% increase in the last week and a 22% rise over the past month signal potential upward momentum. Resistance looms at ninety-one cents, with further gains possible toward a second resistance of slightly over a dollar. Such a rise could mark growth in the region of 24% from its current position. Support sits at the mid-sixty-cent range, providing stability against dips. Despite the cautious optimism, ADA's moderate RSI suggests more room to grow. Investors eye this native token closely for its breakout potential.\nConclusion\nA decline in Bitcoin’s dominance often signals that capital is rotating into altcoins, creating opportunities for substantial gains in well-positioned projects. With XRP eyeing key resistance and Cardano building on recent strong momentum, the stage may be set for notable upside in the altcoin market.\nFor teams looking to amplify their visibility and leverage this shift, Outset PR’s data-led, market-aware approach ensures narratives are delivered at the right time, in the right places, to the right audiences — turning market trends into tangible results.\nYou can find more information about Outset PR here:\nWebsite: outsetpr.io\nTelegram: t.me/outsetpr\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Eyes $7,200 With Uptrend Intact, While Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Sets Sights on $0.50", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/ethereum-eth-price-eyes-7200-with-uptrend-intact-while-little-pepe-lilpepe-sets-sights-on-050", "text": "Ethereum (ETH) keeps showing its power, now priced near $3,800, and a lot of bullish voices are pointing to a possible climb to $7,200. That upbeat vibe is rippling through the whole altcoin market, and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is popping up as a hot new contender.\nEthereum's Bullish Setup Points to $7,200\nEthereum has been hanging tight above $3,500, forming higher lows that keep the climb steady. Analysts tell us that the latest move up looks like a solid continuation signal. The buzz is coming from deep-pocket investors and a solid rise in activity on decentralized apps, and both are pushing the charts in a positive direction. On-chain info shows that a bunch of wallets are quietly stacking more ETH, and the open interest in ETH futures is climbing, too. With all these signals lining up, many believe ETH could soon test $4,200, with some now eyeing a longer talk of a $7,200 target that a few market watchers have pinned on the horizon.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): Built for Speed, Backed by Community\nWhile Ethereum targets higher ground, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is catching serious attention with its creative take on the meme coin narrative. More than just another token riding the wave of humor and virality, LILPEPE is built on a Layer 2 solution, optimized for high transaction throughput, minimal fees, and network security, all while maintaining its identity in the meme coin space. With a playful, yet strategic vision, Little Pepe pays homage to the meme coin king, Pepe, while carving out its own identity through community strength, presale momentum, and planned listings on major centralized exchanges (CEXs).\nPresale Momentum Powers LILPEPE’s Rise\nLILPEPE’s presale performance has been exceptional. Already into stage 10, the project has raised over $19.84 million, signaling strong early support. The current price in this stage sits at $0.0019, with 1.5 billion tokens available for purchase and a target of raising $2.85 million before moving to the next phase. The presale structure reflects careful planning, with 26.5% of the total 100 billion token supply allocated to early supporters. The remaining distribution is as follows:\n-\n10% for liquidity\n-\n30% for chain reserves\n-\n10% DEX allocation\n-\n10% marketing\n-\n13.5% staking & rewards\n-\n0% tax\nThis distribution provides a clear path for both short-term liquidity and long-term ecosystem development.\n$0.50 Price Target: Ambitious but Not Impossible\nLILPEPE’s goal of reaching $0.50 may seem bold, but in the meme coin space, bold targets often define success. With a launch price under one cent, a move to $0.50 would represent over 26,000% in potential gains. According to market analysts monitoring presale tokens with growing hype and strong fundamentals, LILPEPE checks many of the boxes needed for a viral surge. Limited supply, growing community traction, clear tokenomics, and upcoming listings on two top-tier CEXs, plus the biggest global exchange, are ingredients that could support exponential growth. If Ethereum continues to rally, meme coins with strong narratives and early community engagement stand to benefit most. LILPEPE seems to be in a favorable position to ride that momentum.\nListings, Exposure, CMC Recognition, and Massive Giveaway\nThe team behind Little Pepe is setting the stage for a well-timed market debut. The token is already listed on CoinMarketCap, offering credibility and exposure ahead of launch. With plans confirmed for listings on two leading CEXs and the largest exchange globally, the launch strategy looks aligned with what investors often seek: visibility, liquidity, and community-driven growth. A major part of LILPEPE’s success lies in its vibrant and engaged community. To reward early supporters, the team has announced a giveaway for 10 winners, each receiving $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. With over 195,000 entries, the excitement is undeniable.\nConclusion\nEthereum’s momentum shows no sign of slowing, and its bullish setup continues to act as a catalyst across the altcoin landscape. Little Pepe (LILPEPE), with its creative identity, fast-selling presale, and solid ecosystem plans, is emerging as one of the most talked-about meme coins in recent memory. Its $0.50 target is ambitious, but with over $19.84 million raised, major listings on the way, and an energized community behind it, LILPEPE may just be getting started. Now still in presale stage 10, the clock is ticking for early supporters to get in before its major launch, and possibly, its parabolic rise.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

There is the possibility that Bitcoin could go a lot higher. However, for traders looking to maximise their gains, albeit by also partaking in a huge amount of risk, the memecoins are the go-to trade. $DOGE, $PEPE, and $PENGU are favourites, but which will perform the best?\n$DOGE back in a strong uptrend\nSource: TradingView\nThe 8-hour time frame for $DOGE shows the steady uptrend since June of this year. A swing high in July did take the price to $0.28, which was followed by a big dip, but as can be seen, the price is back above the ascending trendline, and with the short-term time frame Stochastic RSIs at the bottom, the bulls would hope to make another higher high in this latest mini uptrend.\nSource: TradingView\nLooking at $DOGE on the weekly time frame it can be noted that the last swing high took the price to the 0.618 Fibonacci extension. The bulls will need to take $DOGE above this in order to avoid a failed rally. The 0.786 Fibonacci at $0.59 is a good target.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the MACD shows the indicator line nicely above the signal line, while the first green histogram bars are printed. Expect these indicator lines to continue to rise.\n$PEPE price inside an ascending triangle?\nSource: TradingView\nFor $PEPE, could it be that the price action is traversing within an ascending triangle? If so, this would be very bullish. The bulls will first need to push the price beyond the $0.000012 horizontal resistance, but then the top of the ascending triangle comes in at $0.000014. If the bulls can push the price through both barriers, the measured move could take the price to $0.000022.\n$PENGU price forming a bull pennant\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily chart for $PENGU shows some of the incredible rise that this memecoin has experienced. From bottom to top, the gain was around 1,130%.\nMany might have thought that after such incredible gains the $PENGU price would start a major retracement. Far from it. Instead, the price has chopped sideways and downwards and a pennant formation is taking shape. This is a bullish continuation pattern. If the bulls can send the price out of the top of the pennant, the measured move could take the price out to $0.065 - another 2x. Not bad for a memecoin that has already made such large gains.\nConclusion\nWhile $PEPE and $PENGU might be pretty good, if risky bets, $DOGE is still the king of the memecoins, and if it is a race between these three, $DOGE has the name and the possibility, no matter how dubious, that it could still be used by Elon Musk as a future payment option, perhaps on X.

Dogecoin (DOGE) support analysis shows stability at $0.21, signaling a potential 30% surge if the buying pressure continues.\nYet, Cold Wallet(CWT) is rewriting the rulebook altogether. With a cashback-first model, $6 million raised, and Stage 17 priced at $0.00998 against a $0.3517 listing, it offers a 3,423% ROI potential. Compared to ADA’s steady climb and DOGE’s meme-fueled volatility, Cold Wallet’s market-ready adoption edge could make it the most lucrative move in 2025.\nCardano Eyes $1 Breakout as Whales Scoop Up 200M ADA\nCardano (ADA) is holding strong near $0.81, and recent whale activity has grabbed attention; 200 million ADA tokens shifted into large wallets in just 48 hours. Analysts are watching the $0.84–$0.88 zone closely: a decisive move above this resistance could pave the way toward the psychological $1 milestone.\nOn-chain indicators show moderate bubble risk, suggesting market strength without overheating and that the rally could be sustainable. The long-term ascending trendline remains intact, adding technical support to the bullish thesis.\nWith whales accumulating, the scattered chart strength, and a reasonable momentum, a move beyond $1 could trigger renewed buying and broader momentum. For long-term investors, Cardano’s setup now offers a potentially favorable entry ahead of a breakout.\nDogecoin Eyes 30% Surge As Whale Buying Signals Strength\nDogecoin (DOGE) has found its footing around the $0.21 support level; a zone that previously sparked strong rallies. Analysts suggest that as long as DOGE holds above this level, it could launch a 30% upside move toward approximately $0.26. This outlook follows a recent rebound from a pullback near $0.20, with buyers stepping in at key price points.\nNotably, large holders accumulated over $200 million worth of DOGE in a single day, signaling renewed confidence and fueling bullish sentiment. Technical indicators are lining up in DOGE’s favor. Patterns such as a rounded bottom and a potential MACD golden cross suggest broader momentum may follow. For speculative traders and meme-coin enthusiasts alike, this setup combines clear entry levels with evidence of strong buying demand.\nCold Wallet’s $6M Presale Turns Fee Refunds Into Growth Power\nCold Wallet is removing two of the biggest barriers to Web3 adoption: high participation costs and slow onboarding. Instead of letting gas, swap, and transfer fees drain user value, Cold Wallet refunds them directly, making every action inside the ecosystem a value-positive event. This cashback-first model builds loyalty from the first transaction, creating a reason for users to stay active long-term.\nThe integration of Plus Wallet supercharges this launch. Over 2 million pre-existing accounts are already connected, meaning Cold Wallet begins at scale on day one. This is not a theoretical roadmap; with $6 million raised and more than 716 million tokens sold, it is already a fully funded build in motion.\nStage 17 of crypto presale pricing is set at $0.00998, compared to a fixed $0.3517 listing goal, offering an eye-catching 3,423% potential ROI. Early buyers in Stage 1 entered at $0.007 and are already seeing measurable gains. With each stage sold, that profit gap closes, adding urgency for new participants.\nFor those looking for a market-ready crypto project with adoption, liquidity, and incentives already in place, Cold Wallet delivers an ecosystem designed for rapid scale, and the window to enter at its current price is closing fast.\nWhy Cold Wallet Holds the Real Edge\nCardano (ADA) bullish outlook points toward a breakout, and Dogecoin (DOGE) support analysis teases a short-term rally, but neither offers the built-in adoption advantage Cold Wallet commands. By refunding fees and onboarding over 2 million Plus Wallet users instantly, Cold Wallet enters the market with scale, liquidity, and retention hardwired from day one.\nStage 1 buyers at $0.007 are already ahead, and each presale stage narrows the profit gap toward the $0.3517 listing. In a year where the strongest plays will be those that merge utility with immediate traction, Cold Wallet is not just riding the market; it is positioned to reshape it entirely.\nExplore Cold Wallet Now:\nPresale: https://purchase.coldwallet.com/\nWebsite: https://coldwallet.com/\nX: https://x.com/coldwalletapp\nTelegram: https://t.me/ColdWalletAppOfficial\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

With SHIB, PEPE, and rising contender XYZVerse each drawing crowds, the race heats up. Some hope to spot the token poised for huge gains in the coming market surge. Which one could deliver a life-changing return as excitement builds among traders?\nXYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin?\nThe buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch.\nThe current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price.\nBullish Mood on $XYZ\nXYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow.\nXYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster, who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.”\nMore Than Just a Meme Coin\nUnlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value.\nRight now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention.\nStill Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends\nBeyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time.\nA Community-Driven Project With Big Plans\nOne thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility.\nThe recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use.\nAs part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem.\nCould XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin?\nWith a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look.\nJoin XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity\nShiba Inu (SHIB)\nSource: TradingView\nSHIB trades between 0.00001227 and 0.00001447, pushing above both short and long averages. A 1-week jump of 11.84% shows fresh energy after a slow 4.08% climb over the past month. Even with a 17.47% slide in 6 months, momentum is tilting back to buyers.\nThe 10-day average at 0.00001396 now sits over the 100-day line at 0.00001351. RSI reads 47.76 and the stochastic sits near 34, both hinting that room still exists before the coin looks stretched. MACD hangs just above zero, signaling mild upward pressure rather than a sharp spike.\nIf volume keeps building, the nearest ceiling at 0.00001536 may come into play. A break there opens a path to 0.00001756, about 22% above the top of the current band. Failure to hold gains drags the coin toward the floor at 0.00001096, roughly 18% below today’s low. A deeper pullback could test 0.000008766, but the recent upside swing and improving averages suggest SHIB has a better shot at nudging higher than melting lower in the short term.\nPepe (PEPE)\nSource: TradingView\nPEPE has swung both ways this spring. The coin gained 14.32% in the past week after drifting just 1.28% lower over the month. A 17.47% six-month climb shows steady traction. Today the price hovers between 0.00001046 and 0.00001315, rubbing against the 10-day SMA at 0.00001230 and the 100-day SMA at 0.00001195. That tight cluster signals a market that is pausing but not tired.\nMomentum tools lean to a cautious upside. RSI sits at 44.65, almost neutral, while the Stochastic reading of 21.97 hints at an oversold patch ending. MACD edges into the green at 0.0000000359. If buyers clear the nearest ceiling at 0.00001424, the door to 0.00001693 opens. That break would add roughly 30% from the lower bound of today’s range and about 20% from the current mid-price.\nSupport at 0.00000886 is the line bulls must defend; a dip there means a 25% slide from current levels and could drag price toward the deeper floor at 0.00000617, another 30% lower. Given the half-year uptrend and fresh weekly pop, probability tilts toward a slow grind higher, yet the narrow range shows the market will demand clear volume before any decisive leap.\nConclusion\nSHIB and PEPE show promise, but XYZVerse stands out with its unique sports and meme blend, aiming for huge growth and community-driven success.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

On 15th of August, Ethereum has tested the $4,750 mark, signaling strong momentum as altcoin season indicators turn positive.\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index leaning toward greed and the Altcoin Season Index showing an upward trend, market sentiment is shifting toward altcoins, creating a favorable backdrop for new and emerging projects. Pepeto, the Ethereum-based meme coin, is approaching the close of Stage 9 of its presale after raising $6,187,248 in total. With a price of $0.000000147 per token, the project continues to attract attention from both meme coin enthusiasts and the wider crypto market.\nStage 9 Nearing Completion: Pepeto Presale Interest Holds Strong\nStage 9’s momentum reflects consistent investor attention. Each stage has moved quickly, and demand has been supported by Pepeto’s clear utility roadmap. Not relying solely on viral hype, Pepeto’s core value lies in its exchange platform, which is already set to list the next wave of meme coins in 2025. Applications for legitimate Web3 projects are open, and a demo version of the exchange has been showcased across social channels, a move that positions the project for sustained relevance.\nCommunity Engagement Meets mid August 2025 Market Timing\nPepeto’s rise comes during favorable market conditions, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index leaning positive and altcoin season beginning to take shape. The project reports strong engagement across social platforms, contributing to visibility in a competitive market. Its appeal is further supported by two independent audits, from SolidProof and Coinsult, reinforcing transparency and security. Known for its subtle connection to one of the biggest names in meme coin history, Pepeto carries the same 420 trillion token supply as Pepe, with its name born from a playful twist, taking “P E P E” and leaving “T O.” This tie to meme culture, combined with its focus on real infrastructure, is helping it stand out during a busy presale season.\nThis diligence has drawn attention from more cautious investors seeking credible opportunities in the meme coin sector.\nWhat’s Next for $PEPETO?\nWith Stage 9 nearly complete and the token’s public debut drawing closer, Pepeto enters a decisive phase. The funding raised so far provides a strong base for initial liquidity and visibility once trading begins. As the presale moves toward its final stages, market watchers will be looking at how Pepeto leverages its exchange, PepetoSwap, cross-chain bridge, and 245% staking rewards to capture attention in a sector driven by both community and innovation.\nAbout Pepeto\nPepeto is an Ethereum-based meme coin combining viral appeal with functional utility. Its ecosystem includes a zero-fee exchange, PepetoSwap technology, a cross-chain bridge, and high-yield staking. Built to merge meme culture with lasting infrastructure, Pepeto’s mission is to create a secure and accessible environment for trading and community growth, backed by audited smart contracts and an engaged global following.\nDisclaimer:\nTo buy PEPETO, make sure to use the official website: https://pepeto.io.

With just $100, early buyers saw returns of over $20,000 as DOGE surged nearly 22,000%. The same question now looms as the 2025 bull run approaches: Which token will be the next DOGE? Analysts at X (formerly Twitter) ran the question through Grok, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot trained on real-time financial data, social sentiment, and market structure to find the answer. Grok didn’t hesitate. When asked to name the meme coin most likely to replicate DOGE’s historic rise, it gave a surprising answer: Little Pepe (LILPEPE). Here’s why Grok AI—and an increasing number of human analysts—believe LILPEPE could turn $100 into $22,000 by 2026.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): More Than a Meme, It’s an Entire Blockchain\nGrok’s pick may sound like another frog-themed meme coin, but Little Pepe is far more than a meme—it’s an entire Layer-2 blockchain dedicated to powering the next generation of meme tokens. In a space crowded with ERC-20 tokens offering little more than hype, Little Pepe stands apart as the only memecoin project building its infrastructure. The team is launching a lightning-fast, ultra-low-cost Layer-2 network explicitly tailored for meme coins. No more clogged networks. No more $50 gas fees. No more sniper bots front-running presales. This is the first meme coin blockchain ever created, and the $LILPEPE token powers it all—from transaction fees and staking to launching new projects via its built-in meme coin launchpad.\nCurrent Presale Stats: You’re Still Early\nLILPEPE is in Stage 10 of its presale with the following key stats:\n-\nPrice per Token: $0.0019\n-\nNext Stage Price: $0.0020\n-\nUSD Raised: $16,583,704 of $19,325,000\n-\nTokens Sold: 11.3B of 12.75B\n-\nPresale Progress: 88.68%\nWith just over 10% of presale tokens remaining, Grok’s pick still offers an ideal entry for early believers. The presale outperformed expectations, signaling immense community support and early momentum. Even a modest investment—say $100—gets you over 52,000 LILPEPE tokens at the current price. If the token rises to just $0.42 (a realistic target by bull market standards), that $100 could become $22,000—just like Dogecoin in 2021.\nWhy Grok AI Chose Little Pepe Over Other Meme Coins\nGrok’s selection wasn’t random. The AI based its pick on on-chain metrics, tokenomics, community activity, and narrative strength. Here's what stood out:\n-\nLayer-2 Chain Focused on Meme Coins\nUnlike other tokens that run on Ethereum or Solana, Little Pepe has its blockchain. This gives it full control over speed, gas fees, and scalability—optimized for meme coins. It’s the first chain designed to support viral tokens, making it the most important infrastructure project in meme coin history.\n-\nZero Tax and CertiK-Audited\nMany meme coins impose hefty taxes on buys and sells. LILPEPE imposes zero tax, making it ideal for trading and liquidity. Even more impressive, the project was audited by CertiK—one of crypto’s most respected security firms—with a score of 95.49%. This reduces smart contract risk and boosts investor confidence.\n-\nBacked by Proven Meme Coin Veterans\nThe team behind Little Pepe includes anonymous experts who’ve helped launch and scale several top-50 meme coins in the past. With their track record of viral growth and exchange listings, LILPEPE could be the next major player in the meme coin arena.\n-\nMajor Exchange Listings Confirmed\nAt launch, LILPEPE will debut on two top-tier centralized exchanges, giving it instant credibility and liquidity. Rumors also suggest plans to list on the world’s largest exchange, although the name has not been confirmed. This CEX momentum could spark a surge similar to DOGE’s listings in 2021.\nTokenomics: Built for Growth and Security\nLILPEPE’s carefully structured tokenomics model is built to support growth while ensuring liquidity and ecosystem sustainability:\n-\n26.5% – Presale Allocation\n-\n30% – Chain Reserves\n-\n13.5% – Staking & Rewards\n-\n10% – Liquidity Provision\n-\n10% – DEX Listing & Market Making\n-\n10% – Marketing\n-\n0% – Tax on Transactions\nThe presale benefits early adopters, while the 30% chain reserve ensures the long-term health of the Layer-2 network. A dedicated marketing allocation fuels campaigns, influencers, and meme virality—crucial in today’s hype-driven meme coin world.\nCommunity and Giveaway Fueling Hype\nLittle Pepe’s growing community has already generated serious buzz online. The team has launched a $777,000 giveaway to celebrate the presale and upcoming launch:\n-\n10 winners will each receive $77,000 in LILPEPE tokens\n-\nTo enter: contribute at least $100 to the presale and complete a few social tasks (e.g., follow, share, tag)\nThis campaign is driving significant exposure and onboarding thousands of new holders—similar to the early viral marketing seen with SHIB and DOGE.\nAnalysts Agree: This Could Be the Next Breakout\nWhile Grok’s pick may have surprised some, it’s increasingly aligned with human sentiment. Crypto analysts are beginning to call LILPEPE the sleeper hit of the next bull market.\nWhy? Because it combines:\n-\nViral meme potential\n-\nStrong fundamentals\n-\nReal utility via its blockchain\n-\nMassive presale adoption\n-\nSecurity via CertiK audit\n-\nUpcoming Tier-1 listings\nThis makes LILPEPE more than just a gamble—it’s a calculated bet with asymmetric upside.\nFinal Thought: $100 Today, $22,000 Tomorrow?\nWe’ve seen it before. In 2021, Dogecoin soared from obscurity to glory—and minted thousands of new millionaires. Could 2025 be the year LILPEPE writes a similar story? Grok AI thinks so. And with LILPEPE still under $0.002, the math is simple: $100 could become $22,000—if this frog-themed blockchain pulls a Dogecoin-level moonshot. With less than 12% of presale tokens remaining and the next stage price approaching, now may be your last chance to board this meme train before it takes off.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

However, the real bombshell was Treasury Secretary Bessent’s comment that the US would not be buying Bitcoin for its Strategic Reserve, a comment that he may now have walked back on.\nAwful US PPI data\nSome pretty awful Producer Prices data was released on Thursday which put the skids under the Bitcoin price. It showed that the Producer Price Index had risen 3.3% on an annual basis last month compared with a forecast figure of a 2.5% gain. This could even have implications for the expected rate cut in September.\nBessent not buying - then buying again\nHowever, what really sent the Bitcoin price into collapse mode was U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent’s statement during an interview on Fox News that the US government would not be buying Bitcoin to add to its Strategic Reserve.\nNotwithstanding, only a few hours later in a post on X, the Treasury Secretary appeared to contradict his earlier statement by affirming the following:\nTreasury is committed to exploring budget-neutral pathways to acquire more Bitcoin to expand the reserve, and to execute on the President’s promise to make the United States the “Bitcoin superpower of the world.”\nWhether Bessent miscommunicated in his Fox News interview, or whether he meant what he said, it would seem that the second statement has put Bitcoin purchases back on the agenda.\nDip results in closing CME gap and retesting bull flag\nSource: TradingView\nIf it wasn’t for the trigger of the two valid shocks to the market, one might have thought that the recent sharp dip in price was highly manipulated. Not long after making a new all-time high, the $BTC price fell precipitously all the way down to close the CME gap and retest the top of the bull flag. If you also throw into the mix the fact that short-term momentum indicators were able to reset, the collapse may have had a silver lining.\nRight now the $BTC price is up against the $119,000 horizontal resistance level. It would be expected that there may be a pause here, but given the bounce from the Stochastic RSI indicators, the pause might only be temporary.\nBulls need to get $BTC price back on track\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily chart shows the trend breaks in the price action and also in the RSI. For both it can be observed that it wouldn’t take too much for the price to get back above those uptrends. Concentrating on the RSI, it will be important for the indicator line to rise above the descending trendline (black line) in order to get back on track.\n$119,000 is the important level to hold over the weekend\nSource: TradingView\nThe weekly time frame view for $BTC reveals a candle that is far from good looking. The bulls will be hoping that the candle becomes green and fills up over Friday and the weekend. Even if this doesn’t really happen, the main thing is to stay above what is starting to become a strong level of support at $119,000.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the RSI illustrates how important it is for the indicator line to finally break through the descending trendline.

Without ruling out a possible fluctuation, analysts have been doubling down on DOGE and Unilabs Finance (UNIL). While the Dogecoin price could go parabolic soon, UNIL is considered the best new crypto to invest in due to its blend of AI, DeFi and TradFi.\nIs the Ethereum Price Poised for a Pullback?\nThe Ethereum price crossed $4,700 this week, but the Ethereum Foundation has been quietly selling off ETH. According to recent reports, $31.5 million in ETH was sold this week, coinciding with Monday’s record $1 billion in ETF inflows.\nIs a pullback on the horizon? Following the 30% Ethereum price rally on the weekly chart and a 60% gain over the past 30 days, a correction can’t be ruled out. Moreover, momentum has been declining, as shown by the unimpressive daily trading volume.\nAdditionally, according to IntoTheBlock, there has been a decreasing netflow of $296 million over the past seven days, signaling increasing sales. While the Ethereum price is bound to break out above the 2021 high of $4,891, we might witness a pullback first before a bounce.\nIs the Dogecoin Price Ready for Its Big Leap?\nThe Dogecoin price soared by 30% over the past month, hovering above $0.25 from a 30-day low of $0.18. Momentum has been rising, evident in the 50% increase in the daily trading volume to $4.28 billion.\nJMarks, unrelenting in their optimistic Dogecoin price prediction, eyes $1.20 this cycle. If this forecast plays out, the dog-inspired crypto will trade significantly above its 2021 ATH of $0.73, making it a top pick this year.\nMeanwhile, according to Messari, mindshare is high, suggesting growing investor interest. A retest of $0.28 is expected to push the Dogecoin price above $0.35, a move experts believe could play out in the coming days.\nUnilabs Finance (UNIL) — What Makes it the Next Big Thing?\nUnilabs Finance (UNIL) is unique in the sense that it combines three of the most bullish narratives: AI, DeFi and TradFi. At this crossroads, it has been hailed as a game-changer, with its unique offering revolving around a novel AI-backed DeFi asset manager.\nMoreover, as a presale token, it is significantly undervalued and heavily discounted, currently available at $0.0097 in its sixth ICO stage. With a 415% gain programmed at the listing price of $0.05, it is arguably the best new crypto to invest in—a better alternative than top altcoins with large market caps.\nMoreover, over $12.8 million has been raised by the team in funding, highlighting massive investor interest. Key features of this decentralized asset manager include a self-custodial asset vault and a cross-chain trading hub (users can trade across multiple blockchains). Hence, it edges out Uniswap, a leading DEX on Ethereum with a $7.5 billion market size and stands out more thanks to its yield-sharing strategy and periodic airdrops.\nClosing Thoughts\nWhile the Ethereum price faces a potential downtrend, the Dogecoin price is poised to explode amid rising momentum. At the same time, UNIL, a fast-growing AI token, is seen as the best new crypto to invest in due to its strong growth potential and connection to traditional finance (TradFi).\nFor more information about Unilabs Finance (UNIL) visit the links below:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

And when it does, savvy investors lean in.\nAfter months of rising tensions between the EU and the US, news just broke that the European Union is officially pausing its retaliatory tariffs for six months as both sides edge closer to a landmark trade deal. That’s not just a bureaucratic win, it’s a psychological shift. Emotion drives motion in crypto; this pivot opens new bullish opportunities.\nWhile traditional markets feel the relief of de-escalation, crypto often reacts with even more excitement, especially as global uncertainty eases. Trade tensions typically slow adoption, partnerships, and infrastructure growth. Certain coins look primed for a solid run now that there’s fresh room to breathe. And among them, one unexpected contender is catching serious fire.\nLet’s dive into the five cryptos you should have on your radar right now, and why Little Pepe (LILPEPE) might just be the one that runs away with the show, potentially soaring over 21,985% shortly.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin with Monster Momentum\nDon’t let the memes fool you, Little Pepe is no joke. The presale is already in Stage 10, with the token now selling at $0.0019. And with 89.19% of this stage already filled, time is truly ticking. Once Stage 10 ends, the price ticks up again to $0.0020, and then eventually launches at $0.0030, offering buyers at today’s rate a potential 60.89% gain before exchange listings even happen.\nBut it’s the broader picture that makes things even more exciting. Early investors from Stage 1 have already seen 90% growth. And with only 20 stages in total, the window for entry is shrinking fast. There’s even a $777,000 giveaway happening to boost the hype. LILPEPE has already landed on CoinMarketCap and passed a full Certik audit, giving it credibility that many meme coins never achieve.\nIn a calmer trade climate where attention is shifting from fear to fun, LILPEPE could explode in popularity. It has the storytelling, the community vibes, and the viral energy that made past meme coins millionaires’ playgrounds. Analysts are already whispering about a potential 21,985% surge post-launch.\nStellar (XLM): Quiet, Useful, and Gaining Ground\nWhile meme coins bring the buzz, XLM continues to build real-world relevance. As of today, it’s trading around $0.40, and its upcoming Protocol 23 upgrade, launching on testnet this month and hitting mainnet in early September, has analysts bullish again.\nIf things move as expected, XLM could rise to $0.52 soon, with more upside if volume continues pouring in.\nSolana (SOL): Institutional Eyes Are Watching\nPriced at around $168–$170, Solana may not feel cheap. However, it still might be undervalued, especially now, as institutional investors have grown increasingly. Experts, including some from Bitget, call for a potential move toward $300, assuming bullish market support stays intact.\nChainlink (LINK): The Hidden Hero of Web3\nCurrently trading at around $16.60, Chainlink is quietly doing what it does best: connecting blockchains to real-world data. Over the past year, LINK has risen by 55–66%, and technical analysts are confident it could reach $25 to $40 within this cycle, especially if Web3 projects scale as expected.\nToncoin (TON): The High-Risk, High-Reward Contender\nTON is that mysterious altcoin that could either fizzle or fly. With some analysts forecasting prices as high as $9.90 in the coming months, there’s plenty of speculation behind it. Current market sentiment puts it closer to $3.60, meaning many outcomes exist. But in a world without trade wars hanging overhead, risk assets like TON tend to get more attention.\nFinal Thoughts: A Trade Truce Is a Green Light\nThe EU’s decision to pause its counter-tariffs for six months is more than just headlines; it’s a signal. Markets want clarity. Investors wish for peace of mind. And crypto thrives when fear recedes, and speculation rises. That’s precisely where we are now. From the real-world adoption of Stellar and Chainlink, to the explosive potential of LILPEPE, these five cryptos are positioned to thrive in this new global moment.\nThis might be your second shot if you missed the last meme wave. With the presale at $0.0019 and a launch price of $0.003, the current opportunity offers more than 60% upside before even hitting exchanges. And if it hits its rumoured potential? You could be looking at a life-changing 21,985% return. You can still grab LILPEPE at presale right here.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "BlockDAG’s 50M Daily Buyer Battles Steal the Spotlight From BONK and Ethereum’s Rally — Is This the Top Crypto to Buy Now?", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/blockdags-50m-daily-buyer-battles-steal-the-spotlight-from-bonk-and-ethereums-rally-is-this-the-top-crypto-to-buy-now", "text": "This week’s market headlines are a mix of short-term volatility and longer-term opportunity. BONK has pulled back sharply, testing key support after a failed breakout attempt, while Ethereum is flashing a rare technical alignment that some analysts believe could define the remainder of this bull market. Both stories are grabbing attention, one for its resilience at a critical price level, the other for its potential to lead altcoins higher.\nBut in the background, BlockDAG is executing a presale campaign that blends competitive buying features, widespread accessibility, and an already-secured post-launch trading framework. While traders react to BONK’s price drop and Ethereum’s bullish signal, long-term investors are weighing whether BlockDAG’s unique mechanics could position it as the top crypto to buy in the current market cycle.\nBONK’s Bounce Back Battle: From Sharp Drop to Support Strength\nBONK fell nearly 6% over the past 24 hours, moving from $0.00002606 to $0.00002436 after repeated rejections near $0.000027 on August 11. The drop was accompanied by a surge in trading volume to 1.13 trillion tokens, well above the daily average of 708 billion.\nSelling pressure continued into August 12, but the token found firm support at $0.000024 with 889 billion tokens traded. Buyers stepped in, pushing BONK up 3% to $0.000025, suggesting short-term stabilization and cementing $0.000024 as a key support level.\nThe price action followed news that Nasdaq-listed Safety Shot had invested $25 million in BONK ecosystem development via the Bonk.fun launchpad. This corporate-level involvement points to growing mainstream exposure for meme coins. Technical levels now show resistance at $0.000027 and support at $0.000024, with the rebound clearing $0.000025 intraday.\nEthereum’s Once-in-a-Decade Signal: The $4,850 Question\nEthereum is showing what analyst Kevin of Kev Capital calls a “once-in-a-decade” alignment of bullish signals. Since his May call for “ETH season,” ETH has climbed more than 150%, with related altcoins like Chainlink and Uniswap also rallying.\nThe move began with a rare monthly demand candle at major support, paired with oversold momentum indicators, including a V-shaped Stock RSI turnaround and an imminent monthly MACD cross. Similar setups on ETH dominance and ETH/BTC charts suggest sustained ETH outperformance.\nKevin cautions that Ethereum’s previous all-time high of $4,850 remains the final hurdle before open price discovery. Until that level is broken on high timeframes, the market stays in a high-reward but high-risk phase. Potential U.S. interest rate cuts in September, October, and December could add fuel, but traders are urged to watch for pullbacks before committing to resistance.\nBlockDAG’s Triple Threat: Buyer Battles, 2.5M Mobile Miners, and a Roaring Presale\nWhile BONK and Ethereum are fueling immediate trading conversations, BlockDAG is building momentum through features designed to engage, expand, and deliver from the outset. One of its most distinctive elements is Buyer Battles, a daily competition where the largest buyer of the day receives any unsold BDAG allocation for free. This creates a strategic layer to participation, rewarding both timing and commitment. By resetting the contest every 24 hours, it keeps the playing field level and encourages steady presale activity.\nEqually impactful is the reach of the X1 mobile miner app, which has already drawn over 2.5 million registered users worldwide. The app enables mining without expensive hardware, letting anyone earn BDAG coins simply by engaging daily. This accessibility has transformed mining from a niche technical process into a global participation model, strengthening BlockDAG’s community before the network even launches.\nOn the liquidity side, 20 centralized exchange listings have been confirmed, including MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, LBank, and XT.com. This ensures that BDAG will be tradable across multiple platforms immediately post-launch, reducing price bottlenecks and expanding global reach from day one.\nTo date, BlockDAG’s presale has already raised over $373 million, reflecting strong market sentiment in its model. Currently in Batch 29, BDAG is priced at $0.0276, with an estimated launch price of $0.05, leaving notable upside potential for early buyers. This combination of funding strength, accessible entry, and confirmed market access underscores why BDAG is attracting attention as a top crypto to buy now.\nSumming Up!\nMarket watchers this week are splitting their focus between short-term trade setups and long-term positioning. BONK’s price drop underscores the volatility in the meme coin segment, while Ethereum’s rare technical alignment offers a glimpse at what could be the next major altcoin-led rally.\nBlockDAG, however, is delivering a presale with competitive buying incentives, massive early user participation, and guaranteed multi-exchange availability after launch. These elements put it in a different category, one focused on building an ecosystem before listing, rather than scrambling after the fact.\nFor investors seeking more than just a quick swing trade, BlockDAG’s approach positions it as a competitor for the top crypto to buy now, even in a market dominated by fast-moving headlines.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Experts have picked Cardano, Unilabs, and Tron as the best altcoins to buy now.\nCrypto Jaibrah predicts the Cardano price could soar to $2 by September and $4 by December. Tron is expected to surge to $0.45. Meanwhile, Unilabs (UNIL) is capturing attention with predictions that its value could pump by 5x. The presale gem has given early holders up to 100% ROI and has more up its sleeves.\nCardano (ADA): Analysts Predict Major Breakout and Year-End Surge\nAfter a consistent spell of consolidation at $0.75 and $0.84, the Cardano price has surpassed the next psychological resistance of $0.95. CoinMarketCap shows the Cardano price has increased by 30.1% on the 7D chart.\nWith sustained volume and higher buying pressure, the value of the DeFi crypto might cross $1.00 soon. The Cardano price is technically bullish. The RSI reads 62 which gives room for an uptrend. Supporting this bullish momentum is the ADI, which flashes a buy signal.\nMeanwhile, Crypto Jaibrah has shared a bullish outlook, forecasting that the Cardano price could hit $2 by September and reach a final target of $4.83 by December. This ambitious prediction suggests a strong rally ahead for ADA in the coming months.\nSupporting this view, Mr Brownstone says he fully anticipates a breakout in the Cardano price. He expects the DeFi coin to rise to $1.18 and $1.33. If these levels are cleared, Mr Brownstone forecasts the Cardano price might pump to $1.57.\nTron (TRX) Price Holds Bullish Outlook as Key Resistance Level Nears\nATOMB, a top crypto analyst, stated in a recent X post that the Tron price is still bullish. However, he argued that the $0.36 level will be the actual test of whether it can break out higher.\nHe told his followers that if the Tron price stays above this level for an extended time, then it can surge up towards $0.42 and $0.45 levels, indicating strong potential for further increase. However, if Tron fails to hold $0.35, a pullback to $0.32 could happen.\nAnother expert, Jack, posted a similar Tron price forecast. He noted that the value of the DeFi token could soar to $0.45. At the moment, CoinMarketCap data shows that the Tron price pumped by 7.5% on the 7D chart.\nThe Tron price has crossed the $0.36 mark, a sign that buying pressure is rising. The Tron price requires a prolonged close above this level to start a rally.\nUnilabs (UNIL): The Best AI-Powered Hedge Fund Management Platform\nThe DeFi market is gaining traction exponentially with the market size expected to rise to $231.19 billion in 2030. Amid this expansion, Unilabs has emerged as a leading platform, integrating AI to offer innovative investment solutions.\nUnilabs offers four distinct investment funds (AI, BTC, RWA, and Mining Funds) catering to various investor preferences. These funds leverage AI-driven analytics to identify high-potential projects, enabling users to diversify their portfolios effectively.\nAlso, the platform's staking program offers competitive returns, which are higher than what the like of Lido ETH offers. Unilabs investors can earn up to 122% APY. Furthermore, Unilabs distributes 30% of its revenue to UNIL token holders, providing an additional income stream.\nAmong the reasons why Unilabs should be considered outstanding there is the set of AI-based tools that can maximize investment strategies. The AI Market Pulse combines on-chain the off-chain analytics to offer real-time findings on market trends and movement of tokens and avenues. This gives the investors the strength to make sound decisions out of detailed data analysis.\nUnilabs raised over $12.8 million in funding, and UNIL is now trading at $0.0097. Analysts see massive advancement with some projecting a 10x gain when the token gets listed on major exchanges.\nWhat Are The Best Cryptos To Invest In As the Bull Market Begins?\nAs the crypto market heats up, Cardano, Unilabs, and Tron are emerging as top altcoins for the bull run. With promising price forecasts and strong growth potential, these blue-chip altcoins offer investors a prime opportunity to maximize returns. Unilabs is offering a 50% bonus for smart investors who purchase UNIL coins using the code CMC50 for a limited time.\nFind out more about the Unilabs (UNIL) Presale Today:\nWebsite: https://unilabs.finance/\nTelegram: https://t.me/unilabsofficial\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

At the center of this surge is Pepe Dollar (PEPD), a parody of the U.S. Federal Reserve that merges meme culture with Layer-2 technology, deflationary tokenomics, and integration into gaming ecosystems. Analysts point to the ongoing Pepe Dollar (PEPD) presale as one of the most lucrative opportunities in the current market, citing its ability to unite meme hype with lasting on-chain value. The presale has already attracted over $1.2M, with each stage seeing rapid sell-outs. Investors looking to capture early gains are locking in allocations before the launch price gap closes.\nLil Pepe (LILPEPE) Brings Layer-2 Speed To Meme Culture\nWhile Pepe Dollar (PEPD) dominates the meme-utility conversation, Lil Pepe (LILPEPE) is building momentum as a meme project backed by a Layer-2 EVM chain. Raising over $18.4M toward its $19.3M target, Lil Pepe (LILPEPE) has positioned itself as a scalability-driven alternative in the meme space. Transaction costs are minimal, speeds are instant, and the network’s meme-native culture appeals to both traders and developers. However, market analysts note that while Lil Pepe (LILPEPE) is carving out a unique position, its growth path is more dependent on ecosystem adoption compared to Pepe Dollar (PEPD)’s multi-market utility strategy.\nWhy Pepe Dollar (PEPD) Is Set For The Bigger ROI\nWhat sets Pepe Dollar (PEPD) apart is the layered value proposition. The token will operate on Ethereum Layer-2 for ultra-low fees, use deflationary burns to manage supply, and provide staking rewards for long-term holders. On top of that, the development team has confirmed integration into a mobile gaming ecosystem and payment-Fi modules, creating a multi-channel demand funnel. This diverse utility gives Pepe Dollar (PEPD) more resilience against pure hype cycles, allowing it to capture both speculative traders and utility-focused investors.\nHow To Join The Pepe Dollar (PEPD) Presale\nJoining the Pepe Dollar (PEPD) presale is straightforward. Investors can connect a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or WalletConnect to the official pepedollar.fun site, choose the preferred payment currency (ETH, USDT, BNB, or others), and confirm the transaction. Tokens are reserved instantly, with price tiers increasing as each stage sells out. Given the projected launch price of $0.03695 from a current entry point under $0.005, early investors could see gains exceeding 600% if targets are met post-listing.\nMarket Analyst Takeaway\nAccording to leading market strategists, both Pepe Dollar (PEPD) and Lil Pepe (LILPEPE) are primed for significant runs this cycle. But the broader ecosystem reach, staking mechanisms, and deflationary model give Pepe Dollar (PEPD) the upper hand in delivering outsized ROI. For those aiming to ride the meme coin momentum wave with a safety net of real-world utility, locking in Pepe Dollar (PEPD) now could be the best decision of the 2025 bull run.\nJoin Pepe Dollar Presale:\nPepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/\nPepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity\nPEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Coldware Set to Hit $1 at Launch, Little Pepe Coin Holders Buy COLD to Hedge Crypto Portfolio", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/coldware-set-to-hit-1-at-launch-little-pepe-coin-holders-buy-cold-to-hedge-crypto-portfolio", "text": "Coldware (COLD) has emerged as one of the most ambitious presales of 2025, blending Web3 hardware innovation with a utility-first crypto model. Investors are increasingly speculating that Coldware (COLD) could debut at $1 or higher when it lists on major exchanges. What’s surprising to many observers is just how many Little Pepe (LILPEPE) holders are now buying into the Coldware presale — not to abandon their meme coin positions, but to hedge their portfolios ahead of the 2025–26 bull cycle.\nColdware’s $1 Launch Potential\nThe $1 launch projection for Coldware is grounded in real numbers. The project has already delivered a 310% presale price increase across early stages, is targeting a $200 million total raise, and is releasing its own Larna 2400® Web3 device. This hardware acts as a secure crypto wallet, Lite Node staking hub, and encrypted VPN gateway — all in one sleek package. Unlike purely speculative tokens, Coldware (COLD) offers investors something tangible that can generate recurring demand as more devices ship worldwide.\nWhere most crypto projects rely on post-launch hype to sustain momentum, Coldware is building an active user base before it even lists. That early adoption could be the catalyst for a strong opening price, with some analysts suggesting a market cap leap into the top 50 within months.\nWhy Little Pepe Coin Holders Are Buying Coldware\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) is no stranger to explosive presale hype. With over $16.4 million raised at a presale price of $0.0019, it has positioned itself as a key contender in the 2025–26 meme coin supercycle. Its unique Layer 2 blockchain for meme culture — complete with sniper bot resistance and a built-in Launchpad — has already won the attention of retail traders worldwide.\nHowever, even the most bullish LILPEPE holders recognize that meme coin price action can be volatile. The same hype that propels tokens to 10x gains can lead to equally sharp corrections. This is where Coldware fits into the strategy — by allocating a portion of their capital into COLD, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) investors are balancing high-risk meme exposure with a fundamentally solid utility project.\nBuilding a Balanced Bull Run Portfolio\nIn the coming bull run, two narratives are set to dominate: the meme coin mania fueled by cultural virality, and the utility-driven adoption led by projects that solve real problems.\n-\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) represents the first category, aiming for rapid market penetration with meme energy and blockchain-level infrastructure.\n-\nColdware (COLD) represents the second, offering secure hardware, staking incentives, and device-based network participation.\nCombining both in a single portfolio creates a layered strategy: LILPEPE provides the moonshot potential, while COLD acts as the anchor for sustained value growth.\nPresale Synergy Between COLD and LILPEPE\nThe two projects also share key similarities that make them complementary investments:\n-\nStrong Presale Performance: LILPEPE’s $16.4M raise and COLD’s multi-stage price jumps prove sustained demand.\n-\nCommunity Momentum: Both projects have cultivated passionate followings, driving organic marketing and presale urgency.\n-\nClear Roadmaps: LILPEPE’s Layer 2 launch and Coldware’s hardware rollout give investors fixed milestones to track.\nInterestingly, many wallet addresses show overlapping participation in both presales, suggesting that savvy early adopters are stacking positions in these top performers.\nColdware’s Adoption Flywheel\nThe real power of Coldware lies in its product-driven adoption cycle. As more users buy the Larna 2400® device to access secure crypto storage, VPN privacy, and staking rewards, the demand for Coldware (COLD) tokens increases. This isn’t just speculative buying — it’s functional buying tied directly to product usage. For Little Pepe (LILPEPE) holders, this means they are exposed to a project that grows organically, not only from market sentiment but also from real-world hardware sales.\nConclusion\nColdware (COLD) is shaping up to be one of the most talked-about presales of the year, with a realistic path to a $1 launch price and beyond. For Little Pepe (LILPEPE) holders, adding Coldware to their portfolios is less about abandoning meme coin potential and more about creating a safety net for sustained gains. In a bull market that rewards both cultural hype and real utility, this hedge strategy could prove to be one of the smartest plays of 2025.\nFor more information on the Coldware (COLD) Presale:\nVisit Coldware (COLD)\nJoin and become a community member:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Unlike traditional meme coins that thrive solely on community energy, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) merges Layer-2 Ethereum scaling, a deflationary burn model, and integration into meme-themed GameFi ecosystems. This combination has propelled the Best Crypto ICO beyond $1.2M in presale funding, attracting attention from both retail and whale investors. With staking options and tokenomics designed for sustainable growth, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is well-positioned to outperform many speculative plays in the coming bull run.\nSPX6900 Whales Look for New Highs\nThe rally in SPX6900 (SPX) has been closely tied to broader market sentiment. After breaking key resistance levels, SPX6900 (SPX) traders are now eyeing the $6,500 index target that could act as a catalyst for renewed confidence in meme-related assets. However, while SPX6900 (SPX) shows strength in traditional price action, many of its largest holders are diversifying into crypto assets with asymmetric upside — a trend that has naturally led some toward Pepe Dollar (PEPD). Analysts note that SPX6900 (SPX) may deliver solid index growth, but crypto offers a much more explosive risk-reward profile in 2025.\nToken6900 Investors Enter the MemeFi Arena\nToken6900 (T6900) has built a reputation for bold marketing and high-APY staking, with a community rooted in early 2000s meme nostalgia. While Token6900 (T6900) continues to raise significant presale capital, savvy investors are not putting all their eggs in one basket. Many are now adding Pepe Dollar (PEPD) to their portfolios, recognizing that while Token6900 (T6900) dominates the culture angle, PEPD dominates the utility angle. In a competitive meme economy, the winning plays are often those that combine narrative and functionality — exactly what Pepe Dollar (PEPD) delivers.\nWhy Pepe Dollar Could Outpace Both Rivals\nEven with the strong cultural traction of Token6900 (T6900) and the bullish sentiment around SPX6900 (SPX), Pepe Dollar (PEPD) stands out because of its presale structure and use case alignment. By securing Ethereum Layer-2 scalability, offering meme-based mobile gaming integrations, and maintaining deflationary pressure via regular token burns, PEPD is engineered for long-term holding. In addition, partnerships with NFT marketplaces and meme-driven communities add layers of liquidity and utility that pure speculation plays like SPX6900 (SPX) or culture-first coins like Token6900 (T6900) may not fully capture.\nConclusion — A Three-Way Play, One Clear Winner\nSPX6900 (SPX) gives investors stability and exposure to index-level price growth, Token6900 (T6900) delivers nostalgia-driven hype, but Pepe Dollar (PEPD) offers the most balanced combination of culture, utility, and deflationary economics. For those seeking a Best Crypto ICO that could multiply returns in 2025, PEPD’s momentum is undeniable. If current presale acceleration continues, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) could easily set the tone for the next meme-driven market cycle.\nJoin Pepe Dollar Presale:\nPepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/\nPepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity\nPEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Dogecoin Price Provides Confidence in Altcoin Market, Coldware Holders Prepares For 100X Launch", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/dogecoin-price-provides-confidence-in-altcoin-market-coldware-holders-prepares-for-100x-launch", "text": "The cryptocurrency market is buzzing as meme coins and utility projects alike benefit from renewed bullish sentiment. Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin, is once again proving its influence over the altcoin sector with a breakout pattern targeting $0.295. At the same time, Coldware (COLD) holders are growing increasingly confident that the project’s unique combination of Web3 hardware and blockchain utility could deliver a 100X return as it approaches its highly anticipated launch.\nColdware’s Web3 Mobile Strategy Gains Traction\nWhile Dogecoin’s bullish chart is catching trader attention, Coldware (COLD) is preparing for a very different kind of breakout. The project’s Larna 2400® Web3 smartphone — available in its limited Discoverer presale tier for just $349 — is positioning itself as the first mass-market mobile device built to integrate blockchain directly into everyday use.\nRunning Android 15.0 with 6GB RAM, 128GB storage, and a 6.56-inch 120Hz OLED display, the device comes preloaded with key Coldware ecosystem apps. These include Coldware Wallet for multi-chain asset storage, ColdPay for direct crypto purchases using Visa or Mastercard, Coldware Chat for encrypted blockchain messaging, and a dedicated dApp store featuring staking platforms, NFT marketplaces, and DeFi exchanges.\nFor users, the appeal is straightforward: no complex setup, no external wallets — simply turn on the phone, buy crypto with a card, and start interacting with decentralized apps immediately. This streamlined onboarding process could significantly accelerate adoption in emerging markets where desktop access to crypto services is limited.\nDogecoin Bull Flag Breakout Targets $0.295\nAccording to a technical analysis posted by respected trader @TATrader_Alan on August 12, Dogecoin (DOGE) has broken out of a 4-hour bull flag pattern — a historically reliable indicator of continued upward movement. This setup projects a short-term price target of $0.295, representing a significant upside from current levels. The pattern follows a wave of renewed market activity, with meme coins benefiting from stronger Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) price action.\nTechnical metrics are reinforcing this bullish outlook for DOGE. RSI levels hovering around 60 indicate that the coin has room to climb before entering overbought conditions, while moving averages remain aligned in a positive trend. Historically, DOGE has demonstrated a high beta compared to Bitcoin, meaning sharp rallies in BTC often translate into even bigger percentage gains for DOGE. A successful move toward the $0.295 resistance could ignite further meme coin speculation across the market.\nDifferent Narratives, Shared Momentum\nDogecoin (DOGE) and Coldware (COLD) may be fundamentally different in scope and use case, but both benefit from the current market mood. DOGE’s appeal lies in its cultural staying power, deep liquidity, and the ability to spark retail speculation during bullish cycles. Coldware, on the other hand, targets long-term adoption through tangible utility — marrying the multi-trillion-dollar smartphone industry with blockchain integration.\nColdware (COLD)’s presale has been drawing in SocialFi, GameFi, and DeFi enthusiasts alike, many of whom see the project’s hardware-first approach as a catalyst for sustained token demand. The tokenomics are designed to reward early adopters, with staking incentives and ecosystem rewards directly tied to mobile usage.\nThe 100X Potential Narrative\nHype around Coldware (COLD)’s “100X launch” potential is rooted in its market positioning. The global smartphone market exceeds 6.8 billion active devices, and even capturing a fraction of that user base could create significant network effects for the COLD token. With Real World Asset (RWA) integration, mobile-friendly dApps, and hardware-based wallet security, Coldware is appealing to both crypto natives and newcomers who value simplicity.\nFor Dogecoin (DOGE) traders, the $0.295 target represents a strong near-term opportunity, but the ceiling is limited by DOGE’s current market capitalization and mature status in the meme coin hierarchy. Coldware, by contrast, is still in its early stage — meaning price discovery after launch could deliver much larger multiples for presale participants if adoption scales as projected.\nConclusion\nDogecoin’s bull flag breakout is giving traders renewed confidence in the altcoin market, proving that meme coins can still move sentiment across the board. At the same time, Coldware (COLD) is capturing attention with a fundamentally different value proposition — one rooted in real-world utility through its $349 Larna 2400® Web3 smartphone. With DOGE potentially leading short-term rallies and Coldware gearing up for a long-term adoption play, the two projects highlight how different strategies can coexist and thrive in the current crypto environment. For investors seeking asymmetric upside, Coldware’s combination of hardware innovation and blockchain integration makes it one of the most compelling presale opportunities of 2025.\nFor more information on the Coldware (COLD) Presale:\nVisit Coldware (COLD)\nJoin and become a community member:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Crypto Price Analysis 8-14: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/crypto-price-analysis-8-14-bitcoin-btc-ethereum-eth-solana-sol", "text": "The crypto market is back in bullish territory, buoyed by Bitcoin (BTC) surging to a new all-time high. The flagship cryptocurrency smashed its previous all-time high of $123,091, surging past $124,000 to reach $124,457. However, it lost momentum following its new record, dropping to $121,411 before moving to its current level. BTC is up over 1% in the past 24 hours, trading around $121,670. Meanwhile, the crypto market cap is up 0.89% at $4.14 trillion.\nEthereum (ETH) continued its upward trajectory as it reclaimed the $4,700 mark after a brief wobble. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is up 1.13%, trading around $4,728. Solana (SOL) continued rising after crossing $200, reaching $209 before losing momentum and moving to its current level. Cardano (ADA) has registered substantial bullish sentiment over the past 24 hours, up nearly 11%. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) traded in the red, registering substantial declines.\nNew Google Play Rules Won’t Affect Non-Custodial Wallets\nNew Google Play rules will require crypto wallet providers in 15 jurisdictions, including the US and the EU, to be licensed and comply with “industry standards.” However, the rules do not affect non-custodial wallets. According to Google Play’s policy notice, the new changes come into effect on October 29. US-based developers will need to register with local regulators as a money services business or money transmitter, while EU-based developers must register as a crypto asset service provider. US-based companies registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as money services businesses must also meet specific requirements and implement an anti-money laundering program.\nGoogle addressed concerns regarding the impact of the new policies after uproar from the crypto community, stating,\n“Non-custodial wallets are not in scope of Google Play’s Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Software Wallets Policy. We are updating the Help Center to make this clear.”\nGoogle Play has a rocky relationship with the crypto industry. It banned crypto mining apps in 2018 and removed the Bitcoin Blast video game in 2020. It also took down several crypto news apps in the same year without giving any explanation. In 2021, the Play Store banned eight “deceptive” crypto apps that allegedly tricked users into paying for an illegitimate cloud service.\nJustin Sun Takes Bloomberg To Court\nTron founder Justin Sun has filed a lawsuit against Bloomberg to prevent it from publishing what he calls highly sensitive details about his cryptocurrency holdings. Sun filed the lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Delaware, stating that the disclosure would compromise his privacy and put him and his family at risk. Sun alleged that Bloomberg approached him earlier this year to be included in its online billionaires index. He added that before agreeing, Bloomberg assured him that any asset information would be kept confidential, and that this applied to his cryptocurrency holdings as well.\nSun claimed he agreed only after his assurance and provided detailed wallet and asset data to Bloomberg’s wealth verification team, believing any reference to his crypto holdings in his profile would be limited to a lump sum valuation and not be broken down by token type. Sun argues a detailed breakdown goes beyond what Bloomberg published for other crypto billionaires, adding that such details are not shared unless already public. According to Sun, a detailed disclosure of his holdings would enable blockchain trackers to identify and link his wallets, making him a prime target for hackers and potentially exposing him to physical attacks.\nNorth Korean Hacker Operations Exposed Thanks To Compromised Device\nA compromised device belonging to a North Korean IT worker has exposed the inner workings of a team behind the $680,000 Favrr hack. On-chain investigator ZachXBT revealed that an unnamed individual gained access to a North Korean IT worker’s computer, revealing screenshots, Google Drive exports, and Chrome profiles. The information on the device revealed how the hackers planned and carried out their attacks. ZachXBT also revealed that the hacker and his team were behind the June 2025 exploit of Favrr.\nThe compromised device showed that the team, consisting of six individuals, had 31 fake identities. The hackers collected government-issued ID and phone numbers to land blockchain development jobs. They also bought LinkedIn and UpWork accounts. ZachXBT also revealed an interview script that showed the hackers boasting about working with well-known blockchain firms like Polygon Labs, OpenSea, and Chainlink. The hackers also used Google tools to organize workflows. They also used spreadsheets to track budgets and schedules, and Google Translate to switch between English and Korean.\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\nBitcoin (BTC) surged to a new all-time high early on Thursday as expectations for an easier monetary policy from the Federal Reserve added to tailwinds from recently announced financial reforms. The flagship cryptocurrency crossed $120,000 on Tuesday and moved to $120,113. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as the price rallied, rising nearly 3% to settle at $123,365. BTC raced past $124,000 during the ongoing session, reaching a new all-time high of $124,533 before losing momentum and dropping to its current level.\nThe flagship cryptocurrency briefly flipped Alphabet’s $2.4 trillion market cap to become the world’s fifth-largest global asset, thanks to surging optimism among investors. BTC’s jump to a new all-time high of $124,553 also makes it the first cryptocurrency to cross Google’s $2.45 trillion market cap. Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss stated in a post on X,\n“Bitcoin all-time high and it’s only Wednesday.”\nThe post triggered a host of optimistic responses from fellow traders, including investor Kyle Chassé, who predicted this would be the “best week for Bitcoin.” BTC’s latest milestone has investors optimistic about its price discovery phase, which could see the flagship cryptocurrency reach Apple’s market capitalization next. BTC will need to cross $175,000 to flip Apple’s $3.4 million market capitalization. One analyst believes such a scenario may be possible by the end of August. However, even the $175,000 prediction remains modest compared to predictions made by BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes. Hayes believes BTC could surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025 if the Federal Reserve pivots to quantitative easing and injects more liquidity into the financial system.\nAnalysts believe institutional capital is the main driver behind BTC’s rally. Institutions have pivoted towards BTC thanks to favorable macro tailwinds and growing regulatory clarity. New US policies, including the GENIUS Act and 401(k) crypto allocations, have led to capital flowing into BTC, sustaining its upward momentum.\n“It is not just a wave of speculative enthusiasm; it is the groundwork for crypto’s integration into mainstream portfolios.”\nBTC registered a sharp decline on Friday (August 1), dropping over 2% and settling at $113,365. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 0.67% and settled at $112,601. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Sunday, rising 1.52% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,215. The price continued pushing higher on Monday, registering a 0.69% increase and settling at $115,051. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $112,707 on Tuesday as selling pressure returned. It rebounded from this level to reclaim $114,000 and settled at $114,051, ultimately dropping 0.83%. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.80% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,028.\nSource: TradingView\nBullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $117,000 and settle at $117,515. Despite the positive sentiment, the price was back in the red on Friday, falling nearly 1% to $116,683. BTC registered a marginal decline on Saturday but recovered on Sunday, rising 2.42% to reclaim $119,000 and settle at $119,309. The price surged to an intraday high of $122,319 on Monday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $118,701, ultimately dropping 0.51%. Market sentiment turned positive on Tuesday as the price recovered, rising 1.19% to cross $120,000 and settle at $120,113. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to settle at $123,365. The price surged to a new all-time high during the ongoing session, reaching $124,533. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and is down over 4%, trading around $117,951.\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\nEthereum (ETH) has stalled during the ongoing session, down over 4% after failing to cross $4,800 despite positive momentum. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency rallied on Tuesday, rising nearly 9% to cross $4,500 and settle at $4,589. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as ETH crossed $4,700. However, bulls lost momentum, falling to an intraday low of $4,455 before moving to their current level. Despite the decline, ETH is up 20% over the past week, dwarfing BTC’s recent uptrend.\nEthereum ETFs registered over $700 million in inflows, significantly higher than the $84 million recorded by spot Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum products have registered $2.2 billion in inflows over three days, seven times higher than the $330 million added by Bitcoin ETFs in the same period. ETH surged to an intraday high of $4,794 during the current session, less than 4% from its all-time high.\n“Spot eth ETFs post 3rd best inflow day ever… Over $700mil. 3 of the top 6 inflow days since launch have come *this week*. $3bil new $$$ over past 7 trading sessions. On another heater.”\nEthereum treasury firms have also stepped up their purchases, with BitMine Immersion, the world’s largest corporate ETH holder, announcing plans to raise its fundraising target by $20 billion to fund further ETH acquisitions. However, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin warned against ETH treasury companies, stating,\n“If you woke me up three years from now and told me that treasuries led to the downfall of ETH… my guess would be that somehow they turned it into an overleveraged game.”\nETH started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 6% and settling at $3,488. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 3%, slipping below $3,400 to $3,393. ETH recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to reclaim the $3,500 level. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price rallied, rising over 6% to cross $3,700 and settle at $3,721. ETH was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping nearly 3% to $3,612. It rebounded on Wednesday, rising over 2% and settling at $3,685.\nSource: TradingView\nBullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH rallied, rising over 6% to cross $3,900 and settle at $3,911. The price crossed $4,000 on Friday, rising 2.52% and settling at $4,010. ETH continued pushing higher on Saturday, rising over 6% to cross $4,200 and settle at $4,262. Despite the positive sentiment, ETH lost momentum on Sunday, registering a marginal decline. Sellers retained control on Monday as the price dropped 0.59% to $4,226. ETH rallied on Tuesday, surging nearly 8% to cross $4,500 and settle at $4,589. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price rose 3.40% to $4,745. Despite the positive sentiment, ETH is back in the red during the ongoing session, with the price down over 3% at $4,599.\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\nSolana (SOL) is down nearly 4% during the ongoing session, losing the $200 mark as market sentiment retreated. SOL posted an impressive rally on Tuesday, rising almost 10% to $191. The price continued pushing higher on Wednesday, crossing $200 and settling at $201. However, volatility and selling pressure caused buyers to lose momentum, with SOL down over 3% during the ongoing session. The altcoin crossed the $200 mark for the first time in almost a month.\nSOL’s rally can be attributed to several bullish developments over the past week. Public companies have upped their SOL purchases to access the blockchain’s staking rewards. Firms including Bit Mining, Upexi, and DeFi Development Corp have increased their SOL holdings, with plans to increase their stake substantially over the next few months.\nSOL started the previous weekend with a sharp drop, falling nearly 6% on Friday and settling at $162.

The policy, effective October 29, mandates that developers secure relevant registrations, such as FinCEN Money Services Business (MSB) status in the U.S. or MiCA licensing in the EU, regardless of whether the wallet is custodial or non-custodial.\nThe announcement alarmed developers, as non-custodial wallets, which allow users to retain full control of their private keys, have historically been exempt from such regulatory obligations. Under the new rules, they appeared subject to the same licensing burdens as custodial platforms, potentially forcing many independent projects off the Play Store.\nClarification Following Backlash\nFollowing widespread concern from the crypto community, Google clarified via X (formerly Twitter) that non-custodial wallets are not covered under the Play Store’s “Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Software Wallets Policy.” The company stated it would update its Help Center to reflect this exemption.\nThis reversal alleviated concerns that Android users in the U.S., UK, and EU would lose access to popular self-custody tools due to regulatory licensing requirements that non-custodial wallet developers cannot meet.\nImpact of New Licensing Requirements\nWhile non-custodial wallets have been spared from the immediate licensing mandate, custodial wallet providers face significant compliance demands. In the U.S., developers must register with FinCEN as MSBs, hold state-level money transmitter licenses, or operate as banks. This includes implementing anti-money laundering programs and potentially adding Know Your Customer (KYC) checks.\nIn the EU, Google Play will only list wallet apps from MiCA-licensed Crypto Asset Service Providers — a category that explicitly excludes non-custodial wallets. MiCA defines CASPs primarily as exchanges and custodial service operators, leaving independent software wallets outside the licensing scope.\nBroader Industry Context\nGoogle’s stance reflects a growing alignment with global financial watchdogs like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which in 2021 urged member nations to regulate virtual asset service providers under risk-based frameworks. Although FATF’s guidelines are non-binding, tech platforms have increasingly acted as enforcers by controlling access to distribution channels.\nGoogle has a complicated history with cryptocurrency-related apps, having banned mining software in 2018, removed several crypto news apps in 2020, and blocked deceptive crypto services in 2021. More recently, it allowed NFT games under strict disclosure rules while prohibiting gambling elements.\nThe clarification on non-custodial wallets underscores the ongoing tension between regulatory compliance, platform policy, and user access to decentralized financial tools.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The token’s value soared, drawing comparisons to Pi and ONDO, two well-known digital coins. Some now wonder if XYZVerse could climb even higher and leave those rivals behind. The coming days may reveal whether this newcomer can hold its momentum or surprise the markets further.\nDemand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone\nXYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3.\nUnlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms.\nNotably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet.\nPrice Dynamics and Listing Plans\nDuring its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges.\nThe projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization.\nSo far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors.\nChampions Get Rewarded\nIn XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big.\nThe Road to Victory\nWith solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary.\nAirdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits\nPocket Mining: Why Pi Network Could Be the Next Big Crypto Circle\nPi Network puts a digital mint in your pocket. Launched by Stanford grads in 2019, the app lets anyone earn Pi by tapping once a day. No fancy gear, no hot laptop fan. The system runs on the Stellar Consensus Protocol, so phones sip power. Users pick 3–5 trusted contacts; these tiny circles link into a global web that checks each move on the chain. Extra Pi flows to people who add friends, keep coins locked, or run a full node on a computer. Fair, simple, and social.\nIn a market chasing lower fees and greener tools, Pi looks timely. Bitcoin’s proof-of-work feels heavy; Pi’s light touch could appeal to the next billion users, much like TikTok beat cable TV. The enclosed mainnet, live since late 2021, limits trading today, yet it also shields the project while builders test apps. If the open network arrives on schedule, early pioneers may hold a coin ready for real markets. With memes driving gains and community strength ranking high, a phone-mined token backed by a crowd-sized KYC net could draw fresh attention in the next cycle.\nONDO: Real-World Yield Meets the Crypto Boom\nONDO blends old and new money. The team turns safe, income-making assets like U.S. Treasury notes into digital tokens that move at internet speed. One branch builds these products, while another writes open code that lets them plug into many apps. Big names such as BlackRock help choose the assets, and Coinbase stores the coins, so trust stays high. The star product, USDY, behaves like a steady coin yet earns a small yield from Treasuries and bank deposits, opening the door for non-U.S. users.\nMarkets now swing between hype and safety. While meme tokens chase quick hits, ONDO offers a link to real cash flow, a trait many traders want during rate hikes. Tokenization of bonds is growing fast; even big banks are testing it. This trend could lift projects that already have working lines, and ONDO is one of the few. Its price still moves with the wider crypto tide, yet the solid backing may limit sharp drops. For investors seeking calm in a loud cycle, ONDO may look tempting.\nConclusion\nPI and ONDO remain strong in the market, yet XYZVerse leads as the first all-sport memecoin. With unique sports integration and bold growth goals, XYZ is set to stand out in this bull run.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "FUNToken’s $0.10 Milestone: How Telegram Engagement and Staking Will Fuel FUNToken’s 10X Growth", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/funtokens-010-milestone-how-telegram-engagement-and-staking-will-fuel-funtokens-10x-growth", "text": "While many digital assets rely on speculation, FUNToken ($FUN) is proving that utility and engagement can create real, sustained momentum.\nTrading around $0.01824 at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap, FUNToken is steadily building a foundation for growth. The project’s journey toward the $0.10 milestone is not being driven by promises alone but by a unique combination of Telegram-powered adoption, staking incentives, and a deflationary burn model. Together, these elements form a growth engine that could deliver a 10X return for early participants if roadmap targets are achieved.\nThis article breaks down exactly how Telegram integration and staking are working together to fuel FUNToken’s trajectory and why traders see these systems as critical to reaching the next price threshold.\nTelegram Engagement: The Growth Catalyst\nUnlike most tokens that depend on centralized exchanges or complicated onboarding flows, FUNToken has built an accessible gaming experience directly inside Telegram. This choice has unlocked a massive global audience that is already comfortable with messaging-based apps and micro-transactions.\nHere is why this approach matters:\n-\nFrictionless Onboarding\nTelegram users can start playing in seconds. There is no need for complex wallet setups or downloads. The simplicity of this experience removes the single biggest barrier to adoption in the Web3 space. -\nDaily Active Engagement\nThe platform is already seeing over 105,000 active Telegram players, with daily missions, spin-to-win mechanics, and referral rewards. This high-frequency engagement keeps the ecosystem active and ensures a steady stream of demand for FUN tokens. -\nViral Growth Dynamics\nTelegram’s social features, like group challenges and friend invites, create organic user acquisition. As more players join, each community-driven promotion can snowball into thousands of new wallet activations. -\nRevenue to Support Buybacks\nEvery transaction inside these Telegram games generates revenue. That revenue is used in the project’s quarterly buyback-and-burn program, steadily reducing circulating supply.\nWith the roadmap targeting 10 additional Telegram games in Q3 2025 alone, the growth curve is expected to steepen. More users mean more transactions, more revenue, and a faster deflation cycle.\nStaking: Locking Supply and Rewarding Commitment\nBeyond gaming engagement, FUNToken’s staking model plays an equally important role in its path toward the $0.10 milestone. Staking is more than just a reward system. It is a mechanism that locks a portion of the circulating supply, reducing sell pressure and creating predictable demand.\nHere is how it works:\n-\nIncentives for Holding\nUsers can stake their FUN tokens directly in the ecosystem to earn rewards and access exclusive benefits such as premium game experiences and bonus multipliers. -\nReducing Liquid Supply\nEvery FUN token locked in staking contracts is effectively removed from circulation for the duration of the staking period. As adoption grows, this locked supply becomes a meaningful contributor to scarcity. -\nStrengthening Network Effects\nStakers are incentivized to participate actively in the ecosystem, whether by playing, referring new users, or voting on future platform improvements. This dynamic creates a committed base of holders who have a direct interest in seeing the token appreciate.\nThe roadmap for Q4 2025 includes launching the mobile FUN Wallet app with integrated staking, making it easier for everyday users to stake and earn without complex DeFi interfaces.\nThe Path to $0.10: Why the Numbers Align\nWhen you look closely at FUNToken’s ecosystem, it becomes clear that the combination of AI-driven Telegram bot, Telegram community engagement, staking participation, and deflationary mechanics is a set of quantifiable growth drivers that are already impacting price action.\nHere is how these forces reinforce each other:\n-\nA continuously expanding user base transacting FUN daily\n-\nA rising percentage of tokens are being locked in staking contracts\n-\nQuarterly buybacks funded by real revenue streams\nIf we project this model forward into Q4 and early 2026, several scenarios illustrate why a move to $0.10 is plausible rather than speculative:\n-\nScenario 1: 500,000 Wallet Users with 20% Staking Participation\nThis would remove at least 100 million FUN from the circulating supply. If staking participation climbs to 30% or higher, the impact could be even larger. -\nScenario 2: Expansion of Active Daily Transactions\nAs 10–20 more games are launched, the number of daily transactions could double or triple. Every transaction contributes to revenue and therefore to quarterly buybacks. If burn volumes rise from 25 million to 50 million FUN per quarter, the available supply on exchanges could fall significantly in less than a year. -\nScenario 3: Sustained Community Growth and Network Effects\nEach new player not only increases demand for FUN tokens but also introduces referral loops and viral engagement. This dynamic creates an organic, compounding network effect that makes growth less reliant on external marketing spend.\nTogether, these scenarios create a market structure where demand consistently rises while supply steadily contracts. This is why traders and analysts watching FUNToken often describe the $0.10 milestone as a logical step in the token’s lifecycle rather than a speculative moonshot.\nFinal Thoughts\nFUNToken’s roadmap is clear. Grow the ecosystem, expand active users through Telegram, incentivize holding through staking, and consistently reduce supply. This is a combination that few projects in the gaming token space have achieved.\nWith each quarter delivering more games, deeper staking integration, and significant deflationary burns, the foundation for a move toward $0.10 and 10X growth is already being laid.\nAdding to this momentum, FUNToken has also launched a $5 million giveaway, designed to reward the community and accelerate adoption by attracting new players and holders into the ecosystem.\nFor those watching closely, this year may prove that utility, transparency, and deflation - combined with strong community incentives - can be far more powerful than hype alone.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

With prices currently consolidating after steady gains, traders are weighing whether this pause signals a temporary pullback or the start of a more prolonged trend shift. Amid the uncertainty, select altcoins are showing promising setups, offering potential opportunities for growth.\nThis analysis, supported by Outset PR’s commitment to delivering clarity through data-driven insights, explores Bitcoin’s current technical landscape and highlights how strategic communication can position projects to thrive in shifting market conditions.\nBitcoin Eyes Resistance: Will It Surge Higher Soon?\nSource: tradingview\nBitcoin is currently trading between $116K and $122K. It's been showing steady improvement, with a three-and-a-half percent rise in the past week and over twenty-one percent in the last six months. This momentum hints at further growth. The next big hurdle is around one hundred twenty-three thousand dollars. If Bitcoin can break through this, it might aim for one hundred twenty-nine thousand dollars. Such a move would increase its value from the current range by around seven percent.

While Cardano remains a powerhouse in blockchain innovation, the excitement right now is shifting toward Ozak AI. This project isn’t just another token; it’s riding the twin waves of blockchain and artificial intelligence, and it’s doing so with a clear mission and an aggressive presale.\nOzak AI’s presale is already deep into stage four, with over 127 million tokens sold and $1.84 million raised. Priced at $0.005 now, with a listing goal of $0.05, some investors are quietly asking whether $2 could actually be in play before year-end. Sounds bold, but the foundation is there.\nWhy Ozak AI Is Turning Heads\nThis isn’t about empty promises. The protocol’s Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network, or DePIN, blends blockchain’s security with IPFS storage efficiency. That means data is safe, transactions are immutable, and single points of failure are eliminated. It’s the kind of setup that industries relying on real-time analytics dream about.\nOn top of that, the $1 million giveaway campaign has already crowned over 100 winners, showing that the team knows how to keep the community engaged. Big winners—$100,000 and $50,000—are pulling in fresh attention, and all it takes to qualify is a $100 presale buy-in.\nCardano vs. Ozak AI: Different Strengths, Different Play\nCardano plays the long game, focusing on methodical development and peer-reviewed updates. Ozak AI? It’s going for speed. The difference is almost like comparing a marathon to a sprint. Cardano’s established network is powerful, but Ozak AI’s hybrid AI-blockchain model could push it into niches Cardano hasn’t touched.\nData sharing via smart contracts, decentralized scaling, and secure storage are all in place. That’s why some early backers believe this isn’t a “what if” project but more of a “when” scenario.

Each project is riding a unique market wave — and together, they form what many are calling the “Presale Big 3” of this cycle.\nColdware’s Hardware-Backed Web3 Model\nWhile most presales rely on promises of future tech, Coldware (COLD) is delivering from day one with its Larna 2400® hardware device. This Web3-ready mobile terminal acts as a secure crypto wallet, Lite Node staking hub, and encrypted VPN gateway, giving every user a tangible reason to buy in. The Coldware presale has already recorded a 310% price increase across its early stages, with a target raise of $200 million to fund mass hardware rollout, staking rewards, and liquidity provisioning.\nRemittix: Solving a $19 Trillion Payments Problem\nRemittix has carved its own presale dominance by tackling real-world cross-border payments. With the ability to process crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries, audited smart contracts, and a wallet beta launching in Q3 2025, RTX is positioning itself as the PayFi disruptor of the cycle. Trading at $0.0922 with over $18.8M raised, Remittix offers a utility-driven roadmap that is attracting both retail and institutional backers.\nLittle Pepe: Meme Coin Meets Infrastructure\nLittle Pepe isn’t just another meme coin. It’s building its own Layer 2 blockchain designed purely for meme culture, with ultra-low fees, sniper bot resistance, and a built-in Launchpad for new token launches. At just $0.0019 in presale phase 10 and over $16.4M raised, LILPEPE blends meme hype with genuine blockchain utility — something the meme sector rarely sees.\nWhy These Three Stand Out\n-\nColdware: Hardware-first Web3 infrastructure with immediate user utility.\n-\nRemittix: Payment-first adoption tackling real-world finance.\n-\nLittle Pepe: Meme coin virality fused with blockchain tech.\nEach project taps into a different dominant narrative: infrastructure, payments, and meme culture. Combined, they give investors exposure to the three strongest drivers of the upcoming bull run.\nConclusion\nIn a presale market crowded with hype and vaporware, Coldware (COLD), Remittix, and Little Pepe have risen to the top by offering real products, strong tokenomics, and undeniable market demand. Investors chasing the “greatest presale of all time” narrative may find that this trio has already claimed the title.\nFor more information on the Coldware (COLD) Presale:\nVisit Coldware (COLD)\nJoin and become a community member:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Some projects in early stages are targeting 200x growth, which could turn $500 into $100,000. Presales in 2025 that have good tech, clear tokenomics and actual utility are receiving the most attention. Analysts have pointed out such projects, and an Ethereum-based AI platform heads the list.\nOzak AI: Ethereum-Based AI With High ROI Potential\nOzak AI is building a predictive analytics platform for financial markets. It combines machine learning with blockchain to deliver real-time insights. Ozak Stream Network (OSN) ensures low-latency data processing, Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) handle secure distribution, Ozak Data Vaults provide safe storage and customizable Prediction Agents allow non-coders to build AI models for trading and forecasting.\nThe OZ token fuels the platform, covering transactions, AI agent customization, user rewards and governance rights. Tokenomics are designed for scalability and long-term demand with a capped supply of 10 billion distributed as:\n-\n30% presale\n-\n30% ecosystem and community\n-\n20% reserve\n-\n10% liquidity and listings\n-\n10% team\nThe current presale price is $0.005, with about 124 million tokens sold and $1.8 million raised. The next phase will increase the price to $0.01 and the target is set to $1. The entry fee is a minimum of 100 USD, either in ETH, USDT or USDC. Hitting its price target would turn a position having $500 into one with $100,000 with its theme of growth being 200x\nOther Presales With Strong Growth Cases\nBitcoin Hyper is building a Bitcoin layer 2 blockchain using Solana Virtual Machine tooling, ZK rollups and a canonical bridge. This allows smart contracts on Bitcoin while keeping interoperability with Solana.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) is a meme coin with Layer-2 performance. It’s set up for fast, low-cost transactions for meme tokens, NFTs and community projects. But it doesn’t have the broader multi-asset support of other platforms yet.\nRexas Finance (REX) is in the DeFi space, providing tools to interact with dApps and ensure liquidity at scale. The DeFi market is on the rise, but it is more narrow than platforms that cover multiple markets.\nLightchain (LTC) is entering the metaverse with integrated NFTs and virtual economies. It’s creating an interactive digital world for creators and users, one of the fastest-growing areas of blockchain.\nConclusion\nPresales with advanced tech and clear use cases are getting attention from investors. Ozak AI’s combination of Ethereum-based AI, decentralized infrastructure and customizable predictive tools is unique. Its presale metrics, capped supply and price targets are aligned to multiply early investments by 200x. Along with Bitcoin Hyper, Little Pepe, Rexas Finance and Lightchain, it’s a short list of presales with scale, vision and structure to deliver high returns. If you want to turn $500 into $100,000 in 2025, Ozak AI is leading the conversation.\nFor More Information about Ozak AI, visit the links below.\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Yet, while Cardano ADA’s chart patterns excite swing traders, a different conversation is taking place among presale-focused investors: Coldware (COLD) is quietly progressing through its Stage 3 presale, with prices set to rise from $0.008 to $0.00975 in the next stage.\nColdware’s Stage 3 Presale Momentum\nColdware has already raised over $7.73 million, selling 73.77% of available tokens for Stage 3. With just 26.23% supply remaining, the next valuation step is approaching fast. The project’s limited-time “50FLASH” offer allows investors to claim additional tokens on purchase, a move designed to reward early adopters and accelerate distribution.\nThis isn’t a vaporware blockchain promise — Coldware (COLD) is already delivering a hardware ecosystem, including the Larna 2400® Web3 smartphone with encrypted calls, blockchain messaging, and a dedicated dApp store. The lineup also features the ColdBook® laptop, decentralized VPN, and a fully integrated wallet solution, all running on the Coldware Layer-1 mainnet and subnet.\nWhy ADA and COLD Attract Different Investor Profiles\nCardano ADA’s price action is driven by market-wide risk sentiment and its roadmap progress on scaling solutions like Hydra and smart contract optimizations. Technical indicators — including a MACD crossover and RSI in the low 60s — suggest bullish continuation if $0.86 resistance is breached. Traders with short-to-medium-term horizons are targeting the $0.921 breakout level, with some analysts suggesting a stretch toward $1.05 under strong market conditions.\nColdware (COLD), meanwhile, appeals to early-stage investors who prefer locking in a low fixed price before listing. Its tokenomics blend blockchain transaction fees with hardware sales revenue, creating a diversified business model uncommon in the current altcoin landscape.\nHow Coldware Could Outpace ADA’s Percentage Gains\nWhile Cardano ADA’s potential move from $0.85 to $1.05 offers around 23% upside, Coldware’s presale stage jumps are far steeper in relative terms. A shift from $0.008 to even modest exchange pricing could eclipse ADA’s rally multiples, especially given the hardware product tie-ins and real adoption potential.\nMarket Context and Altcoin Rotation\nWith Ethereum approaching $5,000 and Bitcoin holding strength above key supports, altcoin capital rotation is intensifying. This environment often sees a split in strategies: traders chase liquid large caps like ADA for technical breakouts, while early-entry capital flows into presales like Coldware (COLD) for asymmetrical upside.\nConclusion\nCardano’s bullish technical setup offers a compelling short-term trade with clearly defined targets, and its broader ecosystem continues to mature. However, Coldware (COLD) represents a fundamentally different play — one that fuses a functioning hardware lineup with blockchain infrastructure, currently available at pre-market pricing. For investors weighing immediate chart-driven moves against the potential of a utility-backed presale, Coldware’s Stage 3 window presents a unique entry before valuation steps higher.\nFor more information on the Coldware (COLD) Presale:\nVisit Coldware (COLD)\nJoin and become a community member:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

This marks the group’s first major sale since amassing a total of 1.21 million ETH, currently valued at $5.6 billion. The transactions were executed at an average price of $4,532, just as Ethereum trades within 5% of its November 2021 all-time high of around $4,800.\nAccumulation History and Strategy\nBetween February 3 and April 7, the whale group purchased 103,543 ETH worth $229.7 million at an average price of $2,219. This buying spree included a notable $42.2 million acquisition of 24,817 ETH at $1,700 in early April. Transaction data shows the assets are distributed across multiple wallets, pointing to a deliberate strategy to diversify holdings and obscure large-scale movements. Significant deposits have also been made into Aave v3, a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol.\nInstitutional Inflows\nThe sell-off comes during a period of heightened institutional demand. Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have posted six consecutive days of inflows, totaling $523.9 million on August 12, following a record $1 billion single-day inflow earlier in the month. Corporate treasuries now collectively hold $16.4 billion worth of ETH across 64 companies, with BitMine Immersion Technologies topping the list at 1.2 million ETH valued at $5.27 billion.\nThe Ethereum Foundation also liquidated 2,795 ETH, worth about $12.7 million, in two transactions as prices hit yearly highs. This sale reduced the Foundation’s ETH holdings to just 99.9 ETH alongside 11.6 million DAI.\nThe move has sparked mixed reactions within the community, with some viewing it as strategic profit-taking and others criticizing the timing.\nNetwork Activity and Market Sentiment\nShort-term holders are currently realizing around $553 million in daily gains, significantly outpacing the activity of long-term holders, according to Glassnode. Despite a 43% price surge over the past month, ETH remains 39% below the previous month’s peak levels.\nMeanwhile, global search interest for “Ethereum” has reached its highest point since 2021, with North Macedonia, Switzerland, Singapore, Slovenia, and Austria leading the trend. Ethereum’s network has also hit a record 1.875 million daily transactions, underscoring strong on-chain activity.\nWhile some large holders are taking profits, others remain bullish. Over the weekend, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes disclosed that he had re-entered the market, purchasing Ethereum just a week after selling $10.5 million worth when the asset traded at $3,507. The divergence in strategies highlights ongoing uncertainty over whether the current rally has further room to run or is primed for a correction.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The result is a network that is faster, more efficient, and built for mass adoption from day one.\nDesigned to safeguard what it calls the five pillars of digital life, which are identity, money, work, community, and data, QF Network achieves block times of just 0.1 seconds through its SPIN consensus without compromising decentralization, a feat no other Layer 1 has achieved. This architecture delivers throughput up to 10× higher than standard Substrate chains and is engineered to support millions of daily users without performance bottlenecks, thanks to its parallel execution engine.\n“Our mainnet launch is not just about going live, it is about proving that a blockchain can be fast, scalable, and still sovereign by design,” said Ben Burge, Founder of Quantum Fusion Network. “We have built the foundation for dApps that feel instant, secure, and unstoppable.”\nQF’s native-first SDK, verifiable off-chain compute, and zkTLS integration create an environment where developers can build applications that match Web2 performance without compromising decentralization. This technical stack bridges Web2 and Web3, maintaining security and verification while removing friction for end users.\nFor developers, this means the ability to compete with centralized platforms on speed and reliability while retaining core blockchain principles. For users, it means experiencing decentralized applications without the latency, throughput limits, or usability compromises that have slowed blockchain adoption.\nMainnet is on track for Q4 2025. When it arrives, QF intends not just to join the Layer-1 race, but to set a new standard for it.\nAbout QF Network\nQF Network is a sovereign Layer-1 blockchain built to safeguard identity, money, work, community, and data for the next century. Powered by SPIN consensus, parallel execution, RISC-V architecture, verifiable off-chain compute, and zkTLS, QF delivers Web2-grade performance without sacrificing neutrality or decentralization.\nWebsite: https://qfnetwork.xyz/\nX: https://x.com/theqfnetwork?s=21\nContact\nCo FounderBen Burge\nQF Network\n[email protected]\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

The partnership follows Bybit's receipt of its MiCAR license in May 2025 and the rollout of Bybit.eu, enabling verified EEA users to onboard to a fully compliant platform, where they can get yield approved assets to earn XION.\nThe Launchpool will feature a total pool size of 100,000 XION, distributed as follows:\n- 50,000 XION to XION stakers (estimated APR: 60%)\n- 30,000 XION to MNT stakers (estimated APR: 36%)\n- 20,000 XION to USDC stakers (estimated APR: 24%)\nAs one of the few Layer-1 projects backed by Circle Ventures, XION has seen strong traction in bringing blockchain-based experiences to everyday users, with over 100+ global brands leveraging its platform. XION has been steadily growing its European presence, as it became the first Layer-1 blockchain to publish a MiCA Title II whitepaper, integrated natively with Paris-based Ledger in June, listed on Bitvavo earlier this summer, and is already working with leading European brands on blockchain-powered consumer experiences.\nSimilarly, one of Bybit's main focuses in 2025 is its European expansion. Being the inaugural Launchpool partner on Bybit EU MiCAR-compliant EU platform, XION will have access to a growing regulated European audience.\n\"Being the very first Launchpool on Bybit EU is a major signal of XION's deep partnership with Bybit and our shared focus on expanding compliantly in the European markets,\" said Anthony Anzalone, Founder of XION. \"Europe is now the proving ground for regulated digital assets, and together with Bybit EU we're setting a precedent for how mainstream audiences can discover and engage with blockchain technology in a safe, intuitive way.\"\n\"Recently securing our MiCAR license in Austria represents our commitment and major focus in 2025 to bring compliant, innovative crypto services to European users. Today's launch with XION, a blockchain focused on mainstream adoption of crypto, demonstrates how regulation can accelerate rather than hinder innovation, and perfectly aligns with our European expansion strategy.\" - Mazurka Zheng, CEO of Bybit EU.\nThe collaboration also builds on XION's earlier relationship with Bybit, where the company featured on Bybit Global's Launchpool during its TGE. The renewed partnership underscores the two companies' shared commitment to making blockchain accessible to everyday users.\nAbout XION\nXION is the first walletless L1 blockchain purpose-built for consumer adoption. Utilizing protocol-level implementations related to abstracted accounts, signatures, fees, interoperability, and more, XION empowers developers to build secure, intuitive, and seamless user experiences.

That said, the price has come back since tapping the big resistance at $1 and has currently reached a support level. It remains to be seen if this hot market will help the price return to attempt this major resistance, or whether a retest of the breakout might take place.

The emergence of IEByte mining machine cloud mining platform has perfectly solved this problem, making low-cost and high-return mining possible.\nWhat Is Cloud Mining?\nCloud mining is a method to mine cryptocurrencies by leasing equipment or renting computing power from data centers. It negates the process of individually setting up physical mining hardware, getting a high-speed internet connection, sourcing electricity, and maintaining the hardware.\nWhat are the advantages of cloud mining?\nThe main advantage of cloud mining is that it allows easy access to cryptocurrencies without a large initial investment. You do not need to spend a lot of money on mining equipment, and you can monitor the performance of these machines by accessing them through the most common devices (PC, tablet, smartphone, etc.).\nIn addition, this is an activity that everyone can participate in, even complete beginners, since it does not require any special expertise. Profits can be obtained simply by renting the services of miners through cloud mining platforms.\nWhat are the disadvantages of cloud mining?\nAmong the main disadvantages of cloud mining, we can cite the risk of fraud (which, unfortunately, still exists in this market) and the low decision-making power of mining.\nIn addition, most of such platforms offer long-term contracts with fixed subscriptions (1 or 2-year commitments), which is risky given the large fluctuations in the prices of the cryptocurrency market. If a currency collapses, then an attractive yield today may be harmful in the future.\nIs cloud mining safe for me?\nCloud mining is safe if you choose a reputable platform.\nWhich Is The Best Cloud Mining Available In The Market Today?\nBest cloud mining depends on factors, like trustworthiness, mining fee, contract duration, and coin to mine. However, as per our research, IEByte, Genesis Mining,Bitdeer and ECOS are some of the best cloud mining services available today.\nIEByte stands out in the cryptocurrency industry by offering a profitable model that requires no professional knowledge or trading acumen.

{"title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Hits New All-Time High: Are Buyers losing steam?", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/bitcoin-btc-hits-new-all-time-high-are-buyers-losing-steam", "text": "Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $124,000 early on Thursday. Following the high, the price retraced to just above $121,000. While the crypto market is very bullish, buyers are starting to lose steam. Could buyer exhaustion bring the price further down?\nExcitement continues to grow\nThe good news for crypto just keeps on coming, at least in the US, which is the main market for alternative assets. Only just last week, President Trump signed an executive order allowing Americans to invest their 401(k) retirement savings accounts into crypto. Looking into the future, this move alone could open the door to some of the more than $12 trillion that is invested into these plans.\nWith Bitcoin just having hit a new all-time high it might be expected that this surge continues. Excitement is growing by the day and the US stock exchanges are riding high, making their own all-time highs with mounting regularity.\nA note of caution\nHowever, Bitcoin is just on the edge of the overbought zone. Therefore, two possible scenarios could play out. Firstly, the market could continue to climb higher, but eventually reach a point where buyer exhaustion causes a precipitous plunge back to earth. The other potential scenario is that the Bitcoin price starts to track sideways again until the momentum indicators for the shorter term time frames have reset.\nThis is still a bull market\nOne thing to bear in mind is that this is a bull market, and it is entering what could be its final stage. The trend is up, and is likely to remain so. There will probably be more corrections to come, but in the main, this market is likely to go higher.\n$BTC in healthy trend higher\nSource: TradingView\nThe short-term time frame shows that since leaving the bull flag the $BTC price has continued higher, but in a very healthy ebb and flow manner, without surging madly.\nAfter making the all-time high, the price has come back to test the tops of the candles from the last upward impulse. The Fibonacci levels for this entire bull flag move reveal that the price is now beyond the 0.786 level. The 1.618 extension level is overhead, pretty much exactly at $130,000.\nFinally, the ascending trendline (faint dotted line) is still being respected. So until it’s not, this particular upside impulse is probably set to continue.\n$BTC continuation of this upside move?\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily time frame illustrates the trend break in the RSI. The indicator line broke up through the descending trendline and this was reflected in the bull flag breakout in the price action.\nNow this recent upward trend (faint dotted line) has reached the point where it will either continue, or it will break down. A bounce of the indicator line from this ascending trendline would signal a continuation of the upside move.\n$BTC price follows bull market parabolic curve\nSource: TradingView\nZoomed right out on the weekly time frame, the entirety of this bull run plus the climatic stage of the previous one can be viewed. The Fibonacci extension levels indicate that the 1.618 Fibonacci level was reached at just over $100,000, while the 2.618 level is overhead at a price of almost $155,000 - a very possible target.\nIt can be seen that the price action is still keeping to the parabolic curve, meaning that the price is likely to continue to rise steeply. At the bottom of the chart, the Hash Ribbons indicator has printed a row of 3 back-to-back blue buy signals. Such a tight group of 3 buy signals has never printed before on the weekly time frame. It can only be imagined what could happen to the price from here.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Top Blockchain Projects to Watch in 2025", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/top-blockchain-projects-to-watch-in-2025", "text": "The blockchain space is growing quickly, with new projects constantly emerging to address specific industry needs. As we look ahead to 2025, several mid-tier blockchain projects stand out for their practical applications, unique ecosystems, and significant growth potential.\nHere in this article will take a closer look at five blockchain projects that are worth keeping an eye on in 2025: Gleec, Mosaic Alpha, Hedera, Quant, and VeChain. Each of these projects brings a different approach to the blockchain landscape, offering solutions for financial tools, decentralized finance, enterprise-grade performance, interoperability, and supply chain transparency.\n1; Gleec\nGleec was initially introduced in 2015 as a safe communications system. Nevertheless, it later became a complete blockchain ecosystem developed on top of a Bitcoin fork. Its native token is GLEEC which consists of 21 million capped tokens, and is used to facilitate different kinds of financial and digital services, seeking to provide convenient solutions to users in emerging markets.\nEcosystem:\nGleec has developed a number of new tools that users can now access to facilitate their entry into the crypto environment and close the gap between crypto and traditional finance.\n-\nGleec Pay: An IBAN crypto-friendly service, that supports fiat-to-crypto conversions effortlessly, e.g., in areas where access to banking solutions is restricted.\n-\nGleec Card: Visa-backed debit card which can use the creations to spend their crypto assets with millions of companies and shops across the globe.\n-\nGleec BTC Exchange: The exchange venue is approved in El Salvador and promotes BTC-to-USD exchanges since the nation offers friendly terms towards cryptocurrencies.\n-\nRaphael Coin: This is a new project that offers tokenized art benefiting surging interest in digital assets and NFTs.\nWhat are Gleec’s Use Cases? Gleec employs a proof-of-work consensus mechanism like Bitcoin, which can make the mechanism highly secure and transparent. It is traded over 15 exchanges such as HitBTC and Changelly and has a market cap of about $43 million.\nRecent Developments:\nIn 2024, Gleec had its exchange granted regulatory approval in El Salvador and launched staking rewards and community governance capabilities. Another area of focus is increasing the outreach of the platform through partnership with other regional fintechs to scale Gleec Pay.\nWhy Watch in 2025:\nGleec’s focus on practical financial tools for emerging markets positions it well for growth. The small market cap and its low-profile status make it a potential sleeper hit, though it faces competition from larger payment-focused blockchains like Ripple.\n2; Mosaic Alpha\nMosaic Alpha, a decentralized platform that launched on the Binance Smart Chain, makes DeFi investing easier by providing token baskets. Those baskets represent a preselected portfolio of assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polkadot, and are set to make the crypto investment process more accessible to new and seasoned investors.\nEcosystem:\nThe mosaic Alpha ecosystem centers itself on a simple portfolio management feature, simplifying the ability of users to diversify their investments.\n-\nToken Baskets: Portfolios that have been built or created to hand users a selection of crypto assets to invest in simultaneously.\n-\nMosaic Wallet: Mosaic Wallet is an Ethereum wallet, which gives you a complete control over your assets, and natively integrates with multiple DeFi systems.\n-\nMosaic Chain: The project is developing a Polkadot parachain to increase its scalability and multi-hub capabilities.\nTechnical Details:\nThe platform runs on the BNB Chain with low fees and fast transactions. Transaction fees can be paid by using KDX tokens, as well as using the token to access premium services, like advanced portfolio analytics. The platform is built in a manner that is deeply decentralized, and governed by the community.\nRecent Developments:\nIn 2024, Mosaic Alpha introduced emerging DeFi tokens to its token basket, and it incorporated Polkadot into the ecosystem in which to be interoperating. New governance features have also been implemented on the platform such as top holders being allowed to curate baskets.\nWhy Watch in 2025:\nMosaic Alpha stands out for its user-centric approach to DeFi investing, making it accessible to a wide range of investors. Its integration with Polkadot ensures scalability, though it will need to compete with established DeFi giants like Aave and Yearn Finance.\n3; Hedera\nHedera was launched in 2018 and uses the hashgraph consensus algorithm to provide transactions at high speeds and low costs. It is a platform overseen by a council of international enterprises such as Google, IBM, and Boeing which endears it as a reliable solution to enterprise and DeFi applications.\nEcosystem:\nThe Hedera ecosystem is intended to enable diverse use cases, ranging to enterprise applications to decentralized finance.\n-\nHedera Token Service (HTS): Gives businesses the power to create specialized tokens to support their initiatives in an easy way.\n-\nHedera Consensus Service (HCS): A high-throughput data verification service dedicated to the tracking of supply chains, as well as financial settlements, among others.\n-\nSmart Contracts: Hedera embraces Solidity based smart contracts whose finality occurs within 3-5 seconds.\nTechnical Details:\nHedera is built upon hashgraph, a more energy-efficient and faster-transacting consensus algorithm as compared to the traditional blockchains. It has a capacity that can handle more than 10,000 transactions each second and it is carbon negative.\nRecent Developments:\nIn 2024 Hedera increased its DeFi integrations and partnered with Indian Institute of Technology to encourage blockchain education. On top of this, the platform is launching the HashSphere project, a personal blockchain that integrates regulated sectors, in 2025.\nWhy Watch in 2025:\nThe enterprise support and high-performance nature of Hedera gives it a competitive advantage regarding institutional adoption. Nonetheless, its governmental structure is centralized, which can be the cause of alarm among blockchain enthusiasts.\n4; Quant\nQuant works on addressing the burning problem of blockchain interoperability. The communication between the various blockchains, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, or Ripple, is made possible via its Overledger platform without involving the creation of a new network.\nEcosystem:\nOverledger is the most significant element of the Quant ecosystem that offers the solution to an interconnection issue between blockchain networks of various enterprises.\n-\nOverledger: Network-agnostic API which links the public and the private blockchains and allows cross-chain payments and sharing of data.\n-\nQNT Token: QNT coin is a native token of the platform and helps to license the platform as well as pay fees on transactions.\nTechnical Details:\nQuant is a layer-1.5 solution that does not build a new blockchain instead of integrating the existing ones. This renders it an impartial stage of cross-chain data and asset transfer. The total number of QNT tokens (approximately 14.6 million) provides the project with stability.\nRecent Developments:\nIn 2024, Quant collaborated with UK financial institutions on tokenized securities testing and added to its Overledger APIs to further interoperability within DeFi. Its grants were community driven, and it further added to the expansion of the platform ecosystem.\nWhy Watch in 2025:\nQuant’s focus on interoperability positions it as a key player in blockchain adoption, especially as cross-chain capabilities become more essential for enterprises. Its neutrality makes it a strong solution for developers looking for a seamless connection between different blockchain networks.\n5; VeChain\nVeChain is a blockchain platform established in 2015 aimed at enhancing the transparency of the supply chain. Its two-token model (VET to transfer values and VTHO to pay the transaction fees) has taken it on the top of the list of companies that offer blockchain solution to any company across the world.\nEcosystem:\nVeChain’s ecosystem focuses on offering businesses solutions for traceability, sustainability, and logistics.\n-\nToolChain: A plug-and-play platform that enables businesses to use blockchain as a supply chain traceability mechanism, and luxury goods in particular authentication, and in food safety.\n-\nVeChainThor: A public chain that allows smart contracts and decentralized apps to be carried out that makes transactions cheap.\nTechnical Details:\nVeChain uses a proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, which ensures efficiency and scalability. Transaction costs are minimal, around $0.01 in VTHO, making it attractive for enterprise use.\nRecent Developments:\nIn 2024, VeChain expanded its carbon tracking programs and introduced new integrations for SMEs in Asia. Its node infrastructure was also upgraded for faster transaction processing, further enhancing scalability.\nWhy Watch in 2025:\nVeChain’s established partnerships with global brands and its focus on transparency and sustainability make it a top choice for enterprises looking to implement blockchain technology in supply chain management.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

And at the forefront of this transformation are two radically different projects: Coldware (COLD) and BlockDag (BDAG). While both are reshaping how we engage with blockchain technology, they’re doing so from opposite ends of the spectrum—Coldware (COLD) from a hardware-first access point, and BlockDag (BDAG) from a software-layered developer ecosystem.\nColdware (COLD): The Gateway to Everyday Decentralization\nColdware (COLD) is the only crypto presale that combines blockchain utility with physical consumer devices. Instead of expecting users to download wallets, secure their own private keys, or master DeFi protocols, Coldware (COLD) bakes it all into encrypted smartphones and laptops. These devices function as decentralized nodes, cold wallets, messaging tools, and access points to Web3 apps.\nThis presale is catching fire—and for good reason. As of August 2025, Coldware (COLD) is in Stage 3 of its 20-stage presale, with 1.3B + tokens sold and over $7.7 million raised. The current presale price is $0.008, set to climb towards a launch price of $0.3517—a potential 3,924% gain for early backers. Less than 25% of the Stage 3 allocation remains, and investors can still claim 50% bonus tokens via the promo code 50FLASH.\nBut more than numbers, Coldware (COLD) is solving a critical bottleneck: onboarding. Crypto still intimidates the average person, and Coldware’s plug-and-play devices may be the missing link to global adoption. With built-in dApp store access, gasless wallet transfers, and hardware-level security, it lowers the barrier to entry for both retail users and institutions.\nBlockDag (BDAG): Developer Fuel for a Multi-Layered Ecosystem\nOn the flip side, BlockDag (BDAG) is staking its future on developer engagement. With a staggering $371 million raised and over 25.1 billion tokens sold, this presale is one of the largest of 2025. And the growth hasn’t slowed—BlockDag (BDAG) is now priced at $0.0276, reflecting a 2,660% return since its earliest batch.\nWhat makes BlockDag (BDAG) stand out is its laser focus on builders. Its flagship Hackathon has attracted over 500 development teams, using Solidity-compatible and low-code tools to create dApps across DeFi, gaming, and AI.\nWhereas many projects hope for post-launch innovation, BlockDag (BDAG) is ensuring the Mainnet goes live with utility from day one. That’s a massive differentiator—and one that makes BDAG more than a speculation token.\nHardware vs. Software: Which Layer Wins Long-Term?\nThe fascinating part of this comparison isn’t which token performs better—it’s how well they complement each other.\nColdware (COLD) brings physical access. Its smartphones and laptops become the secure endpoint where users interact with the blockchain—possibly even with BlockDag (BDAG) applications. Meanwhile, BlockDag (BDAG) builds the infrastructure: a scalable, fast, and app-rich ecosystem ready to power the next generation of blockchain utility.\nIn this sense, the combination of Coldware (COLD) and BlockDag (BDAG) could mirror the relationship between iPhones and the App Store. One delivers the device; the other brings the experience.\nWhy 2025 Investors Are Buying Both\nInvestors are increasingly recognizing that crypto’s next bull run won’t be fueled by hype alone. Tokens like Coldware (COLD) and BlockDag (BDAG) are seeing record presale interest because they offer actual products—hardware, apps, and development frameworks—that will survive market cycles.\nWhere Coldware (COLD) shines in accessibility and self-custody, BlockDag (BDAG) wins in utility and developer support. Backing both is a bet on Web3’s full-stack future.\nConclusion: Two Layers, One Future\nCrypto’s evolution is being driven by real-world relevance. Coldware (COLD) brings decentralization to your pocket, while BlockDag (BDAG) fuels the apps that make those devices powerful. If you're looking for 2025 tokens that bridge speculation and substance, both Coldware (COLD) and BlockDag (BDAG) deserve a front-row spot in your portfolio.\nFor more information on the Coldware (COLD) Presale:\nVisit Coldware (COLD)\nJoin and become a community member:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "ReactorTrade Kicks Off $REACT Token Sale Ahead of TGE as DeFi Market Cap Hits $98B", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/reactortrade-kicks-off-react-token-sale-ahead-of-tge-as-defi-market-cap-hits-98b", "text": "ReactorTrade, a decentralized trading platform, has begun the sale of its native $REACT token, the core utility token of the ReactorTrade ecosystem. $REACT powers all value exchange between traders, liquidity providers, strategy developers, and platform participants, acting as the gateway to governance, premium features, and incentive mechanisms. This marks the start of community distribution, well before the Token Generation Event (TGE). Unlike a TGE — which unlocks token liquidity and market trading — the current public sale phase allows early supporters to secure allocations at a discounted rate ahead of exchange listings and full ecosystem activation.\nThe initial distribution phase begins alongside the first phase of ReactorTrade’s public rollout — the Trade Aggregation Engine — with yield aggregation vaults scheduled for Q4 2025 and dynamic perpetuals set to follow in early 2026, forming a multi-phase product roadmap designed to steadily expand user capabilities.\nDeFi Market Momentum Supports $REACT’s Public Sale\nThe timing coincides with a surge of interest across the DeFi sector. As of June 2025, the combined market capitalization of top DeFi tokens reached $98.4 billion, representing a 38% year-over-year surge from $71.2 billion. Across the sector, the numbers show investors are once again interested in productive, infrastructure-focused crypto assets.\nAccording to industry data, DeFi was June’s top-performing category with a roughly 10.9% increase in total value locked, even as the broader crypto market remained flat.\nMeanwhile, the Coinbase COIN50 index showed a strong increase in TVL across DeFi assets. This all but confirms sustained momentum at a time when the broader market and other sectors are showing flat or even declining trends. ReactorTrade’s token sale taps into this trend, positioning $REACT amid a DeFi upswing that is valuing utility, governance power, and yield mechanics.\nMore About $REACT\n$REACT launches with a maximum supply based on a $30M starting fully diluted valuation (FDV), with an FDV of $100M projected at TGE. The current price of the token is $0.03, increasing to $0.10 at the TGE. $REACT will be available on BNB Chain and Base.\nThe global token distribution follows a deflationary supply model: for every token sold to the community, an equal token is permanently burned. The token allocation is 20% LP tokens, 25% community tokens, 5% team tokens (locked for 12 months, then vested linearly over 24 months), 20% ecosystem growth, 2% KOLs, 3% advisors, and 25% burned.\nUnder the burn-on-sale model, the “community tokens” share is flexible — for every token sold, an equivalent token is earned for distribution, and the undistributed portion adjusts accordingly. For example, if 35% of the supply is sold, 35% will be earned for distribution and the undistributed share will drop proportionally.\nIn terms of utility, $REACT acts as the core economic and governance layer for ReactorTrade. Holders can vote on protocol decisions like new market listings and feature priorities, with voting power tied to holdings or staking levels. Stakers can also earn trading fee discounts, liquidity reward multipliers, and access to event-based promotions. Token holdings will determine membership tiers, to be introduced after the first stage of the sale, offering varying bonuses and perks for participants. Certain premium features, such as early market access, advanced trading bots, exclusive analytics, and alpha/beta testing participation, are token-gated and require either a minimum holding or staking commitment. This mechanism ties token scarcity directly to platform adoption — a rarity among DeFi governance models — creating a clear link between network growth and tokenholder value.\nTo further widen community participation, ReactorTrade is introducing its “ConvertDrop” program, allowing early supporters and partner protocol communities to swap certain assets or stake holdings in exchange for recurring $REACT airdrops, reinforcing grassroots ownership from day one.\nAbout ReactorTrade and the $REACT Token\nReactorTrade is a decentralized trading and yield platform combining spot trading, permissionless perpetuals, and meta-governance yield aggregation in one interface. By unifying liquidity aggregation, yield strategies, and governance, it solves a core DeFi pain point — switching between multiple tools to trade, farm, and vote. Its hybrid architecture blends aggregated AMM liquidity, on-chain order book access, and automated strategy vaults for deep liquidity, fast execution, and reduced MEV risk. Built with a community-first approach and backed by seed funding, ReactorTrade is designed for progressive decentralization, with its $REACT token powering governance, incentives, and long-term value alignment across the ecosystem.\nHave questions about ReactorTrade and its token?

By doing so, they aim to increase net asset value per share and expand token ownership. Pantera believes this approach offers superior return potential compared to simply holding tokens directly or via ETFs, which typically track spot market performance without generating operational yield.\nPantera’s Investment Scope and Thesis\nThe venture capital firm has targeted DAT firms in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Israel, with holdings spanning Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, BNB, Toncoin, Hyperliquid, Sui, and Ethena. Companies in Pantera’s portfolio include BitMine Immersion, Twenty One Capital, DeFi Development Corp, SharpLink Gaming, Satsuma Technology, Verb Technology Company, CEA Industries, and Mill City Ventures III.\nGeneral partner Cosmo Jiang and head of content Erik Lowe emphasised that these companies are “employing strategies to grow their digital asset holdings in a per-share accretive way,” positioning them to benefit from both market appreciation and yield generation.\nEthereum as a Core Bet\nBitMine Immersion, one of Pantera’s key investments, has recently launched an Ethereum-focused treasury strategy, becoming the largest ETH treasury holder and the third-largest DAT globally with 1.15 million ETH valued at $4.9 billion as of August 10. Pantera views Ethereum as a long-term macro growth driver, underpinned by increasing institutional adoption, tokenization of real-world assets, and stablecoin expansion.\nPublic blockchains currently host more than $25 billion in tokenized assets and $260 billion in stablecoins, with Ethereum capturing the majority of this activity. Since April 2025, ETH has gained 103% against Bitcoin, reinforcing Pantera’s conviction in its structural growth trajectory.\nMarket Context and Outlook\nThe rise of DATs reflects a broader institutional trend toward onchain treasury management. As financial institutions integrate blockchain for security, settlement, and staking participation, Pantera expects further growth in both the number and scale of DAT companies. The firm has raised two DAT-specific funds totalling over $100 million and has yet to decide on launching a third.\nBy aligning with companies actively compounding token holdings, Pantera aims to capture outsized gains compared to passive exposure, betting that crypto treasuries will emerge as a key segment in the digital asset market.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Market Overview: Why BlockDAG, Arbitrum, Stellar, & Mantle Rank as Top Cryptos to Buy Now", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/market-overview-why-blockdag-arbitrum-stellar-mantle-rank-as-top-cryptos-to-buy-now", "text": "The cryptocurrency market no longer feels like an experimental playground where speculation ruled the day. Over the past few years, it has matured into a space where structure, clear objectives, and measurable progress matter just as much as price action.\nProjects now compete on technology delivery, adoption metrics, and consistent execution, rather than simply riding hype cycles. This shift has made it easier to identify the top cryptos to buy now among names like Arbitrum, Stellar, and Mantle, based on real performance indicators. Let’s look at why these are considered the top cryptos to buy now, setting the stage for a deeper review of each.\n1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Pre-Launch Push Gains Market Momentum\nBlockDAG is gaining strong traction ahead of its mainnet, positioning itself among the top cryptos to buy now. Its approach focuses on building infrastructure and community before going live, a strategy that has already delivered impressive results.\nThe project has secured over $373 million in funding, sold more than 25 billion BDAG coins, and advanced through 29 batches, with the latest priced at $0.0276. Early participants from Batch 1 have already seen returns exceeding 2,600% compared to the current rate.\nThe network merges Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) scalability with Proof-of-Work (PoW) security, creating a hybrid Layer-1 model designed for speed, decentralisation, and resilience. This architecture addresses common blockchain bottlenecks while maintaining robust security standards, making it attractive for long-term adoption.\nBlockDAG’s ecosystem is already active. The X1 mobile mining app has attracted over 2.5 million users, while 19,000 ASIC miners have been distributed globally. This dual-tier mining system allows both casual participants and dedicated miners to contribute, ensuring a diverse hashrate and reducing the risk of centralisation.\nA live Demo Trading Dashboard adds another layer of engagement, letting users simulate trades, monitor real-time prices, and test platform features before the full launch. Unlike many early-stage crypto projects that depend on post-launch activity, BlockDAG (BDAG) enters the market with a ready community, functioning tools, and operational mining power.\n2. Arbitrum (ARB): Ethereum’s Layer-2 Leader\nArbitrum, priced at $0.40, is the leading Ethereum Layer-2 solution, integrating DeFi, NFTs, and numerous applications. Its expanding Total Value Locked (TVL) and strong network activity support long-term price growth. Analysts suggest ARB could reach $2.00–$3.00 in the next cycle, delivering 5–7x potential gains.\nFor example, $50 could become $300–$350. This consistent performance positions ARB as a reliable mid-cap choice. With its solid fundamentals and steady adoption, it earns a place among the top cryptos to buy now for balanced growth potential in a portfolio focused on both stability and reasonable returns.\n3. Stellar (XLM): Cross-Border Payments Power\nStellar trades at $0.41 with a $12.97 billion market cap, designed for fast cross-border transactions, remittances, and tokenised asset transfers. With a track record of real-world usage, XLM remains far below its all-time high of $0.94. A recovery to $1.50–$2.00 could mean a 4x–5x rise, where a $50 stake might turn into $200–$250.\nWhile its speculative upside is lower than some, Stellar’s practical utility strengthens portfolio diversity. For those aiming for consistent and utility-driven returns, it remains one of the most dependable picks among the current top cryptos to buy today.\n4. Mantle (MNT): Scalable Ethereum Rollup\nMantle, backed by BitDAO, operates as a modular Ethereum rollup, supporting DeFi and advanced infrastructure projects. Currently valued at $2.9 billion and priced at $0.87, it offers scalability and efficiency. Market forecasts point to significant growth in its Total Value Locked (TVL) and user activity, possibly pushing its price to $4–$8.\nThis translates into potential 5–10x returns, where $50 could grow to $250–$500. It serves as a strong mid-tier growth opportunity within a diversified portfolio, securing its position as one of today’s top cryptos to buy now for those seeking steady yet rewarding performance.\nLast Word on the Market’s Most Reliable Performers\nMarket cycles often reshape which projects hold lasting value, and the current phase is no exception. BlockDAG’s pre-launch momentum, proven fundraising success, and already active mining ecosystem make it the most compelling of the top cryptos to buy now. Arbitrum continues to benefit from its expanding role as Ethereum’s leading Layer-2, supported by consistent network growth.\nStellar’s focus on efficient cross-border transactions adds stability to any diversified portfolio. Mantle’s scalable rollup model positions it for steady adoption in DeFi infrastructure. Together, they reflect a market where structure now outweighs speculation, offering measured opportunities for those watching long-term performance.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

UNIL’s 415% Increase Upon Listing is Set to Outshine BNB and ADA – Time to Buy?", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/142-gain-from-0004-to-0009-unils-415-increase-upon-listing-is-set-to-outshine-bnb-and-ada-time-to-buy", "text": "The new AI altcoin Unilabs Finance (UNIL) has become a strong alternative to the BNB coin and Cardano crypto. Surpassing $12.8 million in funding in record time amid massive retail and whale demand, experts consider it the best new crypto to invest in. Its projected 415% rally from $0.009 to $0.05 makes it a bullish wave not to miss.\nThe BNB Coin Approaches a New High; Is a Pullback Close?\nAs the overall crypto market cap increased, exceeding $4 trillion, so did the BNB coin price. The exchange-based token surged by 10% over the past seven days to $830, approaching a breakout above its July ATH of $859.\nWith daily trading volume surpassing $2.8 billion (a 2% increase) and a broader market rally, the BNB coin could enter price discovery soon. However, despite the optimistic token price outlook, technical indicators, notably the RSI and MACD, suggest it is in an overbought area and could decline.\nNevertheless, a sustained rally, plus accelerating momentum, could send the BNB coin price higher, echoing Josh’s $920 target. However, if current support is lost, the altcoin price could retest its 30-day low of $675.\nCardano Crypto to $1 Soon?\nThe Layer-1 crypto ADA skyrocketed, marked by a 15% increase in the Cardano crypto price to $0.8. Surging forward, the market cap has also increased by 7% to $29.7 billion, cementing its position among the top 10 cryptocurrencies.\nAt the same time, the daily token trading volume has exceeded $2 billion (a 40% increase). As momentum accelerates, a breakout above $1 seems imminent, presenting a bullish and optimistic price outlook. Meanwhile, a breakout above $0.9 could ignite a significant run, positioning the Cardano crypto among the altcoins to watch.\nFurthermore, according to Messari, mindshare is “very high,” rising by 13% in the past week. This on-chain metric suggests growing investor interest and positions the Cardano crypto for higher upside. However, a dip below $0.75 could ignite a cascading sell-off toward $0.68, its 30-day low.\nUnilabs Finance (UNIL) — Can This New AI Token Outshine Top Altcoins?\nFollowing a 142% rally from $0.004 to $0.009, its current price in the sixth ICO stage, Unilabs Finance (UNIL) has been on investors’ radars. Still in its early stages, participation in the presale will yield a 415% gain at the listing price of $0.05, making it arguably the best new crypto to invest in.\nWith many looking beyond its anticipated gain, another of its biggest attractions is its bullish narrative. Compared to other DeFi protocols, Unilabs Finance (UNIL) intersects with artificial intelligence and traditional finance. It will be the world’s first AI-driven DeFi asset manager, poised to reshape the financial landscape and primed for adoption.\nAs it nears its debut, experts are optimistic about it outshining other protocols in the DeFAI category. For instance, while SUPRA has a $70 million market size and PAAL has a $110 million market cap, UNIL is on track for massive growth. This is because of features like staking and governance, as well as the sharing of 30% of the generated fees to token holders.\nClosing Thoughts\nAmid soaring presale demand, the UNIL ICO has crossed $12.8 million in funding and skyrocketed by 142%. With a 415% increase programmed on the launch day at $0.05, experts believe it is the best new crypto to invest in, potentially outshining the BNB coin and Cardano crypto.\nFor more information about Unilabs Finance (UNIL) visit the links below:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Back then, that money would have bought you about 3.57 trillion SHIB tokens. Now, let's skip ahead to August 2025, when SHIB is selling for about $0.00001233. At that price, your tiny 2020 buy would mean your $200 is now worth about $44.01 million. This dramatic increase is a clear example of how meme coins can deliver astonishing results. SHIB once peaked even higher, but with its current price around 86% lower than that all-time high, it shows how quickly values can swing in crypto. Still, SHIB made millionaires out of early believers. The question now is: What could be the next SHIB? Two meme coins have recently captured attention for their explosive potential. One is already showing massive traction, and another is building serious hype among early adopters. At the top of this list is Little Pepe (LILPEPE).\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin That’s Making Waves Before Its Launch\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) isn’t just another frog-themed token; it’s the future face of meme coin innovation. Built on a Layer 2 blockchain tailored for meme-driven ecosystems, it offers lightning-fast transactions, ultra-low gas fees, and full support for dApps. This makes it perfect for both traders and builders in the meme coin space. The ongoing presale has been nothing short of explosive. Beginning at just $0.0010 in Stage 1, Little Pepe is now in Stage 10 at $0.0019, and each round has sold out quicker than the last. The project has already drawn millions of unique wallets, and with only 26.5% of the 100 billion tokens available in the presale, the demand has been off the charts. At the expected launch price of $0.0030, early buyers are already sitting on strong paper gains. But that’s just the beginning. With analysts forecasting a potential rally that could see LILPEPE mirror SHIB’s trajectory, some believe a $200 investment now could climb past $45 million by 2027 if similar growth plays out.\nLittle Pepe isn’t riding the meme wave; it’s setting the tone for where meme coins are headed next.\n-\nAnti-bot Architecture: Built with protective layers to stop sniper bots, Little Pepe ensures fairer launches and trading environments.\n-\nSmart Community Building: The project is backed by multiple anonymous developers with a history of successful meme coin launches. Their marketing strategy has already resulted in LILPEPE being listed on CoinMarketCap before even hitting DEXs.\n-\nLegendary Lore: Little Pepe’s story is gaining attention. From the “swamps of Solidity” and “jungles of JavaScript,” this hero frog symbolizes transparency, decentralization, and unstoppable green candles.\n-\nA “CryptoWomb” Roadmap: With listings, staking features, NFT integration, and dApp partnerships on the schedule, LILPEPE is preparing for a major breakout post-launch.\nCrypto investors are noticing. Many are pouring capital into LILPEPE presale allocations, betting big on what could be the next historic meme coin pump.\nPudgy Penguins (PENGU): Cute Faces, Serious Gains\nWhile LILPEPE may be the freshest contender, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is another meme coin making waves. Priced around $0.0356, PENGU has already racked up a market cap of $2.25 billion, a sign that it’s more than just a cute face. The recent surge in trading volume, up 150% in 24 hours to $907 million, shows that investors are paying attention. Its breakout above $0.03 resistance now puts the coin on track to potentially soar, especially with whale interest increasing. Catalysts like the upcoming Pudgy Party game on the TON blockchain, and hints at a possible ETF filing with the SEC, have created a positive buzz that could carry PENGU even further, soaring your investment just like Shiba Inu did.\nThe Next Big Breakout\nMeme coins continue to prove that they’re more than just jokes; they’re serious vehicles for growth when paired with timing, hype, and community momentum. For those hunting the next big breakout, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) offers early positioning, an unstoppable presale, and all the energy of a frog ready to leap over the moon. Add PENGU to the watchlist, but if you’re looking for something still under the radar, LILPEPE is where the noise is getting louder by the minute. $200 in SHIB made millionaires.

Partnering with a platform that shares that mindset is a natural step for me, and I look forward to this journey,” said Jackson Jr.\nBTCC plans to use the collaboration to launch fan engagement initiatives, highlight core platform features such as futures trading and copy trading, and develop original content that offers a closer look at Jackson Jr.'s journey both on and off the court. Through these efforts, the company aims to bridge the gap between professional athletes and the evolving crypto landscape.\nAt the heart of the campaign is a shared commitment to security, focus, and long-term strategy.

{"title": "From $0.10 to $0.33: Why FUNToken Is on Track for a Major Price Surge in 2026", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/from-010-to-033-why-funtoken-is-on-track-for-a-major-price-surge-in-2026", "text": "After a year of steady momentum, FUNToken ($FUN) - trading around $0.0185 at the time of writing - is drawing attention for a bold prediction: that it could first reach $0.10 in the coming months and then push as high as $0.33 in 2026.\nWhile many projects rely on speculation to drive targets, FUNToken’s approach combines a proven deflationary model, community-powered adoption, and a clear roadmap.\nHere is a closer look at why analysts and early supporters believe this path is more than wishful thinking.\nThe First Milestone: How $0.10 Became Realistic\nThroughout 2025, FUNToken has laid the groundwork for the initial price leg up to $0.10, powered by several tangible achievements:\n-\nConsistent Burns\nIn June 2025 alone, 25 million tokens were burned, with future burns projected to grow as revenue scales. -\nUser Growth Through Telegram\nOver 105,000 active players are already using FUNToken’s Telegram bot. As more games launch, this number is expected to double. -\nExpanding Wallet Adoption\nThe project’s roadmap targets 500,000 wallets by the end of Q4 2025, creating a broad base of participants who transact daily.\nThese fundamentals have created real upward price pressure, and reaching $0.10 is increasingly seen as the natural outcome of this progress rather than a speculative spike.\nWhat Will Drive the Next Phase to $0.33?\nMoving from $0.10 to $0.33 will require not just momentum but a different scale of adoption, engagement, and disciplined supply reduction. Here are the core drivers expected to power this next phase of growth:\n1. Scaling the Game Catalog\nBy early 2026, FUNToken plans to operate 30 or more live games across Telegram, iOS, and Android platforms. Each release has three important effects:\n-\nDaily Active Transactions: Every new game generates thousands of daily micro-transactions, each contributing to platform fees and demand for FUN tokens. This steady activity base helps support liquidity and price floors.\n-\nRevenue for Burns: As usage grows, so does platform revenue. This revenue is then recycled into quarterly buybacks, removing tokens from circulation in a predictable, transparent way.\n-\nReferral Growth: New titles give existing players reasons to invite friends, further expanding the user base. Telegram’s built-in referral tools make it simple for users to share links and earn bonuses.\nWith the roadmap targeting 10 million players by Q2 2026, the impact on demand could be substantial. No other gaming token project has laid out this level of detail for scaling both content and community.\n2. The $5 Million Giveaway’s Ongoing Impact\nUnlike many promotional campaigns that last only a few weeks, the $5 million giveaway is structured to run over an extended period, rewarding not just early adopters but also those who stay engaged.\nThis initiative drives growth in several ways:\n-\nIt incentivizes users to hold and stake their tokens, reducing circulating supply.\n-\nIt motivates new players to join, play, and refer friends to earn rewards.\n-\nIt creates sustained buzz across Telegram communities and social media channels.\nAs more participants qualify for rewards, the program is expected to bring the community into the hundreds of thousands, increasing both awareness and transaction volumes.\n3. Staking as a Scarcity Engine\nStaking will become a cornerstone of FUNToken’s strategy once the dedicated FUN Wallet app launches in the coming quarters.\nHere is why staking is so important:\n-\nPredictable Lock-Ups: Tokens staked in smart contracts are effectively removed from the trading supply for a set period, reducing liquidity and sell pressure.\n-\nIncentives to Hold: Players will have reasons beyond passive yields to stake, including access to exclusive games, higher rewards, and premium features.\n-\nAccessibility: Integrating staking directly into the wallet app eliminates the need for separate DeFi platforms, making it easy for casual users to participate.\nIf even 20–30% of the growing base of wallet holders stake some of their tokens, the cumulative impact on supply could be significant, supporting a sustained price climb toward $0.33.\n4. Compounding Deflation\nOne of FUNToken’s most powerful mechanics is its commitment to quarterly burns funded by real platform revenue.\nOver time, the effect of these burns compounds:\n-\nEach quarter, fewer tokens remain in circulation.\n-\nAs the user base grows, the volume of burns increases.\n-\nA smaller supply means each incremental buy order has more impact on price.\nIn June 2025, the project burned 25 million FUN tokens. With the planned expansion in games, staking, and active users, future burns could grow substantially. Historically, this combination of shrinking supply and rising demand has been the catalyst for major price movements in other deflationary ecosystems.\nWhat the Timeline Looks Like\nHere is a simplified view of how this journey could unfold:\n|\nMilestone |\nEstimated Period |\nTarget Price Range |\n|\n$0.10 achieved |\nQ4 2025 |\n$0.08 – $0.10 |\n|\n1M wallets and 10M players |\nQ2 2026 |\n$0.15 – $0.20 |\n|\nSustained burns and staking growth |\nQ3 – Q4 2026 |\n$0.25 – $0.33 |\nWhile no outcome is guaranteed, this roadmap demonstrates a clear, staged approach to scaling both utility and token scarcity.\nWhat Sets FUNToken Apart\nHere are a few reasons FUNToken’s strategy is different from other gaming tokens:\n-\nProven Execution\nEvery major milestone so far has been delivered transparently. -\nAccessible Onboarding\nWith frictionless Telegram integration and a simple wallet app, the project is attracting casual users, not just crypto traders. -\nCommunity-Driven Growth\nThe combination of staking, referrals, and the giveaway creates incentives for long-term holding and organic expansion.\nFinal Thoughts\nFUNToken’s journey from $0.10 to $0.33 will depend on continued execution and community engagement. But unlike projects that rely on hype cycles, FUNToken’s fundamentals are rooted in measurable adoption, regular burns, and a roadmap the team has consistently delivered on.\nFor investors and supporters watching closely, 2026 could be the year this unique combination of gaming, deflation, and community incentives translates into one of the most significant price surges in the Web3 space.\nNote: The price mentioned was accurate at the time of writing (July 14, 2025) and may have changed since\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "SHIB Chart Turns Bullish: Start of a Comeback, or Just a Dead Cat Bounce? These 2 Coins Could Be Better Buys Than Shiba Inu", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/shib-chart-turns-bullish-start-of-a-comeback-or-just-a-dead-cat-bounce-these-2-coins-could-be-better-buys-than-shiba-inu", "text": "As the Shiba Inu (SHIB) chart shows a notable 2.57% increase in the past 24 hours, traders are wondering: Is this the beginning of a serious rebound, or just another short-term \"dead cat bounce\"? With the price currently at $0.00001267, Shiba Inu has been climbing steadily from its recent low of $0.00001234, suggesting some renewed optimism. Investors looking for better opportunities in the meme coin space might want to keep an eye on two emerging competitors that are quickly gaining traction: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and its innovative Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 blockchain, and the rapidly growing token backed by strong security and community involvement.\nShiba Inu: Short-Term Bullish Momentum, But Potential Resistance Ahead\nSHIB is indicating near-term bullish activity in its price action. Trading volume increased by 122.98% over the last 24 hours, indicating an increase in interest in the market. The recent growth in the price of SHIB is comparable to the growth in the overall market value of the asset, which currently stands at $7.53 billion as the market cap.\nInvestors are, however, advised to be wary of SHIB, which is set to touch possible resistance points of the price in the range of $0.0000127.\nCardano (ADA) Shows Bullish Momentum with 3.73% Increase\nCardano (ADA) has recorded a 7.44% surge and is trading at around $0.7906. This is shown by the bouncing of the price at the relatively low price of $0.7413 following a bullish direction with an increase in the market sentiment.\nThe increase in volume was 102.46%, which was a sign of greater market participation. There was also an increasing market cap to 28.01 billion, which further strengthens the momentum in the upswing of ADA. Nonetheless, ADA may meet some resistance at a mark of about $0.792 that may restrict its increase in the short term. Conversely, there is support at $0.7376, and as long as this support holds, ADA could have a bullish price run.\nLittle Pepe: A Meme Coin With Real Utility\nLILPEPE is unlike many other meme coins that use solely hype. The memecoin is becoming a serious crypto project by launching its Ethereum-compatible layer-2 chain. This latest innovation makes Little Pepe have an advantage over other meme tokens since the currency has higher transaction speeds, reduced costs, and improved scalability. This is an essential set of features of a project that is based on high levels of community participation and active trading.\nThe reason most people are talking about Little Pepe isn’t just because it taps into meme culture, but also due to its focus on utility and infrastructure. Built on a Layer-2 Ethereum-compatible blockchain, it enables decentralized applications (dApps), liquidity pools, and other features that help establish a healthy ecosystem where both users and developers can participate. Additionally, with anti-sniper bot protection, LILPEPE aims to create a fair trading environment by preventing automated bots from manipulating token issuances and market activity. With the stage 10 presale of LILPEPE nearing completion and more than 11.59 billion tokens already sold, the demand for LILPEPE is undeniable. Currently priced at $0.0019, the token price is set to increase to $0.0020 in the next stage, offering an incentive for early investors to buy now.\nCertiK Audit: Proven Security for Investors\nBesides innovative blockchain features, Little Pepe has also been through a CertiK audit, which is one of the most well-regarded security-side verifications in the crypto world. LILPEPE is demonstrating its intentions concerning security and transparency with its strong audit score of 95.49%. The audit includes the functionality of smart contracts, the known vulnerabilities, and the compliance to the ERC-20 standard, so that investors are confident that they can deal with the Little Pepe ecosystem.\nWhy Little Pepe Might Be Superior to SHIB as a Purchase\nThe advantage of the market demand, a successful presale, and a safe, scalable, layer-2 infrastructure put Little Pepe ahead of the pack of meme coins. Although the recent bull run of Shiba Inu might mean that it is experiencing a short-term recovery, it is a risky decision because of the chances that a pullback might happen. Alternatively, the true potential of Little Pepe, its innovative blockchain, and high-level security promote an attractive long-term prospect to consider among the representatives of the meme token world.\nDon’t Miss the Giveaway!\nThe project is also offering a limited-time giveaway opportunity for 10 lucky winners to each receive $77,000 worth of $LILPEPE tokens, totaling $777,000 in prizes. To participate, simply contribute a minimum of $100 to the presale, complete giveaway tasks, and earn bonus entries to increase your chances of winning. As its community grows, it receives investor support and has a focus on the actual utility in the meme coin market; Little Pepe might become the next big thing to break through Shiba Inu.\nFor More Details About Little PEPE, Visit The Below Link:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Best Crypto to Invest In: Cold Wallet, Dogecoin, Pepe, and Shiba Inu Power Ahead", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/best-crypto-to-invest-in-cold-wallet-dogecoin-pepe-and-shiba-inu-power-ahead", "text": "Finding the best crypto to invest in right now means looking at more than just hype. You need networks that have a clear purpose, strong community backing, and momentum in both adoption and market activity. This list covers four options making noise for the right reasons, each with unique angles that could drive growth in 2025.\nCold Wallet is flipping the traditional wallet model by rewarding users for every on-chain move, while Dogecoin, Pepe, and Shiba Inu continue to dominate the meme coin conversation with strong price action and whale activity. The market is shifting fast, and these picks show a mix of utility, cultural influence, and growing traction. Here’s why they’re worth watching before the next surge hits.\n1. Cold Wallet Turns Usage into Rewards\nCold Wallet isn’t here to be a storage app, it’s built to reward every action you take on-chain. Instead of paying fees and moving on, you get CWT cashback for gas, swaps, and on/off-ramps. The rewards scale with how much CWT you hold, with Diamond tier users getting up to 100% of their gas back. This is a wallet that puts value back in your pocket every time you use it, turning everyday crypto activity into an income loop.\nThe Cold Wallet presale is live in its 17th stage with prices at $0.00998 and has raised more than $5.9 million in record time. Each presale stage sees a price increase. That means the earlier you join, the more you get for the same spend. With 40% of supply allocated to the presale, plus extra bonuses for referrals, the structure is built to reward quick movers. Combine that with its no-staking tier system, and you have a setup where rewards scale naturally as you hold more CWT.\nFor anyone scanning the market for the best crypto to invest in, Cold Wallet checks every box: genuine utility, a product users will return to daily, and incentives designed to keep the token in demand. The cashback model is straightforward but powerful, and the team’s push towards Layer 2 solutions could make rewards instant and free to claim. Waiting too long could mean buying in at much higher prices\n2. Dogecoin Maintains Whale Interest\nDogecoin (DOGE) has seen renewed movement this week, trading around $0.2257 with 24-hour highs near $0.2258 and lows of $0.2057. Its market cap sits above $33 billion, placing it firmly in the top 10. Whale accumulation has been a big driver lately, with over 1 billion DOGE purchased in just 24 hours, sending trading volume past the $1 billion mark.\nThis kind of whale activity often sets the tone for broader market sentiment. DOGE is now testing resistance around $0.225, and breaking that could push it towards $0.232. While short-term pullbacks are possible, the combination of high liquidity and its strong retail following keeps it relevant for anyone considering the best crypto to invest in. For traders, DOGE remains one of the most recognizable and liquid meme coins, giving it staying power in volatile markets.\n3. Pepe Gains on Bullish Signals\nPepe (PEPE) is showing signs of upward momentum, currently trading around $0.000011 with daily gains between 5% and 7%. Trading volume has stayed strong at over $700 million, with a market cap hovering near $4.6–$4.8 billion. A TD Sequential “buy” signal has fueled speculation of more upside, while macro factors like expected U.S. rate cuts have added to the risk-on sentiment.\nPEPE has already proven it can deliver major spikes when volume surges, and high liquidity makes it appealing for active traders. While ambitious targets like $1 are unrealistic, technical setups still suggest room for growth in the short term. For those building a list of the best crypto to invest in, PEPE offers the mix of volatility and community enthusiasm that can drive big moves when market sentiment turns bullish.\n4. Shiba Inu Shows Signs of Recovery\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is trading near $0.00001296 with a market cap of about $7.6 billion, ranking #22. Over the last seven days, it’s up around 12%, backed by ecosystem activity through Shibarium, ShibaSwap, and token burns. Whale accumulation has been reported alongside a 12,887% spike in large-holder outflows, a stat that stands out even if the base number was small.\nSHIB has clear cultural weight in the meme coin sector and continues to build DeFi infrastructure that could help sustain relevance. Key resistance sits near $0.00001599, and holding above current support could open the door for a push higher. For those considering the best crypto to invest in, SHIB offers both speculative upside and an active developer base working on real-world use cases. That combination keeps it in the conversation even as newer meme coins fight for attention.\nSumming Up\nThe best crypto to invest in today depends on your mix of goals, whether you want utility-driven growth or meme coin volatility. Cold Wallet brings a unique angle by rewarding usage, with a presale model that directly benefits early participants. Dogecoin shows continued whale interest and high liquidity, making it a stable meme coin option.\nPepe offers aggressive upside potential tied to technical signals and community hype, while Shiba Inu blends cultural relevance with infrastructure building. Each has distinct strengths, but timing is key, prices and momentum can change quickly. Acting before the next major move could make the difference between catching the run early or buying after the market has already shifted.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

From record-breaking ETF demand to corporate treasury accumulation, capital from professional investors is transforming Bitcoin’s market structure. But while the buying pressure has been substantial, recent price action shows that even in a bullish macro trend, short-term corrections remain part of the game.\nBTC Institutional Inflows Surge in 2025\nThe scale of institutional participation this year is remarkable:\n-\n$50 Billion in 2025 Alone – A Deutsche Bank report estimates that institutional investment inflows into Bitcoin have already topped $50 billion this year.\n-\nETF Powerhouses – BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now holds more than $80 billion in assets, surpassing the growth trajectory of gold ETFs at the same stage.\nSource: blackrock.com\n-\nRecord-Breaking ETF Flows – Spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted $14.8 billion in inflows as of late July, driven by both retail and institutional buyers.\n-\nLong-Term Projections – Strategic studies forecast inflows reaching $120 billion by 2025 and up to $300 billion by 2026, potentially accelerating Bitcoin’s path toward broader adoption.\nThese figures highlight a structural shift — Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative retail asset but an increasingly embedded component of institutional portfolios.\nSmart PR in Bull Markets: Outset PR’s Role\nIn conditions like these — where institutional capital is flowing and market sentiment is strong — smart PR becomes an indispensable growth multiplier. Whether markets are surging or consolidating, strategic communications can determine whether a brand rides the trend or gets lost in the noise.\nIf PR has ever felt like navigating a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data. Its strategies combine retrospective and real-time metrics to deliver results with lasting impact. Rather than relying on vague promises, Outset PR delivers concrete plans tied to perfect publication timing, product–market fit-driven narratives, and performance-based media selection.\nWhile many crypto PR agencies rely on standardized packages and mass outreach, Outset PR builds tailored campaigns calibrated to each client’s goals, budget, and growth stage. Its proprietary traffic acquisition technology blends organic editorial placements with SEO and lead generation, allowing clients to dominate high-discovery surfaces.\nThe firm’s internal media analytics desk tracks outlet performance by domain activity, month-on-month visibility shifts, audience geography, and traffic sources — enabling data-driven media targeting.\nIn a market upswing, such as Bitcoin’s current momentum phase, the opportunity window for visibility is wide open — but only for brands that know how to time and place their stories. Outset PR ensures clients are positioned where the market’s attention is highest.\n👉 Reach Out to Outset PR to Boost Your Brand Visibility\nBTC Price Reaction: Rally Meets Pullback\nDespite these inflows, Bitcoin’s price has seen notable short-term volatility:\n-\nCurrent Price – As of now, BTC is trading near $118,458, down 1.6% from its previous close.\n-\nIntraday Range – The day’s high reached $120,726, with a low of $118,249, reflecting a pullback from the recent all-time high of around $123K.\n-\nETF Outflows Amid Inflows – While total inflows remain strong, short bursts of outflows — like BlackRock’s IBIT recent $292 million withdrawal — can trigger quick retracements.\nThis suggests that while the long-term institutional trend is supportive, short-term price action can still be heavily influenced by liquidity shifts and profit-taking.\nConclusion\nInstitutional inflows into Bitcoin show no sign of slowing, with billions in capital reshaping market dynamics in 2025. While short-term dips below $120K are natural, the structural demand from ETFs, corporate treasuries, and sovereign funds creates a solid foundation for long-term growth.\nFor crypto brands, moments like this are a rare alignment of market and narrative opportunity.

{"title": "Will Ozak AI Break $1 Before Ethereum Hits $5,000?", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/will-ozak-ai-break-1-before-ethereum-hits-5000", "text": "As the cryptocurrency market continues to grow, innovative projects like Ozak AI are emerging with the potential to make waves in the DeFi market. As Ozak AI is moved into Phase 4 of its presale and the $OZ token, investors will keep an eye out as these AI-powered blockchain protocols fight to reach their lofty goal of $1 per token by 2026 amid signs of Ethereum (ETH) finding some sort of bullish momentum this week as it has continued to inch closer to the $4,400 mark.\nBeing sold at an immensely low price of $0.005 per token early in Phase 4 of its presale, the $OZ token has already attracted the interests of traders and investors, with analysts estimating that the token is capable of a 200x increase in terms of price by the end of Phase 4 of the presale, when it will reach the price point of $1.00. There is also something to look forward to, as early-stage investors emerged with a better deal when the price was raised to $0.01 in the next stage.\nWhat Is Making Ozak AI Popular?\nOzak AI, unlike many other speculative tokens, has a real-world use case in the form of predictive analytics via the use of artificial intelligence working in tandem with blockchain technology to be able to offer real-time predictive analytics.\n$OZ allows investors to make quicker and better decisions since it can give them timely market intelligence regarding cryptocurrency, equity, and forex markets through superior AI-driven models. Such utility puts Ozak AI ahead of the pack and has caused a lot of hype about its future potential.\nAs the $OZ token presale progresses, the project has already raised over $1.80 million, with more than 121 million tokens sold. The platform's increasing adoption and the token's expected price increase signal strong market interest. If the momentum continues, Ozak AI is well-positioned to reach the projected $1 price target by the end of 2025, or even earlier.\nCommunity Engagement Drives Investor Confidence\nOzak AI is more than merely technology, it is community building. The project is also engaged in engaging leads into the crypto community, especially in live events involving the GM Vietnam event. These appearances have been used as a launching pad in the establishment of partnerships with the key players in the crypto world, further cementing the credibility of the project and gaining more investors.\nOzak AI is establishing trust and an online fan following through practical experience and the transparency of technical details.\nStrong Tokenomics Support Long-Term Growth\nOzak AI tokens have a tokenomic that drives stability and growth over the long term. During the Token Generation Event (TGE), 10% of the total amount of tokens will become unlocked, and the rest of them will be released linearly over a half-year term.\nThis mechanism prevents large-scale sell-offs that could disrupt the market and ensures steady price appreciation as demand for the $OZ token increases.\nA Strong Foundation for Growth\nThe Ozak AI system comprises AI-powered intelligence as well as cross-chain capability and community governance to offer the required adaptability and scalability of the system. The upside of it is that it utilizes machine learning and predictive analytics to identify arbitrage opportunities in numerous blockchain networks, which cannot be found anywhere.\nMoreover, the decentralized systematic approach and adherence to open-source governance enable the token holders to comment on the decisions of the company, such as protocol changes and the fee systems. This will establish a community-led type of growth, which will harmonize the interests of the investors, development partners, and users.\nWill Can Ozak AI Hit $1 Before Ethereum Hits 5,000?\nFollowing the recent bullish performance of Ethereum (ETH) and its proximity to the $4,400 mark, everyone is looking at the promising projects in the realm of crypto, such as Ozak AI with its advanced technological solutions and real application. The good tokenomics, its active community, and the variety of strategies in AI-driven market analytics make Ozak AI a clear favorite to reach its target price of $1 by the end of 2025, with a possibility of doing it earlier.\nTo those investors who would like to jump over the barriers and have some share of the early stages of the project, Ozak AI is likely to be a rewarding project, as the existing presale price of $0.005 serves as an exceptional chance to reap high profits. In the early stages of the project, price raising may bring tremendous payoffs to the early adopters, as Ozak AI breaches the price thresholds on its way to $1 and beyond.\nFor more information about Ozak AI, visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Top of the chart is Ozak AI, which has a price of 0.005 $OZ in phase four and a commitment price of $1. The AI-enhanced blockchain governance and predictive analytics systems of the project make it a competent candidate to outgrow Solana in its early development rate.\nPredictive Blockchain Governance offered by Ozak AI\nOzak AI combines the organizational structure of decentralized autonomous organizations and artificial intelligence to reinvent governance, efficiencies, and automation in a blockchain ecosystem. It employs predictive analytics to sweep through market facts, identify them, and prepare actionable forecasts to inform more improved community decisions. The intention of this approach is to advance the rate of participation and avoid manipulation of governance.\nOzak AI is now in Presale Phase 4, priced at $0.005 per $OZ token with an impressive 121,052,065.346 $OZ tokens sold so far, raising a total of $1,805,260.236. With marking a 400% jump from its initial $0.001 launch price. With a projected listing at $0.05 and a target of $1, early investors could enjoy substantial returns up to 200x. Already listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, the project features exciting giveaways.\nThis Ozak AI platform promotes automation during the analysis of proposals, delegation of votes, and audit of smart contracts. Using AI-driven systems, governance proposals are categorized according to their susceptibility to a potential impact, and weaknesses are identified prior to implementation. This guarantees smooth operation of DAO routine activities without necessarily depending on human interaction.\nOzak AI ensures high security levels through recognizing and preventing fraudulent accounts and suspicious money transmission behavior in real-time. Its fraud models prevent the abuse of the attempts, like Sybil attacks, by detecting the abnormal activity within the blockchain records. This reinforces governance, and it is transparent.\nThe ecosystem integrates Arbitrum Orbit for Layer-2 scalability, enabling faster smart contract execution and lower gas costs. In addition, it uses EigenLayer AVS to secure transaction validation, ensuring tamper-proof governance processes. These integrations improve both performance and trust in the system.\nOzak AI also utilizes AI in decentralized finance to streamline treasury management, automate dispute resolution, and provide personalized governance advice. These characteristics make it a complete governance and analysis scheme of rising DeFi and crypto AI industries.\nNexChain’s High-Speed AI Blockchain Integration\nNexChain provides a Layer 1 blockchain capable of delivering AI-enhanced interoperability and scalability to real-time applications. Its maximum transaction capacity is around 400,000 transactions each and every second at an insignificant price of 0.001 dollars. It adds protection when using hybrid PoS consensus with dual-level security and adds the ability to audit and execute smart contracts quickly.\nWeb3 Gaming Of Skill-Based Gaming Tapzi\nTapzi is an anti-cheat, instant-rewarding, decentralized Web3 gaming hub on the BNB Smart Chain. Tapzi tokens are staked by players in competitive mods such as chess and checkers. The platform also offers SDKs for third-party game developers to integrate staking and reward platforms.\nMeme-DeFi Hybrid of Pepe Dollar\nPepe Dollar is a meme-edged DeFi entertaining and utility application to Ethereum Layer 2. It is limited in supply, has an in-built burn mechanism, and includes DeFi utilities. Its scarcity model and extra on-chain functionality have increased demand.\nThe Ethereum Bull Market Meme Token of ETH Bull\nETH Bull promotes itself as the next bull coin in the form of a meme coin in Ethereum, with staking rewards, ETH airdrops, and a burn. The community-based tokenomics are focused on maximizing growth in Ethereum rallies. Nevertheless, its audit report is not final, which leaves doubts regarding its contract security.\nNeo Pepe, Community-Governed Meme Ecosystem\nNeo Pepe combines DeFi governance with the meme culture and provides a community-driven ecosystem. It will compensate for the commitments of long-term engagements with governance and incentive rights. It will rely on the active community to perpetuate the momentum after the elimination of staking rewards.\nFor more information about Ozak AI, visit the links below.\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

This system enforces data quality and coordinates participation through four integrated mechanisms: staking, validation, reputation, and incentives.\nRowan Stone, CEO of Sapien, says, “Sapien exists to help AI teams answer two questions that matter for every decision their models make: where did this data come from, and can it be trusted? Onchain systems have proven that incentives can organize capital at scale. We’re applying the same principles to knowledge through our Proof of Quality protocol, aligning incentives to verify provenance and scale high-value data. The aim is simple: make human data traceable, trustworthy, and scalable so the AI built on it can actually improve lives.”\nSapien is already trusted by leading organizations, including Midjourney, Workday, Alibaba, GAC, Lenovo, Transsion, CarVertical, and the United Nations.\nThe upcoming TGE introduces a fair launch model that balances early utility, contributor rewards, investor alignment, and long-term community governance. At launch, 25% of the total token supply will be unlocked, with the remaining 75% released through transparent vesting schedules. The total token supply is capped at 1,000,000,000 $SAPIEN.\nToken Distribution Overview\n- Ticker: SAPIEN\n- Total Supply: 1,000,000,000\n- Network: Base (ERC-20)\n- TGE Date: Aug. 20, 2025\nEligible contributors will be able to claim a portion of their airdrop immediately following the TGE. This marks the first season of the Sapien Airdrop, an ongoing campaign designed to retroactively reward high-quality contributions.\nTo prepare for the drop, point accumulation for task-based work has been paused. A final leaderboard will be published ahead of the August 20th event. After the TGE, contributors will begin earning $USDC and $SAPIEN directly through the platform.\nCookie and Kaito campaigns will continue awarding points for eligible social content.

The collaboration integrates LunarCrush’s 24/7 tracking of 30–50 million social media posts per hour, along with live market data, directly into OpenServ’s generative UI platform for Telegram mini apps and agent workflows. Two products are live today: DeFi News aApp on Telegram and Dash.fun (open beta).\nDeFi News aApp creates short AI video briefings using LunarCrush insights—right inside Telegram—where anyone can try it at t.me/definews_aapp_bot. Users pick a topic, set a timeframe and data source, then receive a one- to three-minute video with animated overlays and on-screen stats. Templates include Bitcoin Daily Brief, Ethereum Weekly, Solana Ecosystem, and Hidden Altcoin Gems. Users can also run a custom analysis, choose an AI presenter, and schedule daily delivery. The app reads LunarCrush metrics such as social dominance, Galaxy Score, trending assets, and top influencers, then assembles a concise script and renders a finished video in‑chat for easy sharing.\nDash.fun launched in open beta on Thursday, August 7, 2025. It surfaces up‑to‑the‑minute information on any cryptocurrency based on social sentiment, recent highlights, company updates, price action, and more—without manual updates. Visit dash.fun to explore live dashboards powered by LunarCrush data.\n“The fastest way to make data useful is to put it where people already work,” said Tim Hafner, CEO and co‑founder of OpenServ. “Telegram is the home base for crypto communities. Together, LunarCrush and OpenServ give users a live social signal and a way to publish that insight as video in seconds. This is just the first of many agentic use cases on Telegram.”\n“Builders want context they can act on,” said Joe Vezzani, chief executive of LunarCrush. “In a world where large language models are trained, released, and end their intelligence at a point in time, LunarCrush fills the gap to allow real-time social context to anyone building LLMs and agents.”\nThe collaboration began after an early‑July discussion between Hafner and Vezzani about opening social data to AI agents and everyday users in chat. The partnership pairs LunarCrush analytics with OpenServ’s aApp Factory, Dash.fun dashboards, and agent tooling for Telegram. OpenServ agents use the same LunarCrush API that powers Dash.fun, shortening setup and improving reliability for teams that want to add social metrics to their own agents, tiles, and dashboards.\nTo help builders, OpenServ is publishing resources so teams can add LunarCrush data to custom workflows: a starter template for Telegram mini apps, an agent guide, and a Dash.fun example that maps social dominance to charts and triggers. A joint livestream will walk through the integration, show how the DeFi News aApp works, and answer questions from developers and community managers. Details will be posted on OpenServ’s Telegram Announcements channel and X account.\nAbout OpenServ\nOpenServ is the leading platform for building AI apps and products. Developers worldwide use OpenServ's generative UI to build and employ AI agents that interact with APIs, automate workflows, and operate across any framework. With native support for Telegram and a modular SDK, OpenServ moves agents from passive interfaces to active participants in decentralized ecosystems. From finance and governance to messaging and research, agents on OpenServ are designed to act, earn, and evolve for your business.

With a fairer economy, fresh game modes, and over 800 new player cards, now’s the time to unleash your inner coach, assemble a killer team, and chase gridiron glory.\nA Brand-New Playbook\nOfficially licensed by the National Football League, NFL Rivals has over six million downloads since launching two years ago. Not content with these accomplishments, its creator, Mythical Games, is introducing multiple bold changes from August 27, having acknowledged that the game “hit a wall in Year 2.”\nAn arcade-style strategy game, NFL Rivals compels players to assemble a squad from collectible player cards, ranging from Common to Elite, and test their strategy in fast-paced, high-energy games. Among other notable changes, Season 3 will tackle a key issue from last year: namely, the inability of new players to compete with veterans managing overpowered teams. Consequently, base cards have been replaced by Training Points, which help you upgrade your roster’s performance.\nBy ensuring new players aren’t outmatched by pros with significant power advantages, Mythical Games is targeting further growth rather than seeking to appease existing players. Cards from in-game packs now start locked, encouraging their use in gameplay rather than instant trading, with cheaper pack prices sweetening the deal.\nFor those still keen to trade peer-to-peer, Mint Tokens unlock cards for the open market, keeping the game’s economy vibrant.\nShowdown at the Stadium\nOne of the biggest changes to be made ahead of season 3 is the introduction of Stadiums Mode, wherein real-time PvP matches are set based on skill level and the winner unlocks up to ten stadiums of varying difficulty. Stadium Mode is activated via in-game coins, and rewards depend on wins, league standings, and stadium progress. Interestingly, matches in Stadiums Mode aren’t timed but rather based on total-plays-per-game.\nAs for leagues, they will now run from Monday to Monday, with rankings tied to coins earned in Stadiums and Events. It’s a competitive overhaul designed to reward strategy, skill and endeavor, whether you’re a rookie or a seasoned tactician.\nAlso sure to be popular with new players are the edits made to the upgrade system. Gone are the days of endless grinding for high-tier cards; now the focus is on fun, with Training Points and Rank Up Tokens – earned by burning cards – letting you boost star players without needing a massive budget. Or to put it another way, to upgrade a player’s tier, you must feed them other cards. Naturally, Season 3 minted cards have a special significance: they get an extra rank, an extra special star, and five bonus levels..\nWith over 800 new cards across all 32 teams – including one Legendary player per team boasting 145–150 power (PWR) – NFL Rivals will benefit from the added firepower. And with squad-building easier than ever, newcomers won’t feel like they’re outgunned from the get-go.\nEasy to Start, Hard to Master\nNFL Rivals isn’t just about building a roster — it’s about outsmarting opponents through smart squad-building and clever plays. Whether you’re a casual fan or a playbook nerd, the game’s arcade vibe and strategic depth deliver.\nBy lowering pack prices, improving card quality, and reducing the gap between new and veteran players, Mythical Games hopes to entice new blood while keeping veterans on-side. Or in their own words, hitting “the sweet spot: easy to start, hard to master.”\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In the world of meme coins, few projects balance humor and technical depth this effectively.\nPEPD Presale Snapshot\nThe Top Crypto ICO for Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is in Stage 1, nearly complete:\n-\nPrice: $0.004688\n-\nLaunch Price: $0.03695\n-\nProgress: 97% sold\n-\nUSD Raised: $1,280,167 of $1,317,138\n-\nTokens Sold: 273,073,174 of 280,959,484\nInvestors using the promotional bonus code get a larger token allocation, making this entry point even more compelling.\nJoin Pepe Dollar Presale:\nPepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/\nPepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity\nPEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar\nPENGU’s Market Strength\nTrading at around $0.035, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has carved out a unique lane as one of three microcap meme coins identified for potential 100x gains in the next bull market. Its combination of NFT credibility, Solana-based token utility, and global retail presence gives it an edge over pure-play meme tokens.\nWhy Analysts Group Them Together\nThe logic is simple: PENGU offers cultural staying power through brand expansion, while Pepe Dollar (PEPD) delivers speculative firepower via the Top Crypto ICO model. Together, they provide investors with a balanced meme portfolio — one for the long game, and one for the high-velocity sprint.\nConclusion\nPudgy Penguins (PENGU) may win hearts, but Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is out to win wallets. With the Top Crypto ICO nearly sold out and a promotional bonus code in circulation, early entrants have a chance to secure a stake in one of the most buzzed-about launches of 2025 before it leaves the presale stage.\nJoin Pepe Dollar Presale:\nPepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/\nPepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity\nPEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, the flagship cryptocurrency is only marginally up, as altcoins led the market recovery. BTC dropped to an intraday low of $118,305 on Tuesday before rebounding to cross the $120,000 mark. However, it lost momentum and fell to its current levels. BTC is marginally up over the past 24 hours, trading around $119,415.\nMeanwhile, altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are leading the market recovery. ETH has raced past $4,500 and is trading above $4,600, up over 7% in the past 24 hours. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency could surge to a new all-time high if buyers maintain momentum. On the other hand, SOL is up nearly 12% and is on the brink of reclaiming $200. Ripple (XRP) has also regained momentum, up 2.25%. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up over 6%, while Cardano (ADA) is up nearly 9%, trading around $0.857. Chainlink (LINK) is up almost 10%, while Stellar (XLM) is up 1.70%, trading around $0.444. Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial increases.\nDo Kwon Pleads Guilty To Fraud Charges\nTerraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon has pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud. According to reports, Kwon waived his right to go to trial on two of the nine charges brought against him by the US government. The plea agreement with prosecutors also imposes $19 million in financial penalties. The charges against Kwon could carry a prison sentence of up to 25 years if served consecutively. However, the agreement could see prosecutors recommend not more than 12 years.\nDo Kwon was indicted in March 2023, with charges including securities fraud, market manipulation, money laundering, and wire fraud. Do Kwon initially pleaded not guilty to all charges after appearing in court following his extradition from Montenegro.\nSEC To Focus On Crypto Regulatory Framework Following Ripple Case Dismissal\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to focus on developing clear crypto regulations after dropping its case against Ripple. According to SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce, the SEC’s decision to dismiss legal action against Ripple is a \"welcome development.”\n“Last week, the SEC’s case against Ripple was finally laid to rest,” Peirce wrote. “A welcome development for many reasons, including that minds once occupied with litigation now can concentrate on creating a clear regulatory framework for crypto.”\nSEC Chair Paul Atkins supported Pierce, advocating for the creation of crypto-specific policies. Atkins stated in a post on X,\n“Commissioner Peirce is right. With this chapter closed, we now have an opportunity to shift our energy from the courtroom to the policy drafting table. Our focus should be on building a clear regulatory framework that fosters innovation while protecting investors.”\nThe SEC dropped its case against Ripple on August 7. The market regulator had alleged that Ripple violated several federal securities laws.\nUS Bank Group Urges Congress To Close Genius Act Yield Loophole\nSeveral US banking groups led by the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) urged Congress to close a loophole in the GENIUS Act. The banking groups claim the loophole allows stablecoin issuers to pay yield on stablecoins through affiliates. Stablecoin laws under the GENIUS Act prohibit stablecoin issuers from offering yields. However, they do not ban cryptocurrency exchanges or affiliated businesses. This allows issuers to potentially sidestep the law by offering yield through their partners. According to the BPI, failure to close the loophole could disrupt the flow of credit to US businesses, and potentially trigger over $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows from the traditional banking system.\nBanking groups are concerned that yield-bearing stablecoins could undermine the ability of banks to attract deposits with high-interest savings products. BPI stated in the signed letter to Congress,\n“These distinctions are why payment stablecoins should not pay interest the way highly regulated and supervised banks do on deposits or offer yield as money market funds do.”\nBPI added that such a shift in the financial system could pose a risk to the country’s credit system.\n“The result will be greater deposit flight risk, especially in times of stress, which will undermine credit creation throughout the economy. The corresponding reduction in credit supply means higher interest rates, fewer loans, and increased costs for Main Street businesses and households.”\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\nBitcoin (BTC)’s rally stalled after crossing the $120,000 mark on Tuesday. The flagship cryptocurrency raced to an intraday high of $122,319 on Monday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level, slipping below $120,000 to settle at $118,701. It recovered on Tuesday, rising over 1% to reclaim $120,000 and settle at $120,113. However, BTC is back in bearish territory during the ongoing session, with the price marginally down at $119,980.\nDespite downward pressure, BTC held the $118,000 level. However, it still faces strong selling pressure above $120,000. The flagship cryptocurrency’s failure to hit a new all-time high led to a sharp pullback across the market. However, while BTC made a marginal recovery, altcoins led the recovery, rebounding and crossing key resistance levels. Some analysts have struck a cautious tone after Monday’s drop from $122,000, with ZAYK Charts stating that the Wyckoff method indicates BTC may have entered a distribution phase. A confirmation of the distribution phase could drag BTC to $100,000 or lower.\n“After a strong Accumulation Phase in March, April confirmed by bullish RSI divergence, BTC entered a powerful Mark-Up phase, reaching new highs. Currently, price action is showing signs of a Distribution Phase — sideways movement with weakening momentum, supported by bearish RSI divergence. If distribution confirms, the next phase could be a markdown, with a potential drop toward the 95K zone.”\nHowever, others believe BTC could continue its rally after the release of the July US Consumer Price Index (CPI), which showed inflation was unchanged at 2.7%, and below the 2.8% forecast. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 3.1% annually, in line with expectations. Overall CPI increased 0.2%, down from 0.3% in June, while core CPI rose 0.3%, compared to June’s 0.2% increase.\nCPI data reinforces a bullish backdrop for BTC as inflation cools, strengthening the case for monetary easing.\nBTC registered a sharp decline on Friday (August 1), dropping over 2% and settling at $113,365. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 0.67% and settled at $112,601. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Sunday, rising 1.52% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,215. The price continued pushing higher on Monday, registering a 0.69% increase and settling at $115,051. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $112,707 on Tuesday as selling pressure returned. It rebounded from this level to reclaim $114,000 and settled at $114,051, ultimately dropping 0.83%. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.80% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,028.\nSource: TradingView\nBullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $117,000 and settle at $117,515. Despite the positive sentiment, the price was back in the red on Friday, falling nearly 1% to $116,683. BTC registered a marginal decline on Saturday but recovered on Sunday, rising 2.42% to reclaim $119,000 and settle at $119,309. The price surged to an intraday high of $122,319 on Monday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $118,701, ultimately dropping 0.51%. Buyers returned to the market on Tuesday as BTC recovered, rising 1.19% to reclaim $120,000 and settle at $120,113. The current session sees the price marginally down, trading around $120,059.\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\nEthereum’s (ETH) rally has resumed after Monday’s wobble, as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency raced past $4,600. ETH registered a marginal drop on Monday as buyers failed to cross $4,400. However, bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rallied, rising almost 9% to cross $4,500 and settle at $4,590. The current session sees ETH up over 2%, trading above $4,700.\nAnalysts believe ETH could continue rising, potentially reaching a new all-time high if buyers maintain momentum. One trader predicted it could cross $8,000 if BTC hits $150,000.\n“In major bull runs, ETH typically hits 30-35% of Bitcoin's [market cap].”\nThe analyst predicted that if BTC crosses $150,000, a 25% increase from current levels, ETH could reach $8,656. Several analysts and crypto firms expect BTC to reach $150,000 by the end of the year. Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, and Unchained market research director Joe Barnett have predicted a move to $150,000 for BTC. Regarding ETH, analysts believe it could reach a new all-time high, driven by surging institutional and ETF demand.\nETH started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 6% and settling at $3,488. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 3%, slipping below $3,400 to $3,393. ETH recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to reclaim $3,500.

ETH rallied on Tuesday, surging nearly 8% to cross $4,500 and settle at $4,590. The current session sees the price up over 2%, trading around $4,700. Analysts believe ETH could surge to a new all-time high and potentially test the $5,000 level.\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\nSolana (SOL) has crossed the $200 mark for the first time in almost a month, as bullish sentiment intensifies. SOL started the week with a sharp drop, falling over 4% to $174. However, it made a strong recovery on Tuesday, surging nearly 10% to cross $190 and settle at $191. SOL has crossed $200 during the ongoing session, up almost 5%.\nSOL’s rally can be attributed to several bullish developments over the past week. Public companies have upped their SOL purchases to access the blockchain’s staking rewards.

Built as a meme coin with a serious twist, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) blends cultural satire with Layer-2 scaling and deflationary tokenomics, creating a dual appeal for both speculative and utility-driven investors. Early backers are targeting triple-digit percentage gains by exchange listing, with whale wallets already deploying significant capital. Among those joining in is a prominent Litecoin (LTC) whale, whose $50,000 strategy has sparked debate about whether blending a legacy altcoin with a high-growth presale could produce millionaire-level returns.\nInside the Whale’s $50,000 Diversification Play\nThe whale’s approach is calculated: split the $50,000 evenly, placing $25,000 into Litecoin (LTC) for stability and $25,000 into Pepe Dollar (PEPD) for asymmetric upside. The idea is to ride Litecoin (LTC)’s anticipated rally to $170 while leveraging Pepe Dollar (PEPD)’s explosive presale growth. The combination targets a portfolio blend where one asset provides long-term resilience, and the other delivers aggressive short-term appreciation. This is a risk-managed method that still allows participation in the Best Crypto Presale buzz of 2025.\nLitecoin (LTC) Breaks Technical Barriers\nLitecoin (LTC) recently broke above an ascending channel pattern, a move often seen as the start of an accelerated uptrend. With prices above $133 and Open Interest hitting a record $1.27 billion, bullish momentum is hard to ignore. The hashrate’s steady climb adds further confidence, enhancing network security. Analysts suggest a rally toward $170 could play out, offering a solid return for those positioning early.\nWhy Pepe Dollar (PEPD) Holds the X-FactorWhile Litecoin (LTC) offers a proven network and stability, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) offers scarcity-driven hype and early-stage growth potential. Token burn mechanics, community-led marketing, and Layer-2 gaming integrations are expected to push trading volume aggressively post-launch. This is why whales are calling it the Best Crypto Presale to combine with blue-chip altcoin holdings.\nMarket Sentiment and Whale InfluenceWhale wallets have historically been market movers, and seeing one allocated into both Litecoin (LTC) and Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is a strong sentiment signal. It’s also a reminder that major profits often come from diversified strategies rather than single-token bets. As liquidity flows into the PEPD presale and Litecoin (LTC) maintains upward pressure, this dual-position play could outperform the broader market.\nConclusion\nThe $50,000 split between Litecoin (LTC) and Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is a textbook example of balancing security with speculative upside. If Litecoin (LTC) reaches $170 and Pepe Dollar (PEPD) delivers the explosive gains many expect from the Best Crypto Presale of 2025, this whale’s strategy could indeed mint new millionaires.\nJoin Pepe Dollar Presale:\nPepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/\nPepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity\nPEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

However, the spotlight is shifting as a new DeFi coin rises, stealing attention from Ripple.\nWith its innovative AI features, Unilabs has gained fast traction. It has raised over $12.7 million and sold 1.8 billion coins, positioning itself as a major player in the DeFi market. In the meantime, the Ripple price still trades around $3.\nBinance Coin (BNB) Price Faces Selling Pressure\nAccording to CoinMarketCap data, the Binance Coin price is consolidating around the $800 mark after facing selling pressure at $822. The pullback comes amid a whale purchase.\nPer reports, BNC bought 200,000 BNB for $160 million and plans to keep buying until it hits $1.25 billion worth of the DeFi coin. BNC is the daughter firm of CEA Industries and is now the largest public holder of BNB.\nThis massive whale accumulation and corporate institution interest positively drive the Binance Coin price. MANDO CT predicts that the price of Binance Coin can surge to $1,000. According to them, the DeFi coin is “moving beautifully” and could rise to the given target soon.\nIn an earlier post, Ali Martinez noted that the Binance Coin price is currently mirroring Bitcoin’s price structure, suggesting it could be in the early stages of a major bull rally. According to him, if this pattern continues to play out, the DeFi crypto price could surge toward the $1,200 mark, reinforcing bullish sentiment around the Binance Coin price in the coming months.\nRipple (XRP) Predicted To Touch $3.60\nThe Ripple price is about to test the $3.10 support after days of failing to cross the resistance around the $3.30 region. Data from CoinMarketCap indicates that the Ripple price has been trading between $3.10 and $3.40 since August 7.\nIf bulls cannot defend the lower support, the Ripple price might drop below the $3.00 mark. Meanwhile, Ali Martinez says the Ripple price has a major resistance at $3.27. He observed that a breakout would cause a new bullish momentum, which could see the Ripple price reach $3.60 in the near future.\nIn another tweet, The Cryptomist expressed strong optimism, saying the Ripple price is unlikely to drop below $2 again. She told her followers to see any dip as a buying opportunity.\nThe Cryptomist added that her target for the Ripple price this bull market is around $8. Given the end of the Ripple-SEC case, the XRP ETF could hit the market anytime from now. This launch would take the Ripple price to a new high by the end of this year.\nUnilabs (UNIL): The AI-Powered Portal to Intelligent Crypto Investing\nUnilabs (UNIL) is a blockchain-based investment platform that merges AI with high-yield crypto strategies to give retail investors the tools normally reserved for hedge funds. Operating in the AI-powered asset management sector, which is expected to grow at 24.5% CAGR to $17 billion by 2030, Unilabs is positioned to tap into one of the fastest-growing sectors in blockchain and fintech.\nWith over 153k subscribers, YouTube analyst Crypto Show praised Unilabs for bringing Wall Street-grade tools to everyday users. One is the Early Access Scoring System (EASS), which identifies and secures allocations in early-stage projects before they hit mainstream exchanges.\nThe platform’s four flagship funds, DeFi Yield Pools, Bitcoin Funds, AI Assets, and Tokenized Real-World Assets, allow users to diversify their holdings. Unlike MakerDAO’s single-focus model, Unilabs’ multi-fund approach blends stability with growth, offering both predictable yield and speculative upside.\nThe UNIL token fuels all operations, granting access to exclusive funds, distributing 30% of platform fees back to holders, etc. With the price at $0.0097 in Stage 6, its trajectory suggests a possible climb toward $0.60 if it captures even 0.5% of the projected DeFi market cap.\nFinal Thoughts on the Best Crypto To Buy\nThe Binance Coin price could rally to a new peak of $1,200 soon. Meanwhile, the rise of the new DeFi cryptocurrency, Unilabs, presents an exciting opportunity for investors. As Ripple is having a hard time sustaining itself, this DeFi project has a high growth potential that can make it a market leader.\nFind out more about the Unilabs (UNIL) Presale Today:\nWebsite: https://unilabs.finance/\nTelegram: https://t.me/unilabsofficial\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

One top crypto analyst now projects a $13 price target for 2026, fueled by institutional catalysts, network upgrades, and broader market momentum. But while ADA has a clear long-term trajectory, many investors are pairing their ADA holdings with early entries into Pepe Dollar (PEPD) — the Top Crypto ICO gaining whale-level attention.\nCardano’s Bullish Setup for the Next Cycle\nAfter a 6.3% weekly gain, Cardano (ADA) has climbed to third place in Grayscale’s performance rankings. The ongoing SEC review of the ADA ETF — with a 75% approval probability — is considered a major bullish driver. Approval could unlock a wave of institutional inflows, dramatically increasing ADA’s liquidity and trading volumes.\nThe launch of the Midnight protocol has further strengthened ADA’s position, bringing privacy-enhanced smart contract functionality that appeals to both developers and enterprise clients. Analysts believe these upgrades could be the catalyst for ADA to break its current $3.10 ATH and march toward double-digit prices in the coming cycle.\nJoin Pepe Dollar Presale:\nPepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/\nPepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity\nPEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar\nWhy ADA Investors Are Buying Into PEPD\nEven with ADA’s strong fundamentals, many of its long-term holders are hedging by entering early-stage, high-growth plays like Pepe Dollar (PEPD). This meme-driven yet utility-backed token is generating hype for its unique blend of cultural parody — mocking the U.S. Federal Reserve — and real Layer-2 blockchain capabilities.\nPEPD’s staking rewards, capped supply, and community-powered liquidity platform make it more than just another meme coin. For ADA investors, this represents a way to add explosive ROI potential to their otherwise steady ADA portfolio.\nPresale Timing and Strategic Accumulation\nPepe Dollar (PEPD)’s presale pricing tiers mean that the earliest buyers stand to make the highest percentage gains. ADA investors entering now can acquire tokens at a fraction of their expected listing price. With strong whale participation already confirmed, the presale is shaping up to be one of the most competitive of the year.\nMany Cardano (ADA) holders are funding their Pepe Dollar (PEPD) buys from staking rewards, avoiding the need to liquidate core ADA positions while still gaining exposure to a high-velocity asset.\nDual-Asset Strategy for the Bull Run\nThe combination of ADA and Pepe Dollar (PEPD) offers exposure to two complementary growth models. ADA’s path to $13 relies on macro adoption trends, regulatory green lights, and ecosystem expansion. PEPD, meanwhile, could deliver faster, more aggressive returns driven by social momentum and meme culture. Together, they form a balanced playbook for capitalizing on the next bull cycle.\nWhy $13 ADA and PEPD Could Define 2026 Portfolios\nIf ADA hits $13, it would mark one of the largest blue-chip gains in the cycle. For investors holding Pepe Dollar (PEPD) alongside, even a fraction of ADA’s market cap could translate into life-changing multiples. Analysts point out that these asymmetric bets often define bull market legends — those who not only held strong assets but also took calculated risks in the right presales.\nConclusion\nCardano’s climb toward $13 is backed by hard fundamentals, while Pepe Dollar (PEPD) offers the cultural and community power that can send a token parabolic.

The plea was entered before U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan on August 12.\nKwon, who was extradited from Montenegro earlier this year, admitted to charges of conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud. Under a plea agreement with the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s Office, prosecutors will not seek a sentence exceeding 12 years. Sentencing is scheduled for December 11.\nTerraUSD Collapse and Alleged Market Manipulation\nKwon co-created TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the U.S. dollar, alongside the Luna cryptocurrency. In May 2021, TerraUSD lost its peg, wiping out approximately $40 billion in market value.\nProsecutors allege that Kwon misled investors by claiming that the “Terra Protocol” algorithm would restore the stablecoin’s value. Instead, they say he secretly enlisted a high-frequency trading firm to purchase large volumes of TerraUSD, artificially propping up its price. This intervention drove further investor confidence and boosted Luna’s valuation to around $50 billion by early 2022, before its eventual collapse.\nMulti-Jurisdiction Legal Battle\nThe guilty plea follows a complex legal saga spanning multiple jurisdictions. After South Korea issued a warrant for his arrest in 2023, Kwon fled the country, eventually being detained in Montenegro for using falsified travel documents. He was later extradited to the United States to face a nine-count indictment, which included securities fraud, commodities fraud, and money laundering conspiracy.\nInitially pleading not guilty in January, Kwon reversed his position as part of a negotiated settlement. In addition to the criminal case, he faces significant civil penalties, including an $80 million fine and a ban on participating in cryptocurrency transactions, under a $4.55 billion settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRegulatory Message\nTodd Snyder, appointed to oversee Terraform Labs’ liquidation, described the plea as a critical step in reinforcing accountability within the digital asset industry. The case is among the most prominent prosecutions stemming from a cryptocurrency failure, underscoring heightened regulatory scrutiny of the sector.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While ETH provides the blue-chip stability and DeFi dominance, the other three offer explosive potential — especially Pepe Dollar (PEPD), which has been called the Best Crypto Presale opportunity of 2025.\nBreaking Down the Picks\n-\nEthereum (ETH) is trading at $4,307, with bullish momentum that could push it toward $5,500 if current trends hold. Institutional inflows and ETF adoption continue to strengthen its long-term case.\n-\nOndo (ONDO) has surged 13% this week on a “Cup and Handle” breakout pattern, eyeing $1.48 as its next target. Strong technicals and adoption in tokenized assets are key drivers.\n-\nSPX6900 (SPX) remains a meme-coin legend with over 135,000% gains from its all-time low, while its spiritual successor Token6900 (T6900) has already raised over $1.83M in presale funding.\n-\nPepe Dollar (PEPD) blends meme culture with Layer-2 infrastructure, deflationary supply, and integrated gaming/NFT ecosystems, making it stand out from typical meme coins.\nJoin Pepe Dollar Presale:\nPepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/\nPepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity\nPEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar\nPEPD Presale Numbers Signal Strong Entry Point\nThe Best Crypto Presale tag for Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is backed by hard data:\n-\nStage 1 Price: $0.004688\n-\nLaunch Price: $0.03695\n-\n97% Sold\n-\nUSD Raised: $1,280,167 of $1,317,138\n-\nTokens Sold: 273,073,174 of 280,959,484\nWith less than 3% remaining in Stage 1, the analyst warns that buyers may miss the lowest possible entry price if they delay.\nHow To Buy Pepe Dollar (PEPD)\n-\nVisit the Official Website — Only buy through the official presale portal to avoid scams.\n-\nChoose Your Payment Method — ETH, USDT, BNB, or card payments are supported.\n-\nConnect Wallet — Use MetaMask or WalletConnect for smooth transactions.\n-\nConfirm and Receive — Tokens are stored securely until the post-presale claim period.\nWhy These Four Could Dominate 2025\nThe analyst’s thesis is that Ethereum (ETH) will provide the infrastructure backbone, Ondo (ONDO) will lead in tokenized assets, SPX6900 (SPX) will remain a culture driver, and Pepe Dollar (PEPD) will capture meme-driven retail mania — all while being part of the Best Crypto Presale strategies that seasoned investors are quietly executing.\nConclusion: A Diversified Path To Millions\nCombining large-cap strength with mid-cap growth plays and one high-conviction presale like Pepe Dollar (PEPD) gives investors a balanced approach to wealth creation in crypto.

These overlooked tokens are drawing attention from investors searching for high returns from small investments. Learn which five coins could climb sharply if they catch the right moment. Each one stands out for special reasons that set it apart from the rest.\n$XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI\nXYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game.\nWith the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project.\nWhat sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth.\nFueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto.\n$XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market\nThe $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price.\nLaunch Price: $0.0001\nPrice Now: $0.005\nNext Stage: $0.01\nFinal Presale Price: $0.02\nFollowing the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries.\nSo far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch.\nDemand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns.\nJoin $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions!\nStellar (XLM)\nSource: TradingView\nXLM has been climbing. The token is up 5.32% in the past week, 10.89% over the month, and 30.78% in six months. It now trades between 0.40 and 0.48, hugging the 10-day SMA at 0.44 and the 100-day SMA at 0.45. That narrow spread shows a tug-of-war that could snap soon.\nMomentum reads are calm. RSI is 44.94, Stochastic 46.21, and MACD is slightly negative at ‑0.0024. Buyers have cooled but remain present. Holding above support at 0.35 keeps the longer trend intact, while a slip to the deeper floor at 0.26 would erase much of the recent advance.\nA push above 0.48 targets the first barrier at 0.52. Clearing that could propel XLM to 0.60, a jump of roughly 25% to 35% from the mid-range. If bulls stall, the coin may slide to 0.40 and test 0.35, cutting about 15% to 20%.\nTerra Classic (LUNC)\nSource: TradingView\nLUNC has inched up 0.93% in the last 7 days, trimming only a bit of the grind that sent it down 2.19% over the past month and 25.83% in 6 months. The coin now trades between 0.00005793 and 0.00006576, a narrow band that keeps traders alert.\nThe 10-day moving line sits at 0.00006091 while the 100-day reads 0.00006225, so price is still under the long trend. Momentum gauges agree; RSI is 42.35 and stochastic is 32.15, both shy of oversold yet signaling the buyers are not in charge. The MACD line stays below zero, hinting at fading force.\nIf LUNC climbs past 0.00006902, the chart points to 0.00007686 next, a potential gain of roughly 18% from mid-range. Failure to clear that lid could send the coin back to the 0.00005334 floor, about 12% lower, and even 0.00004551, near 28% down. With volume thin, the next sessions decide whether the drift turns into an uptick or another slide.\nSiren (SIREN)\nSource: TradingView\nSiren woke up this week. The token jumped 75% in 7 days and has doubled in a month. Over 6 months it still sits 37% higher, so the bigger picture is green too. The current band runs from 0.0628 to 0.1566, showing traders have been willing to chase quick swings but have not cracked the next ceiling.\nThe 10-day and 100-day averages almost overlap at 0.0971 and 0.0990, hinting that a fresh trend is near. Strength and swing gauges sit at 39 and 20, both close to oversold territory. That leaves room for a rebound. If buyers take charge, the first test stands at 0.1965, roughly 25% above the recent top and more than 200% above the range low. A break there could unlock 0.2903, an extra 80% jump from the first barrier.\nFailure to hold the band, though, drags focus to 0.00898. That floor sits about 85% below the range low and would wipe out all recent wins. Momentum favors a push higher while the oversold readings last, yet the token must clear 0.1965 soon to keep the rally alive.\nZora (ZORA)\nSource: TradingView\nZORA stunned traders. The token jumped 71% in 7 days, 1325% in a month, and 11881% over 6 months. Price climbed from sub-penny to the current 0.07-0.13 zone, thrusting the coin into wider view.\nThe range hugs the 10-day mean at 0.12, above the 100-day read of 0.10, hinting at near strength. Yet RSI at 45 is flat, stochastic at 13 is oversold, and MACD is just below zero, showing weak push. Traders eye 0.15 resistance; above that sits 0.20.\nA break past 0.15 could lift price 15% fast, then 30% to 0.20. Holding over 0.20 would stretch the 6-month gain beyond 12000%. Failure could drag ZORA to 0.0394, a 45% slide from today’s mid-range. Low volume means either move may arrive quickly.\nConclusion\nXLM, LUNC, SIREN, and ZORA all show strong potential. However, XYZVerse is unique, blending sports and meme hype, offering a promising roadmap, and aiming for standout growth in this bull run.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, the initial rally was stopped in its tracks and the price action has returned to sit above the $119,000 support level. Is a real rally still on the way?\nCould the CME gap down to $117,000 still be filled?\nSource: TradingView\nA strong rally is probably on the cards for the $BTC price. However, there may be some housekeeping to do first, in the form of a quick dip down to close the recent CME gap that stretches from $119,000 down to just over $117,000.\nIf the $BTC price did take this particular route, the potential dip would likely coincide with a retest of the top trendline of the bull flag, so probably no harm done.\nCME gaps aren’t always filled, but most of the time they are. It just remains to be seen in this particular instance whether the market will want to take off to the upside, or whether it can be held for a last little dip.\n$BTC is currently respecting an ascending trendline (faint dotted line), so if the price falls through this line, it could be a sign that a retrace to $117,000 might be about to take place. On the other hand, if the price lifts off from this trendline, and given the strong bullish fervour in the market, it just might not come back.\nHorizontal support can favour the gap fill\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily chart illustrates that things are relatively serene for $BTC. That said, the Stochastic RSI indicators are perhaps shaping to turn back down. They have not quite reached the top so this remains to be seen. The blue 50-day SMA is travelling up, and it could act as support again if there was more than a slight dip in price.\nAlso on the subject of support, it can be seen that the lower part of the horizontal support band would not be far from the bottom of the CME gap. Could these particular stars be aligning?\nA very bullish 2-week chart\nSource: TradingView\nZooming a lot further out, the 2-week chart continues to look bullish for the $BTC price. In the price action it can be observed that should this two-week period close more or less as is, the current candle will envelop the previous one. If one looks back to the previous bull flag, a similar enveloping candle was what took the price up to the next bull flag.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index reveals that the indicator line is right up against the descending trendline.

{"title": "Ethereum-Based Meme Coin ‘Pepeto’ Nears Stage 9, Raises Over $6.09M in Presale", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/ethereum-based-meme-coin-pepeto-nears-stage-9-raises-over-609m-in-presale", "text": "Dubai, UAE, August 13th, 2025, Chainwire\nPepeto, the Ethereum-based meme coin, is approaching the end of Stage 8 of its presale after raising $6,096,096.67 in total. With more than 100 billion tokens sold so far, the Pepeto team points to consistent demand from both meme coin enthusiasts and the broader crypto community as the driver behind its steady progress.\nBuilt on Ethereum and integrating a zero-fee exchange model, Pepeto aims to combine utility with meme culture. The project’s audited infrastructure, reviewed by SolidProof and Coinsult, and community-focused approach have contributed to its legitimacy and growing investor confidence. Stage 9 is the next step in the project’s timeline toward public launch.\nStage 8 Nears Sellout as Project Advances\nThe nearing completion of Stage 8 is more than a milestone, it reflects investor sentiment. The project reports that each stage has moved faster than expected, driven by increasing participation from new and returning contributors. At a current price of $0.000000146, Pepeto offers early entry with room for potential growth, matching the total supply of 420 trillion tokens, the same as PEPE.\nUnlike many meme coins built solely on viral marketing, Pepeto is anchored by a defined roadmap and tangible developments. Its upcoming platform aims to enhance accessibility, provide zero-fee trading, and bridge multiple blockchain networks, positioning it to scale effectively while appealing to a wide investor base.\nCommunity-Driven Growth and Strategic Foundations\nPepeto’s visibility is supported by both structured development and active community engagement. The team’s presence across X and Telegram has fueled awareness while reinforcing transparency. In parallel, development milestones, including the launch of a demo version of its PepetoSwap exchange, have showcased its readiness for market entry.\nThe project’s emphasis on combining staking rewards of up to 247% APY with scalable infrastructure has been cited by the team as a differentiator in the meme coin space. This measured approach, combined with regular updates and verified audits, positions Pepeto as a project working toward sustained growth rather than short-lived hype.\nWhat Comes Next for $PEPETO\nAccording to the team, with Stage 9 about to begin, Pepeto is preparing for further growth ahead of its public listing. The team has announced that applications for legitimate Web3 project owners to list on its upcoming platform will open in Stage 2 of its post-launch rollout. Alongside this, the demo exchange display, already live, will transition into its full version, expanding the project’s ecosystem.\nFuture plans also include expanding marketing reach, integrating additional trading tools, and leveraging community incentives to maintain engagement before listing. The team believes that these developments, combined with the established audit-backed trust, will help Pepeto stand out as a credible contender in the meme coin market.\nDisclaimer:\nTo buy PEPETO, users must make sure to use the official website: https://pepeto.io. As the listing draws closer, some are attempting to capitalize on the hype by using the name to mislead investors with fake platforms. Stay cautious and verify the source.\nAbout Pepeto\nPepeto is an Ethereum-based meme coin in its presale stages, merging viral meme culture with real-world crypto utility. Built for investors looking for the next big crypto presale, the project offers zero-fee trading, a cross-chain bridge, and high-yield staking opportunities, all backed by two independent smart contract audits. Designed to compete with top Ethereum meme coins, Pepeto’s platform aims to deliver scalable performance and long-term value while attracting a global community of traders and holders. With its low entry price and clear roadmap, Pepeto positions itself as a high-potential meme coin to watch ahead of its public listing.\nContact\nCOODaniel B.\n[email protected]\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "$250 in This Meme Coin Could Explode Into $50,000 Before Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rallies to $0.0001", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/250-in-this-meme-coin-could-explode-into-50000-before-shiba-inu-shib-rallies-to-00001", "text": "Shiba Inu might be one of the best-known meme coins in the cryptocurrency world, but its journey to $0.0001 is still far off. In the meantime, a new meme token generates significant returns from modest investments—Little Pepe ($LILPEPE). Analysts expect that an investment of $250 in Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) could soar to $50,000, vastly outpacing Shiba Inu's growth toward its next price milestone.\nSHIB’s Road to $0.0001: Long, Slow, and Crowded\nShiba Inu has plenty of loyal fans and serious brand power, but that massive token supply keeps prices neutral. Sure, Shibarium went live, and burns are happening, yet even with that, prices might only work to $0.0001 in a few months, or drag out into years. It all hinges on broad crypto markets, Shiba-related news, and how active the community stays. Reaching that target would require a multi-billion-dollar investment and a huge market cap, as it trades at $0.00001. Large-cap meme tokens have seen that level of growth in the past, but it would take a lot of time. If you’re after a fast return on investment, SHIB is likely not for you anymore.\nEnter Little Pepe ($LILPEPE): The Meme Coin Built Different\nWithin the upcoming wave of meme currency altcoin breakouts, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is emerging as a frontrunner. It's the epitome of fun, tech, and profits. With lightning-quick Layer-2 blockchain, no taxation, and aggressive meme brand marketing, this one is hard to miss. Now in stage 10 of its presale, the project has raised more than $16.4 million in the presale and is now trading for $0.0019, a significant increase from the launch-stage price of $0.001. Early adopters have also enjoyed excellent returns, and the surge in value shows no signs of slackening. With a $250 investment, one could receive more than 131,500 tokens of Little Pepe. A more realistic long-term target would be $0.38, achievable due to its Layer-2 roadmap and prospective exchange listings. If $0.38 is hit, your $250 investment would turn into $50,000. Such potential gains are almost Non-Existent in the meme coin universe, but the case of Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is different, as it doesn’t stick to the standard template. Unlike the typical derivatives of cryptocurrency, it possesses its own blockchain, an audited smart contract through Certik, and features that set it apart from the usual pump and dump coins.\nLayer-2 Infrastructure With Meme Appeal\nWhat sets Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) apart is its purpose-built Layer-2 blockchain, which is EVM-compatible and tailored for meme tokens. It has low gas fees and fast transaction finality. It even has a Meme Launchpad for community-initiated projects. Including its anti-sniper bot protection, you have one of the most equitable, sophisticated meme ecosystems available. These attributes make it appealing not just to degens but also to developers and investors who are uninterested in meme culture, coupled with genuine underlying technology. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is scheduled to launch on two major centralized exchanges, with speculation around a listing on the world's largest exchange. These listings are projected to boost liquidity and visibility tremendously, thus further accelerating price discovery. Across social media, the token is going viral. Crypto Twitter, Telegram, and meme influencers are all hopping onto the Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) train because of its humorous branding, solid tokenomics, and infrastructure—something that is rarely found in meme coins. While many meme projects ignore security entirely, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) has completed a full Certik audit, confirming the security and integrity of its smart contract. This is something serious investors look for, and such a token is hard to come by in the low-cap segment. So far, this audit has already improved the project by attracting whales and big presale investors looking for meme coins that won’t do rug pulls and have long-term sustainability.\nConclusion\nWhile Shiba Inu (SHIB) still has potential for growth, it cannot compete with fast-rising new tokens like Little Pepe ($LILPEPE). Investing $250 in SHIB today may provide returns down the line, but with $250 in Little Pepe ($LILPEPE), the transformation of your portfolio could happen much quicker. With strong community backing, impressive fundamentals, and great potential, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is rapidly emerging as a meme coin to keep your eyes on—and maybe the one to buy and hold until the gains are life-changing.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

REFHE uniquely supports both arithmetic and logical operations on encrypted 64-bit values, enabling software to switch seamlessly between math and logic—just like a modern CPU.\nWhy This Matters\nFully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows computation on encrypted data without revealing the underlying information—a capability long considered a “holy grail” of cryptography. But existing schemes typically force a trade-off: choose between efficient arithmetic or efficient logic. REFHE removes that barrier, creating a unified approach where real-world software—full of mixed arithmetic and logic—can run encrypted.\nBreaking a Decade of TFHE Dominance\nSince 2016, TFHE has been one of the most widely used FHE schemes, especially in the context of blockchain use cases, and is leveraged by companies such as Zama. For nearly a decade, no scheme had meaningfully surpassed its performance and latency—until now. REFHE delivers:\n- 100× smaller ciphertexts\n- 20× faster multiplications\n- 1,000× faster additions\nThese gains, alongside being optimized for both arithmetic and logical operations, make it the first FHE scheme capable of operating as a practical, CPU-like encrypted execution engine.\nImplications for 2PC-MPC and the Ika Network\nThe latest FHE-related research, including REFHE and Threshold FHE, can be integrated into the 2PC-MPC protocol powering the fastest MPC network - Ika, coordinated on Sui. With these breakthroughs, 2PC-MPC could directly execute its Zero-Trust signing with FHE, reducing communication rounds and boosting latency, throughput, and security.\nBuilding on Recent Threshold FHE Breakthroughs\nREFHE follows dWallet Labs’ recent Threshold FHE research, which enables scalable, efficient, secure multi-party decryption. Together, these advances form the basis for encrypted systems that are both high-performance and capable of real-world program logic.\n\"This is more than a speedup,\" said Omer Sadika, Co-Founder of Ika and CEO at dWallet Labs. \"It’s about finally aligning encrypted computation with the way real software and CPUs work. That opens up a new class of secure, privacy-preserving applications that were simply not practical before.\"\nAbout Ika\nIka is the fastest parallel MPC network, offering sub-second latency, unprecedented scale and decentralization, and zero-trust security. As the premier choice for interoperability, decentralized custody, and chain abstraction, Ika is set to revolutionize digital asset security and multi-chain DeFi. Users can learn more here\nAbout dWallet Labs\ndWallet Labs is at the forefront of cryptographic innovation, building secure, decentralized protocols for the next generation of the internet. From pioneering 2PC-MPC to advancing FHE, the company is shaping the infrastructure for a secure, interconnected world.\nContact\nIka PRIka\n[email protected]\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

That’s exactly what’s happening with BlockDAG, where the scale of committed capital is already drawing comparisons to early-stage funding rounds of projects that went on to achieve multi-billion-dollar market caps.\nNearly $371 million has been raised in the presale, a figure that has caught the attention of retail buyers looking to position alongside deep-pocketed backers. With each batch pushing the price higher, entry points are getting tighter. For those scanning the market for the top crypto coins 2025, BlockDAG’s funding momentum is a clear indicator to watch.\nInstitutional-Level Capital in a Presale Stage\nInstitutional investors rarely commit heavily to projects without seeing a compelling case for long-term viability. In BlockDAG’s case, the nearly $371 million raised during its presale reflects strong confidence in the project’s architecture, scalability, and growth potential. This level of early-stage capital is reminiscent of the kind of backing seen in now-established networks during their formative periods.\nThe presale has already sold over 25 billion coins, and the current batch price is $0.0276, representing a 2,660% ROI since batch 1. For retail participants, these numbers matter because institutional support often brings both credibility and visibility. This combination is why BlockDAG is increasingly being mentioned among the top crypto coins 2025 in market discussions.\nRetail Capital Following the Smart Money\nInstitutional backing doesn’t just inject large sums into a project, it also serves as a public signal that the risk-to-reward profile has been evaluated by professionals with extensive resources. Retail investors often follow these cues, interpreting institutional participation as a form of validation. This is now playing out in BlockDAG’s presale, where inflows from smaller buyers have accelerated in recent weeks.\nThe psychological effect is powerful: seeing large-scale capital already locked in makes the opportunity feel more time-sensitive. As the presale nears its funding target, the remaining supply at current prices shrinks, creating a stronger sense of urgency. For retail investors weighing their options in the top crypto coins 2025 category, the combination of institutional and grassroots interest makes BlockDAG a notable entry.\nPotential to Scale Into a Multi-Billion-Dollar Ecosystem\nThe historical pattern in crypto is clear: projects that attract significant early capital and sustain post-launch adoption tend to outperform over the long term. With its current trajectory, BlockDAG is positioned to follow a similar path. The funds raised provide not only market validation but also operational runway to support developer grants, ecosystem expansion, and marketing campaigns after Mainnet launch.\nThis capital strength means the network can invest heavily in user acquisition and partnerships without relying solely on post-listing token sales. For long-term investors, this creates a more stable growth environment, one that could push BlockDAG toward multi-billion-dollar status if adoption targets are met. Such positioning is a major reason it stands out as one of the top crypto coins 2025 with both immediate momentum and future potential.\nFinal Say\nRaising nearly $371 million during a presale is more than a milestone, it’s a statement of confidence from investors with the means to shape markets. For BlockDAG, this level of early backing mirrors the launch phases of networks that went on to become dominant players in the industry.\nWith over 25 billion coins sold, a 2,660% ROI since batch 1, and a current price of $0.0276, the case for early positioning is strong. Institutional-grade capital is already locked in, and retail participation is accelerating. For those identifying the top crypto coins 2025 with both funding momentum and adoption potential, BlockDAG demands a close look.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The move marks the start of an ambitious strategy to secure 10% of Ethereum’s circulating supply, positioning the company among the largest corporate ETH holders globally.\nThe firm, which is based in Charlotte, North Carolina, began accumulating ETH on July 30, initiating its plan with a symbolic 6,400 ETH purchase to mark the 10-year anniversary of Ethereum’s genesis block. It has since expanded its holdings through multiple acquisitions, deploying all net proceeds from a recent $200 million private placement into ETH purchases.\nYield-Driven Strategy\nFG Nexus intends to leverage its growing ETH reserves through staking and restaking activities, aiming to generate recurring yields while maintaining long-term exposure to the asset. The company defines “ETH Yield” or ETH generated per share as a core value creation metric for shareholders.\nBeyond direct ETH accumulation, FG Nexus plans to serve as a gateway to Ethereum-powered financial products, including tokenized real-world assets and stablecoin-based yield opportunities. The approach reflects a broader corporate trend of integrating digital assets into treasury strategies.\nInstitutional Partnerships and Custody\nThe company’s ETH holdings are secured with Anchorage Digital, which also facilitates trading operations. Partnerships with Anchorage Digital and Galaxy are set to enhance custody, trading, and structured asset management capabilities, enabling scalable yield generation and reinforcing operational security.\nAnchorage Digital CEO Nathan McCauley called FG Nexus’ approach a “bold, long-term bet” on Ethereum’s role as the backbone of future finance.\nMarket Context and Outlook\nFG Nexus’ announcement comes amid a strong rally in ETH prices, which reached $4,310 on Monday, up 47% over the past month, as the cryptocurrency approaches its all-time high. The company’s rebranding from FGF to FGNX coincides with its pivot toward a digital asset-focused business model.\nEthereum continues to serve as the foundation for decentralized applications, tokenized assets, and blockchain-based finance. FG Nexus’ large-scale accumulation and yield-focused strategy could set a precedent in corporate crypto treasury management, though market observers note the inherent volatility of the sector will test the execution of its long-term plan.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "5 Best Ethereum-Based Altcoins to Invest —Last Chance to Buy OZAK at $0.005", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/5-best-ethereum-based-altcoins-to-invest-last-chance-to-buy-ozak-at-0005", "text": "Ethereum remains a leader when it comes to creating new blockchain-based projects, and hundreds of thousands of tokens and decentralized applications are running on its platform. The most hyped about in terms of opportunities will obviously be the Ozak AI, with the potential to skyrocket on the basis of a presale price of 0.005 dollars to an estimated 1 dollar rise. Such a growth target means having a 200x gain, which is in the spotlight along with known Ethereum-based altcoins, including Chainlink, Uniswap, Render and Injective.\nOzak AI: Artificial Intelligence-Blockchain Giant\nOzak AI is the combination of blockchain infrastructure and powerful trading tools, analysis, charting, and market alerts provided by artificial intelligence. The intended users of this utility are not only retail but also institutional ones, which need to work with information about dynamic markets and act accordingly. To reinvent the metaverse, EarthMeta AI is pursuing the concept of a digital replica of the whole Earth within its ecosystem.\nEarthMeta AI will enable its users to own, trade and grow virtual cities and landmarks as NFTs. Artificial intelligence will add smart ownership, dynamic governance and responsive environments to these assets, resulting in a more immersive virtual world than the usual virtual worlds. It is also enhanced by the power of augmented reality and blockchain technology, adding a more interactive and transparent framework.\nThe AI functionalities in the project will provide adjustments to the virtual layout of the cities, streamline governance regimes, and customize experiences on the basis of behavior and data tendencies. The strategy makes the metaverse an organic, dynamic platform. As an extension of the greater mission that Ozak AI has had, this endeavor would make it a leader in the AI and virtual asset space.\nOzak AI is now in a fourth-stage presale at a price of $0.005; it started in previous presale stages at $0.001 and according to the financial experts, the token might start with a price of a dollar, which would translate to high returns to the initial market members. It has a regulated emission and a Certik audit, which contributes to the stability of its development.\nChainlink (LINK) Oracle Network Leader\nChainlink is an essential part of the Ethereum ecosystem and an oracle that could interface smart contract data with the external world with its decentralized oracle services. Decentralized finance, games and the adoption of blockchain in enterprise operations cannot be realized without this functionality. Its relevance is also evidenced by the steady growth of the network over a very long period of time.\nLINK does not have the same 200x potential as Ozak AI, but it is a stable option that will not disappoint. It is a good addition to other higher-risk opportunities in a diversified portfolio whose track record it has demonstrated. Its market position becomes stronger as a result of further integration into new applications.\nThe Chainlink technology is still essential in securing and correcting data feeds in the blockchain platforms. With the expansion of adoption, one can hardly expect that it will lose its high utility and prevalence in the Ethereum environment.\nUniswap (UNI) DeFi Exchange Pioneer\nUniswap is one of the most significant decentralized exchanges that exists in Ethereum and allows exchanging tokens by using the automated market maker protocol. UNI token owners determine the decisions of the governance, like upgrades and treasury decisions. Its platform has been another important aspect in the growth of DeFi.\nIts growth rate has since subsided relative to its initial boom, but the adoption of DeFi again would help it to start climbing upwards. The function that the platform plays in terms of providing liquidity makes it relevant. UNI is one of the main Ethereum assets that traders would like to get exposure to in a stable way because of its DeFi activity. The fact that Uniswap is globally accessible and can support unlimited tokens makes it ideal to use in the long term.\nRender (RNDR) AI-Powered GPU Rendering\nRender offers a decentralized GPU network that is used to render AI 3D Graphics and metaverse applications. Its usefulness is across these industries that need large-scale rendering capabilities, such as the gaming and design industries. This puts it in the emerging market of AI and metaverse crossover.\nRNDR projections are considered to be between four and nine dollars in 2025. Although this is a minor expansion, the usefulness of the project creates resilience. It is demanded as a high-quality rendering service that revolves around the growing requirements of digital worlds in the future.\nAn infrastructure of Render provides stable involvement in the AI-fueled content generation industry. This long-term positioning assists perseverance in humor with more flip-flop high-upside tokens.\nInjective (INJ) DeFi Infrastructure Innovator\nThe service provided by Injective is decentralized trading in derivatives, order books and cross-chain DeFi. Its low charges and scalability have seen it grow to multiple blockchain systems. The platform maintains a high level of trading capabilities for diverse clients.\nAnalysts expect the stock of INJ to move between $14 and $56 by 2025. Such projections underscore a medium growth rate in relation to the hypothetical potential of Ozak AI. However, its infrastructure utility qualifies it to be a consistent element in Ethereum-powered portfolios.\nInjective is also at the forefront of innovation in DeFi, which makes it poised to be used long term. It is flexible, and this means that it is able to keep pace with the changing market needs.\nFor more information about Ozak AI, visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

What companies/projects are leading this charge, what new companies could announce a TGE event in the final months of 2025, and how will the tokenized RWA ecosystem transform by the end of the year?\nThe decentralized real-world assets (RWA) market is one of the fastest-growing industries in the DeFi space. In the past year, the total value locked (TVL) reached an all-time high of $13 billion on DeFi platforms, with the total market capitalization at $24 billion, a 380% growth since 2022. In addition, investors and venture capital firms are adding millions of dollars into the space, setting a clear bullish path for the industry in the coming months.\nThe markets are expected to turn bullish at the tail end of 2025, according to analysts, and RWA tokenization projects could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the predicted wave. In this article, we focus on the biggest drivers of the RWA tokenized market in 2025, both in the traditional finance space and the decentralized finance space. From the entry of Blackrock’s tokenized treasury fund to Mavryk Network’s $3 billion agreement with UAE companies, the industry is flourishing, and these are the top companies/projects leading the charge.\n1 BlackRock’s entry into tokenized RWAs\nOne of the biggest stories in the RWA marketplace is the entry of BlackRock into the tokenization of real-world assets via its BUIDL tokenized Treasury fund. Since January 2025, the tokenized Treasury Fund has added over $2.4 billion – from $650 million to $2.9 billion – representing a 350% increase in eight months.\nThe fund aims to connect RWAs with decentralized finance (DeFi), having announced a partnership with DeFi protocol Euler, launching sBUIDL, allowing holders of the staked BUIDL token to borrow USDC or AUSD stablecoins.\n2 Mavryk Network Prepare For $MVRK token launch\nMavryk network is preparing for the $MVRK TGE event in May this year. $MVRK will be the native utility token for the blockchain, allowing users to participate in the ecosystem, including RWA tokenization, governance, and treasury functionalities. The token is expected to be the cornerstone of the $10 billion ecosystem and offer users a fast, secure and affordable medium to participate in the tokenization industry.\nIn a landmark deal in May this year, blockchain infrastructure provider Mavryk partnered with MultiBank Group, the world’s largest financial derivatives institution based in Dubai, and UAE-based real estate giant MAG to ink a $3 billion RWA tokenization agreement – the largest ever in the space. The deal fast-tracked the announcement of its token generation (TGE) event for the $MVRK token, with the pre-TGE accessible on QuestN and Galxe.\n3 RWA.io Eyeing A TGE Event In 2025?\nHaving launched the RWA.io Launchpad earlier this year, RWA.io announced its plans to launch its TGE too. The platform aims to connect startups in the RWA space with investors looking for early opportunities in the space. The platform’s official website points to an upcoming TGE, allowing early investors to get in at fixed prices before public trading begins.\nRWA.io’s latest development, the Launchpad, is designed to be a central hub, connecting promising projects with investors who are looking for early opportunities in the RWA space. The native token will be used as transaction fees, incentivising users and on-chain governance of the platform.\nHow The Tokenized RWA Ecosystem Could Shape Up In 2026\nThe coming year could be a critical step forward for the RWA tokenization industry. The nascent technology could unlock trillions in traditional assets, enhancing liquidity and accessibility and serve as the nexus between the two iterations of finance.\nOne key trend in 2025 is the entry of institutional players in the industry – a trend that will likely continue in 2026. Legacy finance companies (banks, hedge funds, and pension funds, are increasingly noticing the benefits of tokenisation, as witnessed with big players entering the market. In July, Goldman Sachs & BNY Mellon announced a partnership to tokenize money market fund shares through blockchain technology. As stated above, BlackRoack launched the BUIDL Fund —an Ethereum-based tokenized fund tracking cash equivalents and U.S. Treasuries – and has $3 billion in its coffers.\nAdditionally, the RWA tokenization ecosystem is becoming more interoperable, giving rise to multichain economies. According to a report by The Business Research Company, blockchain interoperability will witness a 29.3% CAGR for the next three years. This will allow for easy capital movement across the wider economy and open new economies in the RWA space in 2026.\nConclusion\nThe final quarters of 2025 looks bullish in the coming months, as more traditional players enter the ecosystem. The upcoming TGE events from Mavryk and RWA.io, and the possibility of more players entering before year-end, the final quarter of 2025 could be pivotal.\nUnderstandably, institutions entering the field is positive for the industry with billions of dollars projected to enter the RWA tokenization market in 2026.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This development raises questions about shifting investor priorities, evolving market sentiment, and what it means for the ongoing competition between BTC and ETH. As both assets show strong price action, the implications for market leadership, liquidity flows, and potential future rallies are significant.\nWith these dynamics in play, Outset PR provides the analytical perspective and strategic insights needed to navigate such pivotal moments in the cryptocurrency market.\nBitcoin Aims Higher as It Surges Above $114k\nSource: tradingview\nBitcoin is currently exhibiting a steady upward trend, trading between $114,807 and $121,187. The digital currency recently experienced a 5% increase in just one week, suggesting potential for further growth. Bitcoin is approaching its closest resistance level of approximately $123,327, and a breakthrough could lead to a rise towards the second resistance level around $129,707, representing a nearly 7% increase from current levels.\nOver the past six months, Bitcoin's price has climbed by about 26%, indicating strong momentum and investor interest. The market is closely watching to see if this bull run will persist as Bitcoin tests these key price points.\nEthereum Shows Promise with Strong Price Movement\nSource: tradingview\nEthereum is holding strong in a range from above $4,000 to over $4,300. This shows solid momentum, with a notable rise of nearly 23% in the past week and almost 46% over the last month. These steady gains suggest potential growth toward the next resistance around $4,856.\nLooking further ahead, reaching past $5,000 isn't out of the question. The one-month performance reflects a considerable jump, hinting at a brighter future. As Ethereum gains traction, investors watch closely, hoping to see continued upward movement in this dynamic crypto market.\nOutset PR Crafts Communications Like a Workshop, Powered by Data\nFounded by renowned crypto PR expert Mike Ermolaev, Outset PR operates like a hands-on workshop, building every campaign with market fit in mind.\nInstead of offering random placements or templated packages, Outset PR carefully weaves a client’s story into the market context, showcasing what organic PR looks like:\n-\nMedia outlets are selected based on metrics like discoverability, domain authority, conversion rates, and viral potential\n-\nPitches are tailored to fit each platform’s voice and audience\n-\nTiming is mapped to let the story unfold naturally and build trust organically\nOutset PR occupies a unique niche as the only data-driven agency with a boutique-level approach.

Market sentiment soured after Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies fell into the red. BTC failed to test its all-time high, losing momentum around the $122,000 mark.\nThe flagship cryptocurrency plunged as selling pressure returned, dropping below $120,000 to its current level. BTC is down nearly 3% in the past 24 hours, trading around $118,700.\nEthereum (ETH) also stalled after crossing $4,300 as profit-taking took hold. As a result, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency dropped to a low of $4,200 before moving to its current level of $4,292. Ripple (XRP) is down nearly 4%, while Solana (SOL) is down almost 6%, trading around $175. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down over 6%, while Cardano (ADA) is down 5.50%, trading around $0.777. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) are also trading in the red.\nFTX Users Update Lawsuit\nUsers of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX are preparing to update their lawsuit against Fenwick & West, a law firm contracted by the exchange. Users claim new information shows the firm was central to the FTX collapse. FTX customers filed an amended filing stating,\n“The criminal trial of FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and investigations in the exchange’s bankruptcy proceedings produced specific evidence supporting that Fenwick played a key and crucial role in the most important aspects of why and how the FTX fraud was accomplished. Simply put, the FTX Fraud was only possible because Fenwick provided ‘substantial assistance’ by creating and approving the structures that allowed numerous frauds.”\nThe customers accused the law firm of agreeing to create, manage, and represent conflicted companies, including FTX’s sister company, Alameda Research, and its subsidiary, North Dimension. They added that the companies had no safeguards in place to prevent billions of dollars that were stolen. The filing is part of a multi-district class-action lawsuit filed by FTX users following the exchange’s collapse in 2022. The filing added,\n“At SBF’s criminal trial, FTX Insider and co-founder Nishad Singh testified that he informed Fenwick of the misuse of customer funds, improper loans, and false representations, and that Fenwick advised on how to facilitate and hide these very acts.”\nDo Kwon May Enter A Change Of Plea\nTerraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon could enter a “change of plea” at a Tuesday conference scheduled by a federal judge overseeing the case against him. US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) judge Paul Engelmayer ordered all parties associated with the case to appear in court on Tuesday, suggesting that Do Kwon was preparing to change his plea. The Terraform co-founder had pleaded not guilty to nine felony counts following his extradition hearings in Montenegro. Judge Engenlayer stated,\n“[T]he defendant should be prepared to give a narrative allocution that incorporates all elements of the offense(s) to which the defendant is pleading guilty. In the interest of clarity and efficiency, the Court encourages counsel to assist the defendant in writing an allocution that can be read in open court during the plea proceeding.”\nAuthorities indicted Kwon in March 2023, charging him with securities fraud, market manipulation, money laundering, and wire fraud. Authorities alleged he was responsible for the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, wiping out $40 billion in investor wealth.\nAnalysts Worry US Could Nationalise Bitcoin (BTC) Holdings\nCorporate crypto treasuries have crossed $100 million in value, prompting concerns that the US could nationalise some of the holdings in a move harking back to the gold standard era. Bitcoin (BTC) treasury companies hold over 791,662 BTC worth around $95 billion, a staggering 3.98% of BTC’s circulating supply. Corporate treasuries could become a central point of vulnerability for BTC, and could see the asset follow a similar path to gold in 1971. One crypto analyst stated,\n“If the US dollar is structurally getting weak and China is coming in, it’s a fair point that the US might make an offer to all the treasury companies and centralize it, where it could be then put into a digital form, not create a new gold standard. You could then rug it like happened in 1971. And it’s all centralized around the digital Bitcoin. The whole history repeats again back to the beginning.”\nETH Holders Could Rotate Back To BTC\nBitcoin (BTC) pioneer Samson Mow believes Ethereum (ETH) investors will turn back to BTC once ETH prices get high enough. The pivot back to BTC could reverse a five-week jump in ETH prices. Mow explained his stance in a post on X, stating,\n“Let me explain what’s happening with ETHBTC. Most ETH holders have a lot of BTC (ICO/insiders), and they are rotating that BTC into ETH to pump it on new narratives (Ethereum Treasury co’s). Once they’ve gotten it high enough, they’ll dump their ETH, creating new generational bagholders, and then rotate the gains back into BTC. No one wants ETH in the long run.”\nMow has criticised altcoins in the past, and added that it will be difficult for ETH to jump to all-time highs, stating that the closer it gets to its all-time high, the stronger the trader’s drive to sell the asset.\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\nBitcoin (BTC) slipped below $120,000 on Monday despite starting the week on a bullish note. The flagship cryptocurrency raced to an intraday high of $122,319 as buyers attempted to push the price beyond $123,000. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell to $118,701, ultimately registering a 0.51% drop. BTC is marginally up during the ongoing session, but is struggling to reclaim $120,000.\nAnalysts believe BTC could surge past $130,000 if it manages to cross $123,000. However, it could face resistance at this level and could fall back towards established support levels. Analysts believe BTC must stay above $119,000 to maintain its bullish structure and push above $123,000. The price is looking to push towards the upper reaches of its trading channels, and a breakout past $123,000 could create a clear path to $130,000 and higher. BTC’s resistance zone is crucial, as the price has historically paused or reversed after attempts to cross into a higher timeframe.\nHowever, a rejection from these levels will not necessarily end BTC’s bullish structure. However, it could trigger a decline towards $100,000 and another consolidation phase. The flagship cryptocurrency remains poised for further upside. A break above $123,000 could send BTC into price discovery. However, a rejection could see it drop to $100,000. Henrik Andersson, Chief Investment Officer at Apollo Crypto, believes a rally is long overdue following a period of consolidation.\n“In our view, it was just a matter of time before it would break up. In this time, we have seen positive ETF flows, more treasury companies buying Bitcoin, and several positive developments coming out of the White House. Bitcoin has been stuck in a low-volatility band between $115,000 and $120,000 despite all the good news.”\nBTC registered a sharp decline on Friday (August 1), dropping over 2% and settling at $113,365. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 0.67% and settled at $112,601. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Sunday, rising 1.52% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,215. The price continued pushing higher on Monday, registering a 0.69% increase and settling at $115,051. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $112,707 on Tuesday as selling pressure returned. It rebounded from this level to reclaim $114,000 and settled at $114,051, ultimately dropping 0.83%. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.80% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,028.\nSource: TradingView\nBullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $117,000 and settle at $117,515. Despite the positive sentiment, the price was back in the red on Friday, falling 0.71% to $116,683. Sellers retained control on Saturday as BTC registered a marginal decline and settled at $116,492. Bullish sentiment returned on Sunday as the price rose 2.42% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,309. BTC reached an intraday high of $122,319 on Monday as buyers attempted to push above $123,000. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level, dropping below $120,000 and settling at $118,701. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to exert control.\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\nEthereum (ETH) lost momentum after reaching an intraday high of $4,364 on Monday as traders began locking in their profits. The rally saw the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency surge past $4,000 on Friday and reach $4,262 on Saturday before losing steam. However, ETH is back in positive territory during the ongoing session, with the price up over 2%.\nOn-chain analytics platform Glassnode revealed that short-term ETH holders have been aggressively taking profits compared to their long-term counterparts. Glassnode analysts believe short-term holders are expecting a pullback in the short term.\n“ETH profit realization (7D SMA) peaked at $771M/day in July, above Dec ‘24 levels, and is now ramping up again at $553M/day. Profits from long-term holders match Dec ‘24 levels, but short-term investors are realizing far more gains, driving the current wave.”\nGlassnode revealed that ETH profit realisation, measured using the seven-day SMA, is around $533 million per day, primarily being driven by short-term investors. Meanwhile, long-term holders have been happy to sit on the sidelines. ETH crossed $4,300 during the ongoing session. Analysts believe buyers must retain this level for a move towards $4,500 to materialise. ETH has been accumulating for months, steadily absorbing selling pressure before its latest breakout.\nETH started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 6% and settling at $3,488. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 3%, slipping below $3,400 to $3,393. ETH recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to reclaim $3,500. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price rallied, rising over 6% to cross $3,700 and settle at $3,721. ETH was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping nearly 3% to $3,612. It rebounded on Wednesday, rising over 2% and settling at $3,685.\nSource: TradingView\nBullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH rallied, rising over 6% to cross $3,900 and settle at $3,911. The price crossed $4,000 on Friday, rising 2.52% and settling at $4,010. ETH rallied on Saturday, rising over 6% to cross $4,200 and settle at $4,262. However, it lost momentum on Sunday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $4,251. Sellers retained control on Monday as the price fell 0.59% to $4,226. ETH has recovered during the ongoing session, with the price up almost 2%, trading around $4,303.\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\nSolana (SOL) slumped below $180 on Monday as selling pressure returned. The altcoin started the week with a move to an intraday high of $186. However, it could not push higher as buyers lost momentum. As a result, selling pressure returned, driving the price below $180 to $174. SOL is marginally up during the ongoing session,\nAnalysts believe SOL could regain momentum thanks to several bullish developments over the past week. Public companies have upped their SOL purchases to access the blockchain’s staking rewards. Firms including Bit Mining, Upexi, and DeFi Development Corp have increased their SOL holdings, with plans to increase their stake substantially over the next few months. The Solana ecosystem is also emerging as the preferred chain for real-world asset tokenization. The Solana Foundation recently concluded an agreement with R3 to integrate the Solana blockchain for asset tokenization. The network has also registered a sharp jump in daily active addresses, indicating growing user engagement.\nSOL started the previous weekend with a sharp drop, falling nearly 6% on Friday and settling at $162. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell 2.57%, slipping below $160 and settling at $158. It recovered on Sunday, rising over 2% to reclaim $160 and settle at $162. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as SOL rallied, rising nearly 5% to settle at $169. The price was back in bearish territory on Tuesday, falling 3% to $164. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as SOL rose 2.50% and settled at $168.\nSource: TradingView\nSOL continued pushing higher on Thursday, rising over 4% to cross $170 and settle at $175. Buyers retained control on Friday as the price rose 0.79% to $176. Price action remained bullish over the weekend as SOL rose 1.80% on Saturday and 1.51% on Sunday, crossing $180 and settling at $182. Despite the positive sentiment, the price was back in bearish territory on Monday, dropping over 4%, slipping below $180 to settle at $174. The current session sees SOL marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control.\nInternet Computer (ICP) Price Analysis\nInternet Computer (ICP) ended the previous weekend on a bullish note, rising over 3% to cross $5 and settle at $5.13. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose 3.30% to $5.30. Despite the positive sentiment, ICP lost momentum on Tuesday, falling over 4% to an intraday low of $4.95 before settling at $5.07. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as the price rose 0.99% to $5.35. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ICP rallied, increasing 4.49% and settling at $5.35.\nSource: TradingView\nICP fell to an intraday low of $5.20 on Friday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to settle at $5.43, ultimately registering a 1.50% increase. The price rallied on Saturday, rising 5.16% and settling at $5.71. However, it lost momentum on Sunday, dropping 1.23% to $5.64, but not before falling to an intraday low of $5.64.

The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion.\nHusky Inu (HINU) is also closing in on its latest fundraising milestone. The project adopted a dynamic and progressive pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, increasing the price of the HINU token every two days. This has allowed the project to raise funds quickly while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering its growing community. Thanks to this dynamic strategy, Husky Inu crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached its latest milestone in record time, crossing $850,000 on July 25. Husky Inu is now closing in on the $900,000 milestone, and has raised $874,126 so far.\nVisit the following links for more information on Husky Inu:\n-\nWebsite: Husky Inu Official Website\n-\nTwitter: Husky Inu Twitter\n-\nTelegram: Husky Inu Telegram\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Top 5 Gainers This Week (Aug 4–11): MYX, SOON, TROLL, SIREN, ZORA", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/top-5-gainers-this-week-aug-4-11-myx-soon-troll-siren-zora", "text": "This week saw some digital coins make strong moves upward. Five tokens grabbed attention with their rapid gains, setting themselves apart from the pack. Names like MYX and ZORA appeared alongside unexpected surges such as TROLL and SOON. What caused these price jumps, and what makes these tokens stand out now? The details may surprise even close watchers.\n$XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI\nXYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game.\nWith the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project.\nWhat sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth.\nFueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto.\n$XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market\nThe $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price.\nLaunch Price: $0.0001\nPrice Now: $0.005\nNext Stage: $0.01\nFinal Presale Price: $0.02\nFollowing the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries.\nSo far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch.\nDemand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns.\nJoin $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions!\nMYX: The Fast-Lane Token Powering Cross-Chain Perpetual Plays\nMYX sits at the heart of a new kind of trading spot. The coin fuels a cross-chain exchange that lets users bet on price moves without time limits. A smart system called the Matching Pool lines up orders, so trades fill at the price you see. No surprise slips. Up to 50× leverage is on offer with stable USDC as margin. The app lives at once on BNB Chain, Arbitrum, opBNB, and Linea, so funds fly where they are needed. Tens of millions already rest in its pools, and volume has crossed the billion mark.\nRecent cross-chain links lit a spark, sending active wallets and fees surging. In a market hunting for real use, that growth stands out. Many tokens tied to leverage trades, such as GMX or DYDX, have already made big moves this cycle. MYX is younger, still below them in value, yet its pool-to-peer design aims for the same clear fills with lighter costs. If TVL keeps climbing and new chains join, the token could gain fresh demand from both traders and reward seekers. As always, price swings will follow crypto mood, but the setup looks promising.\nSOON: The Fast Lane Token Riding the Solana Super Stack\nSOON powers the Super Adoption Stack, a set of rollups built on the Solana Virtual Machine. These rollups click together like blocks, moving data fast and across many chains. People use SOON to vote, stake, earn rewards, and pay fees. The initial stash sits near one billion tokens, and new coins grow at about three percent each year. Daily trading is brisk, and the cap already sits in the high nine-figure range. Backers have poured tens of millions into the stack, and timed unlocks keep fresh supply flowing.\nThe pitch is simple: rollup speed with Solana tools and Ethereum-style reach. That blend could shine in a market hunting for cheap, fast lanes while Bitcoin cools and Layer-2s crowd. SOON’s clear use cases give it more purpose than many meme coins born this year. Still, the steady unlocks and three percent inflation mean price needs growing demand to climb. If the next cycle favors networks that link chains instead of sealing them off, SOON may stand out much like MATIC did in 2021 or OP in 2023. For traders who see cross-chain traffic as the next big wave, holding a slice of this stack looks worth a closer look.\nTROLL Coin: When Internet Mischief Meets Multi-Chain Mayhem\nTROLL started as a wink to every prank lover online. The coin has no promised use, yet it spreads across Ethereum, Solana, and other chains like a sly joke gone viral. Because its code is renounced, no one can secretly change the rules. Each chain shows its own price, swinging from a few million to almost two hundred million in value. Some weeks the chart leaps double digits in days, reminding fans why meme tokens keep stealing the spotlight.\nMany traders see TROLL as the next playful bet in a market hungry for stories. Meme coins like DOGE and SHIB moved first; now fresh crowds chase newer badges of internet fame. TROLL offers the extra twist of living on many chains, so buyers can pick the network they know best and still join one big tribe. If the current cycle keeps favoring high-risk fun, a low-utility token with loud culture can shine again. Yet the split prices between chains leave room for jumps if they line up. In short, TROLL’s future may depend less on math and more on memes, and memes still rule the feed.\nSIREN: The Mythic Bridge Bringing DIY Options to Ethereum Fans\nSIREN is a fresh stop for people who love choice. Built on Ethereum, it lets anyone create, trade, or close an option on any ERC-20 token while coins stay in their own wallet. Every bet is fully backed, so no gaps appear if prices swing. The name borrows from Greek tales and often mixes with talk of smart AI seas. Daily volume and value both sit in the low tens of millions, big enough for action yet small enough to grow fast.\nMany Web3 coins promise speed, but few give users real control. By skipping middlemen, SIREN feels closer to the core dream of crypto than big exchanges. Its focus on options also sets it apart from the crowded world of simple swaps. If the next market wave lifts Bitcoin and Ether, traders may chase tools that add spice without leaving the chain. SIREN meets that wish. For people who trust on-chain finance and enjoy calling future token prices, the coin looks lively in this cycle.\nZORA: The Social NFT Highway Built for Creators and Low Fees\nZORA lets artists turn any image, clip, or line of text into an on-chain collectable. It runs on a fast, low-cost copy of Ethereum called a Layer 2, built with the OP Stack. Since its 2021 start, the team has added a friendly mobile app, so minting takes a few taps. A link with the Base network now lets users drop “content coins” that rise or fall with each like and share, blending social buzz with real value. Daily trade numbers stay lively, and the market cap already sits in the hundreds of millions.\nMany NFT chains chase volume, yet fees still bite. ZORA’s cheap rails give it an edge over older rivals like the main Ethereum chain and even some newer Layer 2s. The focus on creators, not speculators, lines up with a wider trend: social media moving on-chain. If that wave keeps growing, demand for ZORA’s coin could follow. Prices are still below past peaks, so long-term fans may see room to run in this cycle. As always, the biggest gains tend to go to platforms that people use every day.\nConclusion\nMYX, SOON, TROLL, and SIREN have shown strong performance, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by combining meme culture with sports, aiming for huge growth and community-driven success.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

BC Wong, CEO of KuCoin explains the partnership will revolutionise the tokenized RWA market, “securing investments for the global market”.\n\"This partnership with DigiFT to support the UBS uMINT token highlights a significant step forward in exploring the viability and adoption of secure investments for a broader audience,” BC Wong further stated. “It empowers institutions to unlock tokenized traditional assets for seamless global trading and solidifies KuCoin's leadership in converging traditional and digital finance.\"\nAs part of the partnership, KuCoin will support the uMINT token, allowing institutional tokenholders through DigiFT to utilize their tokenized investment funds as off-exchange collateral. This will enable efficient trading on the tokenized assets, enhance liquidity and safeguard collateral by linking the TradFi market with new digital assets on a robust blockchain infrastructure. In addition, investors can also access an array of digital assets and other investments offered on the exchange.\n\"KuCoin remains committed to innovation alongside unwavering compliance and security,\" Wong added.\nUBS Asset Management launches tokenised MMF Via DigiFT\nBy holding the uMINT token, institutional clients can access UBS Asset Management’s institutional-grade cash management solutions. These solutions are backed by high-quality money market instruments and follow a dynamic risk-managed framework. The tokenized uMINT was offered through DigiFT, a platform that provides investors access to tokenized RWAs.\nThe platform supports subscription and redemption of the tokens via stablecoins and fiat currency in a non-custodial manner. The partnership with KuCoin Exchange will allow investors access to a higher liquidity pool and easy redemption of the tokenized RWA tokens. DigiFT’s goal is to advance the RWA tokenization market, developing the next iteration of compliant institutional-grade capital markets infrastructure for Web3.\nSpeaking on the partnership, Henry Zhang, CEO of DigiFT, stated:\n“The integration of the UBS uMINT token, which will enable tokenholders to use their funds as collateral via KuCoin’s mirroring program, exemplifies our focus on enhancing capital efficiency across digital asset markets through tokenized RWAs. Together with our partners, we are reshaping the innovation contours of institutional digital asset infrastructure.”\nGrowing The Trillion-Dollar RWA Tokenization Market\nNearly $14 billion is currently locked on on-chain RWA tokenization platforms. With RWA increasingly touted as the next phase of blockchain and institutional grade infrastructure being built, the market could be in a bullish phase. KuCoin aims to lead this charge with such incentives. Expanding the use of tokenized RWAs in real-world exchanges and trading environments will initroduce additional utility for cryptocurrencies, according to the KuCoin press release.\nAdditionally, KuCoin targets more partnerships in the RWA tokenization market, as demand for\nhigh-grade on-chain income assets grows. This is to see broader adoption of RWAs, foster a more interconnected financial ecosystem, and provide institutional clients with flexible trading solutions to optimize capital efficiency and boost returns.\nInvestors will be able to trade RWA Ltokens with stablecoin equivalents without transferring ownership, enabling sophisticated trading on digital assets while preserving yields and control through a third-party regulated custodian. This will all be done on highly secure and regulatory-compliant blockchain infrastructure – a new standard for the RWA tokenization economy.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "What’s Next for XRP After BlackRock Shelves ETF Plans", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/whats-next-for-xrp-after-blackrock-shelves-etf-plans", "text": "BlackRock Inc. is steering clear of the first wave of proposed U.S. exchange-traded funds tracking XRP, opting to stick with Bitcoin and Ether despite mounting evidence of investor demand for the token.\nReportedly, the world’s largest asset manager has no plans “at this time” to file for a spot XRP ETF, quashing months of speculation it would join at least eight other issuers awaiting U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval. The decision follows the August 8 resolution of Ripple Labs Inc.’s long-running legal battle with the SEC — a case many believed was the last major hurdle for a regulated XRP product.\nCompetitors in Position\nBlackRock’s absence leaves the early lead to competitors such as Grayscale Investments, Franklin Templeton and Bitwise Asset Management. Industry veterans say first movers in crypto ETFs tend to capture the lion’s share of liquidity and advisory attention, advantages that can be hard to dislodge.\nIgnoring crypto assets besides BTC and ETH “makes zero sense”, said Nate Geraci, President of NovaDius Wealth Management.\nThere has been roughly $1 billion in inflows to newly launched futures-based XRP and Solana products this year as evidence of robust appetite for regulated exposure.\nManaging the Narrative in an ETF-Driven Market\nFor crypto projects the developments around major coins such as XRP can be as pivotal as price action. That’s where firms like Outset PR, founded by crypto PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, have carved out a niche. The agency blends daily market analytics with boutique-level campaign design, ensuring that messaging not only reaches the right media channels but also lands during moments of peak relevance.\nIn a cycle where ETF headlines can trigger billions in market cap shifts overnight, Outset PR’s approach — tailoring pitches to each platform’s audience, mapping campaign timing to market catalysts, and targeting high-discovery outlets — has proven effective for crypto companies seeking to amplify their story in sync with market momentum.\nThe firm’s data-led strategy has driven measurable results for clients such as Step App, Choise.ai, and ChangeNOW, often aligning visibility spikes with token price surges. For projects looking to capture investor mindshare ahead of major catalysts like ETF approvals, such coordinated PR efforts can mean the difference between being part of the headline or buried under it.\nXRP Price Reaction and Technical Picture\nXRP has extended its rally to a sixth consecutive month, trading between $2.93 and $3.41 after a 10.36% weekly gain. The token is up 19.26% over the past month and 35.10% in six months, with buyers defending each minor pullback.\nThe coin is holding above both its 10-day and 100-day moving averages at $3.24 and $3.23, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 57.48, suggesting stable momentum, while a Stochastic Oscillator reading near 87 reflects growing bullish enthusiasm. The MACD remains in positive territory.\nImmediate resistance is at $3.64, with a more significant barrier at $4.12. Support lies at $2.68 and $2.20. A break above $3.64 would open the way to $4.12 — a potential 25%–30% upside from mid-range levels. Holding above $3.00 keeps that scenario in play; a drop below $2.93 could see retracements toward $2.68 (–15%) or $2.20 (–30%). Trend bias stays upward while price remains above $2.68.\nThe Road Ahead\nWhether BlackRock’s “not now” becomes “not yet” will hinge on how quickly competitor products scale. A surge in assets could prompt the firm to reverse course, as it did when it entered the Bitcoin ETF race after rivals filed first.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "XRP Price Prediction Slows While Bitcoin Swift Shows Stronger ROI Potential", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/xrp-price-prediction-slows-while-bitcoin-swift-shows-stronger-roi-potential", "text": "XRP’s projected growth paints a steady, if unspectacular, picture. At an estimated $3.43 in 2026, $4.17 in 2030, $5.33 in 2035, and $6.80 in 2040 based on a 5% annual increase, it offers gradual appreciation for long-term holders. While this slow climb may appeal to the most patient investors, many in today’s market are looking for more immediate, higher-yielding opportunities.\nThis is where Bitcoin Swift (BTC3) enters the conversation, a project that is turning heads for how quickly it can activate returns and for its focus on making participants richer through adaptive rewards and high utility from day one.\nBitcoin Swift: Built for rapid, sustained ROI\nBitcoin Swift (BTC3) is designed as a decentralized financial operating system, not just another token. It combines the security of Proof-of-Work with the governance efficiency of Proof-of-Stake, while its Proof-of-Yield (PoY) model ensures rewards adapt in real time to network activity, environmental performance, and governance votes.\nWhere XRP offers predictable price targets years into the future, BTC3 delivers programmable staking rewards that start during the presale and are distributed automatically at the end of each stage. This transforms early participation into immediate on-chain value.\nAI-driven efficiency and governance safeguards\nBTC3’s AI oracles monitor energy usage and network health, rewarding efficient participation with higher returns. Governance is reinforced by quadratic voting weighted by decentralized identity reputation, AI-powered proposal screening, and an emergency council to block harmful changes. This structure keeps the reward system stable and investor-focused.\nSecurity is independently verified through the Spywolf Audit and Solidproof Audit, with team legitimacy confirmed via KYC verification. Internal sources indicate a third audit is in progress.\nInfluencer-driven visibility\nBTC3 is gaining traction across major crypto channels. Influencer reviews from Bull Run Angel and Crypto Show highlight its unique reward mechanics, compliance-ready design, and the strong potential for post-presale listings to boost value.\nPresale momentum\nBTC3 is now in Stage 4 of its 64-day presale, ending September 18, 2025. Over 2,100 participants have contributed more than $580k at the current price of $4. Stage 5 will increase to $5, with a confirmed launch price of $15. Stage 4 offers 106% APY through PoY rewards, automatically distributed at each stage’s close. The launch will take place on Orca, a leading Solana DEX.\nInternal reports suggest BTC3 is preparing exchange listings with MEXC, KuCoin, and LBank when the presale ends. Its liquidity is already among the highest at this stage, ensuring smoother trades and better price stability for new and existing holders.\nBTC3 tokenomics\n-\nTotal supply: 45,000,000 BTC3\n-\n50% (22.5M) allocated to PoY rewards over 30 years\n-\n30% (13.5M) to presale participants with early governance rights\n-\n15% (6.75M) for liquidity provisioning\n-\n5% (2.25M) for the team and reserve allocations\nCommunity growth that pays\nBTC3 offers a 10% referral bonus for both referrer and invitee, with no lockups or hidden conditions. It is a direct way to grow your position while expanding the network.\nFinal verdict\nXRP’s steady rise offers predictability, but BTC3’s combination of high APY, short presale duration, adaptive reward mechanics, and strong listing prospects makes it a far more aggressive ROI play. For investors seeking faster returns backed by advanced tech and verifiable security, Bitcoin Swift is the standout option in 2025.\nFor more information on Bitcoin Swift:\nWebsite: https://bitcoinswift.com\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The Spot Ethereum ETFs are continuing to buy heavily, and therefore it might just be a matter of time before $ETH crashes through its all-time high.\nSource: TradingView\nIn the 4-hour time frame it can be seen how the $ETH price burst out of its previous bull flag with enough impetus to also crash through the strong resistance band from $4,000 to $4,100.\nNow, while the other shorter term Stochastic RSIs are coming down to reset, the price is consolidating within a tight range. The price could keep chopping sideways for a while, but this most definitely looks like a continuation pattern.\n$ETH rally becoming parabolic\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily chart for $ETH shows just how parabolic this rally has become.

{"title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Testing Breakout: Real Rally or Fakeout Ahead?", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/bitcoin-btc-testing-breakout-real-rally-or-fakeout-ahead", "text": "Not only has this Bitcoin dip back to the top of its bull flag closed the CME gap at $119,000, it has also retested support at $118,000. Could this dip take the price back into the bull flag (fakeout), or will this just be a normal retest before $BTC heads back towards its all-time high?\nDoubts creeping in for the bulls?\nSource: TradingView\nWhen $BTC broke out of its bull flag and surged to just over $122,000 it really did look as though this was going to be the beginning of the next leg higher. Of course, it still may be. There is the possibility that the price has just come back to close the CME gap at $119,000 and test the support at $118,000 before returning to head higher.\nThat said, a few little doubts for the bulls are perhaps creeping in. The price has so far remained around the $119,000 support. Could there be another dip to retest the top of the bull flag? Or in the worst case scenario could the price even reenter the flag and confirm a fakeout?\nThe RSI at the bottom of the chart reveals that the indicator line has crossed down below the uptrend. This is a low time frame, so perhaps too much shouldn’t be drawn into it. However, this trendline did start at the lowest point of the price rally back into the bull flag, and this strong dip below the uptrend of the indicator line looks to be signalling that this particular rally could be over.\nThe Stochastic RSI indicators on this time frame are practically at the bottom, although the 8-hour and 12-hour Stochastic RSIs still require a lot more time to reset.\nBearish daily candle for Monday\nSource: TradingView\nWith one exception, the picture on the daily time frame looks more positive for the bulls. The one exception is the quite negative looking candle for Monday. The strong surge to the upside, followed by the dip back down to support, left a lengthy candle wick behind, which as things stand is revealing a bearish double top pattern.\nIn favour of the bulls, the dip back down tested the support band, which also coincides with the top of the bull flag. There is a small ascending trendline which is so far holding. If the price bounces from here, this will have been a standard test and confirmation of the breakout.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator line will need to be watched closely. There is the possibility that a retest of the descending trendline plus the 50.00 level could take place.\n$119,000 is major level for rally or breakdown\nSource: TradingView\nFor the weekly chart view it is still very early to be making any strong assumptions. This said, the $119,000 level can be seen to be the major level for whether this current breakout rally continues, or whether a breakdown back into the bull flag and perhaps an even more bearish scenario plays out.\nAs already mentioned, a confirmation of the bull flag breakout is absolutely fine. The fact that the surge out of the flag was so strong just means that the price has further to come down in order to make this confirmation.\nAt the bottom of the chart the indicators in the Stochastic RSI are making their way down. They may have gone too far down now for a bounce from the 80.00 level, therefore, the next chance for the bulls is at the 50.00 level. If no bounce comes there, these indicators could carry on down to the bottom. If they do, price action is also likely to fall. It would just be a case of how far would it fall before the Stochastic RSI indicators were able to reset and head back up.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

One such coin is Tron. Javon Marks forecasts that the value of the DeFi token could rally to $1.11 in the months ahead. Solana, too, is poised for a rally, with forecasts suggesting it could hit $400.\nMeanwhile, the altcoin most experts are watching out for is Unilabs (UNIL). With over $12.5 million, the DeFi project has become the center of attention for transforming DeFi investment with AI. Unilabs is projected to outperform the top crypto coins with a 5x pump, driven by the increasing adoption.\nAnalysts Say Tron (TRX) Could See Massive Upside\nCrypto analyst Javon Marks believes the Tron price is still on track to hit $1.11 or even higher. According to Marks, reaching these levels would represent more than a 220% upside from current prices, effectively delivering over a 3x return for investors.\nHe notes that momentum remains strong, and the Tron price has shown the technical setup needed for such a rally. Echoing this bullish sentiment, technical analyst Altwolf highlights that the daily chart continues to print only bullish uptrends for TRX.\nHe adds that the TRON price needs a \"God candle\" on the weekly chart to push toward $0.50, which he believes is \"coming soon.\" With multiple experts aligning in their outlook, the TRON price appears to be gearing up for a potential explosive move shortly.\nThe Tron price has been caught within a narrow range in the past few days. Bulls' attempt to break past the $0.34 level has failed due to high selling pressure. Still, technical indicators such as the RSI, which reads 66, support a rebound in the coming days.\nSolana (SOL) Is Undervalued, Says Expert\nCardzz, a top crypto supporter, believes the Solana price could skyrocket if it breaks out of the $120–$186 range. He argued that the current Solana price is heavily undervalued and poised for a significant rally, with a target between $350 and $400.\nAccording to Cardzz, the Solana price could soar once momentum kicks in, leaving its current levels far behind. For investors watching closely, the Solana price breakout could start a powerful new bullish phase.\nAnother expert, Kamran Asghar, told his followers the Solana price is \"making history in 2025\" similar to 2021. Kamran's chart depicted Solana price in a parallel channel on the multi-month timeframe. The analyst predicted that the Solana price might reach up to $460 within the next few months.\nPresently, CoinMarketCap data indicates the Solana price has risen by 12.3% on the weekly timeframe. The altcoin price, however, has faced a tough resistance level at the $185 mark. This should be a critical level to crack to see Solana price surpass the $200 mark.\nUnilabs: Harnessing AI to Revolutionize DeFi Investment\nThe AI market is also growing, with expectations that it will reach a market value of about $1.2 trillion by the year 2030. As AI continues to shape the financial industry, Unilabs (UNIL) is leveraging its power to redefine DeFi investment strategies.\nWith the combination of AI and blockchain tech, Unilabs provides a unique platform that enables investors to make more informed data-driven decisions. The AI Market Pulse is one of the main products in Unilabs. It is a new tool that can analyze on-chain and off-chain data to provide real-time market insights and reveal upcoming trends, token flows, and possible investment opportunities.\nThe AI Market Pulse enables investors to have a competitive edge and stay ahead of the curve and make informed decisions about funds relating to AI, RWA, and Mining. In addition to its AI tools, Unilabs offers an attractive staking program. Investors will be able to stake their UNIL tokens and receive up to 122% APY in passive income.\nWith the rising demand for AI-based tools in the DeFi space, Unilabs is in the best position to capitalize on this trend. YouTuber Crypto Royal noted in a recent video that the UNIL token has a good opportunity to rise due to its perfect timing and current market conditions. Meanwhile,\nUnilabs has already raised over $12.5 million in its crypto ICO and the UNIL token now costs $0.0097. Analysts are expecting significant growth, with some forecasting the value of the token to grow 5x this year.\nConclusion On The Best Cryptos To Buy\nWith altseason on the horizon, Tron, Unilabs, and Solana offer great opportunities for investors looking to double their returns.

This momentum is projected to continue as their technical indicators are also quite bullish. Even some prominent analysts, such as Crypto GEMs and Shib Knight, have made bold price predictions for these top crypto coins.\nAmid all this excitement, many whales are now discussing Unilabs (UNIL) - a new AI crypto coin that recently entered phase six of its presale. Its presale run has been great so far, having raised over $12 million and potentially reaching $20 million before the end of August. As the first AI-driven DeFi asset management platform, many whales believe Unilabs stands out from crypto coins like Solana and Shiba Inu.\nUnilabs (UNIL): First AI-Driven DeFi Asset Manager Making Waves\nUnilabs (UNIL) is becoming a hot topic among whales, while the price of SOL and the Shiba Inu price are seeing some growth. It is a presale star that has made early investors 140% richer—a percentage that will likely rise soon, as CoinMarketCap will soon list UNIL, triggering a massive surge in demand.\nHype was already high for Unilabs as it recently launched the first AI-fueled DeFi asset management platform with over $30 million in AUM. On it, users get access to AI portfolio management, which focuses on finding the \"next best thing\" in the crypto market before anyone else does.\nWhales are super pumped because Unilabs revealed they'll send 30% of all the fees straight back to anyone holding the UNIL crypto coin. The more you hold, the bigger your slice gets. As a result, over 1.8B UNIL tokens have been bought so far. This crypto coin is worth $0.0097, but this value will hit $0.0108 after the seventh round begins. This 11% growth is just the tip of the iceberg since a Tier-1 CEX will soon list UNIL - triggering a price spike.\nCrypto GEMs: The Price of SOL May Hit $1,000\nSolana (SOL) is one of the best cryptos and it has seen some good movement. CoinMarketCap indicates that the price of SOL has increased from approximately $165 to over $185 in the past seven days. In other words, Solana shot up nearly 15% in just one week.\nMarket analyst Crypto GEMs also excited traders with his Solana price prediction. According to his X post, the price of SOL is now following a rising channel. If it continues to do so, Crypto GEMs predicts that Solana may be valued at over $1,000 by 2026.\nThe technical analysis also supports this Solana price prediction. Notably, TradingView indicates that the momentum indicator is currently at 21, suggesting that this uptrend is strengthening. While the price of SOL may soar soon, whales are turning to Unilabs (UNIL) as it has a smaller market cap, which means faster price gains.\nThe Shiba Inu Price Looks Ready To Move\nAs one of the meme coin titans, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has also experienced some growth. According to CMC data, the Shiba Inu price increased by nearly 10% on the one-week chart. During that period, the value of SHIB increased from approximately $0.000012 to over $0.000013.\nPeople are also keeping an eye on Shiba Inu (SHIB) thanks to some bullish statements from prominent analysts. For instance, Shib Knight made an X post saying that the Shiba Inu price is now testing the 1553 downtrend line. If it manages to break out, the value of SHIB could soar to $0.000033 or even $0.000045.\nTradingView shows some bullish signs too. For example, its momentum indicator also sits at 0.00000154, which indicates this Shiba Inu price trend is accelerating. Although this Shiba Inu price prediction has made some waves, many whales who are more interested in utility are now focusing on Unilabs (UNIL).\nWhy Is Unilabs (UNIL) More Appealing to Whales Than Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB)?\nEven though the price of SOL and the Shiba Inu price are looking like they wanna lift off, whales are putting their cash in Unilabs (UNIL) right now. This could be because Unilabs is in the perfect spot to capitalize on the growth of the AI market, which Grand View Research predicts will be valued at $1.8 trillion by 2030.\nIf it does, the long-term growth potential as well as stability will make UNIL a more favorable option than Solana and Shiba Inu.

{"title": "Is Investing $1K in XRP and ADA Worth It? Here is Why Experts Think New AI Coin Unilabs (UNIL) Has More Upside", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/is-investing-1k-in-xrp-and-ada-worth-it-here-is-why-experts-think-new-ai-coin-unilabs-unil-has-more-upside", "text": "If you are on your last $1,000, the XRP price might be too high and the ADA coin might not be worth it at the current market size. Meanwhile, experts are optimistic that Unilabs Finance (UNIL) is the best DeFi token to invest in this year. Alongside its decentralized feature, it intersects with traditional finance and AI and is teeming with potential as a presale token.\nIs the Current XRP Price a Good Entry?\nThe XRP price hovers above $3.1 at the time of writing, recording an 8% gain over the past week. Despite the slight decline from its monthly peak price of $3.6, the bulls maintain the $3.0 support, presenting an optimistic outlook.\nHowever, momentum has been declining, as highlighted by the 5% decrease in daily trading volume to $5.5 billion. At the same time, technical indicators signal a potential downturn in the XRP price. Losing the $3.0 support might spell doom, with experts predicting a significant downswing below $2.5.\nHence, the current XRP price might not be a good entry, considering the fear of a pullback. Nevertheless, for long-term investors seeking modest gains, the payment-based cryptocurrency might be a good pick. With the SEC lawsuit officially settled and an XRP ETF in plans, it is an altcoin worth keeping on the radar.\nIs the ADA Coin Overvalued?\nWith a market size of $28 billion, saying the ADA coin is overvalued isn’t a stretch. As the 10th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, it has little room to run, prompting investors to seek other high-potential altcoins.\nAt $0.8 following a 15% gain on the monthly chart, the ADA coin is en route to $1.0. Regaining its 30-day high of $0.92 will set the stage for a breakout and a potential retest of its 2021 ATH of $3.0. While the price outlook might be optimistic for large-volume investors and institutions, the Layer-1 coin isn’t as compelling for retailers.\nNevertheless, the token trading volume has exploded by 135% over the past month to $44.5 billion and fees by 45% to $305,000, signaling adoption of the smart contract platform. While the ADA coin might not be the best DeFi token to invest in for substantial gain, it is nonetheless a good option for modest returns.\nUnilabs Finance (UNIL) — Are Experts Right to Consider It the Best DeFi Token to Invest In?\nUnilabs Finance (UNIL) has been the talk of the crypto community for several reasons, notably its upside potential and intriguing blend of AI, DeFi and TradFi. As an emerging and presale token, a 415% gain is projected on the launch date at the listing price of $0.05.\nAdditionally, given its AI integration, experts have drawn a parallel with FET, a protocol with a $1.7 billion market size. However, it is tipped to outperform courtesy of its staking and governance features, as well as yield-sharing. Compared to other protocols, this AI-backed asset manager will distribute 30% of the fees generated by the platforms to users.\nMeanwhile, it boasts over $30 million in AUM, spread across four flagship funds: BTC, AI, Mining and RWA. Attracting just 0.1% of the traditional hedge fund capital could exponentially increase its value, positioning it as the best DeFi token to invest in this year.\nClosing Thoughts\nPrimed to explode amid interest from everyday users and crypto enthusiasts, the UNIL token is significantly discounted at $0.0097 in the sixth ICO stage. It is considered the best DeFi token to invest in and a better alternative to the ADA coin due to its upside potential and bullish narrative. Underpriced compared to the XRP coin, early funding surpassing $12.5 million isn’t surprising.\nFor more information about Unilabs Finance (UNIL) visit the links below:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "XDC Network Breaks $300M Staking Barrier Amid SEC’s Supportive PoS Regulatory Stance.", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/xdc-network-breaks-300m-staking-barrier-amid-secs-supportive-pos-regulatory-stance", "text": "XDC Network has emerged as one of the most closely watched blockchain platforms in 2025, breaking through the $300 million mark in total staked value at a time when regulatory clarity is beginning to favor proof-of-stake (PoS) ecosystems. The milestone solidifies XDC’s status as one of the top six PoS networks on CoinMarketCap and underscores the growing appeal of its hybrid, enterprise-oriented blockchain model.\nRegulatory Winds Shift in Favour of PoS\nIn recent remarks, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a distinction that the crypto industry has long sought: participating in or operating a PoS network is not inherently a securities transaction. While the agency maintained that certain token sales or reward structures could still trigger securities regulations depending on their design, the acknowledgement that PoS consensus itself is not a security has been widely interpreted as a green light for validator participation.\nFor the XDC Network, where validators are essential to maintaining scalability, security, and governance, this represents a strategic tailwind. Institutional stakeholders, once hesitant due to regulatory ambiguity, now see greater scope for involvement without the looming threat of enforcement targeting the staking model itself.\nBreaking Down the $300M+ Locked Value\nData from XDC’s Masternode dashboard indicates 2,660,802,298 XDC are currently staked via active masternodes and delegated pools. At the current market price of $0.092 per token, that stake is valued at approximately $245 million USD.\nBeyond validator staking, the ecosystem has expanded into DeFi and liquid staking solutions. DeFiLlama reports an additional ~142.39 million XDC (around $13.1 million USD) locked in protocols enabling yield farming, lending, and other capital-efficient strategies. Platforms such as PrimeStaking now lead the segment, with over $6 million in locked value.\nTaken together — and factoring in staking via centralized exchanges and wallet-based programs — the total locked value comfortably exceeds $300 million USD, representing a significant portion of the circulating supply.\nThe Economics of XDC Staking\nAccording to StakingRewards.com, XDC currently offers an estimated 10% annual percentage rate (APR) for validators. A masternode requires a locked stake of 10 million XDC (about 874,740 USD), generating roughly 1 million XDC annually, or 874,740 USD per year in rewards, equivalent to just over $8,000 per month.\nDelegated staking allows participants with smaller holdings to earn proportionate rewards by supporting established validators. For risk-managed investors, this creates an accessible entry point without the operational requirements of running a node.\nHosting a Masternode: Step-by-Step\nFor investors considering the full validator route, the onboarding process is straightforward but requires technical readiness and capital commitment:\n-\nAcquire 10 Million XDC — Store in XDC compatible wallet.\n-\nAccess the Masternode Portal — Review setup guidelines and network requirements here.\n-\nComplete KYC — Submit identification for compliance with governance standards.\n-\nConnect Your Node — Link the masternode’s coinbase address to your wallet.\n-\nLock the Stake — Confirm the transaction to activate candidacy.\n-\nMaintain Performance — Ensure uptime and reliability for uninterrupted rewards.\nLiquid Staking and DeFi Expansion\nXDC’s liquid staking infrastructure allows users to maintain staking rewards while receiving tokenized representations of their locked assets, which can then be deployed across DeFi platforms. This dual-layer approach enables strategies such as:\n-\nYield farming with staked tokens\n-\nUsing staked assets as collateral for loans\n-\nParticipating in liquidity pools without forfeiting validator rewards\nThe integration of staking and DeFi broadens the utility of XDC, attracts yield-focused participants, and increases overall capital efficiency.\nEnterprise-First Blockchain Model\nUnlike many PoS projects that began with retail speculation and later pivoted to institutional use cases, XDC was designed from the outset for enterprise-grade applications. Its hybrid architecture merges the transparency of public blockchains with the privacy controls of permissioned ledgers, enabling adoption in:\n-\nTrade finance digitization\n-\nReal-world asset tokenization\n-\nRegulated asset exchanges\nPartnerships in these areas have bolstered XDC’s credibility among institutional actors while maintaining accessibility for the retail market through listings on exchanges such as Binance.US, KuCoin, Bitstamp, and Gate.io.\nCrossing the $300 million locked value threshold signals more than just strong network participation — it reflects deep capital commitment, reinforced by regulatory clarity, competitive yield, and real-world use cases. As tokenization of assets gains momentum and blockchain integration deepens in global trade and finance, XDC’s combination of yield generation and enterprise adoption positions it as a compelling player in the PoS landscape.\nFor both institutional and retail participants, the XDC Network’s growth trajectory suggests that its staking economy is not merely an income opportunity but a stake in the infrastructure shaping the next phase of blockchain adoption.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "From Tokens to Access: How Web3 and Mirror Links Are Reshaping Digital Freedom", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/from-tokens-to-access-how-web3-and-mirror-links-are-reshaping-digital-freedom", "text": "For years, “Web3” has been synonymous with speculation—an ecosystem dominated by NFTs, memecoins, and volatility. But beneath the noise of token trading and decentralized finance hype, a quieter, more revolutionary movement is taking root. One that’s less about wealth—and more about access.\nIn places where digital repression is the norm and online platforms bend to state control, the technologies that underpin Web3—blockchains, decentralized storage, peer-to-peer protocols—are merging with another unlikely ally: mirror links. Together, they are laying the foundation for a freer internet—one that resists censorship not through protest, but through architecture.\nWelcome to the next frontier of digital freedom, where tokens don’t just represent value—they represent entry.\nWeb3's Unintended Superpower\nThe first wave of Web3 was about ownership—owning your assets, your identity, your data. But in censored markets—from Iran and Myanmar to Russia and parts of Sub-Saharan Africa—Web3 is taking on a more urgent mission: keeping the internet open when the walls close in.\nAt the core of this evolution is decentralization. Web3 technologies are inherently resistant to control because they operate outside traditional gatekeepers. Smart contracts don’t live on corporate servers. DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) don’t respond to government subpoenas. And decentralized applications (dApps) don’t vanish when an app store delists them.\nThis matters because censorship today is less about outright bans and more about chokepoints: app removals, domain blocks, surveillance, and payment restrictions. Web3 rebuilds the web from the ground up without those chokepoints.\nMirror Links: The Bridge Between Old and New\nWhile Web3 provides the backend resistance, mirror links offer the frontline access. These are alternate URLs—clones or proxies—that replicate a blocked website’s content on a different domain. Frequently used in regions where authorities block popular news outlets, social platforms, or even crypto exchanges, mirror links are an old trick with new relevance. And when these mirror links are paired with Web3 infrastructure, they become even more powerful.\nFor example:\n-\nA mirror link can point to a dApp frontend hosted on IPFS, making the site immune to takedowns.\n-\nDecentralized domains (like those registered through ENS or Handshake) can be used as mirror destinations, bypassing centralized DNS entirely.\n-\nUsers can receive real-time updates of working mirrors via encrypted Web3 messaging protocols like XMTP or Lens.\nDigital Identity and Permissionless Access\nTraditional internet access is increasingly tied to identity—phone numbers, SIM registration, KYC, IP tracking. In censored countries, this can lead to blanket surveillance or targeted harassment. Web3 disrupts this through self-sovereign identity (SSI) models. Users authenticate via cryptographic wallets, not real-world documents.\nIn this new model:\n-\nA user in Iran can access an educational dApp without revealing their name or location.\n-\nA journalist in Russia can publish investigative content to IPFS via a DAO, using a pseudonymous Ethereum address.\n-\nA citizen in Ethiopia can receive stablecoin remittances tied to a wallet—not a bank.\nThis kind of permissionless participation is impossible in Web2 environments, where every access point is controlled. In Web3, your wallet is your passport—and no one can cancel it.\nCensorship Resistance by Design\nWeb3 apps don't just operate differently; they resist differently. Here’s how:\n-\nContent Hosting on IPFS and Arweave: Instead of a server, data is stored across a distributed network. Censoring one node does nothing.\n-\nDecentralized Frontends: Tools like Fleek or Skynet allow websites to deploy on decentralized hosts, making mirror creation automatic.\n-\nDNS Alternatives: ENS (.eth) and Handshake (.hns) domains live on blockchains, immune to seizure by ICANN or local ISPs.\n-\nToken-Gated Access: Some platforms use NFTs or tokens as keys to gated services—bypassing traditional login systems and surveillance traps.\nEven when governments block access to crypto or dApp services, VPNs, browser extensions, and rotating mirror URLs keep the doors open.\nReal-World Adoption: Quiet but Growing\nWhile many in the West debate regulatory frameworks, users in restricted environments are already adopting Web3 out of necessity—not choice.\n-\nIn Nigeria, P2P stablecoin markets are thriving among freelancers and students facing inflation and fintech crackdowns.\n-\nIn China, developers experiment with blockchain-based publishing tools to preserve censored stories and whistleblower reports.\n-\nIn Ukraine and Venezuela, DAOs have become fundraising tools to bypass banking restrictions and coordinate aid.\nIn these cases, tokens become tools, and mirror links become lifelines.\nRisks, Challenges, and the Road Ahead\nOf course, this isn’t a utopia. Web3 comes with risks—rug pulls, scams, UX friction, and government pushback. Tools like IPFS are still too technical for most users. Wallet recovery remains a pain point. And mirror links, while useful, can be short-lived without constant maintenance.\nBut the direction is clear: access is becoming decentralized. Where the old internet fails under pressure, the new one bends and adapts. Where content is blocked, it’s mirrored. Where users are tracked, they are anonymized. Where speech is banned, it is tokenized and distributed.\nConclusion: A New Internet for the Next Billion\nWeb3 is no longer just about speculation or protocol upgrades. It’s becoming a humanitarian technology stack—a way to bring connectivity, agency, and financial freedom to people who’ve been locked out of the traditional web.\nIn the new paradigm, mirror links are more than circumvention tools. They’re bridges.\nTokens are more than speculative assets. They’re passports.\nAnd Web3 is more than an evolution. It’s a reclamation—of access, autonomy, and voice.\nAs censorship grows more subtle and more technical, so too must the resistance.\nAnd right now, that resistance is being coded into the very fabric of the decentralized web.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Gear Up to Move, But This Competitor Meme Coin Is Already Up 80%", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/dogecoin-doge-and-shiba-inu-shib-gear-up-to-move-but-this-competitor-meme-coin-is-already-up-80", "text": "The meme coin market is heating up again, with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) showing early signs of momentum after weeks of sideways action. Yet while the world’s two most famous meme coins prepare for possible breakouts, an upstart competitor — Little Pepe (LILPEPE) — has already surged 80% in its presale and is drawing heavy attention as the next big thing in the sector.\nDogecoin Price Outlook: Recovery Attempts Underway\nDogecoin has spent much of the past two weeks consolidating around the $0.20 level after a 16% drop from July highs. While the decline rattled some holders, technical indicators suggest DOGE could be attempting a rebound. On the daily chart, DOGE recently broke out from the upper trendline of a falling wedge — a formation that often signals trend reversals. However, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains in slightly negative territory, showing that bullish momentum is still weak. Although the histogram bars are shrinking, which suggests the bearish momentum is waning, the MACD is also struggling to enter positive territory. Should DOGE maintain its position above $0.20 and break resistance at $0.24, the next target for traders could be the $0.26 region. Selling pressure could lead DOGE to $0.17, which is a critical support zone. Breaching this level could trigger a deeper corrective phase.\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Technical Setup: Cup & Handle Points to 36% Rally\nShiba Inu has quietly formed a bullish Cup & Handle pattern on its daily chart, a setup that could pave the way for a significant upside move. Currently trading around $0.00001274, SHIB is approaching its breakout resistance at $0.00001710. If buyers push through this level with strong volume, SHIB could rally to $0.0000239 — a gain of over 36% from current prices. A double Bottom pattern, another reversal signal that strengthens the case for a breakout, adds to the bullish picture. Momentum indicators are tilting in SHIB’s favor, with RSI holding steady and volume picking up. The key level to watch is $0.0000103 — a breakdown here would invalidate the bullish pattern and potentially send SHIB lower.\nThe New Challenger: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Already Up 80%\nWhile DOGE and SHIB holders wait for their next move, Little Pepe has been quietly making waves — and big gains — in its presale. Since launch, LILPEPE’s price has increased from its initial stage to $0.0018, marking an 80% rise before the token has even hit exchanges. LILPEPE isn’t just another meme coin trying to ride the hype. The project is building the world’s first Layer-2 blockchain dedicated entirely to meme coins, aiming to provide:\n-\nUltra-fast, low-cost transactions\n-\nA meme coin launchpad for new projects\n-\nAnti-sniper bot technology to protect fair trading\n-\nA community-driven ecosystem that rewards holders\nWith a total supply of 100 billion tokens and 25 billion allocated to presale buyers, the project is positioning itself for explosive growth when it lists.\nSecurity First: CertiK Audit Score of 95.49%\nOne of LILPEPE's biggest differentiators is its commitment to security — something often overlooked in the meme coin space. The project recently completed a full audit by CertiK, one of the blockchain industry’s most respected security firms.\nThe audit’s results were impressive:\n-\nScore: 95.49%\n-\nNo critical vulnerabilities detected\n-\nSmart contracts built with best-in-class coding practices\n-\nFull compliance with ERC-20 standards\nThis means presale participants and future buyers can confidently interact with LILPEPE, knowing its code has been vetted at the highest level.\nPresale Stage 9: Almost Sold Out\nAs of now, LILPEPE is in Stage 9 of its presale:\n-\nPrice: $0.0018 (Next Stage: $0.0019)\n-\nFunds Raised: $15,647,250 / $16,475,000\n-\nTokens Sold: 10,790,138,577 / 11,250,000,000 (95.91% sold)\nWith less than 5% of this stage’s allocation left, demand is pushing the project toward its next price increase. Early investors are positioning ahead of the token’s planned listing on two top-tier centralized exchanges, with hints at targeting the biggest exchange in the world post-launch.\nWhy LILPEPE Could Outpace DOGE and SHIB in 2025\nDOGE and SHIB have established themselves as meme coin leaders, but their massive market caps make 100x returns much harder to achieve. In contrast, LILPEPE’s low entry price, small initial market cap, and strong fundamentals give it far more upside potential.\nKey reasons LILPEPE could dominate this cycle:\n1. First-mover advantage as a Layer-2 chain built for meme coins.\n2. Utility + Hype — combining meme appeal with real blockchain infrastructure.\n3. Top-tier security validated by CertiK.\n4. High community engagement through giveaways and presale events.\n5. Exchange-ready with confirmed CEX listings at launch.\nIf meme coin market conditions mirror past bull runs, LILPEPE’s fundamentals could make it the cycle’s breakout star, like SHIB was in 2021 and BONK in late 2023.\nThe Bottom Line\nWhile both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have the potential for short-term price spikes, their price growth potential is not as promising as that of up-and-coming projects.

{"title": "Crypto Price Analysis 8-11: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, TONCOIN: TON, INJECTIVE: INJ", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/crypto-price-analysis-8-11-bitcoin-btc-ethereum-eth-solana-sol-toncoin-ton-injective-inj", "text": "The crypto market’s weekend rally extended into Monday as Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies traded in bullish territory. The flagship cryptocurrency’s price action turned bullish on Sunday, surging past a crucial resistance level and breaking past $120,000 early on Monday.\nThe rally can be attributed to the convergence of several bullish catalysts, including surging ETF inflows, expectations of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve, and a bullish flag pattern. BTC is up nearly 3% over the past 24 hours, trading around $121,655 after reaching an intraday high of $121,981.\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) broke the $4,000 barrier over the weekend, with analysts expecting a new all-time high. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has rallied, rising nearly 23% last week, and is up almost 2% in the past 24 hours, trading around $4,300. Ripple (XRP) is marginally up while Solana (SOL) reclaimed $180 over the weekend and is trading around $185, with buyers in control. Cardano (ADA) is marginally up, while Chainlink (LINK) is up almost 4%, trading around $22. Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable increases. However, Toncoin (TON) and Stellar (XLM) defined market trends and traded in the red.\nWhite House Crypto Advisor Bo Hines Resigns\nBo Hines, head of President Donald Trump’s Council of Advisors on Digital Assets, has resigned from his role to return to the private sector. Hines played a crucial role in American crypto regulation, with the sudden and unexpected departure fueling speculations about the reasons behind his resignation. Hines confirmed his resignation through a post on X, and called his experience of working with President Trump and Crypto Czar David Sacks “the honor of a lifetime.” Hines praised their efforts in making the US the “crypto capital of the world” and pledged to support the industry from the private sector.\n“Serving in President Trump’s administration and working alongside our brilliant AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks as Executive Director of the White House Crypto Council has been the honor of a lifetime. Together, we have positioned America as the crypto capital of the world. I’m deeply grateful to the industry for its unwavering support.”\nHines did not give any specific reasons for stepping down, while reactions from the community ranged from admiration to surprise. Some sources speculated that a lucrative private sector opportunity could have prompted Hines to resign.\nCrypto Debanking Is Still Happening\nSeveral crypto firms are still facing account closures and denial of banking services under the pretext of de-risking. The crypto community believes the ongoing debanking policy, called “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” is a policy-driven effort to undermine and suppress the growth of digital assets. The crypto industry believed debanking would become a thing of the past following President Trump’s election victory. Trump campaigned on the promise of a crypto-friendly administration, and several early policy moves indicated a friendly attitude towards crypto compared to the previous administration. This led many to believe restrictions on crypto would gradually ease.\nHowever, recent incidents suggest crypto debanking is still occurring. Andreessen Horowitz partner Alex Rampell warned that banks were squeezing crypto and fintech apps, calling it “Operation Chokepoint 3.0.” According to Rampell, banks are hiking fees to access account data or transfer funds to crypto platforms like Robinhood and Coinbase. Alex Konanykhin, CEO of Unicoin, echoed these concerns, adding that US banks were closing accounts for crypto firms without explanation. Konanykhin stated,\n“We know about it first-hand, as Unicoin and its subsidiaries have been de-banked, without explanations, by several banks.”\nVitalik Buterin Reclaims On-Chain Billionaire Status\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has reclaimed his on-chain billionaire status after ETH surged past the $4,000 mark over the weekend. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency last reached this level over eight months ago. Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham stated,\n“BREAKING: VITALIK BUTERIN IS NOW AN ON-CHAIN BILLIONAIRE AGAIN.”\nButerin’s portfolio is valued at $1.04 billion and holds 240,042 ETH, along with stakes in several other digital assets, including Aave Ethereum (AETHWETH), WhiteRock (WHITE), Moo Deng (MOODENG), and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).\nWorld Liberty Financial Exploring Public Company To Hold WLFI\nWorld Liberty Financial is exploring the creation of a publicly-traded company to hold its WLFI tokens. The company is looking to raise roughly $1.5 billion for the venture. According to reports, the deal's structure is yet to be finalized. However, World Liberty Financial has already reached out to major investors in technology and crypto. The move puts World Liberty Financial among a growing list of publicly-listed crypto treasury companies. Treasury companies have raised around $79 billion in 2025 for Bitcoin (BTC) purchases alone.\nAccording to reports, the new treasury vehicle will be a shell company listed on the Nasdaq. World Liberty Financial’s approach mirrors Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which reinvented itself as a Bitcoin (BTC) holding company. Strategy has amassed over $72 billion in BTC and has reached a market cap of $113 billion.\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\nBitcoin (BTC) has started the week on a bullish note as the flagship cryptocurrency surged past the $120,000 mark. Price action stalled on Friday when BTC fell 0.83% and slipped below $116,000 on Saturday, settling at $115,957. However, with positive macroeconomic developments, surging ETF inflows, and growing optimism about a rate cut, the price recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 3% to cross $119,000. Bullish sentiment has persisted during the ongoing session, with the price up over 2%, trading around $122,000. Analysts believe BTC could set a new all-time high if buyers maintain positive momentum.\nAnalysts believe a move past $120,000 was only a matter of time, and prices could reach a new all-time high if positive momentum persists. BTC’s latest rally is attributed to a bullish executive order in Washington and rising inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Henrik Andersson, Chief Investment Officer at Apollo Crypto, believes a rally was long overdue following a period of consolidation.\n“In our view, it was just a matter of time before it would break up. In this time, we have seen positive ETF flows, more treasury companies buying Bitcoin, and a number of positive developments coming out of the White House. Bitcoin has been stuck in a low-volatility band between $115,000 and $120,000 despite all the good news.”\nAndersson credited President Trump’s executive order allowing crypto in 401(k) retirement accounts as the key driver of the rally. The executive order could see around $9 trillion in capital flow into BTC and the broader crypto industry. Michael Saylor’s announcement about an impending BTC buy has also boosted investor sentiment. Saylor hinted that Strategy is preparing to add to its BTC stash this week, stating,\n“If you don’t stop buying Bitcoin, you won’t stop making Money.”\nBitcoin ETFs continued to see inflows, purchasing $773 million worth of BTC to close the previous week. Despite the flagship cryptocurrency’s impressive rally, on-chain data shows that sentiment isn’t overheated, indicating there is room for further price increases. The Fear & Greed Index is still in the “Greed” zone, at 70 out of 100.\nAnalysts believe BTC could reach a new all-time high this week as a bullish flag pattern activates. A bullish flag pattern often precedes a major breakout. The pattern began on July 22, bottoming out below $100,000 and peaking at an all-time high of $123,091. Investors are also bullish about a possible rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. Odds of a rate cut soared after the US released weak nonfarm payroll data earlier this month.\nBTC registered a sharp decline on Friday (August 1), dropping over 2% and settling at $113,365. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 0.67% and settled at $112,601. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Sunday, rising 1.52% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,307. The price continued pushing higher on Monday, registering a 0.69% increase and settling at $115,097. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $112,707 on Tuesday as selling pressure returned. It rebounded from this level to reclaim $114,000 and settled at $114,139, ultimately dropping 0.83%. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.80% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,047.\nSource: TradingView\nBullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $117,000 and settle at $117,483. Despite the positive sentiment, the price lost momentum on Friday, dropping nearly 1% to $116,513. Sellers retained control on Saturday as BTC fell 0.48% and settled at $115,957. Bullish sentiment returned on Sunday as BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $119,000 and settle at $119,046. The current session sees BTC up almost 2%, trading around $121,100 after reaching an intraday high of $122,190.\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\nEthereum (ETH) raced past the $4,000 level, retaking it after eight months as bullish sentiment around the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency intensified. ETH has been on an upward trajectory since last weekend, rebounding from an intraday low of $3,372. ETH’s stellar recovery prompted BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes to buy back into the asset only a week after selling 2,373 ETH for $8.32 million. Hayes moved $10.5 million in USDC across several transactions, redirecting it towards purchasing ETH.\nHayes had warned of a possible drop in BTC and ETH prices last week, thanks to mounting macroeconomic pressures. The BitMEX founder cited renewed tariff fears following weak nonfarm payrolls numbers, adding that sluggish growth could push BTC and ETH towards $100,000 and $3,000, respectively.\nETH has surged nearly 24% this week, reaching an intraday high of $4,347 earlier today. According to one analyst, the price could surge to $4,000 as it breaks out of its current pattern. The analyst stated that ETH had been accumulating for months and steadily absorbing selling pressure. According to the Wyckoff theory, such a phase generally ends with a decisive breakout. Meanwhile, analysts Crypto Rover and Titan of Crypto believe ETH is breaking above the upper trendline of a multi-year symmetrical triangle and suggested it could climb to $8,000 in the coming months.\nInstitutional interest in ETH has also surged since July, with institutions and whales scooping up over 1,032 million ETH worth $4.7 billion through exchanges and institutional trading platforms.\n“In the month since July 10, more than 1.035 million ETH ($4.167 billion) have been hoarded by multiple unknown whales/institutions through channels such as exchanges or institutional business platforms. The price of ETH also rose from $2,600 to $4,000 in this month, a 45% increase.”\nETH started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 6% and settling at $3,488. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 3%, slipping below $3,400 to $3,393. ETH recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to reclaim $3,500. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price rallied, rising over 6% to cross $3,700 and settle at $3,721. ETH was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping nearly 3% to $3,612. It rebounded on Wednesday, rising over 2% and settling at $3,685.\nSource: TradingView\nBullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH rose over 6% to reclaim $3,900 and settle at $3,911. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency crossed the $4,000 mark on Friday, rising 2.52% and settling at $4,010. ETH rallied on Saturday, rising over 6% to cross $4,200 and settle at $4,262. Despite the overwhelming positive sentiment, ETH lost momentum on Sunday, registering a marginal drop and settling at $4,251. The current session sees ETH up nearly 1%, trading around $4,280.\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\nSolana (SOL) continued pushing higher over the weekend, crossing $180 as buyers maintained control. The altcoin has been steadily rising since last week as institutional interest around the asset grows. SOL is up over 12% in the past week, breaking out of key technical structures. Analysts predict a push towards $200 this week if buyers maintain control. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified a textbook “cup and handle” pattern and predicted a 600% increase from current levels. However, more conservative estimates predict SOL will test its all-time high of $260. Whether buyers have the strength to take the price beyond this level remains to be seen. Institutional interest in SOL has also ramped up, with Upexi, DeFi Developments Corp, SOL Strategies, and Torrent Capital acquiring over 3.5 million SOL, marking one of the strongest accumulation waves in SOL’s history.\nSOL started the previous weekend with a sharp drop, falling nearly 6% on Friday and settling at $162. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell 2.57%, slipping below $160 and settling at $158. It recovered on Sunday, rising over 2% to reclaim $160 and settle at $162. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as SOL rallied, rising nearly 5% to settle at $169. The price was back in bearish territory on Tuesday, falling 3% to $164. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as SOL rose 2.50% and settled at $168.\nSource: TradingView\nBullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as SOL rallied, rising over 4% to cross $170 and settle at $175. Buyers retained control on Friday as the price rose 0.79% and settled at $176. Price action remained bullish over the weekend as SOL rose nearly 2% on Saturday and 2.72% on Sunday to reclaim $180 and settle at $182. The current session sees SOL marginally up, trading around $183 after reaching an intraday high of $186.\nToncoin (TON) Price Analysis\nToncoin (TON) faced substantial volatility last weekend as buyers and sellers struggled to exert influence. As a result, it fell to an intraday low of $3.35 on Friday (August 1), reached an intraday high of $3.71, before settling at $3.57, ultimately rising 0.79%. The price reached an intraday high of $3.72 on Saturday before losing momentum, falling 0.94% to $3.53. Buyers and sellers struggled to establish control on Sunday as volatility persisted. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price rose 0.75% to $3.56. TON was back in the red on Monday, dropping over 4% to $3.41. Bearish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price fell nearly 7% to $3.19.\nSource: TradingView\nDespite the overwhelming selling pressure, TON recovered on Wednesday, rising almost 4% and settling at $3.31. The price fell to an intraday low of $3.22 on Thursday. However, it rebounded from this level to settle at $3.36, ultimately rising 0.86%. TON registered a marginal drop on Friday but was back in positive territory on Saturday, reaching an intraday high of $3.47 before settling at $3.39, a 1.66% increase. Selling pressure returned on Sunday as the price fell 1.24% to $3.34. The current session sees TON up nearly 1%, trading around $3.37.\nInjective (INJ) Price Analysis\nInjective (INJ) registered a sharp drop on Friday (August 1), falling over 5% to $12.57. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 2.99% to $12.19. Despite the selling pressure, INJ recovered on Sunday, rising 6.55% to end the weekend at $12.99. Bullish sentiment persisted on Monday as INJ rose over 5% to cross $13 and settle at $13.65. The price was back in bearish territory on Tuesday, falling 5.42% to $12.91. INJ faced volatility on Wednesday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal increase.\nSource: TradingView\nBullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as INJ rallied, rising 8.50% to cross $14 and settle at $14.04. The price registered a marginal increase on Friday and rose over 3% on Saturday to settle at $14.54.

While the change will take time to implement, the move is fueling optimism among investors and could serve as a major accelerant for long-term adoption.\nAs market adoption increases and competition for attention intensifies, high-quality PR becomes a key growth driver. This article highlights how Outset PR leverages data-backed strategies to deliver results with lasting impact.\nThe Catalyst: Laying the Groundwork for Crypto in 401(k) Plans\nIn early August, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing regulators to expand access to alternative investments such as cryptocurrencies and privately held companies within 401(k) retirement accounts.\nU.S. 401(k) plans currently manage an estimated $8.9 trillion in assets, making the policy a potentially huge channel for future crypto inflows. However, the order does not make crypto investments available immediately.\nWhile some asset managers already offer limited crypto exposure via specialized funds, full-scale inclusion in 401(k)s will depend on forthcoming regulatory updates and employer adoption.\nImmediate Market Reaction\nDespite the timeline for implementation, the market reacted swiftly:\n-\nBitcoin (BTC) rose over 3% intraday, hitting $122,000—just shy of its July 14 all-time high of $123,091.\n-\nMicroStrategy (MSTR), with its large Bitcoin holdings, rallied on the news.\n-\nCoinbase (COIN) saw gains on expectations of long-term retail inflows and higher trading activity.\nThe bullish response reflects both the symbolic impact of policy recognition and the market’s tendency to price in future demand.\nMacro Tailwinds Boosting the Rally\nThe policy news landed in a favorable macroeconomic environment:\n-\nWeaker U.S. Dollar – The dollar eased ahead of key inflation data and a looming U.S.–China tariff decision.\n-\nRate Cut Expectations – Growing bets on potential Federal Reserve rate cuts boosted appetite for risk assets.\n-\nGlobal Liquidity Conditions – Improved liquidity across financial markets supported speculative flows into crypto.\nTogether, these factors amplified the positive sentiment generated by the executive order.\nTechnical Outlook: ATH in Sight\nBitcoin’s chart remains decisively bullish:\n-\nPrice reclaimed $120,000, now acting as short-term support.\n-\nRising volumes confirm strong conviction among buyers.\n-\nRSI levels are elevated but not yet flashing classic overheating signals for a rally phase.\nA clean break above $123,091 could unlock the next targets between $130,000 and $135,000, where psychological levels and Fibonacci projections align.\nRiding Market Trends with Precision: The Outset PR Edge\nIn a market where adoption is growing and competition for attention is intensifying, high-quality PR is no longer optional—it’s a growth driver. Navigating the crypto narrative without the right tools can feel like driving a foggy road without headlights. Outset PR changes that, using data-backed strategies drawn from both retrospective and real-time metrics to produce results with lasting impact.\nRather than relying on vague promises, Outset PR delivers concrete plans with:\n-\nperfect publication timing\n-\nnarratives built around product–market fit\n-\nperformance-based media selection.\nEvery campaign is tailored to a client’s specific goals, budget, and growth stage—far from the cookie-cutter packages common in the industry.\nIts proprietary traffic acquisition technology fuses organic editorial placements with SEO and lead generation, enabling brands to appear in high-discovery surfaces and multiply traffic compared to conventional PR.\nOutset PR also runs an internal media analytics desk to track outlet performance by domain activity, visibility shifts, audience geography, and traffic sources—publishing industry reports that help clients stay ahead of trends.\nBy aligning visibility strategies with market momentum—whether it’s Bitcoin nearing an all-time high or an altcoin entering a breakout phase—Outset PR ensures that its clients don’t just ride the wave; they’re positioned where the wave is highest.\nConclusion\nBitcoin’s rally toward its all-time high is powered by both regulatory optimism and a supportive macro backdrop. While the 401(k) development will take time to translate into real investment flows, it signals a notable shift in U.S. policy toward digital assets.\nIn parallel, the evolving competitive landscape in crypto makes strategic PR a critical tool for amplifying opportunities. Firms like Outset PR show how data-driven, trend-aware campaigns can turn market developments into lasting visibility and measurable business outcomes.\nYou can find more information about Outset PR here:\nWebsite: outsetpr.io\nTelegram: t.me/outsetpr\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Kaspa Price Prediction Gains Interest but Bitcoin Swift Attracts More Stage 4 Buyers", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/kaspa-price-prediction-gains-interest-but-bitcoin-swift-attracts-more-stage-4-buyers", "text": "Kaspa price prediction gains interest across the market, but the real conversation is where the next wave of wealth creation will come from. The crowd wants systems that pay for participation, not just patience. That spotlight is drifting toward a new engine built to share growth with its users.\nKaspa price prediction gains interest\nKaspa has been garnering attention lately, particularly with forecasts painting a mixed but intriguing picture for its next moves. Some analysts see it breaking past the $0.24 mark in the short term, while more ambitious projections stretch toward $0.30 by year’s end. Long-term predictions are even bolder, with some placing Kaspa over $0.50 within the next two years if market conditions align.\nThat said, the road isn’t without its bumps. Volatility and shifting macro conditions mean these targets could be tested. While the growth potential is there, Kaspa still faces stiff competition from projects offering richer incentives, faster scaling strategies, and more aggressive liquidity expansion, areas where Bitcoin Swift is making a louder case for investor attention.\nWhy Bitcoin Swift attracts more Stage 4 buyers\nBitcoin Swift, also known as BTC3, is designed as a financial operating system that rewards real usage. Security anchors to Proof of Work, while Proof of Stake seals checkpoints every 100 blocks and directs governance. Zero-knowledge credentials let users prove age or residency without leaking private data. The wealth pitch is simple. Adaptive PoY rewards start from day one and link payouts to activity, so participants share in the growth they help create.\nAI energy efficiency that compounds gains\nThis is where the engine gets exciting. AI oracles watch throughput and energy mix, then tune PoY multipliers so efficient participation earns more. Contracts run inside a WASM environment and include learning agents that improve performance over time. The result is fewer wasted cycles and rewards that follow real demand. That is how a protocol can scale while paying users fairly. You can explore the stack at Bitcoin Swift, and see how efficiency aligns with returns.\nSecurity checks and governance architecture\nCapital wants safety as well as upside. BTC3 has a completed Solidproof Audit and a completed Spywolf Audit, plus team verification through KYC. According to internal sources from the team, they are working on a third security audit with a well known and reputable blockchain firm to ensure user safety and protocol integrity further. Governance starts with AI risk scoring, then quadratic voting weighted by decentralized identity reputation, and an emergency council can veto malicious proposals. Updates roll out on X and major milestones are mirrored on the official BTC3 site.\nBTC3E stablecoin turns activity into daily utility\nBTC3 plans a USD pegged stable token called BTC3E. Users lock BTC3 in collateral vaults to mint BTC3E with an initial collateral ratio near 150%. AI oracles track prices in real time and can trigger liquidations if safety thresholds are breached. Governance can adjust stability fees and oracle sources. That creates a spendable asset for payments and DeFi while keeping value inside the ecosystem, which supports stronger PoY dynamics for long term holders.\nInfluencers say why attention is building\nPlenty of creators are covering the thesis, with detailed reviews that unpack why Bitcoin Swift attracts more Stage 4 buyers.\nStage 4 presale momentum that rewards participation\nInterest is accelerating because programmable PoY rewards are released at the close of each stage, so holders feel the protocol working right away. Insider chatter points to active talks with MEXC, KuCoin, and LBank for listings, which would deepen order books and speed discovery. Liquidity is already strong for a project at this point, an edge that reduces slippage and supports healthier price action on entry and exit. Tap the official hub at Bitcoin Swift to follow along.\n-\nCurrent price: $4\n-\nLaunch price: $15\n-\nStage 4 APY: 106%\n-\nInvestors: over 2100 with more than $580k sold\nThe presale runs for only 64 days and ends on 18 September 2025. Short runway, immediate PoY distributions, and standout liquidity are exactly why Bitcoin Swift attracts more Stage 4 buyers while Kaspa price prediction gains interest.\nConclusion: Bitcoin Swift Gains More Attention Amid Kaspa’s Analysis\nKaspa price prediction gains interest, yet wealth often flows where users are paid to participate. Bitcoin Swift aligns payouts with real usage through AI tuned PoY, serious audits, and a path to daily utility with BTC3E. That mix is why Bitcoin Swift attracts more Stage 4 buyers today.\nFor more information on Bitcoin Swift:\nWebsite: https://bitcoinswift.com\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "New Meme Coin Takes the Spotlight as Shiba Inu (SHIB) Quickly Loses Market Share and Slips in Rankings in 2025", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/new-meme-coin-takes-the-spotlight-as-shiba-inu-shib-quickly-loses-market-share-and-slips-in-rankings-in-2025", "text": "As of writing, a surprising shift is happening in the meme coin universe. In 2025, a new competitor named Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is quickly changing the landscape previously dominated by seasoned breeders like Shiba Inu (SHIB). LILPEPE draws interest from traders, investors, and influencers, while SHIB is fading from its once-glorious position. With a powerful presale nearly concluded, a $777K giveaway live, and a recent listing on CoinMarketCap, this new meme-layer sensation defines what the future of meme coins could look like.\nShiba Inu’s Decline: The Numbers Don’t Lie\nIn early 2025, Shiba Inu held strong in the meme coin rankings, second only to Dogecoin. However, we have seen a consistent downtrend in both market sentiment and share in recent months. As of August 4, 2025, SHIB trades at $0.000013 as of writing, down from prior highs, with a market cap of $7.37 billion and a daily trading volume of around $163 million. Once ranked comfortably within the top 15 cryptocurrencies, SHIB has now slipped to #22 on CoinMarketCap, with its global crypto market share shrinking to just 0.23%. Despite efforts like Shibarium, ShibaSwap upgrades, and token burns, SHIB appears trapped in a cycle of diminishing returns. Its reliance on Layer-1 Ethereum infrastructure means it continues to face high gas fees and scalability limitations—an Achilles’ heel that new-generation meme coins like LILPEPE are exploiting.\nEnter Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin That Builds While Others Fade\nUnlike many meme tokens that merely ride on hype, LILPEPE is building a full ecosystem. Designed as the native token of its own Layer-2 blockchain, LILPEPE blends meme culture with technical fundamentals—offering ultra-low fees, blazing-fast transactions, and a chain specifically engineered for meme coin launches and liquidity. Currently in Stage 9 of its presale, LILPEPE is priced at $0.0018, having already raised $15.6 million out of a $16.475 million target. Over 10.8 billion tokens have been sold out of the 11.25 billion allocated for presale, signaling strong investor demand. With a listing price of $0.003, early participants stand to make significant returns even before full market listing occurs. Adding to the frenzy is a $777,000 giveaway, where ten winners will receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens each. Over 183,000 entries have been recorded, a clear signal of the coin’s growing community and viral appeal.\nA Meme Coin That Passed the Smart Test\nIn a space often plagued by scams and rug pulls, LILPEPE has gone through a smart audit, reinforcing investor trust. The contract is built on the Ethereum (ERC-20) network and features zero taxes on buys and sells, meaning more gains go directly to investors. The tokenomics are transparently structured, with no initial unlock at TGE (Token Generation Event) and a 3-month cliff followed by 5% vesting every 30 days—a setup designed to prevent sudden dumps and ensure long-term price stability.\nLILPEPE’s Ecosystem: Built for the Future, Not Just the Hype\nWhile SHIB remains stuck on Ethereum’s congested Layer-1, LILPEPE is pioneering a new Layer-2 chain built specifically for meme coins. Its roadmap is rich with growth potential:\n-\nLaunch on Top Exchanges & Uniswap\n-\nGoal of $1 Billion Market Cap\n-\nLayer-2 EVM Rollout\n-\nTop 100 CoinMarketCap Ranking Target\nAs of writing, LILPEPE is officially listed on CoinMarketCap, signaling further validation. With its smart blend of narrative and infrastructure, it’s not just aiming to be a meme—it wants to be the platform for memes.\nWhy LILPEPE Is Surging While SHIB Is Slipping\nSeveral critical distinctions explain why LILPEPE is gaining traction:\n-\nTechnical Infrastructure: A custom-built Layer-2 blockchain gives LILPEPE an edge over SHIB’s reliance on Ethereum L1.\n-\nCommunity Momentum: A growing, engaged base of early investors, meme lovers, and airdrop hunters.\n-\nTransparent Tokenomics: Clear vesting schedules, 0% taxes, and anti-dump mechanics make it investor-friendly.\n-\nNarrative Advantage: While SHIB has struggled to maintain its momentum beyond burns and DEXs, LILPEPE has crafted a compelling origin story and roadmap—resonating with both degens and serious traders.\nMeanwhile, SHIB’s lack of innovation and over-reliance on legacy infrastructure has left it vulnerable to newer, faster, and more community-driven competitors.\nThe Bottom Line: Is SHIB Losing Its Legacy to LILPEPE?\nIf current trends hold, LILPEPE could redefine what a meme coin looks like in 2025 and beyond. From its deeply engaging lore and Layer-2 ambitions to its smart contract audit and aggressive community growth strategies, it’s clear this isn’t just another frog meme—it’s a contender for the meme coin crown. With its presale nearing its final stage, and major exchange listings expected post-launch, now might be the last chance for early investors to grab a meaningful position before the price discovery phase kicks in. Don’t sleep on LILPEPE. As SHIB struggles to hold ground, this new meme-layer king may already write the next chapter in meme coin history. Ready to join the green candle ride?

{"title": "MemeCore VS Bitcoin Pepe Battle Ahead of August 13th Listing", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/memecore-vs-bitcoin-pepe-battle-ahead-of-august-13th-listing", "text": "Two meme coins are hurtling toward a showdown, one already proving its worth, the other about to enter the ring for the first time. MemeCore has been on a tear since launch, climbing 35%.\nBut Bitcoin Pepe is staring down a much bigger prize: direct access to Bitcoin’s $2.3 trillion liquidity. For those just tuning in, this is the first meme ICO built on BTC, with LBank joining MEXC and BitMart ahead of its August 13th DEX debut.\nWith over $17m raised at only $0.0458, early whales and fresh-faced investors are bagging Bitcoin Pepe before this historic DEX debut, betting on a launch surge that could rocket the price straight to the moon.\nHit the official website to keep up with the latest updates before August 13th rolls around.\nBitcoin Pepe vs MemeCore – Meme 2.0 from two angles\nMemeCore is courting creators, validators, and meme-token stakers into one economy, with a concept that is simple yet ambitious: make virality measurable, and then make it pay. Since its market debut, M has climbed 35%, and the ecosystem of Meme Vaults, Viral Grants, and staking pools is starting to fill with activity.\nBitcoin Pepe is taking a more radical path. The PEP-20 standard strips away the friction of creating new assets on BTC, leading to a possible explosion of meme tokens, NFTs, and DeFi apps on crypto’s oldest chain. Its upcoming Layer 2 promises Solana-like speed on top of Bitcoin’s security.\nIn short, MemeCore shows that a meme chain can be structured, fair, and self-sustaining. Bitcoin Pepe is betting that a meme chain doesn’t need to be its own chain at all if you can plug into the biggest one on earth.\nWhich meme coin could 100x in the upcoming weeks?\nOn August 13th, Bitcoin Pepe will get its first real stress test when open-market trading begins without presale caps or allocation limits. That’s when the market decides if the hype translates into momentum, and right now, plenty of traders think it will, with only limited tokens left ahead of the big launch.\nThe staking pool offering 15,000% APY on 1.5 million tokens sold out in a flash, suggesting serious appetite for yield inside the BPEP ecosystem. Partnerships have been stacking up fast, instantly plugging BPEP into a huge, active audience.\nBeyond this, macro is working in its favor: Standard Chartered is eyeing $200k BTC in the months ahead. This rising tide could lift the entire Bitcoin ecosystem and BPEP is small enough to move dramatically if demand spikes. With hype this thick, 100x doesn’t feel far-fetched.\nBitcoin Pepe is a way to get exposure to the BTC network’s credibility and liquidity without paying BTC’s five-figure entry price. This could be a Solana-style expansion, except on Bitcoin, with all the trust and attention this name carries.\nThe next big trade might not be chasing BTC’s climb, but riding BPEP as it builds a full meme economy on top of it. Timing, as always in crypto, is everything, and right now, the countdown is ticking toward one of the most hyped launches of the year.\nLast days before Bitcoin Pepe’s launch on August 13th: Over $17m raised\nThe August 13th DEX listing is the first chance for the open market to decide Bitcoin Pepe’s worth, and if demand spikes, this could be the cycle’s most aggressive moonshot.\nMemeCore has shown that Meme 2.0 can be structured, rewarding, and sustainable. But Bitcoin Pepe offers the asymmetric play: smaller, faster, and ready to ride Bitcoin’s brand in a way MemeCore can’t.\nFor traders priced out of Bitcoin, BPEP is the small-cap ticket into the same ecosystem, with far more room to run.\nThis could be the last moment to buy Bitcoin Pepe at presale prices of only $0.0458.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Why Cardano (ADA) Might Disappoint in the Upcoming Bull Run, and 2 Crypto Coins Poised to Rally Instead", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/why-cardano-ada-might-disappoint-in-the-upcoming-bull-run-and-2-crypto-coins-poised-to-rally-instead", "text": "People have long said that Cardano (ADA) is one of the most environmentally friendly blockchain solutions because it focuses on peer-reviewed development, energy efficiency, and proof-of-stake consensus. However, as the 2025 bull run gets closer, Cardano might be unable to give investors the enormous gains they want. ADA might not be able to get the same kind of returns as other new coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) because it has a high market cap, slow growth in DeFi, and its ecosystem isn't growing. Dogecoin and LILPEPE might be better investments for higher returns and faster development. Let's discuss why Cardano might not do well in the next bull run and why Dogecoin and LILPEPE are better set up for big price jumps.\nCardano (ADA): The Blockchain That Doesn't Have Much Room To Grow In The Short Term\nThere are many good things about Cardano (ADA). It is one of the most respected cryptocurrencies because it has a proof-of-stake system, is environmentally friendly, and has a lot of academic support. The Hydra scaling solution for Cardano is supposed to improve the network's transaction throughput. Cardano was made with security and scalability in mind. Cardano may not see the kind of quick returns that many investors are looking for in the upcoming 2025 bull run, even though it has a lot of potential in the long term. Here are the main reasons why ADA might let you down: A lot of money in the market: Cardano has already taken much of its market share, with a market cap of several billion dollars. Even though its price will increase from $0.7539, the percentage gains will be smaller than those of smaller, newer coins. Slow Adoption in DeFi: Even though Cardano's ecosystem is getting bigger, it hasn't taken over the DeFi space as much as competitors like Solana and Ethereum. This slower adoption makes it harder to grow in the short term. Stagnation in Ecosystem Growth: Cardano is becoming more popular in Africa and other developing areas. However, its use and growth in DeFi and NFTs are still behind other Layer-1 blockchains. Because of these things, Cardano (ADA) will unlikely see the massive percentage growth many investors expect shortly.\nDogecoin (DOGE): The Meme Coin That Will Last\nAlthough Cardano might not perform as expected in terms of returns, Dogecoin (DOGE) will have a significant rally during the next bull run. The first meme coin, Dogecoin, has become a staple in the crypto world with the help of the community and celebrity fans, notably Elon Musk. Dogecoin currently trades at $0.2090 and is expected to increase fivefold to an estimated price of $1 by the end of 2025. At that, DOGE remains an auspicious meme coin to keep an eye on in 2025 since it has an active community, is well-established, and has seen increased utility in the space of NFTs and gaming, as well as in retail payments. Although Dogecoin is not as technology-oriented or promising as some leading coins, it possesses a huge market cap, brand recognition, community contribution, and nature, which is likely to result in a significant rally soon.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin That Works\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) is another coin likely to do better than Cardano in the next bull run. LILPEPE's community may not be as big as Dogecoin's, but it's quickly becoming a meme coin with real use. LILPEPE is trading at $0.0018, raised $15.7 million in presale across blockchain layers, and is built on Layer-2. So transactions are done quicker with lower fees, and the network can support more users than Cardano and Dogecoin. This tech edge makes it more usable and durable for long-term growth. LILPEPE is supported by the Pepe Pump Pad, which gives meme token developers a safe place to start their projects with anti-rug pull features and liquidity locks. This is in addition to its blockchain infrastructure. Analysts say that LILPEPE could reach $0.40 by 2025, a significant return on its current price. Whale investors are starting to buy up LILPEPE, and the community is growing.\nWhy LILPEPE and DOGE Will Do Better Than Cardano\n-\nLower starting points and more potential for growth\nCompared to Cardano, LILPEPE, and Dogecoin have lower entry points and more room for growth. Because Cardano has a high market cap, it can't grow considerably. On the other hand, LILPEPE and DOGE have a lot more room to grow.\n-\nUsefulness in the real world and support from the community\nCardano is a long-term investment, but LILPEPE and Dogecoin are already part of the meme coin culture and can be used for NFTs, gaming, and DeFi. LILPEPE is especially good because it has faster transactions and lower fees, which makes it more useful in the growing DeFi space.\n-\nThe potential for explosive growth\nLILPEPE has a low market cap, which means that early investors could make significant returns as the coin becomes more popular. Dogecoin is also in an excellent position for substantial growth because it has a huge community and is well-known. Retail investors keep buying the token.\nHow to Put Money into LILPEPE\nAre you ready to invest in Dogecoin or pits? Here's how you can get started:\n-\nGet MetaMask or Trust Wallet for your computer or phone.\n-\nPut ETH or USDT (ERC-20) in your wallet.\n-\nGo to littlepepe.com to see the official presale page for LILPEPE.\n-\nConnect your wallet and buy some tokens.\nThe price of LILPEPE will go up as the presale stages move forward, so the best time to invest is early.\nIn Conclusion, Dogecoin And LILPEPE Are Better Choices Than Cardano.\nCardano is still a good long-term investment because it is sustainable and has been peer-reviewed, but it has limited room for growth in the short term. Instead, Dogecoin and LILPEPE are better choices for investors who want to make a lot of money quickly in the next bull run. LILPEPE has real use, a low entry point, and a community that spreads the word about it, so it should do better than Cardano in 2025. Dogecoin and LILPEPE are the meme coins to watch if you want to make more money.

Experts have voiced a bullish Dogecoin price prediction that can yield gains of up to 260% in the upcoming weeks. This news is likely to encourage investors to acquire DOGE tokens at lower entry points.\nMeanwhile, another AI-based investment platform, Unilabs Finance (UNIL), has secured the spotlight as the brightest star for memecoin investors. As the project grows, experts predict that Elon Musk can soon back this revolutionary platform, pumping it 12,650% like he helped Dogecoin skyrocket in 2021.\nDogecoin Price Prediction: Experts Voice 260% Rally to $0.65\nThe 260% Dogecoin price prediction has sparked optimism and hope among the memecoin holders. With a weekly surge of 15% due to the Russia-Ukraine war and trade wars between India and the US, DOGE memecoin is poised for a bullish breakout as buyers eye low entry points to secure spots in the next price pump.\nThe market sentiment is heating up as the bullish sentiment has crossed 85% on CMC. Though the risks exist for a pullback if the political crisis worsens, the monthly potential of the DOGE memecoin stays strong. Experts have set targets on the $0.6533 support level after a double bottom formation at $0.2140.\nWhy DOGE Traders Pump Investments Into Unilabs Presale\nDOGE experts are observed supporting Unilabs as the next prime altcoin to buy for securing gains like Dogecoin in 2021. The platform is known for its Memecoin Identification Tool, which allows high-risk and high-volume traders to hunt early opportunities and maximize profitability through precision trading.\nMoreover, the platform also searches for newly launched memecoins that have the potential to skyrocket due to strong fundamentals and development teams. This makes DOGE experts believe that there is a chance that Elon Musk can announce support for the meme-friendly platform to pump it like he did for DOGE in 2021.\nMeme-Friendly Unilabs Finance Tops Charts With AI-Platform News\nUnilabs Finance (UNIL) is promoted globally for its revolutionary AI-powered platform that manages hedge fund and retail investments with precision and cutting-edge analytical tools. The platform has secured a ground-breaking $12.2 million in stage 6 of the public presale and has sold 1,630 million tokens to 10,000+ users.\nFurthermore, its smart tools like AI Market Pulse and Early Access Scoring System allow hunting for new opportunities in diverse markets, including BTC, stocks, equities, real-world assets, and mining ventures. What makes Unilabs Finance unique is its attention towards passive income for its users through staking, platform fees, and governance.\nOne significant achievement for Unilabs is that it is managing $31 million in assets before its official launch. This shows that investors see a clear trajectory of the platform on top, rushing to buy UNIL tokens at just $0.009. Experts see this as the best time to buy UNIL tokens before the mainnet listing and the upcoming 12,000% pump for early buyers.\nConclusion: Why Buying Unilabs Is Like Acquiring DOGE in 2021\nDOGE price gears up for a bullish rebound in the upcoming weeks, as many experts have voiced a 260% Dogecoin price prediction. However, Unilabs steals the spotlight as the next-generation investment platform liked by meme traders for meme coin-friendly features and advanced analytics for high-risk traders.\nWith expectations of Elon Musk backing this platform like Dogecoin, investors are taking early positions in its presale before the price skyrockets to $0.1 after the mainnet launch announcement.\nLearn more:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Analysts Say XYZVerse Could Multiply That ROI by 12×", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/btc-to-150k-analysts-say-xyzverse-could-multiply-that-roi-by-12", "text": "Bitcoin is catching eyes with bold price targets, but some experts are watching a rising star called XYZVerse. Its potential returns might leave even Bitcoin in the dust, according to fresh analysis. The question now: could XYZVerse really deliver gains far beyond what is expected from Bitcoin’s next move? Readers may find the answer surprising.\nUndervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX\nXYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase.\nSo far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005.\nAt the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount.\nFollowing the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch.\nBorn for Fighters, Built for Champions\nXYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin.\nCentral to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell.\nCommunity-First Vibes\nIn XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record.\nBacked by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary.\nAirdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits\nBitcoin’s Next Act: Scarce Coins, Big Dreams\nBitcoin is the first online coin. It was launched in 2009 by the hidden coder Satoshi Nakamoto. Instead of paper bills, it lives on a shared digital record kept by many computers. No single bank controls it. People who move coins send signed messages to this record. Helpers called miners check each message by solving hard math riddles. The system then gives fresh coins to the fastest solver. A built-in rule cuts that reward in half about every four years, and only 21 million coins will ever exist. This keeps new supply tight.\nMany fans call Bitcoin “digital gold.” Big funds now add it to their mix, and some countries treat it like property. The last reward cut happened in 2020 and sparked a strong rally. Another cut is due soon, and traders are watching. Rival coins offer faster moves or fancy apps, yet none match Bitcoin’s age, size, or name power. If demand stays steady while new supply falls, the price could climb again. Still, swings are sharp, so timing matters. For long-term holders who believe in scarce digital money, this cycle may look tempting.\nConclusion\nBTC, ETH, SOL, PEPE, and MOG are strong coins with proven track records.

Market Analysis", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/when-will-altcoins-surge-with-bitcoins-breakout-market-analysis", "text": "Bitcoin (BTC) broke out on Sunday and Monday has seen a continuation of the surge. What about the altcoins? Not many alts are matching Bitcoin’s performance right now. However, the signs are that an altcoin breakout is not far away.\nAltcoins approach breakout\nSource: TradingView\nThe Total2 chart tracks the combined market capitalization of all the cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin. The weekly chart is telling us that the altcoins are very close to either breaking out of a descending trendline that stretches all the way back to November 2021, or they will be rejected from it. The price action shows a series of higher lows, but in order to make a higher high the trendline will need to be broken.\nMoving down the chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also at a critical stage. It can be seen that if the indicator line is able to break through the descending trendline on the RSI, this would likely coincide with a breakout in the price action.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are pointing down again. However, as previously happened, the indicators could turn back around again. This would certainly provide a lot more upside price momentum.\nBitcoin dominance gets a bounce\nSource: TradingView\nBitcoin dominance (BTC.D) is obviously one of the first charts to refer to when checking out the chances of an altcoin surge. The above 12-hour chart shows that Bitcoin dominance fell out the bottom of the bear flag, but was then able to bounce from the ascending trendline that goes all the way back to November 2022, with extra help from the horizontal support at 60%.\nIt might appear that a crucial point has been reached. The bottom of the bear flag is combining with other horizontal resistance to perhaps put a halt to further Bitcoin dominance gains from the current price level.\nBitcoin dominance trendline is all-important for altcoin season\nSource: TradingView\nMoving out into the weekly time frame the importance of the ascending trendline can be understood. It can probably be safely said that an incredible altcoin season depends on whether Bitcoin dominance falls below the trendline, or whether it continues to bounce.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators have almost hit the floor before turning up again. If these indicators drag along the bottom for a period of time, this could be what the altcoin bulls are waiting for.\n$ETH to retest breakout and then go higher\nSource: TradingView\nEthereum (ETH) is the premier altcoin, and therefore if $ETH is successful, the rest of the altcoins will undoubtedly follow. The weekly chart for the $ETH price reveals the supremely important breakout of resistance levels that go back to 2021.\nThat said, it is likely that $ETH goes back to test this horizontal level as support, whether the price goes back to $4,100, or $4,000.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators will need to turn back around. As can be seen, this may already be starting to happen.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Unlike legacy meme coins, $LBRETT positions itself as a next-generation Layer 2 project, aiming to combine the explosive meme appeal of Brett (original) with technical ambitions that seek to rival and surpass both Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2025. With its Layer 2 foundation and the promise of a 10 billion max supply (mirroring current meme coin economics), $LBRETT is being touted as a candidate for 150x growth—potentially eclipsing the combined gains of Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin.\n$LBRETT vs. Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE): Utility, Hype, and Upside\nUtility and Ecosystem\nSolana (SOL) has long been celebrated for high throughput (50,000+ TPS) and low transaction fees, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is renowned for its viral, community-driven appeal. $LBRETT, by contrast, enters the narrative as a Layer 2 platform, promising ultra-low gas fees and near-instant transactions—paralleling the DeFi and meme coin trends that dominate “best crypto to buy now” searches. However, unlike Solana (SOL), whose technical credentials are independently validated, $LBRETT’s exact throughput and fee metrics remain unverified to date.\nTokenomics and Growth Potential\n$LBRETT’s presale mirrors top-tier projects, with a $0.004 price and a 10B max supply—implying a fully diluted valuation (FDV) near $180 million. This sets the stage for substantial upside if the token captures even a fraction of the attention given to Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin, both of which command multi-billion-dollar market caps in 2025. While Dogecoin (DOGE) is praised for its accessibility and low fees, $LBRETT aspires to deliver similar low-cost transfers but with additional value capture through staking and potential Layer 2 utility.\nStaking, Accessibility, and Core Value Alignment\nStaking and Rewards\nWhile specific $LBRETT lockup details are undisclosed, typical Layer 2 protocols offer short lockups (7–30 days), matching the flexible, user-first ethos that has propelled Solana (SOL) and DOGE adoption. With a staking APY of 20,000%+ for early birds, Layer Brett is top of the tree. $LBRETT’s support for ETH, USDT, BNB, Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin payments, as well as MetaMask and Trust Wallet compatibility, further underscores its ambition to match or exceed the inclusive ecosystem of its rivals.\nCommunity and “Best Crypto To Buy Now” Momentum\nThe meme-powered branding and Layer 2 positioning of $LBRETT tap directly into the “best crypto to buy now” trend. Layer Brett aims to capture the same viral energy that propelled Dogecoin and the stout developer backing that fuels Solana (SOL). In spite of $LBRETT being in its early stages of presale, the community-driven narrative and speculative upside have attracted significant attention in social channels.\nThe Verdict: Will Layer Brett Outperform Solana and Dogecoin?\nBoth Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) remain foundational players in the crypto landscape. But $LBRETT’s blend of meme coin hype and Layer 2 technology positions it as a high-risk, high-reward candidate for outsized gains in 2025. Investors seeking the best crypto to buy now may find $LBRETT’s projected 150x potential compelling, not to mention the 20,000%+ APY for the earliest investors, the $1 million giveaway and the no KYC policy!\nGrab Layer Brett at $0.004 before the climb to $0.0042—lock in your position while it lasts.\nWebsite: https://layerbrett.com\nTelegram: https://t.me/layerbrett\nX: (1) Layer Brett (@LayerBrett) / X\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Currently at a price of around $122,000, it probably won’t be long before the high is broken. Is $130,000 likely to be the next pitstop?\nIt’s been a while coming, but it does finally look like Bitcoin is on its way again. The king of the cryptocurrencies spent just short of 4 weeks inside a bull flag before breaking out and confirming the breakout on Sunday. Currently surging higher, Bitcoin has the formality of breaking past its all-time high and launching into price discovery once again.\nStrong $BTC breakout on 4-hour chart\nSource: TradingView\nLooking at the $BTC price on the short-term 4-hour chart it can be observed that the breakout is strong and as far as price action is concerned things appear to be going to plan for the bulls.\nHowever, the indicators at the bottom of the chart are signalling that the gas tank is starting to empty. That said, the Stochastic RSI indicators can probably continue as they have been doing since the price dropped to the low, while the RSI indicator still needs to climb above the last high at 85.21 in order to avoid bearish divergence.\nDaily RSI signals more upside price action\nSource: TradingView\nIn the daily time frame the RSI illustrates two key signals for the last two breakouts. Looking left to the previous bull flag it can be seen how the low in the RSI matched the low in the price action, and also how the breakout and confirmation of the descending trendline matched the initial surge in the price action.\nAs can be observed above, the same thing has now just taken place for this current bull flag. It might be expected that the indicator line travels back into the overbought territory like it did before, signalling more upside for the $BTC price action.\n$BTC embarks on its journey to $150,000\nSource: TradingView\nThe weekly chart reveals the inverse head and shoulders pattern that appears to be playing out nicely. The price broke through the neckline of the pattern, returned to confirm the breakout, and is now rising higher. The measured move for this pattern is pretty much exactly $150,000. $130,000 could just be the next pitstop on the way.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows how the indicator line is rising to meet the descending trendline once again. This would be a very good time for the indicator line to finally breach the downtrend. If it does so, expect a decent surge in the price action above.\nThat said, the indicator line will need to continue up and get above the last high at 88.40 in order to avoid bearish divergence.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

But the emergence of Layer Brett ($LBRETT) brings a formidable challenger, prompting speculation about a potential shift in the meme coin hierarchy. This analysis examines the latest Pepe coin price data, performance metrics, and narrative catalysts, while directly comparing PEPE to $LBRETT, and referencing other major competitors: Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Bonk, and Brett Original.\nPEPE: Status, Price Performance & Catalysts\nAs of August 9, 2025, the PEPE coin price was approximately $0.00001228, with a notable 24-hour increase of 9.28% and a 7-day gain of around 9.30%. In the past 12 months, PEPE has achieved an impressive 43.73% growth, resulting in a market cap fluctuating between $5.15 billion and $5.19 billion. The circulating and max supply remain fixed at 420.69 trillion coins. PEPE is consistently ranked between #36 and #38 by market cap on major platforms, situating it among the elite Ethereum meme coins.\nRecent catalysts, such as Bitnile’s acceptance of PEPE for payments, robust social media momentum, and speculative projections of a $100 billion market cap, have fueled bullish sentiment assisting the PEPE coin price. The technical landscape is currently supported by a Fear & Greed index of 74 (“Greed”), and whale accumulation is reportedly on the rise. High liquidity and exchange activity further underscore PEPE’s ongoing relevance among meme tokens.\n$LBRETT: Ethereum Layer 2 Ambitions and Utility\nLayer Brett ($LBRETT) positions itself as a next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 meme coin, aiming to combine meme culture with scalable utility. Its max supply is confirmed at 10 billion tokens, with its presale having raised $150,000+ thus far. $LBRETT’s ecosystem is designed to incorporate advanced utility and gamified staking, with APY at 20,000% for early investors. Promotional narratives position $LBRETT as a contender for the “next 100x meme coin” and a potential disruptor of PEPE’s dominance.\nEthereum L1 fees remain volatile, often exceeding $10-$20 during peak congestion, while Layer 2 solutions like $LBRETT aim to deliver lower costs. Community engagement for $LBRETT is rising, but it is still less established than PEPE, which maintains high visibility and active social sentiment.\nComparative Analysis: PEPE vs. $LBRETT and Key Meme Coin Competitors\nPEPE currently holds a decisive lead in both market cap and public recognition. $LBRETT though, is actively marketed as a serious upstart within the Ethereum meme coin ecosystem. It seems as though the new challenger $LBRETT’s strategic positioning as an Ethereum Layer 2 project with a capped supply offers a differentiated narrative.\nCompetitor coins like Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Bonk, and Brett Original continue to shape the meme coin landscape. PEPE’s established track record and liquidity make it the current standard, but the speculative energy around $LBRETT and its Layer 2 ambitions reflect the broader market trends toward scalability, lower fees, and novel staking mechanisms.\nConclusion: Is PEPE’s Reign Threatened?\nEven with its ongoing bullish momentum and strong market cap, PEPE faces growing competition from $LBRETT and other meme coins. $LBRETT’s strategic focus on Ethereum Layer 2 scalability, capped supply, and meme utility could challenge PEPE’s status as Ethereum’s #1 meme coin as ecosystem development progresses. Layer Brett’s $1 million giveaway is accelerating community traction and its no KYC policy is attracting attention. For now, PEPE remains the benchmark, but the evolving landscape signals a dynamic contest for meme coin supremacy.\nSecure $LBRETT early—position for tomorrow’s gains.\nWebsite: https://layerbrett.com\nTelegram: https://t.me/layerbrett\nX: (1) Layer Brett (@LayerBrett) / X\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "XRP Stalls at $3, While XYZVerse Presale Surge Signals 17,000% Upside Potential", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/xrp-stalls-at-3-while-xyzverse-presale-surge-signals-17000-upside-potential", "text": "XRP struggles to push past the $3 barrier, leaving many watchers puzzled. At the same time, XYZVerse’s early sales numbers point to remarkable future growth. Investors are taking notice as today’s winners might not be tomorrow’s leaders. Big moves could be ahead, with one token grabbing the spotlight as another stands still.\nPrice Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible?\nXYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains.\nThe broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch.\nKey Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market:\n-\nStrong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal\n-\nDeflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure\n-\nLiquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch\n-\nCommunity incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding\nPrice Prediction for $XYZ\n-\nCurrent Presale Price: $0.005\n-\nProjected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates)\n-\nPotential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO)\n-\nLong-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings)\nBuy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains\nRealistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10?\nA 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on:\n-\nStrong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day.\n-\nSustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement.\n-\nMarket Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit.\nIs a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ?\nXYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable.\nInvest in $XYZ Before It Surges\nXRP: The Fast Coin Racing to Connect the World’s Money\nXRP is a digital coin that lives on the XRP Ledger. It was built by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz in 2012. The code makes each payment zip across the globe in seconds. Fees are tiny, and no bank account is needed. One hundred billion coins were made at birth. The team gave 80 billion to Ripple, the company driving growth. Ripple locked 55 billion of those coins in escrow and releases them slowly. The name came from “ripple credits,” a nod to smooth money waves.\nToday traders hunt for coins that move fast and cost little. Bitcoin is sturdy but slow. Ethereum is smart but fees soar when traffic spikes. New chains like Solana promise speed but have paused during overloads. XRP has run for years with few hiccups and settles in four seconds. This edge turns heads in the latest market cycle, where cross-border apps and micro-payments are hot. Fresh releases from escrow add supply, yet clear rules on timing calm shock. If the world keeps pushing for cheap, instant moves of any currency, XRP looks hard to ignore.\nConclusion\nXRP, PEPE, and MOG show strong performance in the current market. However, XYZVerse stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, blending memes and sports within one ecosystem. With early adoption benefits, community rewards, and rapid growth potential, XYZVerse aims to set new records and become a major player in both crypto and sports culture.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Currently in its 4th presale level at simply $0.005 per token, Ozak AI combines effective AI-pushed market insights with blockchain technology, attracting sizable attention and raising over $1.6 million at the same time as promoting more than 90 million tokens.\nStrong tokenomics, rigorous security audits, and strategic partnerships with innovators like Weblume and SINT have boosted investor confidence, making this presale one of the most promising possibilities for outsized returns because the mission moves towards release.\nWhat Sets Ozak AI Apart?\nOzak AI distinguishes itself from many crypto projects by using that which specializes in actionable AI-driven trading insights. The platform’s superior AI models examine market facts across cryptocurrencies, equities, and foreign exchange to offer real-time, predictive alerts. This stage of sophistication became historically handiest available to hedge finances and institutional investors; however, Ozak AI aims to democratize this intelligence, empowering retail investors with modern equipment.\nThe $OZ token is at the middle of this space, granting customers the right of entry to premium statistics feeds, permitting participation within the platform, and facilitating transactions. This multi-software aspect strengthens token demand past mere hypotheses, making it a vital element of the platform’s long-term sustainability.\nExplosive Presale Growth and Investor Confidence\nSince its inception, the Ozak AI presale has gained remarkable traction. Selling over 90 million tokens and raising more than $1.6 million to date, the project’s 4th presale stage continues to attract a growing base of investors who see the potential for massive returns.\nThis surge is underpinned by well-designed tokenomics that foster confidence. Only 10% of tokens are released at the Token Generation Event (TGE), with the rest vested over a six-month period following a one-month cliff. Such a controlled release reduces the hazard of fee crashes due to big sell-offs, encouraging long-term holding and price stability.\nSecurity and Transparency Build Trust\nIn the frequently unstable and risky world of crypto, protection and transparency are paramount. Ozak AI has taken steps to reassure traders via undergoing audits from Certik, a top blockchain safety firm, and conducting thorough inner audits. These opinions verify the protection and integrity of the platform’s clever contracts, decreasing the hazard of vulnerabilities.\nFurthermore, the undertaking’s listing on reputable aggregators like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko adds an extra layer of visibility and credibility. Investors can assess Ozak AI’s performance overtly, which bolsters market confidence and facilitates enticing a much wider target market.\nStrategic Partnerships Powering Growth\nOzak AI’s ecosystem is expanding rapidly with its strategic partnerships with modern gamers within the blockchain and AI area. One such collaboration is with Weblume, a no-code Web3 improvement platform. This partnership seeks to immediately combine Ozak AI’s real-time market signals into Weblume’s drag-and-drop app builder, making it less difficult for creators to expand information-rich on-chain programs.\nAnother significant alliance is with SINT, a platform offering “one-click AI upgrades” for products across Web2 and Web3. SINT’s voice-activated AI agents enable users to interact seamlessly with trading platforms and decentralized apps without coding knowledge. The synergy between Ozak AI’s predictive data and SINT’s autonomous agents could revolutionize how investors execute trades, combining speed with ease of use.\nTurning $100 Into $10,000\nThe mixture of innovative era, robust tokenomics, and strategic partnerships positions Ozak AI as a superb presale possibility. Priced at simply $0.005 per token within the present stage, projections propose the token could attain $1, probably delivering 200x returns.\nFor buyers, this means that a $100 investment ought to balloon to $10,000 or more if Ozak AI meets its increased potential. While such profits come with inherent risks typical of the crypto marketplace, the mission’s basics offer a compelling case for early participation.\nWhat the Future Holds for Ozak AI\nAs the broader cryptocurrency market gears up for what many expect to be a bullish phase in 2025, projects like Ozak AI with real-world applications and strong communities are likely to lead the pack. The platform plans ongoing feature enhancements and expanded AI capabilities to keep delivering cutting-edge market insights.\nCommunity events, such as recent meetups in Vietnam combining networking with innovative brainstorming over signature cocktails and Vietnamese cà phê, highlight the vibrant and engaged user base that supports Ozak AI’s vision. This active community plays a crucial role in driving adoption and fostering trust.\nOzak AI’s presale is more than just another crypto offering—it represents a transformative opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on AI-powered blockchain innovation. With over $1.6 million raised, millions of tokens already sold, and a clear roadmap backed by strong security and partnerships, Ozak AI is making waves.\nFor those willing to act early, the potential to turn a small $100 investment into $10,000 or more is very real. As always, investors should conduct their own research, but Ozak AI’s presale stands out as one of the most exciting and promising entry points in today’s crypto landscape.\nAbout Ozak AI\nOzak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.\nFor more, visit\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nTwitter: https://x.com/ozakagi\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "ChatGPT Says Cardano (ADA) is Going Nowhere: Here Are the Top 5 Cryptos to Buy Instead", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/chatgpt-says-cardano-ada-is-going-nowhere-here-are-the-top-5-cryptos-to-buy-instead", "text": "Cardano (ADA) remains one of the top smart contract platforms due to the loyalty of its community and its calm and research-oriented development style. Still, ADA has been unable to rival the price action of Solana and Ethereum. While it has strong fundamentals, the lack of significant updates has kept ADA from reaching new highs. Even with possible updates being worked on, ADA has struggled to gain further upward price action. According to ChatGPT and a growing wave of market sentiment, newer, more agile crypto projects are capturing investor attention. If you're planning your 2025 portfolio, here are the top five cryptos that could outshine ADA—starting with a rapidly rising meme coin that's building more than just hype.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) – The Meme Coin That’s Building a Blockchain\nLittle Pepe ($LILPEPE) is no ordinary meme coin—it’s leading a Layer 2 blockchain revolution, blending meme culture with high-speed, low-cost transactions. Selling at just $0.0018 in Stage 9, this token isn’t just about laughs and frog memes; it’s building infrastructure. $LILPEPE aims to be the world’s fastest and cheapest blockchain for memes, a dedicated L2 chain that eliminates sniper bots and supports a full-blown meme Launchpad. Unlike most meme coins that die off after the initial hype, Little Pepe is backed by anonymous crypto veterans with a track record of successful meme coin launches. Tokenomics include 0% tax, 13.5% staking rewards, and 30% chain reserves for future growth. Already listed on CoinMarketCap, the presale is advancing at warp speed. The project has plans for top-tier centralized exchange (CEX) listings and aims to become the largest exchange in the industry once it goes live. Little Pepe’s roadmap is a meme masterpiece—complete with phases like “Pregnancy,” “Birth,” and “Growth,” all of which it’s flown through ahead of schedule. With Stage 9 in progress, a $77,000 token giveaway in motion, and a community that memes as hard as it holds, Little Pepe has serious potential to deliver a 7800%+ return for early investors. Cardano may be solid, but Little Pepe is fun, fast, and ferociously focused on becoming the king of meme infrastructure in 2025.\nToncoin (TON) – Riding the Telegram Wave\nToncoin has been making waves as the native token of The Open Network, initially developed by the Telegram team. Telegram has begun integrating Toncoin into its application for payments and other activities involving tokens. With over 700 million users, TON is slowly moving towards mass adoption. The project's attention to rapid transaction speeds and scalability puts it ahead of its competitors in the payments and microservices industry. TON is already listed on major exchanges and climbing steadily on CoinMarketCap. With strong utility and a built-in user base via Telegram, TON is positioning itself as the sleeper hit of 2025.\nInjective (INJ) – DeFi Powerhouse with Real Growth\nInjective (INJ) is a protocol for decentralized finance (DeFi) that allows for rapid, safe, and completely decentralized trading. The Cosmos SDK supports INJ, resulting in low fees and high throughput for dApps and derivatives. With rising interest from institutions and adoption in the ecosystem, INJ has become a staple in many crypto portfolios. It has shifted from a niche to a necessary addition. Its innovative tokenomics include staking rewards and deflationary mechanics, solidifying INJ’s place as a long-term DeFi investment. While the DeFi space is still in its early days, INJ has stood out as one of the few projects that consistently keeps its commitments.\nRender (RNDR) – Powering the Future of AI and 3D\nRender Network is pioneering the decentralized GPU rendering space, offering scalable solutions for AI model training, 3D rendering, and metaverse development. With NVIDIA and Apple showing increased interest in spatial computing and AI-generated media, RNDR stands at a valuable intersection of AI and blockchain. RNDR’s use case is becoming increasingly relevant in an AI-driven world, and its listing on top exchanges ensures strong liquidity. As content creation shifts toward 3D and AR/VR, Render is building the infrastructure to power the metaverse.\nOptimism (OP) – Scaling Ethereum With Speed and Efficiency\nOptimism is a top contender in the Ethereum Layer 2 race. Designed to reduce gas fees and increase throughput dramatically, Optimism uses optimistic rollups to process transactions faster and cheaper. It’s already supporting major DeFi projects and has received endorsements from key Ethereum contributors. As Ethereum continues its transition to full scalability, OP is one of the best-positioned tokens to benefit. For investors looking at long-term L2 dominance, Optimism remains a must-watch.\nConclusion: ADA’s Not Dead, But It’s Being Outpaced\nAlthough Cardano is still progressing, it’s evident that newer and more focused projects are getting all the attention. From Little Pepe’s meme-fueled Layer 2 chain to Toncoin’s Telegram integration and Render’s role in the AI economy, these five tokens offer strong narratives and absolute momentum. In 2025, the crypto market will reward agility, innovation, and community—and these tokens are checking all the boxes.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Cardano’s (ADA) price drop risk is even sharper, with technicals hinting at a potential 25% loss toward $0.53 as bearish sentiment builds.\nWhile both projects wrestle with near-term selling pressure, Cold Wallet(CWT) is taking the opposite path, growing before launch. Its $270M Plus Wallet acquisition instantly onboarded 2M+ users, while a presale at Stage 17 and $0.00998 per token still offers a potential 3,423% ROI to launch. In this market, the token flipping gas fees into rewards looks like the smartest bet.\nSolana Faces Key Support Test as 10% Price Drop Looms\nSolana’s price is showing weakness below its June high, forming a descending triangle; a pattern often signaling further drops. Right now, SOL is around $163, teetering just above its $160 support level with bearish indicators building. If it slips past this foundation, it could slide toward $153 in the near term. On‑chain data shows a net outflow of $18.6 million from SOL spot markets, hinting at caution among larger holders.\nStill, dips can serve as entry points when buying pressure returns. Lower prices may offer a chance to accumulate SOL before any recovery. Watch for renewed inflows, a rebound from support, or a break above $166. Those signs could signal that Solana might be preparing for its next move upward.\nCardano Faces a Possible 25% Drop\nCardano (ADA) is showing weakness after failing to hold above $0.74, with analysts warning it could slide toward $0.53. On-chain data shows a decline in tokens moving off exchanges, signaling reduced investor confidence. Over 50% of traders are holding short positions, adding to bearish pressure.\nTechnical signals such as the MACD and on-balance volume are trending lower, reflecting fading momentum. While this setup points to a potential 25% fall, it may also create a lower entry point for long-term buyers. Investors should watch for a shift in volume or a price rebound from key support levels before committing.\nThe next move will likely depend on whether buyers can regain control or sellers push ADA into deeper losses.\nCold Wallet’s $270M Deal Just Changed the Game for Web3 Wallets\nCold Wallet’s $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet is more than just a big number; it is a calculated, pre-launch growth accelerator. This single move instantly brought over 2 million active users into its ecosystem, a scale that most blockchain projects take years to achieve after going live.\nBy absorbing Plus Wallet’s infrastructure, Cold Wallet supercharges its cashback rewards model from the first day of full operations. Every swap, gas payment, or transfer now becomes part of an earning loop instead of a cost sink, giving users a reason to choose it over MetaMask or Trust Wallet.\nUser frustration with traditional wallets’ complex interfaces is growing, and Cold Wallet is positioning itself as the simpler, more rewarding alternative. With $5.8 million already raised in its presale, Stage 17 pricing set at $0.00998, and the Stage 1 price having been just $0.007, the window for maximum ROI is already tightening.\nThe fixed launch price of $0.3517 represents a 3,423% return for those entering now, before more stages sell out and the upside shrinks. This acquisition is not just a headline; it compresses years of user acquisition, adoption, and utility growth into one decisive move.\nTakeaway\nThe Solana (SOL) price update warns of short-term weakness as on-chain flows turn negative. Cardano’s (ADA) price drop pressure underscores deeper structural hurdles, with over half of traders shorting the asset. Cold Wallet, in contrast, is building momentum with measurable, bankable growth; $5.8M raised, Stage 17 entry at $0.00998, and a fixed launch price of $0.3517.\nStage 1 buyers at $0.007 are already looking at a 4,923% ROI projection. With 2M+ users secured pre-launch, a real cashback utility model, and no reliance on speculative hype, Cold Wallet stands as the best-positioned play for outsized returns before broader market sentiment shifts.\nExplore Cold Wallet Now:\nPresale: https://purchase.coldwallet.com/\nWebsite: https://coldwallet.com/\nX: https://x.com/coldwalletapp\nTelegram: https://t.me/ColdWalletAppOfficial\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The optimism is high, but those looking for higher upside potential may want to turn their attention to a rising competitor priced below half a cent.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin Under $0.004 with Millionaire Potential\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) is making serious waves in the meme coin space. Built as a Layer 2 blockchain focused on speed, affordability, and meme culture, it’s quickly separating itself from the sea of low-effort meme tokens. With a name that draws from crypto's rich meme heritage and a Layer 2 infrastructure that combines fun with functionality, LILPEPE is more than just another joke coin. It’s gaining traction where it counts: community growth, presale success, and early market exposure.\nPresale Momentum Signals Explosive Potential\nLILPEPE’s presale has been nothing short of impressive. Stage 8 sold out faster than anticipated, raising $13.775 million. Now in Stage 9 at $0.0018, the token has seen an 80% increase since its presale began, already rewarding early participants. More than 10.72 billion tokens have been sold, and listings are starting to appear, including on CoinMarketCap, giving the project early credibility in the broader crypto space. Community has always been at the heart of meme coins, and LILPEPE is no exception. To celebrate the presale’s success, the team has launched a $777,000 giveaway. Over 181,500 entries have been recorded so far, with 10 lucky winners set to receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens each.\nThe Token to Make You a Millionaire\nThe low entry price, well under $0.004, positions LILPEPE as a standout opportunity. Analysts project gains of up to 2,500x, which would turn a $1,000 investment into a massive $2.5 million. Such predictions, while bold, are fueling even more interest from investors hunting for the next big winner. What sets LILPEPE apart is the team and advisory group quietly behind it. While most names remain anonymous, many have proven track records of success with some of the top meme tokens in the market. This level of behind-the-scenes experience gives LILPEPE a major edge. Meme coins may be fun, but serious market players know success requires strategy and execution. With the right people involved, LILPEPE looks primed for a major breakout.\nLooking Ahead: A Roadmap Built for Momentum\nLittle Pepe isn’t standing still. With each step forward, the coin continues to gain attention from both casual investors and more seasoned crypto holders. While DOGE may be eyeing a solid 8x return if it hits $2, LILPEPE presents a different kind of opportunity: exponential gains from a fraction-of-a-cent entry point. That kind of upside is what turns small investments into massive wins.\nFinal Thoughts\nDogecoin’s rally toward $2 is exciting, no doubt. But the spotlight is starting to shift toward fresh contenders that combine viral potential with early-stage access. Little Pepe (LILPEPE), priced under $0.004, is catching fire with a unique mix of meme appeal, blockchain capability, and strong community backing. With over $13.7 million already raised, a growing user base, and industry veterans backing the project, LILPEPE is more than just hype; it’s a serious contender in the next meme coin wave. The current price window might not last long. For those searching for the meme coin with millionaire-making potential, Little Pepe could be the one.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

All attention is on this new project, as the investor seeks huge gains again. Many are curious about what makes XYZVerse so special that it could possibly deliver a hundredfold profit next.\nDemand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone\nXYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3.\nUnlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms.\nNotably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet.\nPrice Dynamics and Listing Plans\nDuring its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges.\nThe projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization.\nSo far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors.\nChampions Get Rewarded\nIn XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big.\nThe Road to Victory\nWith solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary.\nAirdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits\nSolana: The Fast Lane Coin Racing Ahead of the Pack\nSolana is a digital chain built for speed and scale. It hosts small apps called dapps, much like Ethereum and Cardano, yet moves data faster. Developers can pick from many coding styles, making building simple. At the heart sits SOL, the coin that keeps everything moving. People use it to pay for tasks, run custom tools, and earn rewards for supporting the network. Every tap of SOL adds power to the system, linking users, makers, and investors in one busy place.\nThe current market cycle favors projects with real use and clear speed gains. Solana ticks both boxes. Its single-layer design avoids the puzzle of side lanes and shards, so growth feels smooth. Daily activity keeps rising, showing demand for quick trades, games, and art tokens. While Ethereum stays the big name and Cardano eyes research depth, Solana offers a middle path of fast action and low fees. If you believe heavy traffic will shift to faster rails, SOL may look like an early ticket.\nConclusion\nSOL and other major coins remain strong choices, but XYZVerse (XYZ) leads as the first all-sport memecoin. Its blend of sports, memes, and strong community aims for standout growth in this bull run.\nYou can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here:\nhttps://xyzverse.io/, https://t.me/xyzverse, https://x.com/xyz_verse\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

{"title": "This Top Trending Crypto Is Gearing Up for 30x Gains, While These 3 Coins Lead the Market Narrative", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/this-top-trending-crypto-is-gearing-up-for-30x-gains-while-these-3-coins-lead-the-market-narrative", "text": "As crypto markets enter a new phase of cautious optimism, a handful of standout projects are commanding outsized attention, and for good reason. From decentralized AI infrastructure to DeFi-powered cross-chain networks, the innovation hasn’t stopped. Among the names gaining massive traction are Render, Polygon, and Polkadot, each seeing renewed investor confidence and ecosystem momentum. But one project, BlockDAG, is emerging as a potential game-changer in the Layer 1 space.\nIts presale price of $0.0016 and explosive growth metrics make it a strong contender for the title of the top trending crypto right now. Backed by a real ecosystem, global visibility campaigns, and even a 10 BTC reward pool, BlockDAG isn’t just making noise, it’s executing.\nIn this spotlight, we break down what makes these four projects especially compelling this week, and why every crypto investor should be paying attention to the new leaders forming in the market narrative.\nBlockDAG: The $0.0016 Underdog That’s Dominating the Spotlight\nBlockDAG is quickly becoming the top trending crypto in the presale arena, and the numbers don’t lie. With a confirmed listing price of $0.05 later this year, early investors at the $0.0016 level are staring at a potential 30x ROI. But there’s more than hype behind those figures. BlockDAG has already raised $368 million, drawn over 200,000 holders, and built a real user base through its X1 mobile mining app, boasting 2.5 million downloads globally.\nThe project blends Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture with Proof-of-Work security to create a faster, more decentralized Layer 1 network. With 19,000 miners sold and a fully functional demo trading platform live, BlockDAG isn’t just promising performance, it’s demonstrating it. Meanwhile, its 10 BTC Auction Pool (worth over $1.1 million) offers presale buyers a chance to win Bitcoin, adding even more fuel to its momentum.\nWith its “GLOBAL LAUNCH release” happening on August 11 to draw global visibility, BlockDAG is primed to explode in awareness. While many Layer 1s launch with little more than a whitepaper, BlockDAG is entering the ring with users, capital, and a functioning ecosystem. It’s no surprise it’s considered the top trending crypto this quarter.\nRender: The “Eye” of the Decentralized AI Revolution\nIn the fast-emerging decentralized AI landscape, Render (RNDR) is carving out a unique and essential role. While projects like Bittensor act as the “brain,” orchestrating neural networks and AI models, Render is focused on being the “eye”, providing the GPU rendering power needed to visualize and train AI efficiently. According to a recent breakdown by Indodax Academy, this complementary function makes Render a vital layer of the growing AI-on-blockchain infrastructure.\nWhat sets Render apart is accessibility. Its tokenomics and use case, allowing users to rent or provide GPU rendering power, are straightforward, especially when compared to more complex AI protocols like TAO.\nThis clarity gives Render an adoption edge, especially among newcomers to the AI-crypto space. With enterprise demand for GPU processing continuing to surge, Render’s position becomes even more crucial. It’s no surprise it continues to feature on lists of top trending crypto picks for AI enthusiasts and utility-driven investors alike.\nPolygon: Liquidity, Cross-Chain Expansion, and a Technical Rebound\nPolygon (POL), formerly known as MATIC, is staying relevant by doing what it does best, building infrastructure and partnerships. This week, DeFi protocol Fluid announced an expansion of liquidity incentives across several chains, with Polygon high on the list alongside Arbitrum and Base. These developments are enhancing cross-chain liquidity, an increasingly critical function in the DeFi world.\nOn the technical front, POL has broken above both its 50-day EMA ($0.2149) and 200-day EMA ($0.2177), signaling potential bullish momentum. This move has caught the attention of analysts and traders alike, as POL’s price action begins to reflect renewed confidence in its roadmap.\nPolygon’s consistent presence in enterprise solutions, coupled with this technical strength, is why it continues to rank as a top trending crypto in infrastructure circles.\nPolkadot: Bullish Signals Amid Institutional Accumulation\nPolkadot (DOT) is another network gaining steam this week after posting a 4% rally from $3.65 to $3.80. What’s noteworthy is that this move appears to be driven not by retail speculation, but by institutional buying. With strong support forming near $3.68, DOT is showing resilience and potential for breakout behavior if momentum sustains.\nWhile Binance cautioned that DOT remains in consolidation, the signs of life are strong. As parachain auctions and cross-chain interoperability regain investor interest, Polkadot is once again finding itself in the conversation.\nIt may not have the flashy headlines of a presale token, but it continues to serve as a quiet giant in the background, often surfacing on top trending crypto watchlists for its long-term scalability play.\nConclusion\nIn a market where narratives change quickly, a handful of projects are rising above the noise to define the next cycle’s themes. Whether it's Render powering the AI frontier, Polygon leading DeFi’s cross-chain expansion, or Polkadot building sustainable long-term infrastructure, each is carving out critical niches.\nBut BlockDAG is the standout of the moment. With a live ecosystem, huge community, and once-in-a-cycle entry price of $0.0016, it’s dominating the charts and headlines. Add in a 30x ROI potential and one of the biggest presale prize pools ever (10 BTC), and it’s clear why BlockDAG is being called the top trending crypto this season.\nAs attention intensifies around the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release, now is the time to watch, and possibly act. These aren’t just projects; they’re pillars of what’s next in crypto. Miss them, and you might miss the momentum shift altogether.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Forget Bitcoin Forks, Bitcoin Swift Introduces Proof-of-Yield That Actually Evolves", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/forget-bitcoin-forks-bitcoin-swift-introduces-proof-of-yield-that-actually-evolves", "text": "Bitcoin forks have been popping up for years, often promising revolutionary changes but delivering only minor tweaks to the original code. Traders have learned to approach them with caution because most fail to add meaningful innovation. The market is now demanding projects that not only enhance security and scalability but also bring fresh mechanics that reward long-term participation.\nWhy Forks No Longer Excite the Market\nFork-based projects can generate short-term hype, yet they rarely manage to sustain momentum. Many rely on branding rather than delivering unique features that impact user returns or network utility. Investors are now shifting focus toward protocols with clear innovation in rewards, governance, and technical infrastructure. This is where Bitcoin Swift enters the conversation, not as a fork but as a fully engineered system built to evolve.\nBitcoin Swift: More Than Just Another Blockchain\nBitcoin Swift (BTC3) is a modular blockchain that combines high-level scalability with a reward system designed to grow user wealth from day one. Its Proof-of-Yield (PoY) architecture issues programmable staking rewards that adapt dynamically based on network conditions and environmental factors, setting it apart from static reward systems.\nThis adaptability is powered by AI integration across multiple layers of the protocol. AI oracles optimize energy efficiency, monitor clean power usage, and feed accurate real-time data into smart contracts. It is this combination of yield intelligence and scalability that is driving BTC3’s rising profile among crypto analysts.\nTechnical Advantages Driving Adoption\nBTC3’s ecosystem blends compliance readiness with advanced decentralized governance. Participants can engage in protocol decisions through a structure that uses decentralized identity verification and quadratic voting to ensure fairness.\n-\nAI Energy Efficiency: AI systems monitor carbon usage and reward sustainability, ensuring long-term operational viability.\n-\nGovernance Architecture: A multi-layer voting process includes AI risk assessment and DID-based reputation scoring, protecting against bad proposals.\nInfluencers have taken notice. A detailed review by Bull Run Angel highlights how BTC3’s technology could set new benchmarks for on-chain reward models.\nSecurity is another cornerstone of the project. Independent verifications like the Spywolf Audit and Solidproof Audit, along with KYC verification, confirm its commitment to safety. According to internal sources, a third security audit is already being arranged with a reputable blockchain firm.\nPresale Momentum and Market Buzz\nThe BTC3 presale is currently in Stage 4, with over 2,100 participants and more than $580,000 already raised. The price is set at $4, with a planned increase to $5 in Stage 5, and a confirmed launch price of $15. Stage 4 APY is 106%, and rewards are distributed at the end of each stage, meaning early participants enjoy active benefits from the start.\nThis presale stands out as one of the shortest in the industry, lasting only 64 days until September 18, 2025. Reports from insiders suggest that the team is in talks with major exchanges including MEXC, KuCoin, and LBank for listings, news that could further accelerate demand.\nBTC3’s liquidity is also among the highest at this stage compared to similar projects. This matters because strong liquidity ensures smoother trading, less slippage, and better price stability after launch.\nBTC3 Tokenomics and Community Growth\n-\nTotal Supply: 45 million BTC3\n-\n50% (22.5M) allocated to PoY rewards over 30 years\n-\n30% (13.5M) for presale participants with governance access\n-\n15% (6.75M) for liquidity\n-\n5% (2.25M) for team and reserves\nOn top of that, the referral program offers a 10% bonus for both referrer and referee, with no hidden terms or lockups, making network expansion as rewarding as holding the token.\nFinal Verdict\nBitcoin Swift is not trying to win by copying Bitcoin’s code. It is building a multi-layered protocol that combines AI-driven efficiency, adaptive rewards, and verifiable governance to create a comprehensive ecosystem. The PoY system directly aligns network growth with user wealth, while high liquidity, strong audits, and short presale timelines create conditions for rapid adoption.\nFor more information on Bitcoin Swift:\nWebsite: https://bitcoinswift.com\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "5 Crypto Tokens That Could Transform Spare Change Into Life-Changing Gains in 2025", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/5-crypto-tokens-that-could-transform-spare-change-into-life-changing-gains-in-2025", "text": "Sometimes all it takes is a few spare dollars and the right timing to rewrite your financial future. Usually, blue-chip assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum offer steady growth. However, it's low-cap, high-upside tokens have turned pocket change into six- or even seven-figure windfalls. With the 2025 market heating up, a new wave of tokens could offer not just hype, but serious potential. Let's take a look at five tokens that could be life-changing this year.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): From Meme to Millions?\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE) is storming the meme coin scene with utility, innovation, and serious investor attention. While many meme coins rely solely on hype, Little Pepe is building real infrastructure. That's precisely why it's drawing comparisons to the early days of Dogecoin and PEPE, but with far more upside. Now in Stage 9 of its presale, $LILPEPE is trading at just $0.0018, with over $15 million already raised. Interest is accelerating, especially after the project’s CoinMarketCap listing, which solidified its credibility in the eyes of retail and early whales alike. The token powers its own Layer 2 blockchain, built specifically for the meme economy. This means zero tax trading, sniper-bot resistance, and lightning-fast speeds. Its ecosystem also features a dedicated meme launchpad, giving it an ecosystem that’s light-years ahead of typical meme coins.\nAdding to the excitement, two top-tier centralized exchange listings are locked in for launch, with confirmed negotiations to list on the world’s largest exchange. Investors are positioning early before this goes mainstream. Analysts believe that if $LILPEPE even grazes $0.50, early buyers at $0.0018 could secure 300x returns within 18 months. The project is also running a $777,000 giveaway, with 10 lucky winners receiving $77,000 each in tokens. To qualify, investors must contribute at least $100 and complete a few simple tasks. This giveaway has added even more incentive to join now. With a powerful blend of meme culture, blockchain tech, and massive upside potential, this is one of the most compelling tokens in 2025 for turning spare change into generational wealth.\nTurbo (TURBO): AI-Generated Hype with Real Staying Power\nTurbo (TURBO) is a distinctive meme coin created entirely by AI. It is now listed and trading at about $0.00430, with a market cap of around $297 million. Launched in April 2023 on a $69 budget using GPT‑4 and Midjourney, Turbo quickly earned cult status with its toad mascot “Quantum Leap.” Despite its lack of concrete utility today, it remains one of the top meme coins capturing AI-meme crossover interest. Analysts forecast price potential as high as $0.0105–$0.0119 by year-end. If a macro meme cycle arrives, the upside could be explosive. For investors starting with just a few dollars, it remains one of the rare meme coins still trading under $0.005 with serious upside potential.\nWall Street Pepe (WEPE): Meme Finance with Explosive Potential\nWall Street Pepe (WEPE) is carving out a unique lane in the meme coin space, blending satire, finance, and viral internet culture. As of early August, the token remains well under the radar with a modest market cap below $25 million. This leaves plenty of room for explosive upside. WEPE's strategic branding, meme-rich narrative, and growing community that thrives on humor and hustle set it apart. It recently secured listings on BitMart and MEXC, sparking fresh interest and widening access. The team has teased an NFT line and DeFi utility in development, adding long-term potential to the hype. With strong meme momentum and clever execution, WEPE could quietly become one of 2025’s most surprising breakout tokens.\nPopcat (POPCAT): The Viral Cat Token Poised for a Comeback\nPopcat (POPCAT) is trading at approximately $0.2970, with a market cap of around $286 million. After peaking at $2.06 in November 2024, the token has since retraced about 85%, settling near current levels as meme coin sentiment cools. Market trading volume is healthy at $25–30 million daily, supported by listings on platforms like KuCoin and Kraken. Analysts estimate Popcat could reclaim $1–$2 by late 2025 as meme mania returns and Asia-based virality reignites. Popcat’s combination of cultural clout, steady exchange presence, and reclaimed momentum in a market hungry for explosive returns positions it as a potential high-beta play.\nPepecoin (PEP): A Layer‑1 Meme Coin with Real Potential\nPepecoin (PEP) trades around $0.00050, commanding a market cap of approximately $57 million. After soaring to an all-time high of $0.00185 in December 2024, PEP has since retraced 70%. But it remains resilient, recently rebounding from its $0.00045 low. Pepecoin distinguishes itself through Layer‑1 decentralization, merge-mining compatibility with Litecoin and Dogecoin. It also has zero pre-mine or VC allocation, traits rare in meme token space. Analysts see a strong asymmetrical upside of 10× to 50×.\nConclusion\n2025 will be a breakout year for high-upside altcoins, and these five tokens are leading the charge. But one name stands out: Little Pepe (LILPEPE). With its ongoing presale, Layer 2 utility, and early CEX listings, $LILPEPE is a movement. Investors getting in at $0.0018 could be positioning for generational wealth, especially if price targets flirt with $0.50. 🚀 Don’t miss your shot. Join the LILPEPE presale now and turn spare change into a story worth telling.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The new product lets clients take leveraged positions on XRP against the euro under a compliant structure. This move follows strong interest in its earlier BTC/EUR and ETH/EUR listings and builds further momentum for regulated crypto markets in the EU.\nXRP/EUR: Europe’s First Regulated Contract\nOne Trading introduced the XRP/EUR perpetual futures contract on August 18, opening access to both institutional and eligible retail clients. This marks the first euro-denominated perpetual contract for XRP to be launched at a regulated European venue. Based on its experience with bitcoin and ether futures, the exchange expects strong demand for the XRP/EUR product.\n🚀 XRP/EUR Perpetual Trading Starts NOW!!\nFrom today, you can trade XRP/EUR with leverage, low fees, tight spreads, and lightning-fast execution on the first regulated exchange for crypto perpetual futures in Europe! pic.twitter.com/ZQDCJd6HsK\n— One Trading (@OneTradingEU) August 18, 2025\nThe XRP/EUR perpetual futures allow clients to go long or short with leverage, enhancing flexibility in any market trend. The product offers one-minute settlement, low trading fees, and efficient execution tailored for high-frequency strategies. These features are aimed at traders seeking alternatives to offshore platforms that lack regulatory oversight.\nThe exchange structured the XRP/EUR contract to support euro-based desks by avoiding USD conversion costs and aligning with EU treasury needs. With this addition, One Trading targets institutional desks and retail traders seeking local currency exposure. The contract gives market participants a tool to trade XRP in a MiFID II-compliant environment.\nBTC/EUR and ETH/EUR Futures Gained Early Traction\nBefore XRP/EUR, One Trading had rolled out BTC/EUR and ETH/EUR perpetual futures under the same regulated structure. These contracts have recorded nearly €2 billion in total positions, highlighting growing demand for euro-based crypto derivatives. The successful performance of these products established the foundation for the XRP/EUR launch.\nThese earlier listings attracted both institutional and retail traders, especially after retail access expanded in May to Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands. Previously, the products were limited to institutional accounts only. By opening up access, One Trading widened its footprint in the regulated crypto futures market.\nStrong month-on-month growth in volumes indicated that traders preferred a transparent local currency futures platform. The BTC/EUR and ETH/EUR products enabled directional exposure without relying on offshore dollar-based books. Their traction validated One Trading’s decision to expand the offering to other coins like XRP.\nPlatform Leverages Regulatory Strength and Strategic Growth\nOne Trading emerged from the rebranding of Bitpanda Pro in 2023 and secured a licence from the Dutch AFM. This allowed the platform to operate as the EU’s first regulated crypto derivatives venue offering perpetual futures under MiFID II. In June 2025, it partnered with LSEG Regulatory Reporting Solutions to integrate post-trade reporting.\nThis integration added MiFIR and EMIR compliance to the exchange, lowering operational hurdles for regulated entities. One Trading positioned itself as a secure and transparent choice for leveraged crypto trading. Its compliance-first approach distinguishes it from offshore venues.\nWith XRP/EUR live, the platform now completes its first wave of euro-denominated regulated futures. One Trading confirmed that more listings are in development as it builds Europe’s regulated crypto derivatives ecosystem. The exchange aims to deepen market depth and challenge offshore books in terms of liquidity and reach.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 23:16:48 +0000", "author": "Yasmin Werner", "source": "https://coincentral.com/news/feed/"}
{"title": "Apple’s Strategic Social Media Push Targets 1 Billion Chinese Internet Users", "url": "https://coincentral.com/apple-strategic-social-media-push-china-rednote-iphone17/", "text": "TLDRs;\n- Apple launched its official RedNote account, gaining 200K followers ahead of the iPhone 17 release in China.\n- The RedNote debut reflects Apple’s six-year, methodical social media expansion across China’s biggest digital platforms.\n- RedNote’s youthful, tech-savvy user base aligns with Apple’s premium positioning and upcoming product launches.\n- Apple’s careful social rollout balances brand growth with cultural sensitivity and long-term market integration in China.\nApple has deepened its digital footprint in China by launching an official account on RedNote, one of the country’s fastest-growing social platforms.\nThe move comes just weeks ahead of the highly anticipated iPhone 17 launch and underscores Apple’s strategy of building long-term engagement with China’s massive online population of over 1 billion users.\nThe company’s verified RedNote account debuted on August 16 with a short animated video of Apple’s logo, inviting users to share personal stories. Despite not mentioning any products, the post drew instant attention, helping Apple amass more than 200,000 followers within days. The early momentum highlights both Apple’s brand strength and the power of RedNote’s algorithm-driven reach.\nMethodical expansion across Chinese platforms\nApple’s RedNote debut is part of a broader, deliberate strategy to expand its social presence in China. The company entered WeChat in 2018, opened an official Douyin account in 2022, and has long relied on CEO Tim Cook’s popular Weibo presence, which has over 1.8 million followers. Apple Support also maintains an active Weibo account, offering localized customer engagement.\nUnlike many Western brands that rush into every new platform, Apple’s playbook has been measured. Industry analysts argue this reflects lessons learned from past controversies, such as the 2019 backlash over Apple’s removal of a Hong Kong protest-tracking app under pressure from Chinese authorities. By moving cautiously, Apple appears intent on balancing brand visibility with political and cultural sensitivity.\nThis careful rollout aligns with the habits of Chinese internet users, 91% of whom maintain at least one social media account and spend more than 1.5 hours daily online. By diversifying across platforms, Apple ensures it can reach different segments of China’s highly engaged digital ecosystem.\nTiming aligns with RedNote’s explosive growth\nApple’s arrival on RedNote also benefits from the platform’s recent surge in global attention. Earlier this year, U.S. TikTok users flocked to RedNote amid concerns about a potential TikTok ban, boosting the app’s international profile and pushing it to the top of U.S. app store charts.\nWith its mix of lifestyle content, product discovery, and a predominantly Gen Z user base, RedNote offers fertile ground for Apple’s brand positioning. The platform’s recommendation engine currently favors engaging content over sheer follower count, giving Apple’s posts an opportunity to go viral organically.\nIndustry watchers see the move as a smart prelude to the iPhone 17 launch in September. By cultivating an audience on RedNote now, Apple positions itself to capture attention when it unveils its new devices, including rumored updates to the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods lineup.\niPhone 17 launch looms over strategy\nApple’s upcoming September event is expected to showcase the iPhone 17 series, alongside updated Apple Watch and AirPods models.\nRumors suggest the iPhone 17 Pro could feature a redesigned rectangular camera bar, a stronger aluminum frame, and improved battery capacity.

(PANW)\nThe company reported fiscal Q4 2025 GAAP profit of $253.8 million, or $0.36 per share, down from $357.7 million, or $0.51 per share, a year earlier.

Its China-made EV sales fell 8.4% in July, reflecting headwinds from price wars and aggressive domestic competitors such as Xiaomi. Earlier this year, Xiaomi’s YU7 SUV made headlines after receiving over 200,000 pre-orders in just three minutes.\nXiaomi’s pricing strategy has placed it head-to-head with Tesla. The YU7 starts at 253,500 RMB, undercutting the Model Y’s price of 263,500 RMB. Beyond cost, Xiaomi is also offering superior performance, with the YU7 boasting a range of 835 km, far surpassing the Model Y’s 593 km.\nThis gap has pressured Tesla to rethink its strategy in China. Alongside the Model Y L, filings indicate Tesla is also preparing to introduce a longer-range rear-wheel drive Model 3 in the country.\nEV price war worries regulators\nChina’s EV boom has attracted global headlines, but the competitive intensity has also created concerns about sustainability. Over the past two years, average car prices in China have dropped 19%, with some EV models discounted by as much as 30%.\nThe government has stepped in, warning against what it calls “unfair pricing behavior.” Officials fear that unchecked discounting could destabilize the sector, drawing parallels with the financial risks seen in China’s real estate market.\nIndustry associations have echoed these concerns, urging automakers to pursue more sustainable competition. The combination of overcapacity, declining margins, and regulatory scrutiny means that even market leaders like Tesla cannot afford to rely solely on brand appeal.\nTesla diversifies global bets\nWhile Tesla doubles down on China with localized products, it is also pursuing growth elsewhere. Earlier this month, the company secured a Texas state permit to operate its Tesla Robotaxi service, enabling it to compete with Uber and Lyft.\nThe service, currently in pilot testing in Austin, uses Model Y vehicles equipped with partially automated systems and human safety supervisors. The new permit allows Tesla to expand operations statewide, without requiring human safety drivers.\nAlthough Tesla has long promised to scale robotaxis, delays and safety controversies have slowed progress. In contrast, Chinese robotaxi firms such as Baidu’s Apollo Go have already achieved significant market penetration, completing over 1.4 million rides in Q1 2025 alone.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 20:40:12 +0000", "author": "Newton Kitonga", "source": "https://coincentral.com/news/feed/"}

Investors are taking note of Nebius’s strengthening of both its fundamentals and technical outlook.\nCatalysts Behind the Growth\nA key driver of momentum is the company’s AI subsidiary, Toloka, which secured $72 million in funding during May 2025. The round, led by Bezos Expeditions, underscores growing institutional confidence in Nebius’s role in powering AI model training.\nNebius has also been chipping away at CoreWeave’s market share, offering faster GPU deployment and flexible API integration. Analysts have praised the platform’s developer-first design, making it attractive to startups and enterprise clients building AI solutions.\nGeopolitical factors are also working in Nebius’s favor. With governments worldwide pursuing digital sovereignty, Nebius has become a go-to provider in Europe and Asia, offering localized AI infrastructure that aligns with regulatory preferences.\nFinancial Strength and Guidance\nNebius’s financial results highlight its accelerating trajectory. In Q2 2025, revenue surged 625% year-over-year to $105.10 million. The company also reported positive Adjusted EBITDA, proving its model is not only scalable but also profitable at an early stage.\nNet income reached $502.5 million in Q2, marking a dramatic turnaround from past volatility.

Backed by soaring demand, strong profitability, and a sovereign AI edge, the company is building both the financial and infrastructure base to compete globally. With stock momentum accelerating and returns dwarfing market benchmarks, Nebius stands out as one of the most compelling growth stories in AI infrastructure today.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 20:16:55 +0000", "author": "Yasmin Werner", "source": "https://coincentral.com/news/feed/"}

Adam Back, a key industry executive, fully subscribed to the entire issuance. This funding strengthens Capital B’s strategy to expand its Bitcoin reserves amid shifting global economic conditions.\n€2.2M Capital Raise Finalized Without Pre-Emptive Rights\nThe Board of Directors approved the issuance of 1,000,000 new ordinary shares on August 15, 2025.

The offering will not require an AMF-approved prospectus due to its structure. Capital B will list the new shares on Euronext Growth Paris’s offer compartment.\nThe transaction, structured under delegated authority from the June 10 shareholder meeting, adds fresh capital to the company’s balance sheet. The firm will utilize these proceeds primarily to acquire Bitcoin. This aligns with its aim to increase the number of BTC held per share on a fully diluted basis.\nFulgur Ventures Converts OCAs into Equity\nCapital B confirmed the conversion of 4,760,000 OCA B-01 notes held by Fulgur Ventures. This resulted in the issuance of 8,750,000 new ordinary shares at a conversion price of €0.544 per share. The conversion was settled through a debt set-off and formally recorded by the Board.\nThe conversion price included a 30% premium over the 20-day VWAP calculated before the March 4, 2025 board meeting. This conversion adds significant dilution but supports Capital B’s liquidity and strategic goals. The increase in total shares reinforces its fully diluted equity structure.\nAs a result, the total number of shares increases, though certain instruments like BSA 2025-01 remain unexercised. The fully diluted share count reflects free shares and legal adjustments already committed. However, future potential equity from TOBAM’s €300 million authorization remains excluded for now.\nBitcoin Strategy Strengthens as Capital Grows\nCapital B expects to acquire approximately 17 new Bitcoin from this funding round, raising its total holdings to an estimated 2,218 BTC. The company maintains its position as Europe’s first publicly listed Bitcoin Treasury firm.\nThe move follows a broader trend of companies using Bitcoin as a hedge against macroeconomic risks. Amid inflation and geopolitical shifts, firms like Capital B are adopting BTC as a treasury reserve asset. Bitcoin’s capped supply and decentralized structure appeal as a store of value.\nThe company joins peers like MicroStrategy in strengthening digital asset exposure through balance sheet allocations.

Currently in Stage 4 of its presale, $OZ tokens are available at just $0.005 each. With over $1.6 million raised and more than 80 million tokens sold, early investor interest continues to accelerate—driven by projections that this low entry price could turn into massive profits once the token hits exchanges.\nAt the current rate, a $1,000 investment gives you 200,000 $OZ tokens. If the token launches at $1 as projected by some analysts, that investment could explode to $200,000, delivering a 200x gain—or a staggering 200,000% return. These numbers are attracting attention not just from small retail investors but also from early-stage crypto whales looking to enter before broader exposure sends prices soaring.\nAnalysts Are Already Calling It the Top Presale of 2025\nWhat separates Ozak AI from dozens of other presales is not just the token price or marketing—it’s the project’s compelling fundamentals. The platform is being built as a full-scale AI and blockchain integration hub, focusing on real-world tools like predictive analytics, DeFi automation, and AI agents that assist in trading, research, and decision-making. Analysts have noted that this combination of utility and innovation places Ozak in a unique league—one that could mimic the success trajectories of early breakout tokens like The Graph or Injective.\nBecause of its focus on AI—arguably the hottest theme in both traditional tech and crypto—Ozak AI benefits from a strong narrative. Its potential launch around $1 is not just speculation. Several research reports suggest that given the low token supply, utility, presale traction, and increasing demand for AI-driven Web3 solutions, such a valuation at launch is plausible—and potentially conservative.\nThe Path from $0.005 to $1: Not Just Hype, But Momentum\nSkeptics may be quick to dismiss a 200x return as hype, but the reality is that crypto has repeatedly produced similar stories during strong market cycles. Ozak AI’s tokenomics are designed for scarcity, with a limited supply and a significant portion locked for development and community incentives. Once the presale closes and $OZ hits major exchanges, scarcity combined with demand could push prices up sharply.\nImportantly, Ozak AI is already listed on major data aggregators like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko and has undergone audits by Certik as well as internal security teams. These signals suggest the project is gearing up for a legitimate public launch—not a fly-by-night operation. With more CEX listings expected to follow, the post-launch environment could be highly favorable for early holders.\nBranding That Bridges Culture, AI, and Real-World Experience\nOzak AI’s appeal isn’t only technical—it’s cultural. As part of its broader community engagement strategy, the team has begun rolling out branding elements that connect crypto with real-life experiences, including its signature cocktail range and Vietnamese cà phê campaigns. These elements help create a lifestyle identity around the token, making it more than just a digital asset. In a space crowded with look-alike projects, this type of creativity can drive organic adoption and build a loyal following beyond the presale.\nBy embracing a multi-layered approach that blends technology, culture, and investor incentives, Ozak AI is building a holistic ecosystem—one that’s designed to last and evolve well past the launch.\nFor anyone wondering whether it’s too late to get in, the answer is a clear no. Ozak AI’s presale is still active, and the current entry price of $0.005 offers one of the most favorable risk-reward ratios in the market right now. A $1,000 entry could theoretically become $200,000 if $OZ reaches $1, and higher still if the token sees continued growth post-launch. Even more conservative projections—such as a $0.50 or $0.25 listing—still offer incredible upside.\nIn a market where timing is everything, Ozak AI stands out as a project that combines momentum, innovation, and affordability. If the $1 launch target becomes reality, early believers could indeed find themselves part of the next wave of crypto-made millionaires.\nAbout Ozak AI\nOzak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.\nFor more, visit\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nTwitter: https://x.com/ozakagi\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The goal is to detect illicit activity like money laundering and ensure stronger compliance.\nThe Act requires stablecoin issuers to be treated as financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act. They must comply with federal regulations relating to sanctions, anti-money laundering, customer identification, and due diligence. This aligns with broader national security and financial stability objectives.\nDigital Identity, AI, and APIs to Take Center Stage\nThe Treasury is focusing on how regulated institutions can integrate APIs for seamless data sharing and monitoring. APIs support strict access control, boost transaction visibility, and enhance the integrity of digital asset platforms. These interfaces can link internal systems with external partners to improve compliance.\nArtificial intelligence will play a critical role in analyzing transaction data at scale. Financial institutions may use AI to detect patterns, assess risks, and identify trends related to illicit behavior. These systems are expected to automate detection efforts and improve speed and accuracy.\nDigital identity verification, another focus area, allows firms to confirm user identities with greater precision. By using biometrics and government-issued documents, firms can streamline onboarding and reduce compliance burdens. This technology is also expected to support smart contract execution in decentralized finance environments.\nBlockchain Monitoring and Public-Private Collaboration\nBlockchain monitoring is essential for tracking activities across public ledgers. Financial firms can use blockchain analytics to trace illicit funds, identify high-risk wallets, and review multi-chain transactions. The Treasury and law enforcement agencies have already adopted these tools in investigations.\nThe GENIUS Act encourages innovation but acknowledges that new tools may present cost and operational challenges. Financial institutions must assess privacy risks, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and compliance efficiency when deploying them. Treasury seeks input on how to balance innovation with practical risk mitigation.\nThe Treasury plans to submit a report to Congress based on the responses received. It may lead to new guidance, rulemaking, or policy adjustments that reflect the evolving crypto landscape. GENIUS is a foundational step, but broader digital asset regulation is expected in coming months.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 19:14:09 +0000", "author": "Yasmin Werner", "source": "https://coincentral.com/news/feed/"}

In early August, investors are looking at 18x returns with its mainnet launch on the horizon. With a successful presale and a fast-growing ecosystem, here is how LYNO can turn pre-support into genuine wealth.\nLYNO Early Presale & Growth Drivers\nOne-of-a-kind chances to invest are available at LYNO early bird presale phase at a price of only $0.050 per token. The project has been receiving high interest due to its cross-chain arbitrage system and the use of AI-related characteristics. LYNO is scalable, supported by 15 EVM blockchains and a growing demand of DeFi. With less supply of tokens, the increasing demand may stimulate prices to explode, giving a payoff to early investors.\nAI-Powered DeFi Profits with Big Rewards for Early Investors\nLYNO AI is the decentralized, AI-powered cross-chain arbitrage protocol that increases trading P&L by intelligently automating trading strategies and executing instantly. It leverages four major layers, such as flash loans and dynamic profit settlement, and is efficient and scalable. The holders of the tokens enjoy governance, staking rewards, and up to 60% of protocol profits. LYNO has a good incentive around a Cyberscope audit in addition to a token giveaway of 100,000 tokens to those who attend a presale event. The early presale period is the best period to purchase tokens before the second-phase boom in prices and demand.\nAudited Presale with 100K Token Giveaway for Early Backers\nThey keep It’s simple: LYNO has already prepared a presale that is transparent and totally secure; it supports ETH, USDT, and USDC with safe ERC20 transfers and live Chainlink price feeds, and no manual input or guesswork. To reward users, LYNO will hold a time-limited giveaway of LYNO tokens; a total of 100,000 tokens will be given away, and ten beneficiaries will get 10,000 LYNO each. Participants should be awarded with the completion of social tasks and investing at least $100 in the presale in order to qualify—reward one who is interested and active.\nConclusion: A Rare Window for High-Potential Gains\nLyno is gearing up to become a leader in the DeFi sector, with innovative AI, cross-chain capabilities, and a well-developed token economy. Having an audited presale, good incentives, and a potential to get an 18x return on investments in early August, LYNO is a unique chance to get a step ahead. The current price is the greatest, and as the project moves toward mainnet and its demand starts growing, first movers can become the winners of this new market game changer.\nFor more information about LYNO, visit the links below:\n- Website: https://lyno.ai/\n- Twitter/X: https://x.com/Lyno_AI\n- Telegram: https://t.me/lyno_ai", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 04:23:06 +0000", "author": "Sophia Bennett", "source": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/feed/"}

Don’t Miss Ozak AI at $0.005 – Price Prediction Suggests $2.80 by 2026", "url": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/missed-solana-at-10-dont-miss-ozak-ai-at-0-005-price-prediction-suggests-2-80-by-2026/", "text": "The move of the crypto world is extremely fast, and with some projects such as Solana (SOL), riders who bought early on at just $10 sit on a life-changing profit of thousands of dollars. In August of 2025, Solana is now trading at 180 dollars—a tremendous 19x gain by initial holders. However, Ozak AI ($OZ), an Ethereum-based AI token in its fourth presale stage, might be the breakout opportunity in this cycle. Starting at only $0.005 per one Ozak AI token, the project has already managed to sell more than 160 million tokens and raise over 2 million dollars, and the early investors are anticipating the earnings in the double digits as the launch date draws near.\nClear ROI Math: Why $2.80 is a Game-Changer\nThe presale started at $0.001, so the earliest investors are sitting on a 400 percent profit in the initial round (started at $0.001; $0.005 is a five-fold increase). With the close to the fourth phase, the next level of price will increase to $0.01, which is also far lower than the planned $1 price at launch, which will provide endorsing entrants by its rational potential of 200x. Great momentum in its market, growth in the AI industry and actual adoption make Ozak AI potentially go up to 2.8 dollars by 2026, which translates to a 560x increase ($2.80 / 0.005).\nTo have an effective result, a $250 investment at $0.005 = 50,000 tokens. At $1, that is $50K, and at $2.80, it is $140K. This kind of upside potential was similarly held by Solana when it rewarded the early true believers after the price of SOL rose from $10 to more than $190.\nYoutube embed:\nWhat Sets Ozak AI Apart? Real Tech and Real Use Cases\nWhereas meme tokens depend only on hype, Ozak AI will deliver punchy usefulness by synthesizing complex AI analytics with blockchain. Zones are key features and include:\n- Ozak Stream Network (OSN): Provides real-time, low-latency cross-chain crypto data, needed in trading and analytics.\n- Prediction Agents (PAs): Smart bots built on neural networks and ARIMA algorithms that can be customized and that provide tradable trading and investing market signals.\n- Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN): Offers scalable, secure and distributed infrastructure to run data, reduce fees and not get stuck in blockchain bottlenecks.\nThe native gas is the $OZ token, which can be used in the processes of accessing services and customizing the agents and going through the governance process. Utility and demand are directly related to the further evolution of the ecosystem.\nTransparent Roadmap, Strong Audits, and Growing Partnerships\nThe Ozak AI team has shared a roadmap based on milestones, which encompasses:\n- Q3 2025: The beta version of the customizable Prediction Agent dashboard.\n- Q4 2025: OSN and DePIN are completely integrated with the big exchanges.\n- May 2026: Open developer API, AI analytics platform, and SDK.\nCertiK and SolidProof performed security audits, guaranteeing greater confidence of institutional and retail investors. Collaborations with Hive Intel and Manta Network also increase the scope of practical and technical connections of Ozak AI.\nConclusion\nNot only does Ozak AI permit early investors to obtain outsized returns, but it also has, thus far into its development, passed a real, audited product, a solid roadmap and a demonstrated presale fundraising track record. Ozak AI is trading in a prime position to take advantage of the latest influx of investors looking to generate AI-driven profits in the crypto space in a follow-up run to Solana, following its largest rise in history to $10. Do your own due diligence, but don’t wait any longer until the next price change—such a chance may not come again.\nFor more information about Ozak AI, visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nDisclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.

W has shown a bullish divergence on higher timeframes, which many analysts see as a possible turning point. Trading activity and on-chain data are also being examined as market participants look for confirmation of a shift in momentum.\nWormhole Technical Patterns and Market Signals\nSeveral analysts have pointed to bullish setups on Wormhole charts. Crypto Rover noted that $W is showing a weekly bullish divergence between price and RSI. The RSI moved higher while the token set lower lows, which is often watched for reversal signs.\nTraderPA also stated that $W has been trading in a multi-month consolidation phase and suggested a sharp bounce could follow. He remarked that the token has the potential for a “3x” move once momentum shifts. Open4profit pointed to an inverse head and shoulders formation, describing it as a pattern suggesting momentum change.\nOn the weekly timeframe, $W traded at around $0.25 in mid-August after declining from earlier highs near $0.40.

Resistance remains near $0.35, while traders also monitor $0.22 as a support level.\nAnalyst Views and On-Chain Metrics\nMichaël van de Poppe described $W as one of his preferred tokens and pointed to bullish divergences across multiple timeframes. He emphasized that the token appeared “on the edge of breaking out” and noted that the Wormhole team continued to deliver new features.\nRecent developments include the introduction of Portal Earn, a service allowing users to bridge, swap, stake, and earn rewards. Analysts say such product launches can support network adoption, especially when paired with new incentive mechanisms. Open4profit also mentioned that incentives usually attract more users to a protocol.\nBullish setup on Wormhole $W\nInverse Head & Shoulders pattern signaling momentum shift.\nWormhole’s PortalBridge also announced Portal Earn where you can earn points from bridging, swapping, and staking\nIncentives always fuel adoption. 🚀 pic.twitter.com/XTqPHbYhjF\n— Open4profit (@open4profit) August 18, 2025\nOn-chain data has shown an increase in Wormhole’s total value locked, which rose 20% in the past month to reach $1.2 billion.

The latest figures show a growing shift toward Ethereum as investors search for long-term opportunities.\nRecord Inflows into Ethereum Spot ETFs\nLast week, ETH spot ETFs recorded around 649,000 ETH in net inflows, according to Glassnode data. This marked the largest weekly inflow to date, with Ethereum closing near 4,500 dollars before briefly touching 4,740 dollars.\nThese ETF inflows reflect the increasing role of institutions in supporting Ethereum’s price trajectory. The demand is further driven by BlackRock’s ETHA product, which has become the largest holder among ETH ETFs with more than 3.4 million ETH.\nCoinShares also reported that inflows into ETH investment products totaled 2.9 billion dollars last week. This strong appetite has placed Ethereum ahead of other digital assets in attracting institutional funds.\nAnalysts View Ethereum as a Macro Asset\nCommentary from market analysts points to Ethereum’s positioning as a prime macro asset for the next decade. Ted, an investor, noted in a post on X that Ethereum has a wide moat, increasing adoption, and regulatory clarity. He compared its 500 billion dollar market capitalization with Bitcoin and gold, which are many times larger.\n$ETH is the best macro asset to invest and hold for the next 5-10 years.\nIt has a strong moat, institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, spot ETFs etc.\nAnd it's still trading at $500B MCap while $BTC and Gold are 5x-50x higher.\nDon't fade Ethereum. pic.twitter.com/GcTK8i0nAs\n— Ted (@TedPillows) August 18, 2025\nEthereum’s performance is also being supported by corporate treasuries. Recent data shows 69 companies now hold 17.3 billion dollars in ETH, which represents about 3.4 percent of the supply. This adoption by corporations adds another layer of support for long-term investors.\nAnother factor is growing network usage, with daily transactions reaching 1.74 million on August 5. Stablecoin transfers, DeFi activity, and layer 2 scaling have been driving this activity higher.\nKey Price Levels and Institutional Treasury Growth\nEthereum closed last week at $4,475, its highest level since November 2021. Analysts are watching the $4,000-4,150 support range, as this level previously acted as strong resistance. If Ethereum maintains this zone, analysts expect further consolidation before the next rally.\nOn the upside, a close above $4,550 could open the way to new all-time highs between $5,000 and $5,800. This technical structure, combined with steady ETF inflows, keeps Ethereum in focus for traders and institutions alike.\nMeanwhile, ETHZilla Corporation has entered the market with one of the largest public corporate Ethereum treasuries. The company, which recently rebranded from biotech firm 180 Life Sciences, now holds 94,675 ETH worth 419 million dollars. Backed by Polychain, Founders Fund, and DeFi leaders, ETHZilla plans to use staking and DeFi strategies to generate returns.\nThis move signals a shift toward Ethereum as a store of value and income-generating asset.

This transfer, reported on August 18, 2025, may signal a deposit to a centralized exchange like Binance. Such moves have been followed by the sale of Bitcoin in Bhutan. For example, on August 5 the government moved 517 Bitcoin, worth 59 million USD, to Cobo Custody. In July, it transferred 650 Bitcoin worth the equivalent of 74 million dollars to Binance. Such regular transfers have created speculations on the Bitcoin plan of Bhutan.\nBhutan Holds Nearly 10,000 Bitcoin Worth $1.15B, Sixth Among Nations\nAccording to Arkham Intelligence, Bhutan’s investment arm, Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), continues to hold 9,969 Bitcoin, which is valued at more than 1.15 billion dollars. This makes Bhutan the sixth largest government holder of Bitcoins after the U.S, China, the U.K., Ukrain,e and North Korea. It started stockpiling Bitcoin in 2019, taking advantage of low prices and hydropower to mine it cleanly. Therefore, its reserves of Bitcoin have increased considerably, and they are currently one of the most significant assets of the country.\nHowever, such transfers have led to issues over the 3 billion dollar debt that Bhutan owes the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In 2023, Bhutan received a loan of 400 million dollars in IMF to overcome the economic difficulties such as the stagnation of the GDP and unemployment. The IMF has been skeptical of cryptocurrencies and has cautioned that they have the potential to cause instability to economies. Other critics fear that Bhutan Bitcoin sales might be a move to cope with its debt payments. As an example, selling Bitcoin may be used to pay IMF loans, particularly when the price of Bitcoin soared to 120,000 in July 2025.\nRelated Reading: Is Bhutan Cashing In? $74M Bitcoin Transfer to Binance at $120K+ Peak | Live Bitcoin News\nOn the other hand, Bhutan’s Bitcoin moves may reflect strategic profit-taking. It has also sold off parts of its assets at market peaks like the 33.31 million sale to Binance in November 2024. Such sales coincide with the bullish sentiments of Bitcoin indicating that Bhutan is exploiting price jumps. In addition, Bhutan has adopted crypto into its economy. In May 2025, it introduced a national crypto payment system to tourism in cooperation with Binance Pay and DK Bank. This demonstrates how Bhutan is willing to integrate digital resources into its financial plan.\nBhutan’s Bitcoin Moves Raise Questions Over Long-Term Holdings\nBhutan has both crypto challenges despite its proactive crypto policies. The unstable internet connections act as a deterrent in wider adoption. Moreover, the conservative approach to crypto by the IMF may compel Bhutan to cut its dependence on Bitcoin deposits. Critics say the regular sales may undermine the future hold of Bhutan as one of the large Bitcoin holders. On the other hand, the proponents view these decisions as a smart financial strategy that is a trade-off between paying off its debts and the potential of the crypto market.\nTo sum up, the 800 Bitcoin transfer by Bhutan has become a source of controversy regarding its motives. Although it might be ready to sell on Binance, there is still a cloud of doubt regarding its debt to the IMF and the place of the crypto in its economy. Bhutan has a total of $1.15 billion in Bitcoin assets, which make the country a major participant in the global crypto market. The government has got its eyes on the government as it treads economic pressures and market opportunities.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 23:30:48 +0000", "author": "Bilal Hassan", "source": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/feed/"}

The token has continued its upward movement while most cryptocurrencies face pressure, leading to renewed focus on its potential role in traditional and decentralized finance.\nTraders Eye Supply Shock as Institutions Turn to Chainlink\nRekt Fencer, founder of X DAO, stated that “$LINK IS GOING TO $300 THIS CYCLE,” pointing to integrations with SWIFT, Visa, and Mastercard. He argued that Chainlink is becoming a key bridge to decentralized finance and real-world asset tokenization, while also warning that supply on exchanges is drying up.\nThis view reflects a growing narrative that Chainlink could face a supply shock, as more tokens move into long-term holdings or institutional use. Analysts believe that such a trend may support price stability and potential growth, especially as adoption expands beyond the crypto-native ecosystem.\nTechnical Outlook and Market Performance\nEmperorBTC, a crypto market analyst, noted that Chainlink had been “the strongest coin from all the majors” in recent sessions. He highlighted a 13% daily gain followed by continued strength, suggesting the next resistance zone lies around the $29 mark. However, he also said that if Bitcoin weakens, Chainlink may retest the $20 level before attempting another rally.\n1. Strongest coin from all the majors in the past two days. +13% yesterday and barely pulled back today.\n2. If market can stabilise, including BTC holding $115,000 then I expect this to consolidate a bit and then go for the weekly level at $29.\n3. Large pullback or lower… pic.twitter.com/Q2xumFQx1Z\n— Emperor👑 (@EmperorBTC) August 18, 2025\nDespite market volatility, Chainlink’s performance has been reinforced by its ability to maintain price levels while the broader market declined. Data from CoinGecko showed the token gaining 1.5% on a day when the total crypto market cap fell 3.5%. Technical indicators, including the relative strength index and MACD, also suggest strong buying activity in recent days.\nPartnerships, Whale Activity, and Real-World Asset Expansion\nRecent reports have drawn attention to Chainlink’s strategic partnerships and its expanding role in tokenization. Last week, the network announced a deal with Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), adding to its existing work with global financial players. Industry estimates suggest that demand for tokenized real-world assets could reach $30.1 trillion by 2034, with Chainlink seeking to provide data and infrastructure support.\nOn-chain data also shows increasing whale activity. Santiment reported that large holders accumulated more than 2M LINK coins within a week, reducing the available supply on exchanges. This aligns with growing daily trading volumes, which reached more than $3 billion, the highest since December.\nChainlink now secures over $92B in value across 60 blockchains through more than 2,000 oracles, supporting over 450 applications. By comparison, the XRP Ledger hosts a much smaller DeFi ecosystem, securing about $100 million. With rising institutional engagement and continued ecosystem growth, Chainlink’s position as a key infrastructure provider appears increasingly established.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 23:08:11 +0000", "author": "Samuel", "source": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/feed/"}

The cryptocurrency recently broke out of a falling wedge, a formation often linked with trend reversals, and traders now look at $2.27 as a potential long-term target.\nTechnical Structure and Market Position\nArbitrum has been consolidating near the $0.51 to $0.54 range, an area considered crucial by traders. Arbitrum is holding above the 20-day exponential moving average at $0.43 but continues to test the 50-day exponential moving average near $0.53. This area also matches the lower boundary of the Ichimoku Cloud, creating a strong resistance zone that must be cleared for momentum to continue.\nMarket indicators present mixed conditions. The Relative Strength Index stands around 54, signaling neutral momentum, while the MACD remains on the bullish side with green histogram bars supporting upward momentum. Bollinger Bands suggest that the price is oscillating near its middle band, while volume levels remain steady at more than $130 million on Binance.\nArbitrum Breakout and Price Targets\nBitcoinsensus reported that Arbitrum has exited a weekly falling wedge formation, which is a setup often linked with strong reversals. According to their analysis, this structure suggests a possible 400 percent rise if momentum persists, taking the token to $2.27. The short-term resistance remains near $0.58, while a break above $0.54 could open the path toward $0.65.\nTrader Posty also commented on Arbitrum’s price movement, saying he remains long despite uncertainty. “Surprisingly still long here as price has shown enough strength to not be invalidated,” he said, noting that the market remains undecided but resilient. This cautious approach mirrors the broader market view, where traders are monitoring support near $0.43 while waiting for confirmation of a breakout.\nSurprisingly still long here as price has shown enough strength to not be invalidated.\nDon't love it, don't hate it.\nWill let this one play out. https://t.co/6cRdErsfgC pic.twitter.com/gtBlHrn61j\n— Posty (@PostyXBT) August 18, 2025\nSupport, Resistance, and Trader Outlook\nThe keyword Arbitrum continues to attract attention as its price hovers above multiple moving averages. Arbitrum sits well above the simple moving average 200 at $0.39, which signals that the long-term trend remains upward despite recent volatility. Analysts warn, however, that if $0.43 is lost, the market could revisit levels near $0.38 and possibly $0.36.\nShort-term traders are focusing on the $0.51 to $0.56 range, where liquidity has remained strong. Aggressive traders see the current level as a possible entry point, with stops below $0.48 and targets toward $0.58. More conservative traders prefer to wait for a pullback near $0.45 to $0.47 to improve the risk-to-reward setup.\nLong-term investors are watching whether Arbitrum can retest $0.77, which aligns with the 200-day exponential moving average and serves as a psychological barrier. Should the token maintain momentum above $0.54 and confirm strength, analysts believe the $2.27 level remains possible within the next trend cycle.", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 01:08:59 +0000", "author": "Samuel", "source": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/feed/"}
{"title": "Best Crypto Presale — MAGACOIN FINANCE Accumulated by Chainlink & Ethereum Whales for 2025 Growth", "url": "https://crypto-economy.com/best-crypto-presale-magacoin-finance-accumulated-by-chainlink-ethereum-whales-for-2025-growth/", "text": "NEW YORK – Fresh on-chain data reveals that some of the biggest crypto investors are quietly making bold moves. Large-scale holders of Chainlink (LINK) and Ethereum (ETH) have been steadily increasing their positions, while also targeting smaller-cap assets that could deliver outsized returns. One project drawing particular attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts now describe as a potential 2025 “moonshot” thanks to a mix of whale accumulation and growing demand for Ethereum-based treasuries.\nWhale Activity Signals High-Conviction Bet\nMitrade’s latest analytics report shows that over $1.4 billion in capital has been rotated into the crypto market by whale wallets in just the past week. A substantial portion has gone into Chainlink and Ethereum, strengthening bullish sentiment around both projects. Yet beneath the surface, another trend is forming: whales are accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE at an increasing pace.\nAnalysts suggest this isn’t a coincidence but a calculated play. While Ethereum and Chainlink provide stability and long-term growth, smaller-cap tokens often deliver the exponential upside investors crave during an altcoin cycle. Forecasts point to MAGACOIN FINANCE offering 43x to as high as 70x ROI, with some projections even calling for gains of up to 12,000% if momentum continues into late 2025.\nMAGACOIN FINANCE Positioned for Breakout\nWhat sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its ability to combine strong fundamentals with early-stage growth potential. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, it offers DeFi staking features that align with the surge in ETH treasury demand. With institutions pouring $663 million into ETH ETFs in a single week, projects tied closely to Ethereum’s ecosystem are benefiting from a powerful tailwind.\nThis positioning, coupled with HashEx-certified security and an ongoing CertiK audit, gives MAGACOIN FINANCE an added layer of credibility often missing in meme-driven coins. Analysts note that whales accumulating now are likely anticipating exchange listings and staking expansions later this year, which could drive the next wave of adoption.\nEthereum Treasury Demand Reshaping the Market\nEthereum’s rise is more than just a price story. Institutional adoption through ETFs has created a treasury-building trend, where corporations and funds are diversifying into ETH-based assets. This has led to an increased appetite for projects that offer utility within the Ethereum framework. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits this narrative perfectly, aligning itself with Ethereum’s ecosystem while offering an alternative route to yield generation.\n2025 Moonshot Potential\nWith Bitcoin consolidating, capital is clearly rotating into both established altcoins and emerging projects with strong communities. History has shown that these market conditions often precede an altcoin season, where smaller-cap assets outperform dramatically. For many investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the kind of early-entry opportunity that could echo the explosive growth once seen with XRP, SHIBA INU, and DOGE.\nThe mix of whale activity, Ethereum’s institutional-driven momentum, and a credible roadmap positions MAGACOIN FINANCE as a prime candidate to define the next leg of the 2025 bull market.\nTo learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit:\nWebsite: https://magacoinfinance.com\nAccess: https://magacoinfinance.com/access\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance\nTelegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

{"title": "Best Crypto Presale 2025 — Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out as Ethereum & Stablecoins Grow", "url": "https://crypto-economy.com/best-crypto-presale-2025-why-magacoin-finance-stands-out-as-ethereum-stablecoins-grow/", "text": "The cryptocurrency market in 2025 is entering a defining stage, with institutional players weighing in on where the next wave of growth may come from. One of the latest signals comes from JPMorgan, which has connected the rapid rise of stablecoins to Ethereum’s expanding role as the backbone of tokenized finance. This connection has reinforced bullish sentiment across the altcoin sector, with investors searching for the next standout opportunities. Among the most discussed is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale project that many early backers believe could rival the explosive gains of past cycle giants.\nStablecoins Driving Ethereum’s Next Phase\nJPMorgan’s research points to a direct link between stablecoin adoption and Ethereum’s dominance in decentralized finance. With more than $160 billion in stablecoin circulation, demand for scalable and secure blockchain infrastructure continues to grow. Ethereum, despite competition from Solana and other networks, remains the leading settlement layer for stablecoins, smart contracts, and tokenized real-world assets. The bank’s analysts suggest that this trend could push Ethereum’s valuation to new heights as institutional and retail adoption deepen.\nThe stablecoin boom isn’t just strengthening Ethereum’s position — it’s reshaping investor strategies. As confidence grows in Ethereum’s long-term role, capital is beginning to flow into high-upside projects that could benefit from the next wave of adoption.\nWhy Investors Are Watching This Rising Star\nAmid this shift, MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured major attention as one of 2025’s standout presales. The project is being recognized for its scarcity-driven model, with supply limited and demand climbing rapidly. Early participants have already seen allocation rounds sell out in record time, signaling strong momentum. Analysts note that forecasts estimate MAGACOIN FINANCE could reach up to 10,500% gains before the cycle peak, making it one of the few presales investors are prioritizing for multi-year growth potential.\nWhat sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its commitment to utility expansion and ecosystem development, ensuring that early backers aren’t just betting on hype but on a foundation designed for long-term relevance. This blend of scarcity, community growth, and development has made it a focal point in crypto investment circles this year.\nEthereum’s Outlook for 2025\nAs Ethereum’s utility widens through stablecoins, DeFi, and real-world asset tokenization, expectations for its price continue to build. The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. has opened the floodgates for institutional inflows, adding another layer of demand. If stablecoin adoption keeps accelerating at the pace JPMorgan suggests, Ethereum could see a stronger-than-expected run heading into 2026.\nInvestors who are bullish on Ethereum’s growth trajectory are also diversifying into promising altcoin projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, creating a dual strategy that combines the security of established assets with the explosive upside of emerging opportunities.\nConclusion\nJPMorgan’s analysis linking stablecoin adoption to Ethereum growth highlights just how much potential remains in the crypto sector. Ethereum looks poised to benefit from its dominant role, but investors seeking outsized gains are turning to presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where scarcity and strong demand point to significant upside. If the forecasts prove accurate, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be one of 2025’s most profitable plays, making it a top contender in the race for the next breakout success.\nTo learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit:\nWebsite: https://magacoinfinance.com\nAccess: https://magacoinfinance.com/access\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance\nTelegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

With XRP’s outlook now clearer, attention has quickly shifted toward the next big movers. Cardano and Shiba Inu are already under the spotlight, but many analysts are also watching emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which could hold even greater upside potential.\nCardano: A Slow but Steady Climber\nCardano has earned a reputation as one of the most research-driven projects in the crypto space. With its methodical approach, peer-reviewed development, and upcoming upgrades such as Hydra scaling, ADA continues to attract serious institutional attention. Some are even speculating about a potential ETF, which could further validate Cardano as a blue-chip asset in the crypto world.\nWhile ADA is seen as fundamentally strong, its large market cap of around $33 billion makes the chances of explosive short-term growth limited. Analysts see Cardano as more of a steady climber, with predictions suggesting it could hold between $1–$2 if broader bullish sentiment continues.\nShiba Inu: The Meme Powerhouse\nShiba Inu takes the opposite route. Known for its community-driven hype, SHIB thrives on speculation and viral momentum. Its relatively smaller market cap, hovering near $9 billion, makes it more likely than Cardano to pull off a dramatic run if social media buzz and investor FOMO align.\nHowever, SHIB’s weakness lies in its fundamentals. Despite launching Shibarium, its utility remains modest, with little traction in DeFi. For investors, SHIB is a high-risk, high-reward gamble – capable of explosive moves but reliant on hype rather than real-world adoption.\nThe Case for MAGACOIN FINANCE\nBeyond these well-known players, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining recognition as a fresh altcoin contender. Analysts have highlighted it as one of the few projects with the potential for breakout growth similar to early-stage meme coins like Shiba Inu, but with a stronger roadmap and utility expansion in play. Early investors are already pointing to forecasts of over 7,800% potential ROI, making MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out as a project that blends speculative upside with long-term development goals. As presale supply continues to sell out rapidly, scarcity is building, giving it an edge as one of the most sought-after opportunities in the current cycle.\nWhich Altcoin Wins the Race?\nUltimately, the decision depends on investor strategy. Cardano offers slower, institutional-backed growth rooted in real-world use cases. Shiba Inu provides a chance at a hype-driven rally fueled by its loyal community. MAGACOIN FINANCE, however, is drawing attention as a new entry with one of the most aggressive upside projections in the market today.\nThe post-XRP rally has reignited optimism across altcoins, and while no project is without risk, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a top contender for those seeking the next big breakout story.\nTo learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit:\nWebsite: https://magacoinfinance.com\nAccess: https://magacoinfinance.com/access\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance\nTelegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

This is bound to deliver steady growth potential for investors willing to be patient. Meanwhile, DOT provides ecosystem diversification that would appeal to those betting on interoperability and long-term adoption.\nMAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, represents the speculative edge that can yield 35x returns and a crypto presale model designed to capture market attention.\nTogether, these assets reflect the spectrum of opportunity in today’s crypto market. It shows the reliability of established blue chips to the high-risk and high-reward upside of emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE.\nTo learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit:\nWebsite: https://magacoinfinance.com\nAccess: https://magacoinfinance.com/access\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance\nTelegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

The latest upswing comes as traders pile in, with daily trading volume jumping to $6.57 million, a sharp 25% increase that highlights growing short-term demand. This volume surge suggests renewed attention from both retail buyers and active market participants.\nWith over 24 billion DEGEN already circulating, the token benefits from strong market liquidity, making it easier for large inflows of capital to move the price. The rising trading activity also points to a strengthening community presence, which has been a driving force behind DEGEN’s momentum. If the pace of participation continues, the token could be setting the stage for another leg higher in the days ahead.\nHousecoin Surges as Trading Activity Heats Up\nHousecoin (HOUSE) has seen a strong price jump, rising 8.51% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.02181. The move comes alongside growing investor interest, with 24-hour trading volume climbing to $7.4 million, suggesting that momentum is building as more traders enter the market.\nThis surge is backed by a nearly fully circulating supply of 998.62 million HOUSE out of 1 billion total, meaning limited inflation is left to weigh on price action. The healthy trading volume compared to its market cap points to strong liquidity, which often signals confidence from both retail and short-term traders. If demand continues at this pace, HOUSE could be setting up for further upside in the near term.\nFinal Words\nMoonBull whipping up 1000x crypto excitement connects with investors craving the next big leap. The whitelist is live now, and only those quick enough to act will secure that insider edge before the floodgates open.

{"title": "3 Best Altcoins to Buy Now as Solana Targets $420 and Avalanche Holds Gains", "url": "https://crypto-economy.com/3-best-altcoins-to-buy-now-as-solana-targets-420-and-avalanche-holds-gains/", "text": "The crypto market is heating up again as August 2025 kicks off with a surge in altcoin momentum. Bitcoin is steady above $119,000, but the real action is shifting toward high-performing altcoins. Solana has become the clear leader of the rally with analysts projecting a path toward $420, while Avalanche is joining the breakout with growing strength. Alongside these two, analysts are highlighting one emerging name, MAGACOIN FINANCE, as part of the top three altcoins to buy now for big upside.\nSolana (SOL) on Track for $420\nSolana has staged an impressive comeback after its Q2 slump. Currently hovering near $190, the token has climbed more than 20% in just a week. Network activity is thriving, with TVL above $10 billion and daily users increasing rapidly. Institutional interest is also on the rise, with speculation of a Spot Solana ETF fueling strong inflows.\nFrom a technical perspective, SOL’s charts are showing a powerful cup-and-handle setup. Analysts say a break above $250 could trigger a run toward $420 this year, while some long-term projections even stretch to the $6,300 range. Nearer term, a peak in the $270-$280 zone is expected in September.\nAvalanche (AVAX) Showing Strength\nAvalanche is another altcoin catching investor attention. Although it has been consolidating in the mid-$20s, the project’s expanding subnet ecosystem and enterprise applications point to strong fundamentals. If AVAX can break above the $30 resistance, analysts believe a rally toward $34-$38 is on the table by the end of Q3. A return to its all-time highs would mark a massive upside opportunity, reinforcing its position as one of the leaders of this bull run.\nThe New Factor That Could Shake Up the Market\nWhile Solana and Avalanche are grabbing headlines, smart investors are also looking at earlier-stage opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a standout presale project, with analysts projecting potential gains of over 7,800% for early investors. Each funding round has sold out quickly, signaling strong demand. Compared to the early days of some of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting attention for its growing ecosystem and investor rewards. With presale allocations running low, analysts highlight it as one of the 3 best altcoins to buy now before broader market rotation accelerates.\nOther Altcoins to Keep on the Radar\nEthereum continues to surge above $4,600, strengthened by spot ETF inflows and its dominant role in DeFi. Injective (INJ) has been gaining ground thanks to its fast, low-cost cross-chain trading infrastructure, while Cardano offers a steadier play with ongoing upgrades and strong network stability around $0.92.\nThese projects underline the depth of opportunity in the current bull market, but timing and diversification remain crucial.\nConclusion\nSolana’s run toward $420 and Avalanche’s breakout potential are leading the way in this altcoin rally, while Ethereum, Injective, and Cardano provide additional options for investors. Yet, for those seeking early-stage growth with massive upside potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a high-reward play that could define this cycle’s breakout success.\nTo learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit:\nWebsite: https://magacoinfinance.com\nAccess: https://magacoinfinance.com/access\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance\nTelegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

This fast-rising crypto presale is quickly becoming one of August 2025’s biggest talking points.\nThis is unsurprising as their move is being supercharged by a limited-time 50% crypto presale bonus, which has accelerated adoption and fueled a sense of urgency among traders looking for early-stage exposure.\nConsidering this, market Analysts now describe MAGACOIN FINANCE as the best crypto to buy right now, pointing to the whale momentum and outsized upside compared to more mature competitors.\nWhy Crypto Whales Are Pivoting Away From XRP, Solana, and SHIB\n- XRP remains a strong institutional play, with forecasts of $5–$13 by 2025, but whales see limited room for exponential returns at its current maturity.\n- Solana is benefiting from ETF momentum and continues to attract inflows, but much of the near-term upside has already been priced in.\n- Shiba Inu (SHIB) still commands a loyal community, yet whale activity has cooled as returns shrink compared to its early breakout days.\nIn comparison, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still a crypto presale that is offering whales something they cannot find in the other majors like the asymmetry, meme-driven virality, and audited security wrapped into one.\nMAGACOIN FINANCE: The Crypto Presale With Multi-Cycle Potential\nAnalysts highlight several reasons why whales are converging on MAGACOIN FINANCE, the best crypto presale in the market:\n- Explosive ROI potential: Projections range from 3,500% to 20,000% for early adopters, far exceeding expectations for XRP, Solana, or SHIB.\n- Massive whale accumulation: Large wallets from Dogecoin, Cardano, and PEPE ecosystems are actively loading into MAGACOIN FINANCE.\n- Community-first design: With no VC allocations and verified audits by HashEx and CertiK, the project has quickly built trust.\n- Utility beyond hype: Unlike legacy meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building DeFi features designed for growth across multiple cycles.\nThe Verdict\nWhile XRP and Solana remain reliable institutional plays, and SHIB continues to trade on meme nostalgia, the smart money is already rotating out of those assets and into MAGACOIN FINANCE.\nWhale activity confirms that this is where the next wave of outsized returns could come from.\nWith audits complete, a surging community of 12,000+ holders, and a 50% presale bonus driving rapid adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being framed as not just another meme coin — but the best crypto to buy right now for investors chasing high-upside exposure in 2025.\nTo learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit:\nWebsite: https://magacoinfinance.com\nAccess: https://magacoinfinance.com/access\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance\nTelegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

Each altcoin presents unique data points that suggest different price outlooks from forecasts to growing adoption. Analysts are tracking ROI scenarios, network activity, and upcoming milestones across these projects.\nSolana Price Action is Facing Mixed Signals\nSolana surged to $205 after an 18% two-day rally and briefly held above $200 before falling to $191. The move pushed its market cap to $107 billion, second only to BNB at $117 billion. But on-chain activity remains a helping factor for SOL as transactions rose 48% over the past 30 days and network fees climbed 43%.\nSolana’s futures funding rate currently sits at 12% which is a level that shows careful optimism but not outright bullish confidence. Traders remain mindful of past failures to sustain momentum above $200. At the same time, exchange activity has fallen for the third week in a row, with weekly volumes at $20.6 billion.\nAnalysts note that nothing rules out a move toward $250, but they said the absence of leverage and declining DEX participation suggest that further gains will rely on retail involvement and ETF inflows.\nStellar (XLM) is Eyeing Breakout Levels\nStellar (XLM) is attracting attention after analysts highlighted parallels with past cycles. Based on historical chart patterns and Fibonacci projections, forecasts by Javon Marks suggest a possible push from $0.43 to $0.79 in the short term with long-term upside toward $8.\nThe analysis points to a descending triangle breakout as a trigger for further gains. However, market participants stress that XLM must first overcome multiple barriers before any larger rally can unfold.\nVeChain’s Setup\nVeChain (VET) is trading at $0.025 after a 2.94% daily gain, supported by modest buying activity as it currently stands near $2.17 billion. The Galactica Upgrade which introduced full burning of VTHO transaction fees adds a scarcity element that could support value over time.\nAnalyst Vuori Trading has forecasted a surge in VeChain (VET) market capitalisation to at least $12 billion (a 5x increase from its current $2.17 billion) based on Fibonacci retracement analysis.\nMAGACOIN Finance Adds Altcoin Entry Point\nMAGACOIN Finance is gaining traction in 2025 as part of the conversation around top altcoins under $1. Analysts group it alongside SHIB, PEPE, and TRON as key entry points for retail crypto participants this year. The project combines meme coin appeal with DeFi-focused functionality which makes it attractive in a segment that values both accessibility and usability.\nAnalyst forecasts for ROI range widely, with scenarios of 35x up to 15,000x discussed in coverage of the project. While future movements remain market-dependent, MAGACOIN Finance continues to attract attention as an affordable altcoin positioned for broader adoption.\nMain Takeaway\nSolana, XLM, Vet and MAGACOIN Finance are shaping the 2025 altcoin discussion. Solana is showing different signals as Stellar hopes for a breakout and VeChain ranges ahead of possible moves. At the same time, MAGACOIN Finance is adding to the list of low-entry altcoins analysts are tracking for ROI forecasts.\nAccess MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.\n- Website: https://magacoinfinance.com\n- Presale: https://magacoinfinance.com/presale\n- X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance\n- Telegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

{"title": "Cardano Price Surges to $0.9189, Arctic Pablo Coin Smashes $3.5M Presale Milestone, Best Crypto to Buy Today While Dogwifhat and Apecoin Push Forward", "url": "https://crypto-economy.com/cardano-price-surges-to-0-9189-arctic-pablo-coin-smashes-3-5m-presale-milestone-best-crypto-to-buy-today-while-dogwifhat-and-apecoin-push-forward/", "text": "Have you ever caught yourself saying, “you should’ve bought that earlier”? The crypto market is filled with these regret stories. When Dogwifhat started its climb, and Apecoin gained traction from the BAYC brand, only a few believed. Today, both coins are trending. But there’s a new contender making headlines, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). Its presale isn’t just ticking, it’s roaring, having already raised over $3.5 million.\nWith weekly token burns, high ROI forecasts, and a 100% bonus still active, this could be the last low-entry opportunity. Investors are rushing in, knowing the heat always comes after the freeze. Missing out now could mean watching Arctic Pablo become the next viral crypto from the sidelines. This article breaks down Arctic Pablo Coin, Dogwifhat, and Apecoin updates, but Arctic Pablo is the one raising eyebrows across the market.\nArctic Pablo’s Deflation Strategy: Scarcity that Rewards the Bold\nOne of the biggest reasons Arctic Pablo shines as the Best Crypto to Buy Today is its deflationary approach. Most meme coins release an endless supply, slowly crushing the token’s value. But Arctic Pablo flips the script. Every week during the presale, unsold tokens are burned forever, gone from circulation. And after the presale? Any leftovers go up in flames, too. All burns are publicly recorded on Binance Smart Chain, adding transparency and investor trust.\nThis mechanism ensures that the token supply continues to shrink, making every held token more valuable. Investors looking for long-term upside, not just a quick flip, are finding Arctic Pablo Coin’s structure compelling. In a market where scarcity drives price, $APC is designed to thrive. It’s not just hype, it’s smart math. With token burn proof and weekly supply cuts, Arctic Pablo isn’t playing the same game as the rest. It’s rewriting the rules for meme coin longevity.\nStage 37: “Ice Ice Baby” Presale Melts Doubt with 809% ROI Potential\nStage 37 of Arctic Pablo’s meme coin presale, dubbed “Ice Ice Baby”, is generating serious buzz. The token price stands at just $0.00088, and investors are flooding in. With over $3.5 million raised and a 100% bonus for using the code BONUS100 (case sensitive), every dollar invested gets you double the tokens. Invest $1,000 now, and you receive 2,272,720 APC.\nWhen Arctic Pablo hits its $0.008 listing price, that becomes $18,181.76. Experts even project a future cost of $0.1, turning your initial stake into over $113,000. But this window won’t stay open. Once Stage 37 ends, the price increases, and the 100% bonus may vanish. The slogans say it all: Ice Ice Baby, Double Your Tokens Before the Heat Hits. Chill Out With a 100% Token Bonus. This is more than marketing; it’s real math, real timing, and real urgency. Arctic Pablo shines as the Best Crypto to Buy Today, and this moment won’t last.\nDogwifhat Surges with $276M Volume, But Will It Last?\nDogwifhat is back in the spotlight. Priced at $0.867946 and recording a 24-hour trading volume of over $276 million, it’s once again capturing the meme coin crowd. With support from influencers, whales, and centralized exchanges, it’s no surprise Dogwifhat is wagging its way into headlines. But the real question remains, can it hold the momentum? Many traders are chasing the rise, but in crypto, those who hesitate often lose. Timing is everything.\nThe climb could lead to bigger gains or a hard fall. Right now, it’s hot, but that heat could cool quickly. Blink, and this window might close for good. While Dogwifhat continues attracting buzz, savvy investors are also looking for newer opportunities with higher entry leverage. Arctic Pablo shines as the Best Crypto to Buy Today for those eyeing long-term ROI, not just the meme cycle. Will Dogwifhat bark louder tomorrow, or fade into the noise? Only time will tell.\nApecoin Rises on Ecosystem Strength, But Needs Fuel for Lift-Off\nApecoin is trading at $0.6051 with a daily volume exceeding $38 million. It’s backed by the cultural powerhouse BAYC and has long been tied to NFT innovation. While newer meme coins try to ride temporary trends, Apecoin continues to maintain relevance thanks to its DAO and community. With upcoming developments, many believe a catalyst could reignite Apecoin’s momentum. Still, price growth has been slow. Without a spark, it risks falling behind faster-moving tokens.\nInvestors are watching closely, but not everyone is betting big. Some want something fresher, with explosive growth potential right now. Arctic Pablo Coin, with its current bonus and aggressive burn mechanism, offers an appealing combination. While Apecoin’s value may hold long-term, the short-term surge that many crave could come from another direction entirely. Those who miss timing in this market often pay the price. When the next moonshot happens, hesitation won’t buy a ticket; it’ll only buy regret.\nADA Price Action Shows Strength as Cardano Tests Resistance\nCardano has re-entered bullish territory with a current price of $0.9189 and over $2.37 billion in daily volume. The ADA price has been building steadily as new smart contracts and scaling upgrades like Hydra gain traction. DeFi on Cardano is expanding, and user activity is increasing, key signs that the network is ready for a higher valuation. The Cardano price could soon test resistance above the $1 mark if momentum continues.\nLong-time holders remain optimistic, but new buyers are also beginning to show interest again. Cardano’s steady approach to innovation sets it apart, but in a meme-driven market, hype often trumps fundamentals. That’s where Arctic Pablo shines as the Best Crypto to Buy Today, offering not only fast community growth but also powerful ROI mechanics during the presale. The ADA price shows strength, but investors seeking multipliers are exploring lower-cap options. Timing is critical, and Cardano isn’t the only project heating up.\nFinal Thoughts: Arctic Pablo Steals the Show as Market Shifts\nWhile Dogwifhat attracts meme energy, and Apecoin leans on its NFT heritage, and Cardano’s ADA Price strengthens slowly, none match Arctic Pablo Coin’s current momentum. Its weekly burn mechanics, transparent blockchain activity, and massive presale rewards are tailored to reward action-takers. Investors are no longer looking for coins with just hype; they want mechanics, structure, and entry points that multiply value.\nArctic Pablo shines as the Best Crypto to Buy Today because it delivers all three. And it’s not speculation, it’s math. With ROI models, listing forecasts, and bonus code advantages still in play, Arctic Pablo is the narrative of now. If there was ever a moment to get in before the headlines become hindsight, this is it. The presale isn’t just open, it’s on fire. Timing matters, and the window is narrowing. Arctic Pablo isn’t waiting, and neither should savvy investors.\nFor More Information:\nArctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/\nTwitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ\nFAQs\n- What is Arctic Pablo Coin, and what makes it different?\nArctic Pablo Coin is a meme token with a built-in deflationary model, weekly token burns, and an active presale offering high ROI and a 100% bonus.\n- How does the presale bonus work?\nUse bonus code BONUS100 (case sensitive) during presale to receive 100% extra tokens on your purchase.\n- What is the ROI potential of Arctic Pablo Coin?\nFrom Stage 37 to listing price ($0.008), ROI is 809%. Forecasted price of $0.1 pushes ROI to over 11,000%.\n- Is Arctic Pablo Coin on Binance Smart Chain?\nYes, all token burn transactions and presale activity are tracked on Binance Smart Chain for transparency. - Why is Arctic Pablo considered the best crypto to buy now?\nDue to its deflationary mechanics, transparent burns, strong presale, and doubling bonus offer, Arctic Pablo shines as the Best Crypto to Buy Today.\nSummary\nArctic Pablo Coin has emerged as one of the hottest meme coin presales in 2025, reaching Stage 37 with a token price of $0.00088 and over $3.5 million raised. It uses weekly token burns to increase scarcity and offers a 100% bonus with the code BONUS100. The projected ROI exceeds 11,000%, making it a standout opportunity. Meanwhile, Dogwifhat is gaining traction again, and Cardano’s ADA Price shows steady recovery. Apecoin continues its ecosystem growth. Still, Arctic Pablo shines as the Best Crypto to Buy Today, with unmatched structure, scarcity mechanics, and limited-time rewards for early buyers.\nThis article contains information about a cryptocurrency presale.

New players like Remittix are making waves with innovative offerings and promises of a 65X return.\nIts presale in full swing and wallet launch around the corner, Remittix is quietly positioning itself as a contender in the future of digital finance.\nXRP Performance and Market Status\nXRP has been a highly tracked cryptocurrency for years, with its involvement in cross-border payments and having a well-established fan base. The token currently has a value of $3.11 and a market capitalization of $185.33 billion, which places it among the top digital currencies.\nIts trade volume over a day is $3.28 billion currently, though this is a 48.28% fall in the last 24 hours. These types of movements emphasize investor demand and the volatility of digital currency, a dynamic that affects the broader altcoin ecosystem.\nRemittix: Building Utility in a Highly Competitive Market\nContrary to speculative trading, Remittix (RTX) is positioning itself as a crypto that has real utility and concentrating on the $190 trillion global payments market. The system allows for the sending of crypto directly into normal bank accounts, with low gas fees and instant FX conversions.\nFor just $0.0944 per token, over 607 million tokens have already been sold and more than $20 million raised through Remittix’s presale. This success spurred its first centralized exchange listing on BitMart, which equates to higher liquidity and visibility.\nWhy Remittix Is Gaining Attention:\n- $20Million+ raised with 607Million tokens sold\n- Beta wallet launch scheduled for Q3 2025\n- $250,000 giveaway fuelling adoption\nA Presale With Real Momentum\nUnlike most upcoming crypto projects, Remittix is correlating investor demand with product releases. At the heart of its strategy is the beta wallet reveal, giving users a mobile-first solution to process RTX with live cross-border processing.\nDrive through the current presale is being fueled by strategic incentives and marketing efforts by the community. With future listings in the pipeline beyond BitMart, Remittix is looking to be one of the top-rated crypto presales of 2025 and one of the next big altcoin 2025.\nWhile XRP remains a giant in digital payments, its journey to $10 will be determined by market cycles and acceptance. Meanwhile, Remittix is setting itself apart as a DeFi project that possesses real utility, converting crypto easily to fiat.

Price and Market Analysis", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/will-solana-sol-surpass-ethereum-eth-price-and-market-analysis", "text": "Besides Bitcoin, Ethereum has been the major driving force in crypto over the last three months or so. However, Solana (SOL) has just woken up and looks as though it might start outperforming $ETH. Is $SOL about to embark on its own bull run?\n$SOL breaks out but faces $200 major resistance\nSource: TradingView\nAlready up more than 5% on Wednesday so far, the $SOL price has broken out of a big downtrend. Initially, $SOL broke up through a descending trendline that stretched from January. A retrace then occurred, and now $SOL has broken out again. There is a major resistance at $200, so if this can be broken the resistance at $252 could be next.\n$SOL explosive move awaits\nSource: TradingView\nZooming out into the 2-week time frame it can be seen that things are looking extremely bullish for $SOL. As already mentioned, in the price action it can be noted that a break of the current resistance would probably lead to an ascent to the last major resistance at $252.\nAt the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) tells the big story. The indicator line is poking through a descending trendline that goes all the way back to March 2024. If this is indeed broken, the price action for $SOL could be explosive to the upside.\nSOL/ETH about to turn back in favour of $SOL?\nSource: TradingView\nThe daily chart for SOL/ETH has looked quite ugly for $SOL over recent months. It can be seen that SOL/ETH broke down out of a long-time ascending channel and entered a descending wedge pattern. It might be that finally $SOL could be about to turn the downtrend around.\nSOL/ETH sees perfect bounce from 0.618 Fibonacci level\nSource: TradingView\nThe weekly chart puts things very much into perspective. If $SOL is going to turn things around against $ETH it really looks like it will begin here. The Fibonacci retracement levels have the price bouncing perfectly from the 0.618, which also happens to be the bottom trendline of the falling wedge. Also, if one looks at the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart, it can be seen that the indicator lines are at the bottom and ripe and ready to start their ascent.\nThe Solana network is faster, cheaper, has more network activity, and more users than Ethereum, and this is by many multiples. At less than ⅕ the market cap of Ethereum, this is not a state of affairs that is likely to continue. $SOL should be by far the fastest horse in this race.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The initiative will begin with the inclusion of the RYT token—backed by a licensed traditional asset management company—into KuCoin’s Off-Exchange Settlement (OES) system. The integration will be phased in and adjusted based on market feedback.\nThe partnership introduces tokenized units from the \"ChinaAMC USD Digital Money Market Fund,\" issued by China Asset Management (Hong Kong) Limited, into KuCoin’s credit system. The effort marks an early attempt to bridge Web2 and Web3 assets by incorporating traditional fund-backed tokens into an exchange credit model.\nIntroducing Collateral Use for Regulated RWA Tokens\nChina Asset Management (Hong Kong) Limited, a subsidiary of China Asset Management Co., Ltd., is among the first Chinese asset managers to operate overseas. The company issues the underlying assets for RYT, a tokenized representation of the \"ChinaAMC USD Digital Money Market Fund.\" This fund is one of Asia’s first tokenized USD funds aimed at retail investors, with fund units that can be subscribed to and redeemed on-chain.\nUnder the new mechanism, KuCoin users holding RYT will be able to apply for credit lines using the token as collateral. This approach combines secure collateralization with yield-generating assets, enabling users to treat RWA tokens similarly to other on-chain assets. In doing so, the exchange aims to diversify asset allocation and unlock leverage utility within compliant parameters.\nThe RYT token’s asset structure has undergone compliance design, with Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong serving as custodian, administrator, and registrar—reflecting a traditional financial framework adapted to on-chain environments.\nStatements from Leadership\nKuCoin CEO BC Wong stated: “KuCoin has always been committed to bridging traditional finance and the crypto world through innovation. This collaboration with AlloyX to explore RWA tokens as collateral mechanisms exemplifies our dedication to providing users with secure and compliant solutions. We emphasize trustworthiness and risk control—this partnership not only elevates the platform's innovation level but also delivers reliable asset appreciation opportunities to global users, helping them manage digital assets more confidently in dynamic markets.”\nAlloyX Co-Founder and CEO Thomas Zhu remarked: “Our focus has always been on how RWA, as an asset form, can deliver more authentic and sustainable economic functions on-chain. This cooperation with KuCoin is a pragmatic attempt centered on 'collateral mechanisms and scenario building,' not only offering users more possibilities for asset utilization but also providing the industry with opportunities for structural validation.”\nShaping RWA Adoption Through Exchange Infrastructure\nThe partnership reflects a broader industry trend toward recognizing the utility of tokenized traditional assets. By integrating a fund-backed token into an exchange’s credit system, KuCoin and AlloyX are laying the groundwork for future structural models, potentially influencing standards for asset issuers, platforms, and regulators.\nAs institutional interest in RWA continues to grow, KuCoin has signaled that it will pursue additional collaborations to advance the application and liquidity of RWA assets on-chain.\n.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Alongside memes, AI has emerged as another high-potential narrative, with Unilabs Finance (UNIL) leading the line. Combining artificial intelligence and DeFi, UNIL’s integration with traditional finance puts it on the list of the best coins to invest in this month and year.\nThe Shiba Inu Price Nears Breakout\nFollowing a 5% rally on the weekly chart, the Shiba Inu price is nearing a breakout. As of press time, the bulls are holding the $0.000013 level, aiming to regain the monthly high of $0.000015.\nMoreover, momentum has been increasing, as shown by the 40% surge in daily trading volume to $295 million. If the current trajectory is maintained, a breakout above $0.000015 in the SHIB price could play out in the coming days, supported by the bullish technical indicator, MACD.\nMeanwhile, Johncy is optimistic that the SHIB price will surpass $0.000020 and $0.000025 if we see a sustained bounce. Hence, at the current price, the dog-themed cryptocurrency is among the best coins to invest in.\nFurther Upswing for the Dogecoin Price?\nWith memes back in the spotlight, the Dogecoin price recorded almost a 10% gain on the 7-day chart. Currently trading above $0.22, the top meme could rocket past $0.28, its 30-day high, during its next leg up. With daily trading volume increasing by 25% over the past 24 hours to $2.8 billion, bulls are anticipating a significant rally.\nAt the same time, technical indicators signal further uptrends in the Dogecoin price. According to the MACD and Bull Bear Power, as well as the 20-VWMA, the dog-themed cryptocurrency is in an oversold zone, suggesting a big leap.\nMeanwhile, Marcus targets $0.43, supposing the bulls \"stay hungry.\" With a breakout above its 2021 all-time high (ATH) of $0.73 on the cards, the current Dogecoin price represents a good entry.\nUnilabs Finance (UNIL) — 2025’ Wild Card\nGiven its unique and innovative blend of AI, DeFi and TradFi, Unilabs Finance (UNIL) might be this year’s wild card. Its novelty has yet to be priced in and is on track to reach escape velocity once it officially launches. Before then, investors stand to gain a 415% profit at the listing price of $0.05—a more promising alternative than most top altcoins.\nIn the sixth ICO stage, the UNIL token is significantly undervalued at $0.0097, placing it among the best coins to invest in this month and year. Further contributing to its bullish outlook and upside potential is its unique value proposition as the world’s first AI-backed DeFi asset manager.\nCompared to traditional asset managers and DeFi protocols, the UNIL platform will be driven by artificial intelligence. There will be an AI launchpad at its heart, drawing comparison to Raydium, a leading DEX with a $1.5 billion market size. However, it could outperform, considering users are eligible for periodic airdrops from launched tokens and redistribution of 30% of generated fees.\nClosing Thoughts\nAs memecoins and AI return to the spotlight, the Dogecoin price and Shiba Inu price are poised to skyrocket, while UNIL is also among the best coins to invest in. Surpassing $12.7 million in funding, smart investors are betting big on this new AI token, which experts consider this year’s wild crypto card.\nFor more information about Unilabs Finance (UNIL) visit the links below:\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Bitcoin Holdings at Metaplanet Hit $1.85B After $61M Purchase", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/bitcoin-holdings-at-metaplanet-hit-185b-after-61m-purchase", "text": "Metaplanet has boosted its Bitcoin reserves to 18,113 BTC with a $61.4 million purchase, reinforcing its aggressive treasury strategy and positioning itself among the world’s largest corporate holders.\nMetaplanet Adds 518 BTC in Latest Acquisition\nJapanese firm Metaplanet Inc. has deepened its commitment to Bitcoin with the latest purchase of 518 BTC valued at approximately $61.4 million. The acquisition was made at an average price of $118,519 per coin, lifting the Japanese firm’s total reserves to 18,113 BTC. At current market rates, the company’s Bitcoin holdings are worth roughly $1.85 billion, with an average acquisition cost of $101,911 per coin.\nAggressive Treasury Expansion\nThe latest purchase is part of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Treasury Operations, launched in late 2024, aimed at systematically building digital asset reserves. The company, originally a hotel operator, has since evolved into one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders in the world, currently ranking sixth behind U.S.-based miner Riot Platforms. Over the past year, Metaplanet has accelerated its buying pace, supported by both operational income and capital market activities.\nCapital Raising for Further Purchases\nEarlier this month, Metaplanet announced plans to raise ¥580 billion ($3.7 billion) through a large-scale stock offering to fund additional Bitcoin acquisitions. The approach mirrors the strategy pioneered by Michael Saylor’s company Strategy, which leveraged equity issuances to amass over 628,000 BTC. Like Strategy, Metaplanet has seen its share performance closely track Bitcoin’s price movements, underscoring the direct impact of its digital asset-focused model.\nMeasuring Shareholder Value Through Bitcoin Yield\nMetaplanet uses a metric called Bitcoin Yield to measure the growth of BTC per fully diluted share, effectively isolating the benefits of its treasury strategy from the effects of share dilution. The company reported a 468.1% year-to-date Bitcoin Yield for 2025. From April to June alone, yield growth reached 129.4%, with the current quarter standing at 26.5% as of August 12. These figures highlight the accretive effect of the firm’s accumulation strategy on shareholder value.\nFinancing and Liquidity Management\nIn July, Metaplanet redeemed ¥12.75 billion from a bond issuance, using proceeds from exercised stock acquisition rights. The move reflects its balanced approach to funding growth, expanding Bitcoin reserves without straining liquidity. Consistent investor participation in share exercises through July and early August has further reinforced its capital position.\nLong-Term Vision for Bitcoin\nMetaplanet’s rapid accumulation strategy reflects a conviction in Bitcoin as both a hedge against currency depreciation and a long-term store of value. By combining aggressive acquisition with disciplined financing, the company continues to position itself as a prominent institutional advocate for the asset. For investors, the strategy offers significant upside potential alongside the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

XRP still holds a place in the hearts of long-term believers, but the clock is ticking for those who want immediate returns. As we enter the final hours of Stage 4 in Bitcoin Swift’s presale, the contrast between waiting years for XRP’s projected gains and earning high-yield rewards with BTC3 today has never been sharper.\nXRP outlook is steady but slow\nXRP’s growth predictions are methodical. Estimates show about $3 in 2026, $4 in 2030, $5 in 2035, and $7 in 2040. While these numbers can reward patient holders, they are measured in years, not hours. For traders seeking results now, that slow-burn trajectory feels like watching a glacier move in a bull market.\nBitcoin Swift, wealth creation without the wait\nBitcoin Swift’s Proof of Yield model adjusts rewards based on real-time network activity, community governance, and environmental efficiency. This means participants are paid for actively contributing to the ecosystem’s growth. Contracts run in a WASM environment with AI agents that adapt and optimize over time.\nPrivacy is guaranteed through decentralized identity with zk-SNARK technology, letting users prove compliance without exposing personal details. Security combines Proof of Work for block creation with Proof of Stake for governance checkpoints every 100 blocks. The result is a system built to reward engagement immediately. Learn more at Bitcoin Swift.\nAI efficiency and governance strength\nBTC3 rewards cleaner, smarter participation through AI oracles that track carbon impact and system performance. Governance is AI-assisted from proposal screening to quadratic voting based on verified reputations. A dedicated emergency council can block malicious actions, giving investors confidence that the rules won’t be hijacked by whales.\nBTC3E stablecoin for real-world utility\nBTC3’s USD-pegged stablecoin, BTC3E, lets users lock BTC3 in 150% collateral vaults to mint a stable asset for payments, DeFi, and cross-platform use, all without bridges. AI oracles keep the peg tight, and auto-liquidations protect the system’s solvency.\nSecurity, audits, and influencer attention\nBitcoin Swift’s credibility is reinforced by a Cyberscope Audit, a Solidproof Audit, and a Spywolf Audit, alongside full KYC verification. Buzz is growing on X, with in-depth coverage from:\n-\nBull Run Angel explaining BTC3’s market advantage.\n-\nToken Galaxy analyzed why BTC3’s architecture positions it ahead of most launches.\n-\nCrypto Show detailing how its combination of yield, governance, and scalability stands out.\nFinal hours of Stage 4, urgency meets opportunity\nThis isn’t just the last day, it’s the last few hours to lock in:\n-\nPrice: $4, targeting $15 at launch\n-\nStage 4 APY: 106% PoY rewards, paid instantly at stage end\n-\nOver 2100 participants and $580k+ raised\n-\nLiquidity already among the highest at this stage in the market\nInternal reports suggest active discussions with MEXC, KuCoin, and LBank for listings. That could mean rapid post-launch trading volume and wider visibility, a perfect setup for those entering before this stage closes.\nConclusion\nWhile XRP’s steady climb might reward patient holders in 10 to 15 years, Bitcoin Swift is delivering triple-digit APY and ecosystem benefits today. With only hours left in Stage 4, BTC3’s blend of high-yield rewards, institutional-grade governance, AI-driven efficiency, and real-world utility is making it the obvious choice for investors who value both immediate and long-term gains.\nFor more information on Bitcoin Swift:\nWebsite: https://bitcoinswift.com\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

{"title": "Top 3 Meme Coins to Buy Now That Feel Like Catching Dogecoin (DOGE) Under $0.0020 in 2020", "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/top-3-meme-coins-to-buy-now-that-feel-like-catching-dogecoin-doge-under-00020-in-2020", "text": "When Dogecoin was trading at fractions of a cent, very few took it seriously. Most saw it as a joke—or at best, a fun distraction in a market still trying to find its identity. But that tiny coin eventually turned modest bets into massive windfalls, proving that the meme coin category has more depth than many realize. Now, a few tokens generate the same kind of quiet conviction Dogecoin had before its explosion. And they’re doing so with a stronger sense of purpose, better infrastructure, and clearer community traction.\nLittle Pepe (LILPEPE): The Sub-$0.002 Token That’s Starting to Feel Familiar\nAt first glance, LILPEPE looks like another cheeky entrant in the meme coin space. But under the surface, it’s behaving more like a community-backed project that understands the rhythm of real market demand. In Stage 9 of its presale, the project raised over $16.2 million, selling nearly 11.1 billion tokens, and brushing close to full allocation before flipping into Stage 10 at $0.0019. It’s not just the funding that signals strength—it’s how it’s being raised: gradually, transparently, and with visible community support. Unlike some meme coins that rely only on trends, LILPEPE is tying its identity to structure. The latest milestone? LILPEPE has been CertiK audited, which is a huge credibility boost for a meme coin and a step most presales never take. Its tokenomics reflect that: fixed supply, early-stage pricing incentives, and confirmed centralized exchange listings on the horizon. With a total supply capped and tokens distributed over a structured vesting model, early buyers are incentivized to stay in the ecosystem, not dump at launch. LILPEPE’s cult-like following isn’t just built on frog memes—it’s backed by movement. Telegram groups are active, X threads are buzzing, and presale entries keep ticking upward even without paid promotion overload.\nBRETT: Base Chain’s First Meme Star With Real Staying Power\nIf LILPEPE is 2020 DOGE with a roadmap, BRETT is closer to what Dogecoin became in 2021—popular, well-positioned, and riding a wave larger than itself. Launched on Coinbase’s Base network, BRETT draws from the exact comic origins as PEPE but gives it a Base-native twist. Its real strength comes from being a network's first major meme coin, gaining serious traction. That alone has helped push its market cap to $1.4 billion—a stunning figure for a token with no built-in utility. What BRETT lacks in tech, it makes up for in timing and placement. It owns the meme niche on Base, and if the Base ecosystem continues to expand, BRETT could rise with it. Liquidity is strong across major Base DEXs like Aerodrome, and the community remains highly engaged across platforms.\nTOSHI: The Underdog Meme Coin That Might Surprise\nNamed after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s cat, TOSHI may sound like a joke, but it has become a serious contender within the Base community. While not as large as BRETT, it has the grassroots grit that often defines long-term meme coin winners. With a market cap fluctuating between $150 million and $200 million, TOSHI remains accessible while being visible enough to matter. It benefits from launching during Base’s growth phase, and its organic traction has helped it hold a strong user base without the need for heavy marketing. Its presence on primary Base-based tools and early liquidity across DEXs means there’s enough foundation for a big move if sentiment catches up. Should Base experience a breakout moment in 2025, TOSHI could easily piggyback off that growth. While it won’t move as fast or as far as LILPEPE or BRETT, its position makes it a potential mid-cap favourite for meme coin speculators.\nFinal Thoughts: Don’t Miss the Signals\nDogecoin was a punchline before it was a portfolio changer. History has shown that it’s not always about catching the trend—it’s about seeing the energy early. LILPEPE, BRETT, and TOSHI channel different parts of what made DOGE memorable. LILPEPE brings structure to early chaos. BRETT rides the strength of Base’s expanding ecosystem. TOSHI represents the underdog that could punch above its weight. Each carries different levels of risk and return. But all three are early enough that, in hindsight, they might look like catching DOGE under $0.002 all over again.\nFor more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://littlepepe.com\nWhitepaper: https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\nTelegram: https://t.me/littlepepetoken\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/littlepepetoken\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.
