Hedera (HBAR) is the 17th largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $10.45 billion and trading at $0.246. SUI ranks as the 14th largest cryptocurrency with a market valuation of $10.45 billion and trading at $3.69.\nThe move remains significant since it expands the BSC network's multi-chain support by allowing users to deposit and withdraw HBAR and SUI through the network. This cross-chain functionality enables DeFi and staking use cases as well as trading flexibility for both assets within the BNB Smart Chain network.\nBinance and BNB news\nTo expand the list of trading choices offered on Binance Futures and enhance users’ trading experience, Binance Futures has revealed its decision to launch the USELESSUSDT Perpetual Contract with up to 50x leverage on Aug. 15 at 12:15 p.m. (UTC).\nBinance will also open trading for Reservoir (DAM) on Binance Alpha starting Aug. 18 at 11:00 a.m. (UTC). In addition, Binance Futures will launch DAMUSDT Perpetual Contract with up to 50x leverage on the same day at 12:30 p.m. (UTC).\nBNB, the native token of the BNB chain, reached a record-breaking $868.68 on Aug. 14, 2025, a long way from its ERC-20 beginnings in 2017. From an exchange token to powering a significant global blockchain, this milestone represents years of constant innovation.

{"domain": "https://coingape.com", "title": "Binance Coin Price Eyes $1K on BNB Treasury Boom, ETF Approval Hopes", "text": "Highlights\n- Binance Coin price is on the path to $1,000 in the near term.\n- The number of BNB treasury companies has continued rising.\n- The BNB price has formed a cup-and-handle chart pattern.\nBinance Coin price continued its strong bull run this week as it surged to a record high. BNB has soar in the last three consecutive days, invalidating a bearish chart pattern. This growth may continue in the near term as bulls target the crucial resistance at $1,000 amid the ongoing BNB treasury boom.\nBinance Coin to Benefit Amid the Ongoing Treasury Boom\nOne of the main catalysts for the Binance Coin price is that it could see robust demand from companies seeking to set their own BNB treasuries, one of the top trends in the crypto industry this year.\nBNC, a company listed in the Nasdaq, has become one of the top BNB accumulators. BNB bought 200,000 coins, now valued at over $171 million. Its purchasing will likely accelerate when it raises $1.75 billion this year.\nWindTree Therapeutics plans to spend $700 million in BNB buying, while Liminatus will acquire tokens worth $500 million. All this buying will lead to more demand for the coin.\nThe ongoing treasury demand is on reason why some top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared to all-time highs. There are now over 100 Bitcoin treasury companies, while firms like SharpLink and BitMine are accumulating Ethereum.\nAt the same time, there is a likelihood that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the VanEck BNB ETF later this year. Besides, BNB is a proof-of-work (PoW) layer-1 network like Ethereum, which already have ETFs.\nA BNB ETF would likely have institutional demand because of its strong fundamentals. For example, BNB is highly deflationary, burning tokens worth over $4 billion a year. Its goal is to reduce the number of tokens in circulation to 100 million.\nBSC is also a highly liquid token with daily volume worth over $3.5 billion. Liquidity is important because it simplifies how people buy or sell their tokens.\nThird-party data shows that BSC is a key player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoin industry. Its stablecoin supply has jumped to a record high of $11.5 billion, while its DEX protocols process transactions worth billions o dollars a day.\nBNB Price Technical Analysis\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the BNB price has the momentum it needs to keep going up, potentially reaching $1,000. Its rally is being supported by the short and long-term moving averages.\nBinance Coin price also invalidated the double-top pattern at $860. This pattern often leads to a bearish reversal over time. As such, moving above it meant that bulls have prevailed.\nBNB coin price has formed the highly bullish cup-and-handle pattern, a common continuation sign. The distance from top to bottom is about 37%. Therefore, measuring it from the upper side gives it a target of $1,090.\nOn the flip side, a crash below the support $792 will invalidate the bullish BNB price forecast for 2025.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n1. Will Binance Coin price surge to $1,000 soon?\n2. What are the potential BNB price catalysts?\n3.

{"domain": "https://crypto.news", "title": "Top reason why is Binance Coin (BNB) price crashing after ATH", "text": "Top reason why is Binance Coin (BNB) price crashing after ATH\nBinance Coin is showing signs of exhaustion after breaching the $800 mark. Weak follow-through, declining volume, and repeated rejections suggest the rally may be losing steam.\n- Price rejected multiple times after breaching $800 resistance.\n- Declining volume profile signals reduced bullish momentum.\n- Risk of deviation could lead to drop toward point of control and value area low.\nBinance Coin (BNB) recently established an all-time high above $800, but technical signals now point toward potential weakness. The inability to maintain bullish momentum, combined with fading volume, raises the risk of a deviation at the range high and a deeper short-term correction.\nKey technical points:\n- Critical Resistance: $800 serves as the range high and must hold to maintain bullish structure.\n- Volume Decline: Steady decrease in bullish volume since the breakout indicates waning buying interest.\n- Downside Target: A loss of $800 could trigger a rotation toward the point of control and value area low.\nAfter breaking through the $800 resistance, BNB initially looked poised for continuation to the upside. However, repeated rejections at this level have stalled momentum. Price action has failed to deliver sustained bullish follow-through, leaving the door open for a possible deviation of the range high — a structure that often precedes sharp reversals.\nFrom a market structure perspective, a deviation here would be considered bearish, signaling that bulls were unable to defend higher prices. A close back below $800 on the daily timeframe would confirm the deviation pattern and significantly increase the probability of a rotation lower, targeting the point of control.\nVolume analysis supports this bearish caution. Since the breakout, the volume profile has shown a steady decline, suggesting reduced market participation and fading bullish enthusiasm. In healthy bullish trends, volume should expand alongside price, the opposite is occurring on BNB. Without fresh buying pressure, sustaining price above $800 becomes increasingly unlikely.\nA corrective move below $800 could quickly send price toward the point of control, located in the midrange of the current trading structure. If selling accelerates, the value area low becomes a potential magnet for price, setting up a broader retracement phase.\nWhat to expect in the coming price action\nIf BNB fails to close above $800 in the coming sessions, expect a downside rotation toward the point of control. A confirmed deviation would likely result in further weakness, while reclaiming $800 with strong volume would invalidate the bearish bias.", "authors": "Crypto News", "published": "2025-08-14T17:44:46Z", "url": "https://crypto.news/top-reason-why-is-binance-coin-bnb-price-crashing-after-ath/", "source": "trafilatura"}

Early adopters can secure tokens at just $0.0042 before the next bull run.\nWhile established giants like BNB and Cardano show signs of slowing momentum, savvy crypto traders are turning their attention to new projects with explosive potential. The Layer Brett crypto presale is capturing this interest, with its starting price of just $0.0042 per token positioning $LBRETT as a compelling candidate for the next 100x meme coin.\nFusing the viral appeal of a meme token with powerful Ethereum Layer 2 technology, this project offers a fresh alternative for those disappointed by the recent performance of coins like BNB. The presale is attracting significant buzz, with analysts pointing to its unique combination of high-speed transactions, massive staking rewards, and genuine utility as key drivers for growth in the upcoming crypto bull run 2025.\nWhy Layer-2 Gives Layer Brett a Decisive Edge\nThe fundamental advantage Layer Brett holds is its advanced Ethereum Layer 2 infrastructure. This technology allows it to process transactions off-chain, delivering near-instant speeds and minimal gas fees—a stark contrast to the network congestion that can sometimes plague major blockchains like BNB and Cardano.\nFor users, this means a seamless experience when staking or interacting with the ecosystem, without the frustration of high costs. This technical foundation provides Layer Brett with real-world utility, setting it apart from hype-driven tokens.\n- Blazing-Fast and Low Cost: Built on Ethereum Layer 2, transactions are processed in seconds for just pennies.\n- Massive Staking Rewards: Early presale participants can access enormous APYs, a key incentive unavailable to holders of Cardano.\n- Meme Energy Meets Utility: It combines the community power of a meme token with the performance of a serious tech project.\n- Simple to Start: Users can easily purchase and stake $LBRETT using ETH, USDT, or even BNB.\nWhy LBRETT Excites Where Cardano and BNB Falter\nMany investors are growing impatient with the sluggish price action of established assets. While Cardano news and updates trickle out, holders are still waiting for a significant breakout. Similarly, while BNB is a cornerstone of its ecosystem, its days of exponential growth are likely in the past. In contrast, Layer Brett is offering immediate and substantial incentives.\nThe $LBRETT crypto presale allows early adopters to lock in huge staking rewards that diminish as more people join, creating genuine urgency. This opportunity for rapid gains is a major draw for traders moving away from the slower-moving Cardano market. Furthermore, Layer Brett is fully decentralized with no KYC requirements and is hosting a $1 million giveaway, adding another layer of excitement that competitors like BNB cannot easily replicate.\nSubstance Beyond the Hype\nUnlike many projects in the DeFi coin space, Layer Brett provides a clear vision backed by solid tokenomics. With a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens, the project avoids the inflationary pressures that can affect other assets. The roadmap includes plans for NFT integrations, gamified staking, and bridging solutions for seamless cross-chain interoperability.\nThis focus on building a robust ecosystem offers more substance than many alternatives. While traders watch the ADA price for minor fluctuations, Layer Brett is building a platform for long-term growth. It’s this blend of \"meme meets mechanism\" that positions $LBRETT as one of the best crypto presale opportunities and a potential top gainer crypto for investors looking beyond Cardano and BNB.\nDon’t miss this opportunity. The Layer Brett presale is your chance to get in early on a project with the potential for 100x returns. As established players like BNB and Cardano consolidate, the real action is with innovative new contenders. Secure your stake in what could be the next big crypto before it becomes a household name.\nDon’t miss the chance to get in early on a project where meme meets mechanism and where the next 100x meme coin could be born.\nWebsite: https://layerbrett.com\nTelegram: https://t.me/layerbrett", "authors": "Indiatimes", "published": "2025-08-18T10:31:13Z", "url": "https://www.indiatimes.com/partner/bnb-cardano-remain-stagnant-crypto-seekers-explore-layer-brett-as-the-next-100x-meme-coin-667071.html", "source": "trafilatura"}

(13/8)\nBitcoin and most altcoins surged on August 13 as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index turned green and expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut rose following the July inflation data.\n- Bitcoin and altcoins jumped as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index jumps.\n- There is optimism that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September.\n- Top crypto ETFs have experienced robust inflows.\nBitcoin (BTC) crossed the important resistance point at $122,000, while Ethereum (ETH) soared above $4,700. Other top-perfoming tokens were Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), and Ripple (XRP).\nBitcoin and altcoins jump as Crypto Fear and Greed Index rise\nThe ongoing crypto rally coincided with broader risk-on sentiment among market participants. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index advanced to the “greed” zone at 63.\nSimilarly, the broader Fear and Greed Index tracked by CNN Money climbed to 66, helping explain why major equity indices such as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 soared to a record high.\nThe optimism is being driven by expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September.\nIn a statement, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged the Fed to deliver a 0.50% cut next month, while President Donald Trump has called for a 300 basis point reduction.\nThe odds of a rate cut increased after July’s nonfarm payroll and consumer inflation reports. Jobs data showed hiring slowed, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.2%.\nA report on Tuesday showed that the US inflation remained at 2.7% in July, even as the core CPI rose to 3.1%. Most of the price hikes were in the services industry.\nCrypto going up amid institutional demand\nBitcoin and top altcoins are going up amid rising demand among institutional investors. Spot Ethereum ETFs have added over $1.7 billion in inflows this week, while treasury companies like SharpLink and BitMine are continuing their accumulation. In a note to crypto.news, James Toledano, the COO at Unity Wallet said:\n“Ethereum is within about 4% of its ATH, and continued ETF inflows and institutional demand could plausibly push it to new highs. I do see it reaching and possibly surpassing the ATH.”\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs have also seen strong inflows, bringing cumulative assets to $54 billion. Derivatives-based ETFs like SSL and XXRP have continued to add assets, signaling further demand.\nCryptocurrency prices are also driven by expectations that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve multiple exchange-traded funds tied to Solana, Cardano, Hedera Hashgraph, and Dogecoin.\nCrypto bull run faces risks ahead\nWhile the crypto bull run may continue, some analysts see risks to the ongoing surge. Toledano warned:\n“There’s reason for caution as always: derivatives data show traders remain guarded rather than euphoric, and macroeconomic or recession fears could dampen momentum.”\nBTC price chart | Source: crypto.news\nAnother potential risk is technical: Bitcoin is forming a possible double-top pattern at $123,000 with a neckline at $112,000. A confirmed double-top could trigger a reversal, which would likely lead to deeper declines across altcoins that tend to follow Bitcoin’s lead.", "authors": "Crypto News", "published": "2025-08-13T14:42:14Z", "url": "https://crypto.news/why-are-bitcoin-and-altcoins-like-solana-bnb-xrp-going-up-today-13-8/", "source": "trafilatura"}

It Might Reach $1 Evaluation Sooner Than Expected as CMC Listing Made It Top Trending", "text": "Missed early runs on big caps like BNB? Ruvi AI (RUVI) is surging into the spotlight with real utility, a transparent price ladder, and fresh momentum from its CoinMarketCap (CMC) listing. The question on many investors’ minds: could RUVI reach a $1 valuation faster than expected?\nThis post breaks down the catalysts behind RUVI’s rapid presale, why creators are excited about its super app, and what the numbers say about near-term upside.\nWhy capital is rotating into RUVI now\n- CMC listing impact: RUVI’s top-trending status on CMC sparked discovery, watchlists, and conversions, exactly the signals that bring fresh liquidity.\n- Phase 2 at 90%: The $0.015 entry is almost gone. Once it sells out, RUVI advances to Phase 3 at $0.020, a 33% jump.\n- Clear final target: The presale wraps at $0.070, giving buyers a transparent path and defined milestones.\n- Proof of traction: $3M raised, 230M tokens sold, and a holder base above 2,900.\n- Credibility and access: CyberScope completed an independent audit; WEEX partnership helps ensure visibility and simplifies the trading path for holders.\n- Added incentive: A live leaderboard giveaway rewards larger contributors during the sale.\nTogether, these catalysts compress decision time and channel attention into action, which is what you want to see before a programmed price step.\nReal utility: the creator-first AI super app\nRUVI isn’t just riding the AI narrative, it’s shipping a product creators can use every day. The Ruvi AI super app integrates the full content pipeline in one place, reducing tool sprawl and costs while speeding up output.\n- Research trends: Spot topics with proven demand across platforms.\n- Generate scripts: Produce platform-ready scripts tuned to brand voice and format.\n- Create media: Generate images and videos natively, no app-hopping or extra subscriptions.\n- Streamline production: Plan, iterate, schedule, and publish from a single dashboard.\nThis is tailor-made for YouTubers, TikTokers, agencies, brands, and lean marketing teams that care about speed, consistency, and lower costs. By tying token relevance to daily workflows, RUVI strengthens the case for durable demand after listings.\nCMC momentum: from visibility to buy pressure\nCMC acts as a funnel for crypto capital. RUVI’s trending presence hit as Phase 2 sprinted to 90% completion, setting up a simple choice for buyers: secure allocation at $0.015 or accept the 33% step to $0.020, with $0.070 at presale close. That clarity reduces hesitation and often pulls demand forward in structured sales.\nMilestones that reinforce conviction\n- $3M raised\n- 230M tokens sold\n- 2,900+ holders\n- Phase 2 at 90%; $0.020 next (+33%)\n- Final presale price: $0.070\n- Live leaderboard giveaway\nThese checkpoints offer social proof and a straightforward thesis for momentum to continue.\nTrust and access that larger buyers want\n- CyberScope audit: Third-party validation of smart contracts and security lowers perceived risk.\n- WEEX partnership: Alignment with a major exchange improves visibility and eases post-presale trading for token holders.\nThese signals matter to both retail and allocators deciding where to deploy fresh capital.\nVIP tiers: modeled upside at a $1 valuation\nFor bigger entries, RUVI’s VIP program illustrates how bonuses can amplify modeled outcomes if adoption scales:\n- VIP 2 ($750 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 9,233% ROI.\n- VIP 3 ($1,500 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1, this equals $160,000, delivering a 10,566% ROI.\n- VIP 5 ($7,500 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens, boosted by a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1, this equals $1,000,000, achieving a 13,233% ROI.\nThese are models, not guarantees, but they explain why momentum-focused investors are acting before Phase 3.\nBottom line\nCould RUVI outpace Binance Coin on near-term percentage gains? Large caps face a higher bar. RUVI combines a top-trending CMC listing, a completed CyberScope audit, a WEEX exchange partnership, and a creator-first super app that anchors token demand in daily use. With Phase 2 at 90% and a programmed jump to $0.020 ahead, followed by a $0.070 presale finish, the window for lower entries is closing fast.

Built for cross-chain operations across Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana, PEPETO aims to provide holders with seamless multi-blockchain access.\nMany early PEPE investors are now exploring PEPETO as their next opportunity, drawn by its staking features, active development, and structured roadmap.\nPEPE Faces Ongoing Utility Challenges\nPEPE’s recent price action shows mixed signals as the token attempts recovery from previous lows. Technical analysis suggests the token faces key resistance levels, though its lack of fundamental utility continues to concern long-term investors.\nThe primary challenge facing PEPE in 2025 remains its limited practical applications. Price movements appear driven primarily by market sentiment and trading rotations rather than underlying utility or adoption metrics.\nThis dynamic creates uncertainty for holders seeking sustainable value appreciation.\nThese utility concerns have prompted some early PEPE investors to explore alternatives like PEPETO, which offers tangible features including staking rewards, multi-chain compatibility, and active development progress.\nPEPETO’s Multi-Chain Approach\nAccording to project materials, PEPETO has already raised over $6 million and maintains a current price of $0.000000146. The project’s primary value proposition centers on interoperability across major blockchain networks without requiring external bridge protocols.\nStake Early, Win More 🐸\nBuy $PEPETO now while the presale price is still low, it rises at every stage.

The project reports having undergone smart contract auditing and maintains active development of its ecosystem features.\nThis utility-focused approach aligns with broader market trends favoring projects with practical applications over purely speculative assets. Early adopters appear drawn to PEPETO’s combination of meme culture appeal and technical functionality.\nThe project’s roadmap includes plans for expanded features and potential exchange listings, though timelines remain subject to development progress and market conditions.\nOpportunity to Get PEPETO Early\nPEPETO represents an evolution in meme coin development, prioritizing utility alongside community engagement. The project’s multi-chain capabilities and staking mechanisms differentiate it from traditional meme-focused tokens.\nThe project, at the current price, appears underrated as its complete execution of its roadmap might send the price to the roof.\nFor those interested in exploring PEPETO, the project maintains its official presence through established channels and verified platforms.\nConclusion\nPEPETO’s approach to combining meme culture with blockchain utility reflects changing investor preferences in the cryptocurrency space.\nThe project’s emphasis on cross-chain functionality and staking rewards positions it differently from traditional meme coin offerings.\nWith zero-fee trading, multichain access, and high-yield staking backed by over 42T tokens staked, it’s set to lead the next meme coin cycle.\nVisit Pepeto.io now and secure your position before listings go live.\n- ZA Miner is the High Profit Platform that Investors Have Been Looking For\n- AIXA Miner’s Potential as the Best Earning Platform Shines Through Its Cloud Mining Solutions\n- How Hash Miners’ Innovative Mining Pool Changes the Standard Passive Income Paradigm\n- Little Pepe Presale Reaches $20M Milestone with Custom Layer 2 Infrastructure\n- Pepeto Presale Reaches $6M Milestone as Meme coin Market Shows Renewed Interest", "authors": "CoinGape", "published": "2025-08-13T08:24:38Z", "url": "https://coingape.com/sponsored/pepetos-6m-presale-draws-pepe-investors-with-multi-chain-staking-utility/", "source": "trafilatura"}
