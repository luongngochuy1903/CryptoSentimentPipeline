Across Europe and the Middle East, record-breaking temperatures are threatening lives as well as livelihoods. France has experienced its largest wildfire since 1949, while across Europe an estimated 500,000 hectares of land have burned.\nBut farmers are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather, which has a direct impact on crop yields. So reports of a second consecutive year in which food growers in parts of the UK are seeing dramatic falls in production should concern the British public. Access to food is frequently taken for granted in the world’s wealthiest nations. But increased food insecurity is among the dangerous effects of the climate crisis, as well as being worsened by Trump’s tariffs, and geopolitical instability including the war in Ukraine.\nLast year the problem for British farmers was too much summer rain, leading to waterlogged fields and lost crops. This year the challenge has been the reverse: prolonged, intense hot weather, leading to large parts of England being declared officially in drought. Dramatic local and regional variations complicate the picture. While some farmers are warning of smaller vegetables in supermarkets following disappointing early harvests, others have fared quite well. It is too soon to draw firm conclusions or make decisive comparisons with previous years. What is already beyond doubt, however, is the immense challenge of adapting to an altered reality.\nAt a recent water summit hosted by the National Farmers’ Union, Steve Reed, the environment secretary, suggested that the government might support a change to planning rules, making it easier for farmers to build reservoirs on their land. Ministers should work with nature experts as well as farmers to develop this, and other proposals to boost resilience, in an environmentally responsible way. While tensions between the priorities of conservationists and farmers have not gone away, there is also common ground, for example around the need for stronger, long-term water infrastructure and flood risk planning. Last month a survey by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit found that more than 80% of UK farmers are worried about the climate crisis.\nSuch fears, along with falls in crop yields and incomes, also help explain the furious reaction to inheritance tax changes introduced last year by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, restricting an exemption for agricultural land. Last week the independent Centre for the Analysis of Taxation proposed amendments to the new rules that the Treasury should consider carefully. The chancellor is right to target wealthy, tax-avoiding landowners. But ministerial antagonism toward rural communities serves no purpose and only plays into the populist right’s hands.\nWhile farmers are the first to register falling yields, and smaller heads of broccoli, the productivity and resilience of agricultural land affects everyone who is not insulated by wealth from higher food prices. Last month a thinktank, the Autonomy Institute, argued that the UK is particularly exposed to “climateflation” due to its heavy reliance on food imports. Extreme weather could drive up food prices by more than a third by 2050. With this in mind, the government should seek constructive engagement with farmers, while promoting healthy food policies.\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"title": "Watchdog urges UK advertisers to avoid ‘irresponsible’ images of thin-looking models", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/aug/18/advertising-standards-agency-thin-models-unhealthy-body-image", "text": "The chief executive of the UK Advertising Standards Authority has issued a plea to advertisers to avoid using “irresponsible” images of unhealthily thin-looking models.\nGuy Parker, CEO of the UK watchdog, said adverts where models appeared to present an unhealthy body image were “becoming more of an issue” and called upon advertisers to “please, please, please think very carefully” about the body types they depicted.\nRecently, the regulator banned adverts from high street retailers including M&S, Next and Zara for presenting “irresponsible” images of models who appeared “unhealthily thin”.\nThe regulator reported that in one of the images used by M&S in April, a model “wore large pointed shoes which emphasised the slenderness of her legs”. A downwards tilting camera angle made the model’s head appear “out of proportion with the rest of her body and further highlighted her small frame”.\nIn response, M&S said it “took concerns about the depiction of body image in [its] ads very seriously”. The shoes had “only been chosen for stylistic and fashion purposes” while the camera angle “had not been chosen to exaggerate the model’s proportions”.\nThe watchdog typically receives five or six complaints a week about such ads, but after the ruling against M&S in July that increased to more than 20. In 2024, it received a total of 61 complaints about the size of models in adverts. According to the ASA, 45% of the UK public are concerned about ads that include idealised body images of women.\nParker, who has worked for the ASA for more than 30 years, said a wider “return to thinness in fashion” was causing an increase in complaints. “It is not unprecedented,” he said. “Fashion trends go in cycles. In the 90s we had a ‘heroin chic’ period and we banned several ads back then. Our rules have long required ads to be socially responsible. It may be that we’re kind of back in that sort of space today.”\nThe rise of weight-loss medication may also be affecting the types of bodies being portrayed in ads. “There is a connection between the two,” said Parker, who is overseeing a project focusing on injectable versions. “There have been too many cases of advertisers, many of whom should know better, promoting prescription-only weight-loss medicines to the public. That is against the law and our codes.”\nThe watchdog has previously been accused of double standards for allowing campaigns starring plus-size models, with some online critics calling such models obese. Parker said a wider cultural context played a part here. “We know in the UK currently, society tends to view thinness as aspirational. That’s not the same case when it comes to being overweight.”\nParker said it was important not to “demonise the models that have been featured in ads”. The rulings are generally not about the model’s body but about how advertisers may have manipulated images of a model. Lighting, makeup and the type of poses used all play a role.\nParker said the final images selected for use was crucial, pointing to a recent ruling against Zara as an example of this. In four adverts, starring two models, the ASA found that shadows used over one of the model’s legs made them “appear noticeably thin”, while the low-cut design of a shirt worn by the other model created “a focal point around her collarbone, which was protruding”. Two other adverts starring the same models did not breach its code.\nResponding to the ruling, Zara said during its hiring process both models had provided medical certificates proving they were in good health.\nParker said: “The key moment is when you are selecting the images because there will probably be a whole bunch of images of the model you can use but there might be some that you shouldn’t. It comes down to these advertisers making sure that they have got a stage in their compliance process that actively and consciously checks to make sure irresponsible images don’t slip through.”\nNoticeable bones are especially contentious. “We have had issues where ribs are really visible. Sometimes it is very thin-looking arms or thin-looking legs. I say thin-looking rather than thin because it is about how models are presented in clothes, not the model per se.”\nParker said “thin” was subjective. “I don’t think any of these advertisers are intentionally promoting this sort of concept of unhealthy thinness. But that can sometimes be the result if they are not really careful about the images they select to use.”", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:36:38 GMT", "author": "Chloe Mac Donnell", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

The south-east and south-west of England are expected to see the heaviest congestion.\nHeavy traffic is expected on the M5 between Bristol and Devon, according to the transport analytics company Inrix. On Friday and Saturday there are likely to be holdups of more than 40 minutes on the stretch between junction 15 north of Bristol and junction 23 for Bridgewater.\nOn Friday, drivers making Channel crossings via Dover or Folkestone are expected to face delays exceeding 30 minutes on the M20 in Kent.\nThe best times to travel will be after 7pm on Friday, before 9am on Saturday and before 11am on Monday, with traffic expected to be lighter on Sunday.\nApproximately 17.6m car journeys are expected to be made during the long weekend. The figures are based on a survey of 2,080 UK adults, extrapolated to the 34m cars licensed in the UK.\nNick Mullender, the repairs team leader at the RAC, said: “More traffic on the roads will inevitably lead to more vehicle breakdowns, especially if the sun makes an appearance and people decide on the day to visit popular destinations. Anyone planning routes through these areas should set off as early as possible or be prepared to spend longer in traffic.”\nRail passengers face their own challenges. Some major routes will be closed for engineering works as Network Rail carries out 261 projects over the long weekend.\nLong-distance services will be suspended between London King’s Cross and Peterborough on Sunday, affecting Anglo-Scottish routes along the east coast mainline by LNER and Lumo.\nAvanti West Coast will run a reduced service to and from London Euston, with no trains between Birmingham New Street and Birmingham International from Saturday to Monday. Affected services by Avanti West Coast and CrossCountry will be diverted, adding extra time to journeys. London Northwestern services will run to and from Birmingham International only.\nHelen Hamlin, the chief network operator at Network Rail, said: “While the vast majority of the railway will be running, works on some parts of the network are unfortunately unavoidable as we complete major work to support a better, more reliable railway that we wouldn’t be able to complete in a normal weekend. So we’re asking passengers to check their journeys in advance to ensure their route isn’t affected.”", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 04:01:07 GMT", "author": "Priya Bharadia", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}
{"title": "Reeves considers replacing stamp duty with new property tax", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/aug/18/rachel-reeves-stamp-duty-property-tax-council-tax", "text": "The Treasury is considering a new tax on the sale of homes worth more than £500,000 as a step towards a radical overhaul of stamp duty and council tax, the Guardian has been told.\nAs the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, prepares the ground for tax rises in this autumn’s budget, senior ministers have tasked officials to study how a new “proportional” property tax could be implemented and model its impact before reporting back to ministers, who have been briefed on the proposals.\nOfficials are initially examining a potential national property tax, which would replace stamp duty on owner-occupied homes, sources said. They are also studying whether, after the national tax, a local property tax could then replace council tax in the medium term in an effort to repair battered local authority finances.\nNo final decisions have been made. A national tax could be implemented during this parliament, while it is understood an overhaul of council tax would take longer, at least requiring Labour to win a second term in office.\nThe policy options are being considered as part of a large tranche of work within the Treasury aimed at tapping into the vast cumulative rise in house prices in recent years that risks entrenching inequalities and making council tax – which is based on early 1990s property values – more unfair.\nIf the plans came to fruition, they could provide valuable political cover for Reeves, both in terms of raising extra revenue without breaking Labour’s pledge to not raise levies on working people and as policies that would be likely to appeal to many of the party’s MPs and members.\nThere has been increasing pressure on the chancellor to consider more wealth-based taxes, notably from the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, and the additional tax on more expensive homes could be presented in this light.\nThe national tax would be paid by owner-occupiers on houses worth more than £500,000 when they sell their home. The amount paid would be determined by the value of the property, with the rate set by central government, which would directly collect the proceeds via HM Revenue and Customs. It would not replace stamp duty on second homes.\nCurrent rates of stamp duty vary depending on whether someone is a first-time buyer and are banded in steps upward depending on the value of the property being bought and sold.\nIt would take time to phase in a replacement to stamp duty, and a range of options are being considered for phasing in changes. The revenue raised by stamp duty on primary residences varies considerably from year to year, depending on housing market conditions. In the last financial year, it raised £11.6bn, according to government figures. Over time, it is believed the new national property tax would be a more reliable, consistent source of revenue and ultimately raise the same amount as stamp duty.\nThe levy would only affect about a fifth of property sales, compared with about 60% with current levels of stamp duty, which is paid by the buyer of a home. The average price of a home in the UK was £272,664 in July, according to Nationwide.\nSources said Treasury officials were, in part, drawing on the findings of a 48-page report from the centre-right thinktank Onward, which was published in August last year.\nOnward’s report proposes a dual approach of a national and local “proportional property tax” on property, based on its value. It is written by Dr Tim Leunig, who worked as a government adviser for more than a decade and was closely involved with devising the furlough scheme during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nLeunig wrote: “These proposals would make it easier and cheaper to move house, for a better job, or to be near family, as well as being fairer. It should not be the case that a terrace house in Burnley pays more than a mansion in Kensington – and it wouldn’t be under these proposals.”\nThe government has already showed signals of adopting some of the steps towards council tax Leunig laid out in his report: “The first step would be to end the overfunding of various councils in affluent areas of inner London, particularly Westminster, Wandsworth and Kensington and Chelsea councils.” This is similar to the approach laid out this summer in a consultation on how to redistribute from richer to poorer councils.\nThe idea of a new local annual property levy to replace council tax was also proposed by Onward. That plan would result in owners, rather than the residents, of a property worth up to £500,000 paying varying rates of tax dependent on the value of their home. They would pay a minimum of £800 a year and the funds this generates would go directly to local councils, whose finances have been severely stretched in recent years.\nRayner has already raised the prospect of ramping up redistributions of funds to address regional inequalities, which she has argued are exacerbated by the existing council tax system, which replaced the poll tax in 1993.\nA spokesperson for the Treasury said: “As set out in the plan for change, the best way to strengthen public finances is by growing the economy – which is our focus. Changes to tax and spend policy are not the only ways of doing this, as seen with our planning reforms, which are expected to grow the economy by £6.8bn and cut borrowing by £3.4bn.\n“We are committed to keeping taxes for working people as low as possible, which is why at last autumn’s budget, we protected working people’s payslips and kept our promise not to raise the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, employee national insurance or VAT.”\nEconomists from the right and left of the political spectrum have heavily criticised stamp duty and council tax. Stamp duty applies in England and Northern Ireland. There are different approaches to some land taxes in Wales and Scotland. Council tax banding based on older property values is considered flawed and out of date by economists in all parts of the UK and is believed to be ripe for reform.\nIn June, the government launched a consultation on how to reform the allocation of funds raised by council tax. Labour said the “fair funding review” aims to fix the “broken funding system we inherited” which has “left local authorities across the country in crisis”.\nThe strategy has already met a backlash after it emerged deprived inner-city London councils stand to lose millions of pounds.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies, an economic thinktank, has said that while reform was very much needed, the proposed changes in the government’s funding review appeared to run counter to an “expectation that deprived and urban areas would win at the expense of more affluent and rural areas, the government’s baseline funding reform proposals are not particularly redistributive to poor, urban areas of England”.\nWhile any wealth-related tax could provoke strong criticism from rightwing opponents, ministers have shown willingness to ignore such criticism for policies that generally affect wealthier people, such as adding VAT on private school fees and changes to inheritance tax for some farms.\nIf billed as a part of a longer-term replacement of stamp duty, this could also be helpful given the existing levy is unpopular and widely seen as a blunt tool and a block on the property market.\nUsing property taxes as a replacement for council tax would be complex to implement and almost inevitably require a second term in office, but there is an increasing acceptance among all the main parties that the current system for local government funding is obsolete and unviable.\nLabour has already committed to the biggest shake-up of council structures in England for decades but does not want to oversee the predicted series of local authorities declaring effective bankruptcy, especially as many will be run by the party.\nLast week, the Guardian revealed that the Treasury was also looking at ways to raise more money from inheritance tax in an attempt to ease pressure on the country’s finances, in the run-up to Reeves’s autumn budget.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:04:42 GMT", "author": "Anna Isaac and Peter Walker", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

But the problem of what to do with 700,000 cubic metres of radioactive waste – roughly the volume of 6,000 doubledecker buses – from the country’s past nuclear programme, as well as future waste from nuclear expansion, has yet to be solved.\nThe government is proposing the vast underground nuclear dump, known as a geological deposit facility (GDF), to safely deal with legacy waste and new nuclear material.\nNo site has yet been confirmed for the dump and Lincolnshire county council recently pulled out of the process, leaving only two possible sites, both in Cumbria.\nA Treasury assessment this month, contained in the annual report of the National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority (Nista), has rated the project as “red”, which means successful delivery appears to be “unachievable”.\nA red rating states: “There are major issues with project definition, schedule, budget, quality and/or benefits delivery, which at this stage do not appear to be manageable or resolvable. The project may need rescoping and/or its overall viability reassessed.”\nThe report also suggests the cost could soar to up to £54bn.\nRichard Outram, the secretary of Nuclear Free Local Authorities, said: “The Nista red rating is hardly surprising. The GDF process is fraught with uncertainties and the GDF ‘solution’ remains unproven and costly.\n“A single facility as estimated by government sources could cost the taxpayer between £20bn and £54bn. This being a nuclear project, it is much more likely to be the latter and beyond.”\nMost nuclear waste is currently stored at Sellafield in Cumbria, which the Office for Nuclear Regulation says is one of the most complex and hazardous nuclear sites in the world.\nThe power stations that need decommissioning include 11 Magnox power stations built between the 1950s and 1970s, including Dungeness A in Kent, Hinkley Point A in Somerset and Trawsfynydd in north Wales, as well as seven advanced gas-cooled reactors built in the 1990s, including Dungeness B, Hinkley Point B and Heysham 1 and 2 in Lancashire.\nWaste from more recent nuclear facilities, including Sizewell B, a pressurised water reactor in Suffolk, and two new EDF pressurised water reactors – Hinkley C, which is under construction in Somerset, and Sizewell C, which is planned for construction in Suffolk – will also need to be deposited in a GDF.\nIt is likely to take until 2150 to deposit the legacy waste into a GDF, if one is built. Only then would a GDF be able to take waste from new nuclear reactors.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “Constructing the UK’s first geological disposal facility will provide an internationally recognised safe and permanent disposal of the most hazardous radioactive waste.\n“Progress continues to be made in areas taking part in the siting process for this multibillion-pound facility, which would bring thousands of skilled jobs and economic growth to the local area.”", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:54:44 GMT", "author": "Sandra Laville", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

Big phone providers are already facing competition from financial firms including Revolut and the buy-now-pay-later provide Klarna, which are also trying to take a slice of the mobile phone market.\nA spokesperson for Monzo said: “Monzo is known for transforming products – and an entire industry – to deliver a great experience for customers. So when we heard from our customers that mobile contracts can be a pain point we set out to explore how we could do this the Monzo way, and are in the early stages of developing this idea.”\nThe move, which was first reported by the Financial Times, would help diversify revenues for Monzo, which has already gone from a scrappy newcomer luring millennials with its sleek app and hot coral pink card, to a fully licensed bank with more than 13 million UK customers and more than 3,900 staff.\nIt could help increase the company’s valuation before an anticipated initial public offering. Monzo was last valued at £4.5bn in October 2024 when employees sold stock to existing investors. This followed a funding round in May the same year that raised £500m.\nWhile its valuation has lagged significantly behind its rival Revolut, which was last valued at $45bn (£33.6bn), Monzo has focused most of its growth in the UK and gained a coveted banking licence from British regulators in 2016. Revolut has only been granted a restricted licence and, 12 months on, has yet to have its application fully authorised despite government efforts to hasten the process.\nMonzo was recently embroiled in controversy and fined £21m over weak financial crime controls. An investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority found that the controls were lax enough that customers were able to register for accounts using “obviously implausible UK addresses when applying for an account”, including 10 Downing Street, Buckingham Palace and Monzo’s own headquarters.\nThe bank’s chief executive, TS Anil, said last month that the FCA fine drew a line under issues he said had been resolved and were “firmly in the past – with our learnings at the time leading to substantial improvements in our controls”.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:58:20 GMT", "author": "Kalyeena Makortoff Banking correspondent", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

These days, it seems content to be a willing supplicant – handing over its data, infrastructure and public services to US tech giants in exchange for the promise of a few percentage points of efficiency gains. Worryingly, the artificial intelligence strategy of Sir Keir Starmer’s government appears long on rhetoric, short on sovereignty and built on techno-utopian assumptions. Last week Peter Kyle, the technology secretary, was promoting the use of AI-generated discharge letters in the NHS. The tech, he said, will process complex conversations between doctors and patients, slashing paperwork and streamlining services. Ministers say that by applying AI across the public sector, the government can save £45bn.\nBut step back and a more familiar pattern emerges. As Cecilia Rikap, a researcher at University College London, told the Politics Theory Other podcast, Britain risks becoming a satellite of the US tech industry – a nation whose public infrastructure serves primarily as a testing ground and data source for American AI models hosted on US-owned cloud computing networks. She warned that the UK should not become a site of “extractivism”, in which value – whether in the form of knowledge, labour or electricity – is supplied by Britain but monetised in the US.\nIt’s not just that the UK lacks a domestic cloud ecosystem. It’s that the government’s strategy does nothing to build one. The concern is that public data, much of it drawn from the NHS and local authorities, will be shovelled into models built and trained abroad. The value captured from that data – whether in the form of model refinement or product development – will accrue not to the British public, but to US shareholders. Even the promise of job creation appears shaky. Datacentres, the physical backbone of AI, are capital-intensive, energy-hungry, and each one employs only about 50 people.\nMeanwhile, Daron Acemoglu, the MIT economist and Nobel laureate, offers a still more sobering view: far from ushering in a golden age of labour augmentation, today’s AI rollout is geared almost entirely toward labour displacement. Prof Acemoglu sees a fork: AI can empower workers – or replace them. Right now, it is doing the latter. Ministerial pledges of productivity gains may just mean fewer jobs – not better services.\nThe deeper problem is one of imagination. A government serious about digital sovereignty might build a public cloud, fund open-source AI models and create institutions capable of steering technological development toward social ends. Instead, we are offered efficiency-by-outsourcing – an AI strategy where Britain provides the inputs and America reaps the returns. In a 2024 paper, Prof Acemoglu challenged Goldman Sachs’ 10-year forecast that AI would lead to global growth of 7% – about $7tn – and estimated instead under $1tn in gains. Much of this would be captured by US big tech.\nThere’s nothing wrong with harnessing new technologies. But their deployment must not be structured in a way that entrenches dependency and hollows out public capacity. The Online Safety Act shows digital sovereignty can enforce national rules on global platforms, notably on porn sites. But current turmoil at the Alan Turing Institute suggests a deeper truth: the UK government is dazzled by American AI and has no clear plan of its own. Britain risks becoming not a tech pioneer, but a well-governed client state in someone else’s digital empire.\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Although the government has not yet confirmed how it will calculate fares for 2026, they last rose by 4.6% in March, which was one percentage point above the RPI reading from July 2024.\nBruce Williamson, a spokesperson for the campaign group Railfuture, said such an increase would be “outrageous”.\n“What would be the justification for jacking up fares above inflation? There isn’t any,” he said.\n“It’s ripping off the customer, driving people off the trains and on to our congested road network, which is in no one’s interest.”\nThe government is working on plans to bring rail services into public ownership, and Williamson said he would support a government freeze on fares.\n“One would hope that there would be some efficiency savings and economies of scale that you get from having a more integrated railway,” he said.\n“But of course, I strongly suspect that if there are any savings to be had, they’d be swallowed up by the Treasury and not passed back to the passengers, which I think is wrong.”\nAlmost half of rail fares in England are se directly by Westminster.

They include Birmingham, Nottingham and Woking.\nThe Audit Reform Lab at Sheffield said the average cost of external auditors checking a local authority’s finances was now at least £50,000 higher in cash terms than when the Audit Commission was disbanded in 2015.\nPrivate-sector accountancy firms took over the job of auditing local government accounts in England after the agency was abolished, in an austerity-driven push by Tory and Lib Dem ministers to find savings and efficiencies.\n“Ten years on, however, it now seems clear that these reform ambitions have failed,” the authors of the report wrote.\n“Only 1% of audits were delivered on time in 2022-23, with many audits delayed by several years. Audit costs have risen dramatically in response. An unwieldy, but ultimately operational centralised bureaucracy was replaced by market chaos. The £100m per annum savings heralded by the UK government in 2014 are now a distant memory.”\nThe report found that average audit costs in England had more than tripled – an average increase of 238% – in the year to 2023-24. It blamed most of this increase on private-sector auditors hiking their rates.\nIt compared the large rise in audit costs in England to much smaller increases in Scotland and Wales, where it said there was a much stronger level of central oversight of private-sector auditing.\nSome of the biggest increases were at financially stricken councils, including a 620% rise in audit fees at Woking, as well as leaps of 470% at Runnymede and 450% at Spelthorne.\nIn total 13 councils had fee scale increases of 300% or more in 2022-23. Birmingham city council paid an audit fee above the £1m mark, representing a 314% increase. The councils were approached for comment.\nThree auditors dominate the local audit market: EY, Grant Thornton and Forvis Mazars. Others including Deloitte and BDO have exited because profit margins are considered too low, while complexity and risks have risen.\nEY and Grant Thornton declined to comment. A spokesperson for Forvis Mazars said: “We are working closely with all stakeholders including MHCLG [Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government] and remain committed to supporting the return to the delivery of good quality audits for local authorities.”\nWhile audit costs have risen sharply, so has the complexity of checking council finances at a time when growing numbers of local authorities are running into severe financial difficulties.\nExperts have also long warned local audit fees have been too low to attract accountancy firms to do the job, compared with the money available in private-sector auditing.\nIn 2020, an independent review by Sir Tony Redmond found fees were “at least 25% lower than required to fulfil current local audit requirements effectively”.\nThe breakdown in local audit reached crisis point two years ago when only 1% of English councils had their 2022-23 accounts signed off in time. Ministers then allowed accounts to be completed with qualifications – whereby an auditor signs off but expresses reservations – to clear the backlog.\nA new Local Audit Office is also being established to centralise previously fragmented oversight of the process.\nAn MHCLG spokesperson said: “We have taken decisive action to restore the broken audit system, providing £49m to help councils clear backlogs – but we know there is more to do. This is why we will set up a new Local Audit Office to simplify the system and increase capacity by establishing public sector audit provision.\n“This will ensure the local audit system provides accountability, transparency, and value for money for taxpayers.”\nRunnymede council said it was on a sound financial footing and did not recognise the fees quoted in the Audit Reform Lab report.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 23:01:01 GMT", "author": "Richard Partington Senior economics correspondent.", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

Reynolds is expected to reply to the letter this week, after asking for more time to respond.\nManufacturers behind the legal letter said Reynolds gave just 24 hours’ notice of the quota cut, leaving thousands of tonnes of imported steel stranded at UK ports. They said steel already on ships from east Asia had been “bought and paid for” but would now attract a tariff on entry to the UK.\nThe Confederation of British Metalforming (CBM), which represent companies that forge, weld and roll raw steel to make industrial products, said its members faced a “tsunami” of problems, from higher costs to delayed shipments. It said disruptions in deliveries “are reverberating throughout domestic industry”.\nPaul Whitehouse, the managing director of Steel & Alloy Gonvarri Industries, based near Birmingham, said he would need to pay more than £500,000 in tariff surcharges.\nWhitehouse said: “The government has shot itself in the foot. It wants to help the steel industry, but acting in this way, giving just 24 hours’ notice, has only increased our expenses. We work on very small margins – 1% to 2% – and these extra costs matter.”\nThe main producers of raw steel in the UK are Tata Steel’s operations in south Wales and British Steel’s plant in Scunthorpe, which was taken over by the government in April after it became concerned that its Chinese owner, Jingye, was planning to let its blast furnaces cool.\nSpeciality Steel UK (SSUK), which employs 1,500 people and is part of the Liberty Steel Group owned by Sanjeev Gupta, is also under threat of closure.\nUK steel businesses have struggled to find domestic buyers after a collapse in demand from longstanding customers. Car production has fallen in the UK and activity in the commercial construction sector, another large user of steel, has slowed this year.\nA regime of quotas and tariffs already exists, protecting UK raw steel makers from cheap Chinese imports and restricting imports from the EU.\nPressure has mounted since February when many steel-producing countries began seeking new markets for their products amid threats by Donald Trump of hefty tariffs on imports to the US. Washington’s steel tariffs have also dented UK exports to the US.\nThe government said its decision followed a recommendation by the Trade Remedies Authority (TRA). However, the metal industry accused Reynolds of ignoring changes set out by the independent body.\nA review by the TRA recommended a cap of 40% on tariff-free imports from “other” countries that make raw steel, including Vietnam, Thailand and South Korea. But Reynolds reduced the cap to 15% and said it would apply the next day.\nThe industry had been expecting the new rules to be implemented in October, giving them time to find new suppliers.\nThe CBM president, Stephen Morley, said steel was being stockpiled at ports “creating a domino effect, with businesses facing additional costs, logistical challenges, and uncertainties about the future of their operations”.\nHe said his members were in favour of measures safeguarding UK steel production, but added that Reynolds had “exacerbated the existing pressures on firms already grappling with the aftermath of the current economic climate”.\nMembers of the CBM are understood to be clubbing together to fund a judicial review of Reynolds’s decision after sending him a pre-action protocol letter.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: “We do not comment on potential or ongoing legal proceedings.”", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:32:18 GMT", "author": "Phillip Inman", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

It was founded by the restaurateur Nick Jones, who has a 5% stake, although the biggest investor is the US retail billionaire Ron Burkle, who holds 40% of the company. Richard Caring, the owner of the Ivy restaurant chain, has a 21% stake. All three will retain their stakes, as will the US investment bank Goldman Sachs, which has 8%.\nThe new investors will pay $9 a share for about 15% of the Soho House & Co shares that trade publicly. The company said the deal implied an enterprise value of about $2.7bn, although that included $700m of debt.\nThe offer leaves the value of its shares – at about $2bn – well below the $2.8bn level it achieved shortly after listing in 2021. The company has traded below $9 a share since May 2022, although it said that offer represented an 83% premium to the price before investor interest was revealed in December.\nMCR Hotels is the third-largest hotel operator in the US, with more than 150 sites including the High Line hotel and the TWA at JFK airport, both in New York. It is converting the BT Tower in London’s Fitzrovia into a hotel, after reaching a deal last year to buy it for £275m.\nSoho House operates 10 locations in London, and 48 that are either open or planned around the world, ranging from Paris and Istanbul to Bangkok and Mumbai. It has four clubs in Los Angeles and three in New York. While it is listed in New York, its main office is in London.\nIt attracts a celebrity clientele, with Kate Moss, Kendall Jenner and Ellie Goulding among those spotted at its clubs. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan, met on a blind date in 2016 at its 76 Dean Street house in London.\nHowever, the company has had to balance the rapid and expensive global expansion of the chain with the difficulty of retaining the feeling of exclusivity demanded by the 213,000 members who must pay an annual fee of up to £2,920 a year for access to every property.\nIts share price has dropped from above $14 in August 2021 to $7.64 on Friday. The company has lost a cumulative $739m in the four years it has been listed, although it has made a net profit in its past three quarters.\nIts struggles have attracted attention from activist investors who push for improvements in companies. Third Point, the hedge fund run by the billionaire Dan Loeb, had argued that Soho House should seek other investors to try to push for a competitive bidding process.\nThe Wall Street short sellers GlassHouse had previously raised concerns about Soho House’s accounting, although these were rejected by the company.\nAndrew Carnie, the chief executive of Soho House & Co, said the deal “reflects the strong confidence our existing and incoming shareholders have in the future of Soho House & Co”, despite a “backdrop of challenging economic conditions and global uncertainty”.\nThe company argues that it has become a more efficient business in the past two years, allowing it to increase in size more profitably. Revenue has doubled in the past three years.\n“Returning to private ownership enables us to build on this momentum, with the support of world class hospitality and investment partners,” Carnie said. “I’m incredibly proud of what our teams have accomplished and am excited about our future, as we continue to be guided by our members and grounded in the spirit that makes Soho House so special.”", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:35:37 GMT", "author": "Jasper Jolly", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}
{"title": "Racing strike leads to battle lines being drawn in dispute over tax reforms | Greg Wood", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/18/racing-strike-prompts-battle-lines-dispute-over-tax-reforms", "text": "Two days on from the out-of-the-blue announcement that British racing will strike on 10 September, the widespread media exposure the move has received may already be worth significantly more than the loss to sport from cancelling low-key meetings at Kempton, Lingfield, Carlisle and Uttoxeter. It will be an afternoon when most punters are looking 24 hours ahead to the St Leger meeting at Doncaster.\nAs a result, there is a raised awareness of the deep concerns about government plans to harmonise the duty rates for online betting and casino-style gaming products, which could, according to modelling commissioned by the British Horseracing Authority, cost the sport between £66m and £160m in annual income.\nThere will be further coverage on the day itself to add to the balance sheet, the races concerned will be restaged at other meetings to minimise the loss of media rights income and the degree of cooperation required between the BHA and racing’s two biggest racecourse ownership groups is also a positive for the sport.\nThe response of the main industry body, the Betting and Gaming Council, to the news was instructive, too. “Racing’s decision to reschedule fixtures was taken without consultation with betting operators, whose support for the funding of the sport is mission critical,” the BGC said on Sunday. “We are concerned that futile political gestures will only antagonise the government and frustrate punters, instead of delivering a solution to a shared challenge facing both racing and betting.”\nThis followed hot on the heels of a suggestion by Michael Dugher, the BGC’s chair, in a column in the Racing Post that “any increase in costs gets passed on not just to the sport, through reduced spend on sponsorship, but also punters. That might mean worse odds, fewer offers, less generous promotions.”\nThe same column also included perhaps the most absurd sentence to appear in the pages of the sport’s trade paper since Fred Done, the chair of BetFred, suggested that cutting the maximum stake on roulette machines in betting shops from £100 to £2 could force him to close his entire high-street estate.\n“The idea that betting on horseracing is purely a game of ‘skill’ and not also a game of ‘chance’ is nonsense,” Dugher wrote. “How many punters back a horse because they like the name or the colours? If betting on horses were purely a game of skill, how is it that a 150-1 shot wins a Group 1 at Goodwood?”\nThe weasel-word here is “purely”, because as far as I am aware, no one in racing has ever, or would ever, claim that betting is “purely a game of skill”. Instead, skill is an essential element of the process. Every horse has its chance and its price and the skill lies in judging one against the other. It is the complete absence of skill in gaming that is one of the fundamental differences between the two.\nTaken as a whole, the BGC’s response to the strike action is informative, because it should leave no one in racing with any lingering doubt that those traditional betting brands many still think of as “the bookies” are now just subsidiaries of global gambling operators, whose primary concern is the risk-free profits from fixed-margin gaming.\nThe BGC wants racing to argue for no change at all – ie 15% duty on betting and 21% on gaming – when that is the one thing that is almost certainly not going to happen. The government needs funds, the Treasury has already consulted on harmonisation and gambling revenue is a blindingly obvious target for a tax hike. As a result, and as the debate over gambling duty rolls on towards the autumn budget, the realistic best-case and worst-case scenarios for racing and the gambling industry are almost precisely opposed.\nFor racing, any harmonisation of duty, whatever the chosen rate, is the worst-case outcome, because it not only costs the sport revenue, but increases the incentive for operators to prioritise their gaming business in the longer term. The realistic best-case outcome, despite the sport’s calls to “Axe the Racing Tax” completely, is probably a small rise in betting duty – perhaps alongside possible reform of the Levy to ease some of the pain – and a much more significant hike in the rate for gaming, to reflect the increased risk of gambling-related harm.\nThe gambling industry would regard harmonisation at either 21% or 25% as a huge let-off. It is the thought of a possible rise in gaming duty – perhaps to 40% or more that they willingly pay to access gaming markets elsewhere – that is keeping their CEOs awake at night.\nRacing’s strike will not tip the balance one way or the other, but it is a long way from being the “futile political gesture” the BGC would have you believe. And if that organisation’s chair thinks that a pacemaker getting loose on the lead in the Sussex Stakes means racing is little different from roulette, it is conceivably a sign they are starting to feel the heat.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 16:08:24 GMT", "author": "Greg Wood", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}
{"title": "Trump is promising a US manufacturing renaissance. Many experts are dubious", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/trumps-tariffs-manufacturing-resurgence-jobs", "text": "Donald Trump’s hugely disruptive trade war is setting the stage for a manufacturing renaissance in the US, administration officials say. Outside the White House, many economists are skeptical.\nGlobal trade experts point to many reasons they believe the president’s tariffs will fail to bring about a major resurgence of manufacturing, among them: Trump’s erratic, constantly changing policies, his unfocused, across-the-board tariffs, and his replacing Joe Biden’s carrot-and-stick approach to brandish sticks at the world.\n“I think [Trump’s tariffs] will reduce the competitiveness of US manufacturing, and will reduce manufacturing employment,” said Michael Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute (AEI). “They’re raising the costs of production to US manufacturing companies, and that makes manufacturers less competitive. There will be some winners and some losers, but the losers will outnumber the winners.”\n‘Trump keeps changing his mind’\nThe president and his aides insist that higher tariffs on more than 100 countries – making goods imported from overseas more expensive – will spur domestic manufacturing. “The ‘Made in USA’ label is set to resume its global dominance under President Trump,” the White House spokesperson Kush Desai claimed recently.\nBut few economists see that happening. Ann E Harrison, an economics professor and former dean of the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, said the erratic, on-again-off-again rollout of Trump’s tariffs has already gone far to doom the president’s hopes of inspiring a huge wave of manufacturing investment.\n“For the policy to be successful, it has to be consistent over a long period,” she told the Guardian. “People need to believe it’s going to last. Some factories take five years to plan and build. You’re talking a long-term play. But Trump keeps changing his mind. Even over the last six months, we’ve had very little consistency.\n“The other problem is that he’s old, and no one is sure he’s going to be around that long. These policies need to be consistent, and that’s not happening.”\nEconomists point to another question mark that is causing corporate executives to think twice about building factories in the US. In May, the US court of international trade ruled that Trump’s blanket tariffs are illegal – a decision that is under appeal.\nStrain, at the AEI, said: “When you add into the equation the erratic nature of President Trump’s tariff regime, when you add the question of its questionable illegality, when you add that none of this is going through Congress, when you add that even when the US secures a ‘deal’ with another country, it’s not really a deal, there are major outstanding questions.”\nFrance doesn’t think its alcohol exports will be hit by tariffs as part of the European Union’s agreement to pay 15% tariffs, noted Strain. “That’s a big question mark that would never go unresolved in any regular, traditional trade deal,” he said. “That’s all part of the massive uncertainty we’re seeing.”\nThe Biden administration used deliberate industrial policies to boost several strategic industries, most notably semiconductors and electric vehicles, including a 100% tariff on EVs from China and 25% on lithium-ion EV batteries, as well as subsidies to buy EVs and build EV-related factories. The policies resulted in a surge in new factories to build semiconductors, electric vehicles and EV components.\nBiden “said we care about semiconductors and national security, and what he’d try to do is get actual investors to invest in it”, said Dani Rodrik, an economist specializing in trade and industrial policy at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, who predicted Trump’s blanket tariffs will prove less successful in inspiring investment. “If you really want to increase manufacturing and employment in the US, you’d go about it in a very different way, through industrial policies that first identify specific segments you care about.”\nWhen China, Japan and South Korea adopted policies to build their electronics and auto industries, they insisted that the corporations that benefited from those policies compete with foreign companies to help make them globally competitive. “For industrial policy to succeed, it has to work to promote more competition,” said Harrison, at the Haas School of Business. “The problem with tariffs is they do just the opposite. They restrict competition.”\nSusan Helper, an economist at Case Western Reserve University who worked on industrial policy in the Biden and Obama administrations, said Trump’s tariff rates on some countries and markets – like 15% on the EU, Japan and South Korea – are too low to spur much investment, questioning why a company would build a major factory to circumvent such a duty.\n“A [semiconductor fabrication] plant, that’s a billion dollars. You need to get a payback and that takes several years,” Helper said. “If the tariffs are 145% [as Trump once imposed on China], that’s attractive for building a plant. But if they fall back to 15%, then it’s really hard to get a return on your investment.”\nThe administration boasts that several of its trade deals have specific commitments to spur huge manufacturing investment. It says its deal with the EU includes a $600bn investment pledge; with Japan, a $550bn investment pledge; and with South Korea, $350bn. Jamieson Greer, US trade representative, wrote in the New York Times: “These investments – 10 times larger than the inflation-adjusted value of the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe after World War II – will accelerate US reindustrialization.”\nBut these supposed pledges have attracted skepticism. After all, this president claimed during his first term that “the eighth wonder of the world” was being built in Wisconsin after FoxConn pledged to invest $10bn and create 13,000 jobs at an electronics plant. But that promise fell embarrassingly short.\nMany economists question whether the EU, Japan or South Korea can force corporations to make a specific investment in the US. Indeed, a European Commission spokesperson said the bloc had expressed “aggregate intentions” that are “in no way” binding. “These large numbers really sound like window dressing, some round numbers they’re throwing around,” said Harvard’s Rodrik.\n“Some include investments you were already going to make, and some are aspirational,” said Todd Tucker, a trade and industrial policy expert at the Roosevelt Institute. “Once we’ve had time to evaluate whether the investment happens or not, Trump will be on to the next press cycle.”\nIn recent years, manufacturing employment has been trending downward – not just in advanced industrial countries, but also in China, as new technologies enable factories to churn out goods more efficiently, with fewer workers. That trend raises questions whether Trump’s trade policies can increase factory jobs in the US.\n‘An island of backwardness’\nThe US is past its manufacturing peak, Berkeley’s Harrison noted. “That was actually during World War Two, and it has been declining ever since,” she said. “I don’t see manufacturing’s share of the economy or manufacturing employment reversing.”\nShe added: “If the question is, are you going to bring about a major resurgence in manufacturing employment, it’s not just unlikely, the answer is no. More and more manufacturing is robot-driven and not done by people.”\nAuto industry officials in the US complain that Trump’s 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum have increased their costs and injured their competitiveness. “In manufacturing, for every one job in steel production, there are 80 jobs that use steel,” the AEI’s Strain said. “So putting tariffs on imported steel might help that one guy, but you’re hurting the other 80 people.”\nA study by Federal Reserve economists found that the tariffs Trump imposed in his first term were actually associated with a reduction in factory jobs nationwide, because increased input costs and retaliatory tariffs outweighed import protection from tariffs.\nHelper, at Case Western Reserve University, warned that the US auto industry would be hurt badly by Trump’s mishmash of tariffs coupled with his slashing subsidies for EVs. “Trump’s policies are setting the auto industry up to be an island of backwardness,” she said. “The rest of the world is going to be making EVs, but we’re going to be focused on making really high profits on pickup trucks that will be bad for the climate and won’t sell in the rest of the world.\n“We’ll have a great, competitive position in large, gas-guzzling pickups, but we’ll fall further behind in EVs. That’s a very risky and dangerous path.”", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:00:30 GMT", "author": "Steven Greenhouse", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

She lived in the El Poble-sec area of Barcelona – it translates from Catalan as “the dry village” – where she cared for her 85-year-old mother and sang in a local choir. For three years, she had worked as a city street cleaner for an outsourcing company, wearing a lime-green uniform – made, her family later said, from “100% polyester … a material used to make coats”.\nOn 28 June, her shift in the city’s Gothic Quarter began at 2.30pm and ended seven hours later. The temperature that day had reached more than 35C, which left workers like her exposed: Spain has a clearer system of regulations covering heat and work than a lot of other countries, but it is still full of gaps.\nThat afternoon, Aguilar had sent a friend a WhatsApp message: “Sorry for not answering sooner, it’s just been a really bad afternoon. Not just because of the shit [ie the rubbish], but I thought I was going to die. I’m getting pains in my arms, chest and neck, cramps.” She also seems to have told one of her managers about how awful she was feeling. When she returned home, she collapsed and hit her head. Attempts by paramedics to revive her were unsuccessful.\nThe reaction to Aguilar’s death has been furious. On 16 July, people marched behind banners that read: “Extreme heat is also workplace violence”. Street cleaners demanded better summer workwear and more breaks. They claimed that some of the most crucial new rules announced by local politicians and officials – supposedly to ensure that outdoor workers had breathable uniforms – had not been put into practice. By then, Aguilar’s family was readying legal action: if her autopsy showed she had died of heatstroke, her relatives said they would sue Aguilar’s employers and the city council.\nAfter days of searing heat in the UK, it is not hard to imagine a version of this story happening in this country – and to see that, at the intersection of work and the climate crisis, there is already a huge tangle of increasingly urgent issues. As temperatures in this corner of northern Europe once again scrape the mid-30s, what must it be like to work in warehouses and factories with precious little ventilation, let alone air conditioning? How do builders and bike couriers cope? And what are working lives like in parts of the economy from which people completely avert their eyes?\nIn the heatwave that hit us a month ago, I was in Exmoor, where I saw a pizzeria tell its customers that for the sake of their kitchen staff, they had no choice but to temporarily shut. But as people were turned away, I kept thinking of the dark kitchens that supply many of the food-delivery companies concentrated in our cities: tiny workplaces baldly described in a report by the Royal Society for Public Health as “small boxes” where food is produced in a “dark, cramped and low paid environment which is frequently either too hot or too cold”.\nWhereas European countries such as Belgium, Hungary and Slovenia have working regulations built around clear temperature limits, what passes for this country’s system of rules and regulations on work and heat is a very British mess of half-measures and mere recommendations. For those working indoors, official guidance suggests a minimum temperature of 16C, which falls to 13C if people are doing “physical work”. But neither hardened legislation nor small-print guidance specifies any maximum temperatures – nor, indeed, many comprehensive rules that cover people who work in the open air.\nHealth and safety legislation and industry-specific regulations offer some protection to workers outdoors in such trades as construction and railway maintenance. But there is an awful sense of the severity of extreme weather finding no reflection in the law.\nFrom around the world, there is an ongoing torrent of stories highlighting tensions and problems that can easily be copied across to the working lives of people in any number of other countries. In South Korea, construction workers point out that as the air reaches 35C, concrete and asphalt intensify the heat even further, and tell journalists: “In a summer like this, we think every day that we may die.” In northern India, the city of Varanasi has recently seen dozens of delivery workers cut adrift by the companies they work for, after they took part in protests demanding heat safety measures. In stories such as these, there are glimmers of demands that will soon become globally inescapable – not just for drastically altered conditions, but radically different ways of living.\nIn the UK, there are signs of deepening political tensions that another hot summer could make explosive. Before last year’s election, Labour acknowledged that “in a number of sectors, working temperatures are regularly unacceptably high” and said it would commit to “modernising health and safety guidance with reference to extreme temperatures”. As part of her plans to upgrade workplace rights, Angela Rayner repeated the last pledge once her party was in government. The Health and Safety Executive is now working on measures that would allow workers to insist on new protections from heat, and make it obligatory for employers to carry out “heat stress assessments”.\nQuite rightly, the trade unions want more. For the past few years, the TUC – supported by its big member organisations – has been pushing for a cut-off temperature in indoor workplaces of 30C, or 27C if people are doing strenuous jobs. It also demands much more flexible working, and outdoor shifts that sit either side of the middle of the day. But the signals from Whitehall seem maddeningly hesitant. Perhaps because of the government’s belief in sweeping away regulation and reducing red tape, its spokespeople insist there are “no plans to introduce a maximum workplace temperature”, while ministers bat away calls for legislation that would allow British workers to be sent home during extreme heat.\nWhat is really striking is how awkwardly searing heat sits with views of work that are common across the political establishment. Human frailty, we are told, must be no barrier to getting a job. As evidenced by new rumblings about the pension age being raised to 68, the same logic is being applied to people in what used to be considered old age – which is precisely when sensitivity to heat can become fatal. This is an aspect of climate denial that is still completely overlooked, crystallised in glaring contrasts: between the wilting parcel-deliverer or ageing supermarket worker stoically pushing shopping trolleys across baking asphalt, and the politicians still failing to look ahead to a recalibration of work that will surely become inevitable much sooner than they think. As labour becomes ever more a matter of life and death, how could it be otherwise?\n-\nJohn Harris is a Guardian columnist", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 05:00:52 GMT", "author": "John Harris", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

A 57-year-old inmate was moaning and hyperventilating. She said her “guts are all twisted up”.\nRather than sending her to the ER, medical staff chalked her pain up to opioid withdrawal, since they had taken a prescription opioid away upon her arrival days before, a grand jury investigation later found. They placed the inmate – referred to as CF in the grand jury’s report – on mental health observation and gave her Tylenol. Even as the cell floor became covered in vomit, staff ignored her requests to go to the hospital. The documentation that should have been filled out to explain why her request was not honored was never completed.\nThe grand jury determined that CF’s stomach had perforated days before her excruciating death in March. Medical staff had taken her inability to walk from her cell to the exam room as “a refusal of treatment”, according to the investigation. Twenty minutes later, CF was discovered “unresponsive in her cell, slumped over, with lips that had become blue in color”.\nAn autopsy report and investigation concluded that CF would have had a 90% chance of survival if she had received immediate treatment. Instead, medical staff had attempted to revive her with Narcan, which only revives people who are experiencing overdose.\nWellpath, one of the nation’s leading health providers to prisons and jails, was the contractor responsible for healthcare at Santa Barbara county’s Northern Branch jail, where CF died. The grand jury’s report is the latest in over a decade of government investigations into two behemoths in the prison health industry – Wellpath and Corizon – which are both backed by private equity investors.\nSince 2014, in eight cases involving these two private equity-backed healthcare companies examined by the Guardian, investigators from the Department of Justice, New York City department of investigation and other local investigators, have found their negligence so severe that it violated inmates’ eighth amendment rights protecting them from substantial risk of harm, including preventable death. Staff shortages are often a contributing factor – a 2023-24 Santa Barbara county grand jury investigation into Wellpath-managed jails found that staffing shortages led to delays in care.\nDespite these issues, the private prison healthcare industry has only continued to grow – it was estimated to be a $9.3bn business in 2022. Both Corizon and Wellpath continued to contract with jails, prisons, immigration and juvenile detention centers around the country until they faced so much liability – both from lawsuits and other complex business issues – that both landed in bankruptcy court over the last two years.\nThe Guardian approached Wellpath and Corizon’s new iteration, YesCare, for comment about alleged medical neglect. Wellpath said in a statement that it provides “safe and effective care” to patients. YesCare did not provide a comment.\nBoth companies were still operating in some form while restructuring in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, and had reorganization plans confirmed in bankruptcy court this year that allowed them to settle many of their debts and continue their prison contracts.\nColleen Grogan, a professor at University of Chicago’s school of social work, said the reason for Wellpath and Corizon’s continued existence, despite facing scrutiny, is simple: “These private equity firms have a ton of political power, and prisoners are the most vulnerable. The political power dynamics are about the worst they can be.”\nCorizon formed in 2011 from a merger between two existing prison healthcare companies. By 2016, Corizon had been sued 660 times for malpractice, including many wrongful death and personal injury suits. During that time, a US Department of Justice investigation into conditions at New York City’s Rikers Island found that adolescent inmates at the facility had their constitutional rights violated due to the high risk of violence from Rikers staff and other inmates. Corizon medical staff sometimes failed to report injuries from prison staff use of force, and would avoid calming inmates being forcibly removed from their cells, even though it was part of their job. The investigation also raised concerns about the poor quality of mental healthcare Corizon provided at Rikers, which may have violated the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. In 2015, a New York City department of investigation report on the same facility found “significant breakdowns” by Corizon Health. “Corizon staff improperly removed inmates from suicide watch or otherwise failed to supervise inmates with serious mental illnesses,” the report said. “Two of those inmates died while unsupervised.”\nCorizon lost its contract with Rikers Island in 2015, but it still remained a market leader. Corizon’s then CEO claimed at the time that Corizon provided oversight rather than directly employing medical staff. The remarks contradicted the New York City department of investigation’s findings.\nIn 2016, an independent medical expert investigated Corizon’s performance with the Alabama department of corrections and found that in some cases medical providers employed by the company attempted to manage care “for which they have no experience”, which could result in harm to patients. In a media report at the time, Corizon said that it provided quality care to its patients.\nIn one case, a patient was briefly hospitalized for a groin infection, but returned to the prison quickly. Over the next six months, the expert’s report said, the infection spread to his entire right leg, and began to ooze and become discolored. When he returned to the hospital, his doctor recommended a surgical consultation, but Corizon’s regional medical director called to have him returned to prison instead, the report said. He died of septic shock.\nAs lawsuits against Corizon piled up, a new market leader emerged when the private equity firm HIG merged together multiple companies to form Wellpath in 2018. During this time, the market was growing, but the number of competitors was shrinking.\nErin Fuse Brown, a professor of health services at Brown University, said private equity was known for buying up competitors. Private equity firms, she said, were able to grow their market shares in prison health because they have deep pockets that allow them to handle the risk that comes with an industry so prone to legal liability – and to provide a variety of services all at once so prisons and jails do not need to look for additional contracts.\n“They basically are saying, ‘we can provide this whole thing, soup to nuts,’” Fuse Brown said, adding that once they land those contracts, private equity firms will aggressively cut costs to further edge out competitors and maximize profits.\nThose cost cutting measures tie directly to alleged civil rights violations, according to Caroline Cohn, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. Multiple contracts from Wellpath and Corizon, as well as Wellpath’s own promotional materials, show both companies charged facilities per inmate per day.\n“When private healthcare companies receive a fixed fee per person, their financial incentive is to spend less on the care they’re providing to incarcerated patients,” Cohn explained. “The impact on quality of care is predictable, and there are hundreds of lawsuits, complaints, and news stories documenting just how horrific this care often is.”\nAs Wellpath became the dominant player, accusations of constitutional violations stacked up against them as well. Department of Justice investigations into the Massachusetts department of corrections in 2020 and the San Luis Obispo county jail in 2021 both found that Wellpath staff violated inmates’ rights by failing to adequately monitor inmates facing mental health crises – including those who were self-harming – and by in some case placing them in solitary confinement for prolonged periods rather than offering treatment.\nIn 2019, according to the federal investigation, one Massachusetts inmate died by suicide after hanging himself in an isolation cell. It was his seventh attempt in the prison. After one attempt, “he made statements about sacrificing himself to prove how bad the system is.” Before he died, the investigation found, mental health staff employed by Wellpath “took his word that he would not harm himself and granted his request to leave mental health watch without addressing his risk factors”.\nIn 2023 an order from San Jose, California’s district court required that records pertaining to Wellpath’s performance in Monterey county jails be unsealed – these reports show multiple preventable deaths, and at least one lost limb.\n“Prison health is the perfect market for private equity because they are serving a literally captive audience,” said Brendan Ballou, former special counsel to the Department of Justice’s anti-trust division and author of the book, Plunder: Private Equity’s Plan to Pillage America. He said “tough-on-crime” legislation “had made it harder for prisoners to have their rights vindicated”. For example, the 1996 Prison Litigation Reform Act requires incarcerated people pay filing fees if they want to initiate a lawsuit, and to “exhaust all remedies” available to them in prison before seeking justice in civil court, even if those remedies are difficult to access. Supreme court rulings in 2006 and 2020 added additional hurdles for inmates seeking justice.\nAnd private equity firms have another layer of protection from liability, according to Ballou. Past court rulings make it difficult to hold private contractors liable for wrongdoing in prisons, and “corporate veil piercing law”, which protects private equity firms from being held responsible for the actions of their investments, makes it very difficult for victims to go after the firms behind the prison health companies that allegedly hurt them. So private equity firms know that even if their prison health investments face a lot of liability, they can remain relatively untouched.\nWhen federal investigations implicated Wellpath in constitutional violations, they would center their regulatory firepower on Wellpath’s government clients and not Wellpath itself. Even then, the sanctions were not severe, mostly coming in the form of recommendations for improvements, including better training for mental health staff. Department of Justice settlements with the Massachusetts department of correction and San Luis Obispo county did not include any fines or punishment for Wellpath, although the company did eventually lose its contract with the Massachusetts department of correction. Inmates and their loved ones who suffered from Wellpath’s alleged negligence did not receive any compensation under these settlements. Both the Massachusetts department of correction and San Luis Obispo county denied any wrongdoing.\nA Wellpath spokesperson said in a statement that “Wellpath is committed to our patients and the communities we serve. Our company and our thousands of frontline caregivers are dedicated to providing safe and effective care to our patients.”\nThe controversies may have started to affect the companies’ bottom line – both filed for bankruptcy in the last two years. Corizon’s 2023 bankruptcy was controversial – they attempted a maneuver known as a “Texas two-step”, in which a company splits the company in two, putting its assets into one company and its liabilities in another, which files for bankruptcy. A group of senators, led by Elizabeth Warren wrote a letter accusing the company of using the bankruptcy court to “evade liability”. In a response defending the bankruptcy, company leadership claimed Corizon was so loaded with liability in 2020 that investors sold it to Flacks Group, a private equity firm that specializes in distressed assets, for about $10m – the same amount the company paid out in a wrongful death suit the previous year, and a pittance for a company that had recently reported $800m in revenue.\nBoth Wellpath and YesCare, the surviving half of Corizon’s split, had Chapter 11 reorganization plans approved in bankruptcy courts this year. Both companies still have contracts in prisons and jails across the country.\nAs for CF, the inmate who died in a Santa Barbara county jail – the grand jury’s investigation did not do much in the way of justice for her. Despite the horrific death the report describes, the only consequence for Wellpath is that the county will conduct a thorough assessment of its services in the jail. Even if Wellpath does lose its contract, there won’t be a lot of other options to choose from.\nYesCare’s press office did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:00:40 GMT", "author": "Hannah Harris Green", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

Disclosures show he cited examples such as airport delays caused by drones.\nAcoba, which is due to be scrapped amid allegations that it is “toothless”, agreed he could take up the position, providing “strategic direction and high level advice”, on condition that he did not work on matters related to defence.\nAcoba appeared to accept Shapps’s description of Cambridge Aerospace’s activities, saying the company’s work “focuses on civilian aerospace”, meaning there was no direct overlap with the former defence minister’s access to sensitive information.\nThe Labour MP Phil Brickell said this explanation was “stretching credulity” given Cambridge Aerospace’s own public statements and backers.\nThe company, which has attracted around $100m (£73.9m) in funding, outlined its plans in a presentation to investors, first reported by The Upstart and subsequently obtained by the Guardian.\nSlides in the presentation describe Cambridge Aerospace as a “defence tech” company and refer to the need to prepare for a “new era of warfare”.\nSpeaking to Bloomberg last month, Prof Steven Barrett, Cambridge Aerospace’s co-founder and a longtime acquaintance of Shapps, said the company had “one mission”.\nThis was “to protect the UK and our allies from the well-known threats we face from the skies”.\nThe company’s first product, labelled Skyhammer, aims to intercept drones and cruise missiles, leading to comparisons with Israel’s Iron Dome missile defence system.\nThe technology is understood to have been initially intended to counter drones and could expand to include defence against threats including ballistic and hypersonic missiles. The firm is planning to operate from an engineering site in Munich and a manufacturing hub in the Polish city of Gdansk.\nBarrett’s co-founder, Chris Sylvan, previously worked for Anduril, a California-based defence company that is developing what Sylvan appears to have described as “robot fighter jets” in a post on the professional social networking platform LinkedIn. The post is no longer available.\nShapps served as defence secretary between August 2023 and July 2024, a tenure that falls within the two-year grace period during which former ministers must apply to Acoba if they want to take up private sector roles.\nThe system is designed to ensure that ministers and their new employers do not benefit unfairly from information or contacts garnered from their time in government. Acoba can only advise on appointments but, in practice, has no power to block them, unlike its equivalent body in France, which can veto appointments.\nIn its advice to Shapps, Acoba said the risk of a conflict of interest was “limited”.\n“Whilst you will have had oversight of a wide range of information on policy, operations and matters generally affecting defence, there is no direct overlap with your access to sensitive information as this work focuses on civilian aerospace,” it said.\nEarlier this year, Keir Starmer pledged to replace Acoba, which was described as “toothless” in a 2017 report, with a tougher system of checks and balances to monitor ministers’ private earnings after leaving office.\nBrickell said Acoba’s advice to Shapps was “yet another example” of why Labour was getting rid of Acoba.\n“It’s weak, has no teeth and doesn’t have the powers to prevent conflicts of interest from arising,” he said.\n“Grant Shapps seems to be saying one thing about what he’ll be doing, while his company is saying another. It is stretching credulity to breaking point. The authorities clearly need to look at this again, and Shapps should resign from this post if he can’t provide satisfactory answers.”\nA spokesperson for the campaign group Transparency International said: “Oversight of this revolving door rests on little more than gentlemen’s agreements, with no means in practice of enforcing the business appointment rules.\n“It will just invite abuse until the rules governing former ministers entering the private sector are tightened, and properly enforced.”\nShapps said: “I joined Cambridge Aerospace because I have always believed in the importance of protecting our civilian airspace – a belief only strengthened by witnessing the devastation caused by Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.\n“As the company has grown, so too have the threats facing our nation. Our mission is to develop technology that can save lives, strengthen UK and allied security, and create highly skilled British jobs. I’m proud to be a founding partner in a business dedicated to those goals.”\nA spokesperson for Acoba pointed to the advice it had given Shapps not to engage in defence matters for two years.\n“The committee also took into account that as a qualified pilot since 1995, Mr Shapps had a long-term interest in aviation, unrelated to his time in ministerial office,” they added.\nBarrett said: “In the less than a year since Cambridge Aerospace was formed, we have developed a range of products, hired nearly 60 people into highly skilled engineering roles, and continue to invest significantly in full domestic manufacturing.\n“As we have seen in Ukraine, the need to protect against a range of threats from the air, targeted at anything from infrastructure to civilian populations is only increasing. I am incredibly proud of the work our team has done to provide a low-cost solution that can provide vital defensive capabilities to these threats facing Europe and our allies.”", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:17:57 GMT", "author": "Rob Davies and Jasper Jolly", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}
{"title": "We used AI to analyse three cities. It’s true: we now walk more quickly and socialise less | Carlo Ratti", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/18/ai-walk-more-quickly-socialise-less-public-spaces", "text": "Something is thinning in public space. Pavements are still crowded. Parks still bustle. But if you look more closely – or, better still, if you measure it – the texture of our interactions has changed.\nTogether with colleagues at Yale, Harvard and other universities, we used AI to compare footage of public spaces from the 1970s with recent video in the same locations in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. The findings are striking: people walk faster, linger less, and are less likely to meet up. That’s no surprise in a world where phones, Netflix and AI companions are luring us away from real-world spaces and real-world friends. Yet, if technology is part of the problem, it may also be part of the solution. By using AI to study urban public spaces, we can gather data, pick out patterns and test new designs that could help us rethink, for our time, our modern versions of the agora– the market and main public gathering place of Athens.\nThe urban playground has always drawn curious minds. Among the sharpest was William “Holly” Whyte, who filmed plazas and parks in 1970s New York. He was fascinated by where people chose to sit, how they navigated space, and what drew them together. His findings, documented in The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces (1980), were at times beautifully simple: “What attracts people most, it would appear, is other people.” From his footage, Whyte turned his observations into data-backed recommendations: he said seats should be “two human backsides deep” and sung the praises of movable chairs that let people chase sun or shade. His analysis helped save New York spaces such as Bryant Park and shaped our modern approach to people-centred design.\nWhyte’s experiments were revelatory, but hard to replicate. Why? Analysing the footage, frame by frame, took a team of assistants months. Now, finally, that challenge has been overcome, as we have invented non-human evaluators. Our team digitised Whyte’s original footage and compared it with recent videos – of Bryant Park, the steps of the Met Museum in New York, Boston’s Downtown Crossing, and Philadelphia’s Chestnut Street – collected by sociologist Keith Hampton. Then we trained an AI model to analyse the two sets of footage. AI allows self-driving cars to recognise bikes and pedestrians; that same technology excels at analysing footage of parks and plazas, and keeping track of hundreds of people at the same time. What took Whyte months now takes minutes.\nSo how have cities changed between 1970 and 2010? As we discuss in a recent paper in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, walking speeds have increased by 15%. People stand still less often. Dyads – pairs meeting and then walking together – have declined. Downtown Crossing in Boston, once lively and social, has become a pass-through. Even in Manhattan’s Bryant Park – improved, according to Whyte’s vision – the number of social interactions has fallen. Cities have not emptied, but a part of their essence has thinned.\nDifferent forces have caused these changes. Work rhythms are accelerating and as time becomes more precious, we are less willing to spend it meandering. Perhaps people prefer Starbucks to the park. The iPhone was barely three years old in 2010, yet already we may have been pulled into our personalised data streams, abandoning the wandering gaze of the flâneur.\nThat could be a disaster for our social fabric. Online, we drift into curated echo chambers, scrolling past discomfort and filtering out dissent. Public space, by contrast, remains gloriously unfiltered. It invites friction, messiness, surprise. A rival football fan holds the door for you. Your children play with children who speak different languages. If we spend less time in public space, we might lose tolerance for the wider public – and thus lose the habit of citizenship itself.\nParadoxically, the same technologies pulling us inward might help bring us back out. Social media is addictive because algorithms are constantly testing out what we like. If we use AI to analyse outdoor public spaces, we can do the next best thing: give every park, plaza and street corner its own, personal William Whyte to test improvements there. What types of chairs and benches best promote interaction? Could adding greenery or water features create a more comfortable microclimate? Which public games might help break the ice? Temporary design interventions could be introduced, evaluated with AI, and iterated through a process of trial and error – evolving organically, much like nature itself.\nTo this end, architects should not shy away from using new AI tools, as we argue at this year’s Biennale Architettura in Venice. But how?\nFirst, with humility. Public spaces of the past were far from perfect – often excluding women, minorities, and those with access needs. We should not romanticise them. Nor should we surrender to a technology-led present. Optimising public life through data alone risks repeating the mistakes of high modernism. AI can reveal patterns. It cannot dictate what is good.\nSecond, with curiosity. Public space is not static. It is alive. It responds to heat, light, geometry, programme. Small interventions – a bench in shade, a water fountain on a hot day, a winding path instead of a shortcut – can transform behaviour. In a recent study in Milan, we found that compliance with 30km/h speed limits had less to do with signage and more to do with street geometry. What slows us down is not instruction but design.\nClimate change, too, plays a growing role. As temperatures rise across southern Europe, many urban spaces remain shaped by outdated climatic expectations. Sicily can now grow mangoes, yet its squares offer little protection from heat. We might learn from cities such as Singapore, where the orchestration of vegetation, water, and shading are used to actively mitigate heat. If Europe’s climate is changing then its public spaces must follow.\nThe deeper challenge is this: for too long, designers have worked at a remove – imagining how people should behave from studios located far from the street. Today, we have tools to observe how people actually behave. To test hypotheses. To prototype joy and proximity. Yet these tools must be used not for optimisation but for stewardship.\nIf we can use them wisely, we can counter the hollowing of public space. The agora isn’t dead. It just needs redesigning. And if we’re smart about it, AI might just help us get there. It may help us hear something else too: the fragile, elusive symphony of the commons.\n-\nCarlo Ratti is professor at MIT and Politecnico di Milano, and director of Venice’s 2025 Biennale Architettura", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:00:41 GMT", "author": "Carlo Ratti", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

Some were allowed to resit the exam on 30 June, but many were informed they will have to wait until next year and had no right to appeal.\nIn a letter sent last month to Fifa’s general secretariat, the group of more than 40 candidates who were affected asked for a review “based on fundamental and obvious errors in the application of Fifa regulations” that they estimate could have had an effect on “thousands worldwide”.\n“Across borders and examination centres, candidates encountered severe technical and procedural irregularities that compromised the fairness, transparency and validity of the exam,” the letter says, listing several examples including “incorrect or misleading questions” and “multiple correct answers marked as wrong”.\n“The list of technical issues is extensive and in many cases nearly never‑ending.

{"title": "‘They’re not chic!’ How did BuzzBallz become the undisputed drink of the summer?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/19/buzzballz-not-chic-undisputed-drink-summer", "text": "When Merrilee Kick invented BuzzBallz in 2009, she was a 47-year-old teacher from Texas who needed to make some money fast. “I was about to get a divorce and was terrified of becoming homeless,” she says. “I was a high-school teacher not making enough money to survive, much less put two sons through college.” She had the opportunity to do an MBA through a teacher-enrichment programme, and came up with the idea for BuzzBallz one hot afternoon while marking homework. “I chose booze because it thrives in good times, and thrives even more in bad times,” she says.\nKick decided to make a cocktail that came in a plastic container rather than glass that could break, and was inspired by the shape of a snow globe she had brought back from Sweden. Finding the funds to manufacture her product proved challenging. She was turned down for business loans by every bank in Dallas, until one accepted the cows from her mum’s ranch and her old car as collateral.\nSince then, BuzzBallz has grown to become the US’s biggest-selling single-serve premixed cocktail, and the fastest-growing ready-to-drink brand in terms of sales volume in the UK. In 2022, the company was bought by Sazerac in an estimated $500m deal, which made Kick the 89th-richest self-made woman in the US. In January 2025, Kick and her family stepped back from running the company – now valued at more than $1bn.\nBuzzBallz arrived in the UK in 2022, and in the past year sales have boomed. In one day in London, I spoke to students, lawyers and a group of festivalgoers, all swigging the vividly coloured drinks. You may have seen the packaging – bright, round, gaudy – on shelves in corner shops and supermarkets, clutched at house parties or spilling out of the bins in your local park.\n“The buzz has been largely driven by organic discovery, primarily in independent retailers and via word of mouth on social media,” says Jake Wenz, the CEO of Sazerac. “It has been incredible to watch BuzzBallz become a cult favourite among consumers in the UK, specifically gen Z.” And it’s not just BuzzBallz that are booming in popularity with this age group. A survey showed that in March 2025, 76% of UK gen Z consumers had drunk alcohol in the last six months, up from 66% in 2023.\nStrawberry ‘Rita, Tequila ‘Rita and Chili Mango are Britain’s favourite flavours, according to Wenz. My nearest off-licence started selling them four months ago, and the shopkeeper tells me that young people can’t get enough of them. “It’s surreal,” says Kick. “What started as a wild idea has become a global party-starter.”\n“People my age are either buying a home and getting married,” says Freya McCann, 29, who works in sales in Edinburgh, “or they’re saying: ‘Let’s get some BuzzBallz and have a good time.’” McCann recently tried her first BuzzBallz, a Strawberry ‘Rita, at a friend’s party and now loves them. She thinks they’ve become popular in the UK because “you can get them at a corner shop, or before you get on the train”. They’re convenient, she says, “but they’re also quite silly”. For McCann, there’s something nostalgic about the drink, reminding her of school discos. “They used to sell these little drinks and you’d feel so hyper.” With about five teaspoons of sugar in each BuzzBallz, not far off the maximum daily recommendation for a woman, it’s no wonder.\nLike everything that was all the rage in the 90s and early 00s – from low-rise jeans to thin eyebrows – premixed drinks and alcopops are making a return. After a 10-year hiatus, Reef, the vodka, orange and passion fruit drink, was relaunched in 2024. Bacardi Breezer, also discontinued a decade ago, made a return this summer. In June, Smirnoff Ice launched a new advertising campaign across 20 countries. Nik Jhangiani, the interim chief executive of the drinks company Diageo, which makes Smirnoff Ice, told the Telegraph this month that it now has a “huge opportunity” to win over gen Z.\nIn the mid-90s, when alcopops first came on the market, critics said they were being deliberately marketed to teenagers who were below the legal drinking age. “The thing that really bothered people about alcopops was that they are so palatable,” says Andrew Misell, a director at Alcohol Change UK. “We know from looking at statements from some of the drink companies that they were aware that if you want to sell more alcohol, you need to appeal to people who don’t like traditionally bitter or sharp drinks,” such as wine or beer. In 1996, the government slapped a 40% tax on alcopops and some supermarkets pulled them from their shelves. TV adverts for WKD and Smirnoff Ice were banned for encouraging under-18s to drink. By 2013, the ready-to-drink sector, which at its peak in 2005 was worth £1bn, had shrunk by half.\nMisell doesn’t think there’s anything especially wrong with alcopops or premixed cocktails making a return: “They don’t have any sort of extra-dangerous ingredients in them; they don’t tend to be particularly strong alcoholically.” But, he says, they are “easy to drink a lot of and they may appeal to younger drinkers who have a sweet palate”.\nNick Lonergan, a 29-year-old Australian who moved to London two years ago and works in customer relations for a fashion brand, had his first taste of BuzzBallz at a house party four months ago. “I had a sip and then I ran down to the store and bought about five of them,” he says. He likes the fact that they are easy to fit in a bag, which makes them “the perfect drink for a party”.\nFlorence Langford, a 30-year-old Italian-Scottish marketing executive living in Manchester, thinks they’re perfect before a night out or at a festival. “They’re not chic,” she says. “But they are that drink of the summer.” The appeal for her is the packaging, which is fun, trashy and toxic-looking. “I probably just go for the most obnoxious colour over the taste, if I’m honest,” she says.\nThere are two types of consumers for these kinds of drinks, says Matthew Bulcroft, the marketing director of Global Brands, which owns Hooch and Reef: “The nostalgia-chasers – the over-30s who either remember it from their parents drinking it or actually consuming it themselves.” They make up about 65% of Hooch’s market. The rest are finding the drink for the first time: “Either because the 90s and 00s are cool again, or just because they want an easy drink that is nice and refreshing and won’t get them too drunk,” says Bulcroft.\nSince 2022, the consumption of alcohol-free drinks has risen, with Mintel revealing that 41% of UK adults have drunk low- or no-alcohol beer, wine, cider, spirits or cocktails in the past three months. The manufacturers of drinks such as Hooch and Reef have responded by creating drinks that are lower in alcohol: once about 6% ABV, they are now 3.4%. Misell says that while there is a cohort of under-25s who don’t drink at all, that “doesn’t mean that the rest of the under-25s are problem-free when it comes to alcohol”.\nThat could explain the popularity of BuzzBallz with gen Z. “They’re generally having one or two as a precursor to a night out, or it’s an indulgent treat for the train,” says Bulcroft. Gen Z and millennials rate the cost of living as their top concern, with 52% of both generations reporting that they live from one payday to the next. According to a 2025 survey by Deloitte, many young people will be looking for more cost-effective ways of socialising. Since the beginning of 2020, more than 2,000 pubs have closed in England and Wales, in part due to rising costs and declining consumer spending.\nBuzzBallz cost from £2.99 in Aldi, which started stocking them this May, to £4.99. At 13.5% ABV, they are certainly not low alcohol.\nFelicity Dunstan, who is finishing off a Choc Tease with her friends Carlo-Gino, 27, and Emil James, 23, in a London park, says she first saw BuzzBallz on TikTok, where there are more than 50,000 videos of people taste-testing them. In a viral video to her 991,000 followers, the influencer Heather Bowling drinks a Chili Mango before a night out in Manchester, a voiceover of Samantha Jones from Sex and the City in the background. There’s a #buzzballchallenge to see how people react to drinking them.\n“People litter them a lot, so you see them around,” says James. “It’s actually really good advertising. They’re everywhere.” Carlo-Gino chimes in: “But put them in the bin, guys.” BuzzBallz say they are packaged in 100% recyclable PET plastics.\nAre BuzzBallz actually any good? With the help of a few friends, I give them a go. We buy all six of the flavours stocked at my local shop. The Espresso Martini is watery and tastes like a strong black filter coffee, but it’s not bad. If I needed a pick-me-up on the way to a club, I’d probably give it another go.\nThe Choc Tease is creamy and has a subtle hint of vodka – it tastes a bit like Baileys. The Pornstar Martini, made with vodka and passion fruit juice, tastes weirdly synthetic, as does the Strawberry ‘Rita with tequila and vodka. The Chili Mango, also with a tequila and vodka base, is my favourite. It’s very sugary but has a little kick from the jalapeños.\nAll my friends were keen on the containers, until it came to finishing the last sip. The spherical shape means you have to tilt your head right back to drain it.\nLangford says she has noticed the alcopop revival – she’s seen Hooch around and is looking forward to trying WKD’s Irn-Bru flavour. She thinks BuzzBallz are fun but is just as happy to buy premixed Moth cocktails or a canned Cîroc Vodka Spritz. But the drinks are new and exciting for Lonergan, who didn’t grow up drinking alcopops in Sydney. “There’s no nostalgia attached. It’s like I’m living in the here and now.

In other words, how stuff gets done. Before today’s era of hybrid and flexible working, employees tended to absorb their workplace culture almost by osmosis. “You’d be living and breathing it five days a week,” says Nish Chowdhury of the marketing agency Oliver.\nAs the agency’s global director of people systems and operations, Chowdhury has had to grapple with the dramatic upheaval in working practices of recent years. While the shift started with the global work-from-home experiment that many companies underwent during the Covid pandemic, it has continued apace. “Covid really put a spanner in the works in terms of how we see company culture,” says Chowdhury.\nA workplace culture is now harder to absorb, especially for new hires. And it isn’t just about people’s physical presence: the pace of business and technological change has also accelerated. The constant upheaval makes it that much harder to instil a corporate culture. Employees might find themselves suffering from “change fatigue” or feel overwhelmed by technology and the numerous apps, platforms and information sources they now have to work with. For some businesses, the questions of culture and change management have grown increasingly intertwined. On top of this, the geopolitical environment is a lot less stable than it used to be, which has fed through into the economy.\nIn such a fluid business environment, company culture is more important than ever. It binds employees together, ensures shared values and goals, and keeps everyone engaged and motivated.\nSo how do you instil a workplace culture in today’s fast-changing world – and make it easier for a distributed workforce to acquire?\nIn broad terms, managers now need to make their workplace culture more obvious and intentional. For instance, they can try to articulate the culture more explicitly. This doesn’t necessarily have to entail formally codifying every aspect of your workplace culture – there are human ways to do it, such as demonstrating the culture and building processes around it, or publicly recognising employees and actions that best embody it.\nManagers can also try to express their workplace culture more frequently, and make it more ubiquitous. Technology can help here. Chowdhury highlights how her agency adopted a new HR system that can be configured to reinforce the company’s culture. “We have customised our [HR portal] homepage so employees are exposed to our culture wherever they’re logging on from,” she says. “It might be adding our values or mantras, having hosted videos or branded experiences.” The idea, she explains, is that no matter where you are, you feel connected to the company. “People are on their phones a lot and so you give them mobile access to the business.”\nThe system used by her agency is Sage People, an HR solution. Steve Watmore, HR and payroll product manager at software company Sage, says these features and personalised experiences can be particularly crucial when companies are onboarding new starters, as it isn’t always possible to physically get new hires in for face-to-face time. “The question becomes: ‘How do you create that culture of welcoming people in and starting the kind of conversations that bring teams together?’” he says.\nHowever, it’s not just about having the right technology: you also need to make it easy to use. One way of doing this is by providing staff with a one-stop shop – a single point of contact – instead of having numerous apps and platforms that result in a very fragmented experience. Lampros Sekliziotis, a product leader at Sage, says having a single self-service portal for employees is key. “Everything feels easy and smooth. You log on to your phone and you’re immersed in the company.”\nTechnology solutions such as Sage People can also help companies improve their workplace culture by breaking down barriers to connecting – for instance, making it easier to synchronise meetings and schedule in-office days. Sekliziotis says that for remote workers you can also emulate some of the feel of a physical workspace. “You have interactions that would normally happen in the office – so you make them happen in the flow of work.”\nAll this helps to make people feel more part of the business – and it helps the business run as a more cohesive whole. Moreover, the portals can be personalised and tailored to the needs of individual teams, geographies and so on.\nThere are many other benefits. In a world where fake news is rife and can damage company culture and morale, having a single reliable portal that staff can go to for facts is increasingly important. “You want staff to have a place they trust that they can go to if they need information,” says Chowdhury.\nHowever, workplace culture isn’t just something that comes from the top down. It’s always been a two-way process that is also shaped by employees. This has become increasingly true with social media and digital communication. Traditionally, employees had a chance to give their own views and feedback with annual satisfaction surveys. But once a year is far from ideal in today’s world. Tools such as employee pulse surveys – short, quick surveys that are sent to employees on a regular basis – are becoming increasingly important as they allow HR managers to spot changes and issues quickly and take action to maintain employee engagement and satisfaction. Sage People therefore incorporates pulse surveys and other similar features as a built-in function.\n“It’s about getting real-time feedback from the employees,” says Watmore. He notes that the employee induction process is an example of how useful this can be. “Maybe at the end of onboarding you can send a survey to the new hires to ask them how the process went. Did you find something that they didn’t like?” The next round of new hires can benefit from this feedback.\nGoing forward, more sophisticated data analytics and, increasingly, AI mean that companies will be able to use platforms to generate ever-more useful cultural insights from the information they hold. Thus, the future of company culture is a sophisticated, ongoing tech-enabled conversation that delivers a better workplace for everyone.\nDiscover more about how to instil a workplace culture to your business", "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 10:22:19 GMT", "author": "Rhymer Rigby", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

Polly Toynbee discusses some possible tax changes, including VAT (Both left and right agree taxes must rise. Time for Labour to get creative, 12 August). My view is that a 2.5 percentage point rise in the average VAT rate is the most viable option to raise sufficient revenue without reducing growth.\nToynbee also discusses possible changes to inheritance tax and the introduction of a wealth tax. These policies may be redistributive but are unlikely to raise substantial revenue. As an example, Norway currently imposes a wealth tax that raises less than 3% of its non-petroleum tax revenue.\nGiven the urgent need for revenue, a VAT raise is likely to be the UK’s best option. First, VAT raises significant revenue, at about 17% of total UK tax revenue. This means that a 2.5 percentage point increase may raise as much as £21bn yearly. This is roughly five times more than what it is expected the government will raise from the stricter taxation of non-domiciles.\nSecond, VAT poses limited harm to growth. Since it also applies to people who are outside the labour market, it dampens work incentives less than income taxes do. A VAT rise may partially replace the government’s failure to reform disability benefits. In addition, increases in VAT do not reduce incentives to save, as costs go up by the same ratio today and in the future.\nAnd third, VAT can be quite progressive. While new savings are unaffected, old savings that people spend in the future are subject to VAT increases. Most importantly, while the VAT rate is flat, using the revenue to support public services disproportionally benefits the poor. This means that raising sufficient revenue may be most important for progressivity.\nKristoffer Berg\nLecturer, Trinity College, University of Cambridge", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 16:30:15 GMT", "author": "Guardian Staff", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

Earlier this year, Delaware superior court judge Eric Davis ruled that Newsmax had defamed the voting technology company by broadcasting false claims about its equipment after the 2020 election. A jury would have considered whether Newsmax was liable for damages. Dominion had sued the outlet for $1.6bn.\nAfter the 2020 election, lies about the security of Dominion voting machines, which are widely used in the US, became central to Donald Trump’s false claim that the election was stolen from him. Allies and other rightwing personalities made baseless claims that votes had been flipped and that the equipment was not secure.\n“We are pleased to have settled this matter,” Dominion said in a statement to CNN.\nIn a lengthy statement of its own, Newsmax was defiant, saying it chose to settle not because it was admitting wrongdoing, but because it believed Davis would not give the company a fair trial.\n“Newsmax believed it was critically important for the American people to hear both sides of the election disputes that arose in 2020,” the company said. “We stand by our coverage as fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards of journalism.”\nNewsmax will be paying the settlement in three instalments until January 2027.\nDominion obtained a $787.5m defamation settlement from Fox in 2023 on the eve of a defamation trial in Delaware.

On sale: peanuts, cigarettes, chewing gum, chocolates and chips.\nWhen asked how much she made in a day, Palacios’s disabled son Gustavo, who helps run the tiny store, simply laughed. “If we make 100 pesos ($5) it’s a lot,” he said. Happily, said Palacios, the family has a different lifeline.\nWith their house crumbling and bills piling up, the only thing keeping them afloat is a bimonthly transfer of 6,200 pesos ($330) implemented by the government of previous president Andrés Manuel López Obrador for adults over 65.\n“God bless López Obrador,” said Palacios. “Without him what would we do? I think we wouldn’t even have enough to eat.”\nPalacios is one of millions of people across Mexico who have benefited from the welfare policies of López Obrador, or Amlo as he’s commonly known. And now, thanks to a report released last week by the country’s national statistics agency, we know just how effective those policies were.\nWhen Amlo took office in 2018, there were nearly 52 million people living below the poverty line: by the time he left office six years later, that number had dropped by 13.4 million, a decrease of almost 26%. Extreme poverty also dropped from nearly 9 million people to just 7 million.\nIn a country that has long suffered from deep inequality and struggled with economic precarity, the steep drop in the number of people living in poverty is a remarkable achievement and suggests Amlo’s policies had a measurable impact on the lives of millions of everyday Mexicans.\n“It’s something extraordinary, historic, the reduction [of poverty],” said Amlo’s successor and ally Claudia Sheinbaum during a news conference on Thursday. “‘For the good of all – first the poor’ is not just a slogan, but a reality in Mexico.”\nSome independent Mexican analysts have been equally enthusiastic about the poverty reductions achieved under Amlo.\n“There has never been a single six-year term in which poverty has been reduced or decreased so significantly,” said Viri Ríos, a public policy expert and director of Mexico Decoded. “This is a watershed moment for the Mexican economy.”\nAmlo was elected in a 2018 landslide with a promise to eradicate corruption and tackle inequality. Among the legacies of his administration were the tripling of the minimum wage from 88.40 pesos ($4.75) per day when he took office to the current rate of 278.80 pesos ($15) a day.\nThis had a knock-on effect on other sectors of the economy, according to Valeria Moy, a Mexican economist and director general of IMCO, a public policy thinktank.\n“When the minimum wage increases, other wages and incomes in the economy begin to rise – even in the informal economy – because there is a greater availability of resources,” she said. “I don’t know if the [poverty reduction] was purely because of López Obrador’s policies, but I do think the push in the minimum wage moved the rest.”\nRíos was more emphatic.\n“We’re talking about a labor market that had a minimum wage well below the standard of living,” she said. “And now it’s reached a level that allows 13.4 million families to escape poverty. It’s a historic achievement.”\nAmlo also transformed the social welfare system, implementing a system of cash transfers for elderly people, like Palacios, for young people doing apprenticeships and for farmers planting fruit trees, among others. He then doubled the amount spent on these transfers.\nThe universal cash transfer system, which replaced a well-regarded conditional system for the poorest fifth of households requiring children to go to school and families to attend health check-ups, has received some criticism as it meant that, in the case of the pension system for example, anyone, even well-off Mexicans over 65, were entitled to a transfer.\n“We lost focus and lost the ability to give to the poorest,” said Gonzalo Hernández Licona, the former head of the National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy (CONEVAL), a now defunct agency which used to measure poverty before the task was transferred to the statistics institute. “While the amount has grown, the way the amount is distributed has worsened.”\nThis might help explain why the 19% reduction in extreme poverty was much lower than the nearly 26% reduction in overall poverty. Many of the poorest Mexicans live in remote rural places, where accessing social welfare is hard if not impossible.\n“The big problem [with the cash transfers] is not that they’re universal,” said Ríos. “The big problem is that the Mexican government has not made an effort to make it truly universal – that is, to make it reach everyone.”\nMeanwhile, the report from the statistics agency also revealed other glaring issues under Amlo’s government: while access to food security, social security and dignified living conditions all increased, the number of people without access to health services more than doubled, from 20.1 million people in 2018 to more than 44 million in 2024.\n“I think the great debt that the Mexican state still owes its people is improving access to healthcare,” said Ríos. “As a percentage of GDP, our spending on health is similar to countries in sub-Saharan Africa.”\nPalacios, who has considerable medical expenses but no access to medical insurance said she felt “horrible”.\n“Medicines are so expensive,” she said. “And I don’t have anything.”\nSheinbaum admitted there was still more work to do.\n“Do we still have progress to make? Yes,” she said. “With 30% of Mexico’s population living in poverty, we obviously have to keep moving forward.”", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:00:32 GMT", "author": "Oscar Lopez in Mexico City", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

We’re going to stay strong. We’re going to stay committed to making sure those workers can do the job they love doing and actually be able to afford a roof over their heads, to afford caring for their families,” said Mark Hancock. “And if means folks like me going to jail, then so be it.”\nHancock said members want a solution, “but that solution has to be found at a bargaining table”.\nFlight attendants with Air Canada went on strike on Saturday after months of failed negotiations with Canada’s flagship carrier over wages. Ahead of the work stoppage, Air Canada warned that a shutdown could affect 130,000 people a day.\nLess than 12 hours after the strike took effect, however, the country’s jobs minister, Patty Hajdu, used her broad powers to impose binding arbitration on both parties – a move the union representing flight attendants decried as unconstitutional.\n“The talks broke down,” Hajdu told reporters over the weekend. “It is clear that the parties are not any closer to resolving some of the key issues that remain and they will need help with the arbitrator.”\nAir Canada initially said it planned to resume flights on Sunday, but the union said it would defy the government’s back-to-work order and accused the governing Liberal party of trampling on workers’ rights and setting a “terrible” precedent.\n“The Liberals have talked out of both sides of their mouths. They said the best place for this is at the bargaining table. They refused to correct this historic injustice through legislation,” Wesley Lesosky, a senior member of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said in a statement.\n“Now, when we’re at the bargaining table with an obstinate employer, the Liberals are violating our Charter rights to take job action and give Air Canada exactly what they want – hours and hours of unpaid labour from underpaid flight attendants, while the company pulls in sky-high profits and extraordinary executive compensation.”\nFollowing an emergency hearing on Sunday requested by Air Canada, the industrial relations board sided with the federal government and airline.\n“The members of the union’s bargaining unit are directed to resume the performance of their duties immediately and to refrain from engaging in unlawful strike activities,” according to a directive from the board.\nThe union said it intends to challenge government-imposed binding arbitration in a federal court.\nIf they defy the order from the labour board, union heads can be arrested and union members face the prospect of steep fines.\nThe prime minister, Mark Carney, said it was “disappointing” the stalled negotiations had not yielded a new contract.\n“We recognize very much the critical role that flight attendants play in keeping Canadians and their families safe as they travel, comfortable as they travel,” Carney told reporters on Monday. “And it’s important that they’re compensated equitably at all times, fairly at all times.”\nOn Monday morning, Air Canada said it hoped to resume flights later in the day, but also suspended its financial guidance for the third quarter and its full year due to the shutdown. The strike is expected to cost the airline tens of millions of dollars in lost earnings each day.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 17:58:06 GMT", "author": "Leyland Cecco in Toronto", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}
{"title": "Like looking in a mirror: how HR data and AI can help companies improve their corporate social responsibility", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/empowering-your-employees/2025/jul/07/how-hr-data-and-ai-support-corporate-social-responsibility", "text": "Businesses have had to get to grips with a range of new criteria in recent years that reflect more socially conscious goals, impacts and metrics. These are often lumped together under the acronym ESG, which refers to environmental, social and governance factors.\nThey might incorporate these criteria for regulatory purposes or simply to better manage their business risks – whether it’s physical risks from the impact of climate breakdown, financial risks, or risks to their reputation.\nWhen it comes to ESG, the environmental and governance factors have typically been more measurable. You can count your carbon emissions and you can measure how much waste you produce. Similarly, you can set up governance frameworks and follow best practice. But the S part of the acronym has always been trickier to quantify.\nThis is partly because of a lack of objective and comparable data. Likewise, social factors have often been regarded as subjective and malleable – contingent upon changing social attitudes and individuals’ personal lived experiences. They also vary from company to company and across geographies – taking in everything from diversity and pay disparities to relationships with stakeholder groups, corporate stances on contentious issues and volunteering. Organisations often don’t know where to start, even if they want to do the right thing.\nBut despite being difficult to get a grasp of, social responsibility can’t be ignored. Companies now need to comply with regulatory disclosure requirements, such as the EU’s corporate sustainability reporting directive and European sustainability reporting standards. Moreover, they might also have to meet the requirements of their own business partners in their supply chains, who may stipulate social disclosure and reporting. They also need to think about how they are viewed by potential new hires. Younger people, in particular, increasingly want to work for businesses that align with their own values. Social responsibility is therefore part of being an employer of choice.\nWhile it can be confusing terrain to navigate, data can provide clarity. As the adage goes: what gets measured, gets managed.\nGiven that so many social criteria relate to the welfare of a company’s employees, having a robust and dynamic HR platform can help. These platforms provide companies with a wealth of objective data, from deeper insights into the diversity of their workforce to pay gaps at different management levels and social responsibility initiatives.\nSteve Watmore, HR and payroll product manager at software company Sage, says high-quality HR data can be a bit like looking in the mirror for a business. It can really help you understand what your culture means, what you stand for as a business, where you’re going, and what you need to do to get there. “This really helps when you are trying to attract and retain the best people,” he notes.\nThis can make it easier for businesses to do everything from meeting disclosure requirements to demonstrating community engagement.\nOf course, all this data still needs to be sifted in order to generate useful insights. Kaustubh Sevak, a principal solutions consultant at Sage, says businesses have often struggled with this. “Traditionally, companies will take all of this data, and it’ll take a team of analysts a week to actually come up with some insights or nuggets on what that data actually is.” Now, he says, companies can take advantage of what Sage calls a “workforce intelligence offering”.\n“This is where AI and machine learning-led statistical analysis is really powerful, because it’s bringing those insights to HR at the click of a button. HR practitioners can look at whatever data points are important to them in the jurisdiction that they want to restrict it to, and in a couple of clicks they get real-time insights.”\nThis is particularly important when it comes to dealing with different disclosure requirements across different countries or geographical territories. It also enables multinational businesses to integrate data from different territories with different HR policies.\nThere are many other ways that a high-quality HR platform can make it easier for businesses to comply with disclosure requirements.\nThey can provide transparency about company policies, and also the methodology companies use to measure its performance against ESG criteria – which is particularly important given that some ESG reporting regulations require information about how the data was calculated.\nMoreover, a good HR platform can provide all this required data in one place that’s easy to access and collate.\nLampros Sekliziotis, a product leader at Sage, notes how the company’s all-in-one HR and payroll platform, Sage People, can combine HR data insights with responses to employee surveys. “You can use Sage People to gather data on the social side of things and share it with whoever needs it,” he says. “You might, for example, ask staff if enough is being done to support wellbeing or volunteering, or you could look at the backgrounds of new hires – and this could be reported or shared with regulatory bodies.”\nData can also be used to help companies improve their own performance and reach their internal social objectives. One Sage People customer has incorporated social mobility data into KPIs (key performance indicators). The idea here is that you can cascade a top-level goal down the organisation and use data to see how employees are contributing to achieving it and what more needs to be done.\nSekliziotis emphasises that this is very much a two-way flow of information. “You could also communicate the sort of social responsibility programmes you are undertaking and ask staff if they’re interested in participating, or report on community collaboration.”\nAnother benefit of the platform is that this communication can be targeted. For instance, it can often make sense, if volunteering news is sent to those closest to the communities it takes place in. “[Employees] can even book volunteering days on the system so that the company knows you’re not booking a day’s holiday and that you’re working in your local foodbank,” says Sekliziotis.\nAn organisation can learn from this data and use it to make improvements. For example, it can look at programmes it has instituted and see what the takeup is. Watmore says that this can be useful when it comes to making comparisons across different parts of a business or across different regions and territories.\n“Comparative data is useful, but you sometimes need to use it to recognise that all data should be comparative,” he notes. “You can use software to slice and dice it into different regions – and the richer the data is, the more powerful this becomes.”\nDiscover more about how HR data can help companies improve their corporate social responsibility", "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 10:19:42 GMT", "author": "Rhymer Rigby", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

Water companies and the government prayed desperately for rain as reservoirs ran low and the groundwater was slowly drained off.\nContingency plans were drafted to ban businesses from using water; hotel swimming pools would have been drained, ponds allowed to dry up, offices to go uncleaned. If the lack of rainfall had continued for another year, it was possible that taps could have run dry.\nThat, however, was just a taster of what could come down the line. On Tuesday, the government announced a “nationally significant” water shortage in England, which means the whole country is at risk of running out if the dry weather continues. People across England are already banned from using hosepipes, with more restrictions probable over coming months. The UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH), an independent research institute, has warned of exceptionally low river flows. Reservoirs are also at extremely low levels and groundwater is dwindling.\nDroughts are generally two-year events. A year of dry weather means water supplies are running out – that is what is happening now. Things really come to a head if the following year does not bring above average rainfall. That is when the shortages start to bite, with farmers unable to irrigate and households and businesses hit with sweeping restrictions. With reservoirs at record lows and stream flows exceptionally low, England is desperate for rain.\nForecasts indicate that by 2055 England’s public water supply could be short by 5bn litres a day without urgent action to future-proof resources, the equivalent to more than a third of the supplies available today. The effect on the economy will be profoundly negative. The thinktank Public First has estimated that the economic cost of water scarcity could be £8.5bn over this parliament.\nSo how on earth did famously rainswept England, notorious the world over for being green and wet with our national symbol pretty much a furled umbrella, come to this?\nBritain’s geology and climate means there should be plenty of water. Underground in the south of England the rock is made of chalk, which is very soft and porous. These layers of rock filter rainwater into some of the cleanest water in the world, collecting in huge aquifers that have been tapped by local residents for centuries. Water companies now use those aquifers to provide the majority of the drinking water in some parts of the south.\nFurther north, the rock underfoot is harder; sandstone and limestone, so lacking the benefits of the chalk aquifer. But it tends to receive more rainfall than the south, so there has generally been plentiful water from the skies to fill the reservoirs on which the northern water companies rely. There are also the rivers that crisscross the country, which (when clean) include gin-clear chalk streams buzzing with mayflies and thronging with salmon and other fish.\nThe UK is one of the rainier places in Europe. Some areas are wetter than others. In England, the Lake District generally receives an average of 2,000mm of rainfall a year, while in parts of the south-east it is as low as 700mm.\nPerhaps it is because the country has always had such rich resources, that they have been taken for granted. Running out of water has never really been in question. But with population growth and climate breakdown, this is starting to look like folly.\nIt was in the 17th century that the New River Company began piping water into London’s homes from the springs in nearby Hertfordshire for the very rich. Slowly the technology began to spread and grow in popularity. Over the next decades, England’s population would rise dramatically and the water systems of its rapidly growing cities would come under increasing stress.\nWhen the Great Stink hit London in 1858 during a heatwave, the civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette had already been commissioned to draw up plans to urgently update the city’s sewage system. Known for his tirelessness, Bazalgette checked every connection himself, making thousands upon thousands of notes, and saved many lives as the system diverted sewage away from the city and into the Thames estuary. Later, treatment centres were added to purify the water.\nToday, consumers are used to having water coming out of a tap and they want to use a lot of it. Future generations, who will be dealing with long, dry summers, would probably be shocked at the profligate way clean tap water was used to flush toilets, water gardens and run washing machines. UK households use more water, mostly on showering and bathing, than other comparable European countries, at about 150 litres a day per capita. For France the average is 128, Germany 122 and Spain 120 (although in Italy its 243 litres a day).\nAnd the waste starts long before it gets to people’s taps. Water companies in England and Wales lose about 1tn litres of water through leaky pipes each year. The industry has said that about 20% of all treated water is lost to leaks. The water firms have pledged to halve leakages by 2050.\nMeanwhile, the annual pipe replacement rate is 0.05% a year across all water companies: much of the sewage system in London, for example, has not been significantly updated since Bazalgette and his colleagues installed it in the 19th century.\nNo new reservoir has been built in 30 years despite significant population growth and climate breakdown meaning longer, drier summers during which the country desperately needs to store water. The reservoirs England does have are at their lowest levels in at least a decade, just 67.7% full on average. According to Dr Wilson Chan, a hydroclimatologist at UKCEH, “above average rainfall over several months is needed to ease pressures on water resources”.\nWas it the privatisation of the water and sewerage industry in 1989 that has led to this situation? England’s water system has been widely criticised, and privatisation has been blamed for a lack of investment in infrastructure. Some say this is owing to the water companies paying out dividends rather than using the money raised by customer bills solely for investment in infrastructure; others blame a privatised regulated monopoly system that has prioritised low customer bills over investment.\nExperts have also pointed to the regulatory system. Water company drought plans compel firms to follow a series of steps before they can increase abstraction, taking more water from reservoirs, rivers and the ground to supply customers, beginning with reducing consumption (a hosepipe ban).\n“Water companies must now take action to follow their drought plans – I will hold them to account if they delay,” says the water minister, Emma Hardy. “We face a growing water shortage in the next decade.”\nBut water companies believe that people hate being told to reduce their water consumption, so avoid hosepipe bans as much as possible. It does not help that bans may also lead to customers giving low satisfaction marks for their company, which are then taken into account by the regulator.\nThe end result of these incentives; unsustainably high levels of abstraction from the natural environment, most of which will not be replaced by rain on the same timescale. Stores of water such as fossil aquifers and chalk streams recharge over centuries. The Environment Agency (EA) assess that 15% of surface water bodies and 27% of groundwater bodies in England have unsustainable levels of abstraction.\n“We are calling on everyone to play their part and help reduce the pressure on our water environment,” says Helen Wakeham, the EA’s director of water and chair of the National Drought Group. “Water companies must continue to quickly fix leaks and lead the way in saving water.”\nThis is not just a management problem. As climate breakdown accelerates, rainfall patterns are changing fast, and water will increasingly become less available at certain times of year. As Sir David King, a former UK chief scientific adviser who chairs the Climate Crisis Advisory Group, says: “Drought in England is no longer a warning. It is a clear signal that climate collapse is unravelling our water, food and natural systems right now.\n“This crisis demands a fundamental shift that places real value on our planet and environment, invests in nature, restores water cycles and transforms how we use every drop. If we rise to this moment we can turn crisis into opportunity, delivering economic resilience, ecological renewal and climate leadership.”\nThe UK is not the only country that is already struggling to deal with changing weather patterns. Almost half of Europe is in drought, with wildfires tearing across the continent and farmers struggling to grow crops.\nMany of the economies of Southern Europe are dependent on sunny weather that has historically made the region the perfect place to grow vegetables for export. Scientists are concerned that farming in certain southern European countries will become less and less viable. More than 90 million people in eastern and southern Africa are facing extreme hunger after record-breaking drought across many areas has led to widespread crop failures and the death of livestock.\nAs the impacts of the climate crisis unfurl around the world, is the UK government awake to the scale of the problem? Nine new reservoirs are in the pipeline to be built before 2050, while there are consultations on reducing demand for water. But this may be too little, too late; many housing developments are on pause because of water scarcity.\nThe first new reservoir planned for Abingdon in Oxfordshire is sited in the same place as the government’s new datacentre zone, leading to fears the water will be used to cool servers rather than serve customers in one of the most water-stressed areas of the UK.\nGreen homes experts have said government building codes for new housing should include rainwater harvesting for internal use such as in lavatories and washing machines. People with gardens could use a water butt in summer, so that clean tap water is not being pumped through a hose into garden plants.\nReducing time in the shower by a minute can save water, says Waterwise, while green building groups recommend the use of water-saving shower heads. A recent government commissioned report recommends smart water meters are installed nationally, so households who use sprinklers and fill swimming pools are charged more than those who are more frugal with their use.\nMore broadly, farmers could build reservoirs on their land to reduce the need for irrigation. Nature-based solutions could be used too, such as releasing beavers that create dams and hold water in the system, or restoring wetlands.\n“We need to build more resilience into our rivers and their catchment areas with nature-based solutions at scale, such as healthy soils that allow water to filter into the ground and not rush off taking the soil with it; riverside tree planting to provide shade and further slow the flow of water; wetlands to store and slowly release water, and rewiggling streams to raise the water table and purify pollutants,” says Mark Lloyd, the chief executive of the Rivers Trust.\n“We also need to finally implement the use of rainwater rather than drinking water where we can, such as car washing, gardening, washing pets, filling paddling pools and flushing the loo. Other water-stressed countries have used this approach for decades and we need to join that party.”", "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 05:00:22 GMT", "author": "Helena Horton Environment reporter", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

The world’s oldest hatters, who designed fitments for Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation crown and boast fans including Winston Churchill. A luxury sports brand with a “spy-ready” ski-suit.\nHas James Bond assembled a crack team that can successfully take on his latest adversary?\nLawyers representing Danjaq, the US company that controls the rights to worldwide James Bond merchandising in conjunction with the UK company Eon Productions, have filed evidence running to 227 pages as it battles to retain control of the superspy’s name across Europe.\nIn February, the Guardian revealed that a Dubai-based property developer had filed claims in the UK and EU arguing that lack of use meant various protections had lapsed around James Bond’s intellectual property, including his name, his 007 assignation and the catchphrase “Bond, James Bond”.\nNearly all nine of the trademarks being challenged relate to the merchandising of goods and services under the Bond name, which can be challenged after five years of “non-use”.\nJosef Kleindienst, an Austrian who is building a $5bn (£3.7bn) luxury resort complex called the Heart of Europe on six artificial islands off Dubai, has argued that the trademarks have been commercially underexploited.\nBoehmert & Boehmert, one of the largest intellectual property (IP) law firms in Europe, representing Danjaq, has hit back, filing evidence to the European trademark office from a who’s who of high-end partners still using the Bond name.\nThe filing starts with the 140-year-old Jermyn Street tailor, Turnbull & Asser, which describes itself as the “definitive British shirtmaker” and created shirts for Sean Connery in the first Bond film, 1962’s Dr No, continuing to do so since for Bond actors including Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig.\nThe firm is the personal shirtmaker to the king, who bestowed the company with his first royal warrant when, as the Prince of Wales, he was given the power to do so in 1980.\nTurnbull & Asser created the shirt Charles wore on his coronation day in 2023, and a year later he renewed its royal warrant.\nThe evidence file also features Lock & Co, the world’s oldest hatters with roots dating to 1676, whose heritage includes being responsible for fitting out first world war soldiers in their now familiar “Mark 1” tin helmets before being deployed overseas.\nThe company, based in London’s St James’s Street, started its Bond relationship with one of its hats appearing in the now famous opening credit gun barrel scene in 1960’s Dr No.\nLock & Co was also behind henchman Odd Job’s famous lethal Coker, or bowler hat, in 1964’s Goldfinger.\nBond fans can pay £537 for the James felt trilby, Dr No edition while women might take to the £662 Vesper, originally created for Eva Green to wear as Vesper Lynd in 2006’s Casino Royale.\n“In cases such as this the brand owner should respond by providing a robust package of evidence, assuming they are able to do so,” said Mark Caddle, partner and trademark lawyer at the European IP firm Withers & Rogers. “Commercial use is often shown by sales figures and a selection of invoices to support them, as well as by evidence of marketing and communications activity, such as brochures, online advertising, physical advertising and social media posts.”\nCommercial information has also been provided for the luxury sports lifestyle brand Bogner.\nWilly Bogner Jr, who took over running the company founded by his father in 1932, has been credited for creating the world’s first action skiing scenes for 1969’s On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.\nHe went on to create alpine scenes for Bond productions including The Spy Who Loved Me, For Your Eyes Only and A View to a Kill.\nLast year, the company launched its “spy-ready” ski range – the Bogner X 007 collection – with products priced from $290 to $2,300 (about £205 to £1,700).\nThere is also product and commercial information from luxury cashmere and accessories brand N.Peal, founded in 1936 with a flagship store in London’s Burlington arcade, which stocks a modern take on Bond, including a pair of £245 No Time to Die combat trousers.\nBoehmert & Boehmert has called the trademark action an “unprecedented assault” on the multibillion-pound global franchise.\n“We will file evidence of use for each trademark,” said Rudolf Böckenholt, at Boehmert & Boehmert, in a defence filing. “Considering the number of goods/services at issue for each trademark, this will be a submission considerable in length and size, including numerous attachments and exhibits.”\nKleindienst has extended his attempt to try to take control of the spy’s various brands by also submitting his own trademark for James Bond in Europe. He has not, however, done the same in the UK.\nThe developer has said that he has launched the trademark action because he is concerned about the commercial future of the spy franchise, arguing that Bond “will not die” on his watch.\nDaniel Craig’s last outing as 007, in No Time to Die, was released in 2021. With no announcement yet of his replacement or timeline for production of the next film, the franchise is on track to beat the previous longest gap between instalments of six years and four months.\nDanjaq also co-owns the copyright to the existing Bond films, along with MGM Studios, which was acquired by Amazon for $8.5bn in 2021. Days after the report of Kleindienst’s legal challenges, it emerged that Amazon had paid more than $1bn to gain full “creative control” of the franchise from Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, the longtime stewards of the Bond films.\nWith creative control, Amazon now has the power to move forward with new films and potentially TV spin-offs, without approval from the two British-American heirs to the film producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli, who had overseen the integrity of the character originally created in 1953 by the author Ian Fleming.\nDenis Villeneuve, the man behind the Dune franchise, is directing the next Bond film. And Steven Knight, who is the co-creator of the gameshow Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and penned Peaky Blinders, has reportedly been brought on board to write the next 007 outing.\nIn March, Amazon confirmed that Amy Pascal and David Heyman would produce the film, although no release date or lead actor has yet been named. Pascal has experience with the Bond series in her previous position as Sony’s chair of film, overseeing Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. She also had producer credits on the latest Spider-Man series.\nHeyman is best known as the producer of the Harry Potter films as well as the Fantastic Beasts franchise and is now in pre-production on the HBO TV series adaptation of the stories. He is the second most commercially successful film producer of all time, with credits including Gravity, Paddington, Barbie, Wonka and Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood.\n“We have the utmost respect for the legacy of James Bond,” said Kleindienst in response to the latest developments in the trademark case. “Yet we must acknowledge a simple truth: there are clear trademark and copyright laws, which exist to prevent prolonged inactivity and ensure that cultural properties continue to serve the audiences that value them. Our goal is straightforward – to respect the legacy while ensuring that Bond remains relevant and accessible to all fans.”", "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 12:00:29 GMT", "author": "Mark Sweney", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

You can see the hills of north Somerset, Bath and Wales, and almost peer into Bristol City FC’s Ashton Gate stadium.\nThe platform the Guardian reached was about 100 metres (330ft) above the river close to the tower on the west side of the bridge that bears the motto suspensa vix via fit – a suspended bridge built with difficulty.\nIsambard Kingdom Brunel’s stucture may have been built with difficulty but it has stood the test of time and still has 99% of its original ironwork. “It’s not like Trigger’s broom,” said Johnson, alluding to the road sweeper’s brush – which had 17 new heads and 14 new handles – in the sitcom Only Fools and Horses.\nThe bridge was opened in 1864 – but the links are even older as they were recycled from the engineer’s original Hungerford footbridge in London when it was demolished.\nThe refurbishment work on the grade I Clifton Suspension Bridge began in April last year and should be finished by next spring. It is being carried out by the engineering contractor Taziker, which has previously worked on Abraham Darby’s Iron Bridge in Shropshire and Brunel’s Royal Albert Bridge, which links Devon and Cornwall. Taziker is also refurbishing Brunel’s intricate ironwork on the roof of Bristol Temple Meads station.\nThe flake-grey paint has to be applied painstakingly by hand because it is difficult to get the right thickness in the nooks and crannies with a spray. Specially made brushes designed for the Clifton chains have been created.\nAs the River Avon is tidal, the salty air means the ironwork can corrode easily if it is not well maintained. Three coats of even coverage are required. Another reason for not spraying is that drips and flecks must not find their way into the gorge, a site of special scientific interest.\nAbout 8,000 litres (1,760 gallons) of paint will be used and it will take 100,000 person-hours to complete the job. The project is costing £8m and is funded through the tolls collected by the Clifton Suspension Bridge Trust charity, which maintains the bridge.\nNatalie Craig, the learning officer at the bridge, said workers of eras gone by would be amazed at the effort, especially the health and safety measures in place now.\n“Way back then, they would balance on the chains to go up,” she said. “One of the things they would be asked when they went for a job is if they could walk up the chains. They wouldn’t be able to comprehend all the measures we have today but they’d be proud of how it is being looked after. Everyone loves the bridge.”", "published": "Sat, 16 Aug 2025 06:00:53 GMT", "author": "Steven Morris", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}
{"title": "Want more productivity, Rachel Reeves? It’s time to embrace Mancunian swagger | Richard Partington", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/17/productivity-rachel-reeves-london-manchester", "text": "Over the summer Rachel Reeves has been on a road trip around Britain. From Cornwall and Kent, to Aberdeen, south Wales and Belfast, in search of the solutions for a national economy that is stuck in a rut.\nInspired by this tour, the chancellor used a Guardian article last week to set her autumn budget priority: boosting productivity. Tax and spending may dominate news headlines, but this is the real problem facing the country, and no politician of the past two decades has managed to fix it.\nProductivity is a dull word of vital importance. Growing the measure of output for each hour of work is an economic secret sauce, enabling growth in wages and living standards over the long run without stoking inflation.\nOn the hunt for solutions, Reeves could have extended her trip. Leaving Westminster on a (most probably delayed) Avanti train from Euston, or an overcrowded TransPennine Express from her Leeds constituency; for the wetter side of northern England, where Manchester is having a moment in the sun.\nUnlike the rest of Britain, there are signs of life in Greater Manchester’s productivity. Between 2004 and 2023, the city region recorded the highest rise in gross value added for each hour worked of any combined authority in the country.\nLondon – once the driver of UK growth – has effectively stalled. The capital is still streets ahead in terms of productivity and the UK is still one of the most regionally unequal countries in Europe, with no regions outside London and the south-east of England above the national average. But Manchester is beginning to close the gap – with growth of 31% since 2004.\nTo anyone familiar with the north-west, this will probably come as no surprise. Manchester has changed beyond all recognition in recent years, never mind the past two decades. The Haçienda has been a posh block of flats for longer than it was at the epicentre of the “Madchester” music scene. The class of ‘92 swapped Old Trafford for building luxury hotels long ago, petrodollar cash has flooded the east of the city, and Oasis have just added, by some counts, £1bn to the British economy at large.\n“Manchester has got this buzz about it,” says Jim O’Neill,a former Goldman Sachs chief economist, and a proud Mancunian, who is life president of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership.\n“It’s always been there for years in the [city] centre. But most importantly it’s now spreading. Some would say it’s that Manchester swagger. It all relates to an attitude that ‘we can do this; we want to see it happen’. I don’t know another part of the country where it has that vibe.”\nFor years Britain’s productivity growth has been a dismal disappointment. Before the 2008 financial crisis growth averaged 2% a year, but has trickled to well below 1% since. Figures last week showed growth contracted in the year to June.\nWith the autumn budget not far off, this is fuelling a sense of alarm in the Treasury. Whitehall is abuzz with speculation that the Office for Budget Responsibility is poised to hand Reeves downgraded productivity forecasts – with the potential to blow a £20bn hole in her tax and spending plans.\nTo turn things around, Reeves could take the ingredients behind Manchester’s renaissance and apply them elsewhere. She could also double down on the “Northern Powerhouse” strategy for good measure.\nSources close to Labour say that is exactly the plan: Keir Starmer and Reeves are expected to launch an intensified regional growth strategy next month, with the revival of the Northern Powerhouse Rail project as its centrepiece.\nThose who know Manchester best say there are a few golden threads to the renaissance of Cottonopolis: devolution; political stability and coordination between its policymakers, businesses and institutions; the involvement of its top universities; and sustained investment.\nAndy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, says London hasn’t entirely cottoned on. The city symbolised by the worker bee has done well, but could have done even more with extra money and power from the Treasury.\n“The learning for Whitehall is, if you want productivity growth, and growth more broadly, you have to let go and trust places. And you have to invest. Because you can’t get it without investment.\n“[But] there is a bias against cities outside London and the south, and as long as this remains, the country will not achieve its full potential.”\n“I compare Manchester [today] with the city I came back to after uni, and the one I had to leave to get on in life. It’s been a major shift. The momentum is there now, and it’s what you do with that next.”\nIn truth the Manchester revival has deep roots. The timeline before Burnham’s arrival as mayor in 2017 is well known: the 1996 IRA bomb as catalyst for city centre regeneration; the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the opening of Salford Media City, the Lowry, Bridgewater Hall and the expansion of the Metrolink.\nLed by the city council’s former chief executive Howard Bernstein, and ex-leader Richard Leese, their “Manchester family” approach to coordinating investment proves Reeves’s theory that public money can “crowd in” the private sector: Manchester has ranked top outside London for foreign direct investment projects for three of the past five years.\nHowever, the transformation isn’t all plain sailing. House prices and rents are rocketing, crowding out families from Manchester’s poorer suburbs. For those who, like me, grew up around these parts, the skyscraper-sprouting skyline is a source of both pride, but also nagging worry. Could the pace of change sweep away something special, in a city used to doing things differently? And are the proceeds of growth lining Mancunian pockets, or flowing out of the Irwell to an offshore bank account?\nBurnham is alive to the danger. “I use the phrase that, the kids can see the skyscrapers from their bedroom window but they currently don’t see a path to the modern Greater Manchester economy. The next phase is about making that path.”\nStill, the addition of glass-fronted flats and office blocks among the converted Victorian mills has helped Manchester to create more jobs at a faster pace than the UK average. They reflect Labour’s hopes for Britain more broadly: that a fairer distribution of growth, in theory, will become easier if there is some growth in the first place.\nReeves could do with a few more Mancunian economic miracles. The national economy will not come unstuck without Britain’s biggest regional cities reaching their full productive potential.\nIn her first conference speech as chancellor last year, along the M62 in Liverpool, Reeves promised a Labour government would mean “shovels in the ground. Cranes in the sky. The sounds and the sights of the future arriving.”\nTo the next critic who asks ‘well, when exactly do you mean?’, a Manchester reference may help.", "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 10:06:09 GMT", "author": "Richard Partington", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

Coffee shops in the heart of New York are bracing for impact.\nWhen the Trump administration announced another wave of sweeping tariffs, particularly on Brazil, Stone Street Cafe’s managing partner was first confused. Then came fear. A cafe already runs on slim margins and extra costs passed on from tariffs could risk everything.\n“If these tariffs are long term, it will put our business in jeopardy,” Antony Garrigues, managing partner of Stone Street Cafe, said. “In New York City, the operating costs are already so high, and these tariffs will make everything much more expensive.\n“In the end, if people cannot afford our coffee, and we do not have a profit margin, we will not make it.”\nStone Street Cafe, based in Manhattan, sources green coffee beans from more than 35 different countries, including Brazil. But Brazil is not the only coffee-producing nation facing tariff pressures: Vietnam, Colombia, Ethiopia and Indonesia are also affected.\n“These tariffs are not paid by the country. The costs are passed down to the business owner, and consumer,” noted Garrigues. “For now, we are going to try and absorb as much [of] the cost as we can. But at the end of the day, this is a business – so we may have to increase the prices.”\nWith the growing effects of climate change already inflating coffee prices, other cafes have already done so.\nAside from coffee Ciao Gloria, in Brooklyn, also imports cocoa powder from Brazil. Jams sourced from Italy now face Trump’s 15% tariff on exports from the European Union. The cafe raised prices by about 25 cents per cup, but plans to absorb any additional tariffs costs, at least for now.\n“I’m selling sugar and caffeine – I’m basically a drug dealer,” joked owner Renato Poliafito. “So I want to make sure the menu is affordable.”\nBut then he turned serious. “We have to be vigilant about analyzing the situation before jumping to price increases.”\nCustomers are already scrutinizing their receipts. US coffee prices rose 14.5% in the year to July, according to official data.\n“It’s this idea of shifting baseline where we normalize something being expensive when it shouldn’t [be], and it’s very scary to see,” said Helina Seyoum, 29, who has reverted to making coffee at home. “Now a morning coffee becomes a burden, because you’re obsessing over the costs.”\nA daily cafe trip was how Aley Longo, 28, made sure she escaped the confines of her studio apartment and spoke to people outside work in an “affordable” way. Now it’s strictly a weekend activity.\nTrump’s tariffs are “bad for Americans, and our quality of life”, Longo said, “and we are suffering, whether it’s as tiny as just being able to buy coffee out, or something so much bigger”.\nThose behind the counter know what it’s like to watch the price of a regular purchase grow. Allon Azulai, who owns Kos Kaffe in Brooklyn, which imports beans from countries including Colombia, Honduras and Kenya, described nervously asking vendors for their latest prices each week, as tariffs and mounting demand looms large.\n“Right now the industry is so unstable and what worries me if tariffs continue is cafes that do not have big pockets will not be able to survive,” said Azulai.\n‘Straight to the American consumer’\nAs US cafes come under pressure, the coffee producers they source from are also preparing for disruption.\nBrazil is the world’s largest coffee producer and exporter. The US is the leading destination of its coffee: about a third of its coffee imports are Brazilian.\nThe Brazilian Soluble Coffee Industry Association, which represents producers, said the 50% US tariff on the country’s exports amounted to a “clear competitive disadvantage” as other leading countries for coffee production face lower rates, ranging from 10% to 27%.\n“This decision not only harms the Brazilian industry but could also negatively affect American consumers, who benefit from the quality and competitive price of our coffee,” the association said.\nBrazilian producers and exporters still hope they can lobby for coffee to be exempt from US tariffs, arguing the US produces very little coffee domestically. The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, had previously suggested products not cultivated on American soil could be granted zero tariffs, they note.\nIf that fails Brazil’s Coffee Exporters Council says it will at least seek to reduce the tariff on coffee to 10%, in line with other Brazilian goods, including oil, orange juice and aircraft. “We remain optimistic and hopeful,” the council said.\nNew coffee export deals with the US are on hold and shipments ready to go are stuck in storage, adding costs for exporters. China has meanwhile approved 183 new Brazilian firms to export coffee, although the exporters’ council cautioned that sales may take time to materialize.\nIn Vietnam and Colombia – the world’s second and third largest coffee-producing nations, respectively – exporters hope that lower US tariffs on their coffee will help them steal a march on Brazil.\n“The US can’t grow coffee at scale, so tariffs won’t bring production back home,” Timen Swijtink, founder of Lacàph Coffees in Vietnam, said. “With the tiny margins in our industry, any tariff cost goes straight to the American consumer.”\nEven with 20% US tariffs on Vietnam, the country’s farmers “are resilient and will find new markets”, added Swijtink, “with global demand strong and China’s demand growing like a rocket ship”.\nWith the US tariff on Colombia only at the baseline 10%, small coffee growers across the country are shrugging off any immediate impacts. “The average coffee farmer won’t feel it, at least for now,” said José David Posada, a fourth-generation coffee farmer and owner of Capilla del Rosario, a finca in Medellín. “It’s the exporters who will be impacted.”\nThere is also a sense among some that, given Brazil’s tariffs are at 50%, Trump’s tariff war could even help Colombian business. The country’s coffee cultivation is vital to the national economy, representing 8% of total Colombian exports.\nPosada said: “The fact that Brazil has a higher tariff, obviously that’s going to have a positive impact on us, right?”\nGuilherme Morya, a coffee analyst at Rabobank, said the 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee may, at least in the short term, shift American buyers toward other sources. “Colombia gains a price advantage, and being the second-largest supplier, it becomes the most obvious candidate to fill this gap,” he said.\nBut Alejandro Lloreda, a farmer at family-run Cafetal de la Trinidad, which produces specialty coffee, cautioned the difference would only give Colombia “a temporary advantage”. “A coffee tree can take two to three years to produce, and the tariff situation could well change before then,” he said.\nBack in New York, cafe owners find themselves in an equally uncertain position.\n“The tariffs are to small businesses’ detriment,” said Poliafito, of Ciao Gloria. “Big businesses can find a way around it. But we will suffer the costs.”\n“It’s scary to not know if we can continue our business,” added Nick Kim, manager of Koré Coffee in Manhattan. “It’s really a shame, and sad, that you know bad things are coming, but you cannot do anything to change it. We have no option but to see what will come.”", "published": "Sat, 16 Aug 2025 09:00:58 GMT", "author": "Jenna Zaza in New York, Tiago Rogero in Rio de Janeiro, Harriet Barber in Medellín, Michael Tatarski in Ho Chi Minh City", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

How managing people is changing in the workplace", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/empowering-your-employees/2025/jul/07/why-managing-people-is-shifting-from-time-to-energy", "text": "Let’s face it, there’s never any shortage of management fads and business buzzwords. But they can feel particularly overwhelming these days given that the world of work has been experiencing its biggest shakeup in a generation.\nThe shift to more hybrid, flexible and asynchronous working has given us a deluge of different management styles, new axioms and conflicting advice about emerging best practice. The sheer level of noise and increasing complexity can be daunting – deterring businesses from confronting crucial shifts and implementing necessary changes.\nIt can help to try and look at a bigger picture. For example, one useful way to think about all these myriad workplace shifts is to consider the question of employee energy levels. This is a useful big lens that effectively captures issues around hybrid working, productivity, wellness and employee engagement.\nTraditionally, bosses have focused on managing people’s time and what they do with it. You see this in how project requirements are described – days spent on tasks, schedules, deadlines, measurable goals and milestones. This approach is not necessarily bad, but it can have some shortcomings. For example, many people work in bursts, rather than at a steady pace – certain staff (and roles) contribute in ways that are not easily measured and, of course, some people work faster than others. These issues are exacerbated in the new flexible, hybrid and asynchronous world of work – making the concept of managing people’s time feel even more old-fashioned. It is increasingly clear that time put in no longer correlates with output. We need a new way of ensuring staff stay productive. Hence the idea of managing energy levels.\nSo how can managers start thinking in terms of managing their employees’ energy rather than their time?\nUntil recently, energy levels have been difficult to measure and it’s hard to manage what you can’t quantify. But new technology and tools are changing this. “It’s about understanding when people are productive and what makes them productive, especially in environments such as hybrid workplaces where you don’t have a line manager physically present,” says Lampros Sekliziotis, a product leader at software company Sage.\nSage People, an all-in-one HR and payroll solution, can offer powerful people insights and HR analytics to help managers spot where they can intervene most effectively to keep employees energised and productive. Companies can use insights and analytics to see if people have problems, which indicate flagging energy – for example, are they not taking holidays, are they constantly working long hours or have their absence rates increased? These are often signs of stress or burnout. Moreover, tools such as Sage People can demonstrate where initiatives to tackle these issues work and where they don’t. Data analytics and AI are improving all the time and the more information HR platforms have, the better they get.\nSteve Watmore, HR and payroll product manager at Sage, says another example of this energy-based approach might involve using tools and technology to look more closely at meetings. You can delve into how employees find meetings and what they get out of them: “How do staff feel about them? Both past meetings and meetings that are coming up. How is the time used?”\nYou might, he suggests, use these insights to change hour-long meetings to 45 minutes of focus and 15 minutes of recap. The recap could be made more efficient using tech – for example, AI and transcription tools that pull out and summarise the key points and create an agenda for future meetings. This also frees up the person who once did minutes from a lot of drudge work and allows them to take a more dynamic and energetic role.\nKate Travers, principal solutions consultant at Sage, says much of it is about understanding that employees are not all alike. Different employees, at different life stages, working in different locations are going to have different needs. “Employers can use tools that boost energy and spark engagement and focus,” she explains.\nFor example, when it comes to invigorating staff through personal development and training, micro-learning tools can give employees more control over their pace of learning new skills and knowledge – allowing them to tailor things so that they feel energised rather than overwhelmed. One such tool is Uptime, a learning and personal development app that offers five-minute learning hacks and is offered to Sage customers.\nMicro-learning in bite-sized chunks can be more rewarding as well as empowering. “If I do a day’s training, I feel I’ve got to put it into practice immediately because it’s a valuable investment of a large amount of time,” adds Watmore. But if you do a half hour of training online, it’s very different. Not only is it easy to fit in when you have an hour before lunch, but you don’t feel the obligation to use it immediately. Nonetheless, it makes you feel positive – as if you’re making progress and adding value to your CV.\nOther tools and platforms can help by integrating employee wellbeing directly into workflows – such as Sage’s human capital management software (HCM). Again, this helps galvanise people’s energy and can be tailored to the individual. “A combination of HCM and Uptime, for example, can offer a really powerful way to do this,” says Travers.\nUltimately, measuring and maintaining energy levels is a technologically-enabled and holistic approach to doing business the right way in a world where you may no longer bump into your boss in the corridor. Good companies, says Watmore, take the time to find out “what makes people tick and feel engaged”.\nDiscover more about how managing people is changing in the workplace", "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 10:20:59 GMT", "author": "Rhymer Rigby", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

The new data has fuelled calls for rent regulation to end a growing affordability crisis for renters.\nLondon was the least affordable region with rents of £1,957 per month, meaning tenants had to pay on average 41.6% of their income on housing.\nThe top 10 least affordable council areas were all in London, topped by Kensington and Chelsea where those on median incomes had to pay 74.3% of their gross earnings on rent. The next worst were: Westminster (55.8%), Wandsworth (54%), Camden (51.7%), Hammersmith and Fulham (51.3%), Haringey (48.3%), Lambeth (47.1%), Merton (46.8%), Islington (45.5%) and Richmond (45.3%).\nAll 32 council areas in London have been above the 30% affordability threshold for eight of the nine financial years ending 2016 to 2024, the ONS bulletin said.\nOutside London, the least affordable areas based on the percentage of salary paid on rent were: Bristol (44.6%), Bath and North East Somerset (42.7%), Brighton (42.7%) and Trafford (41.3%), as well as Sevenoaks (42%) and Watford (41%), which have a high number of London commuters.\nThe figures showed that rents last year rose faster than incomes in England. Faster rising wages meant the ratios of rent to income briefly dipped in 2022-23, but since then the ratio has worsened and rents look set to continue to outstrip rises in incomes.\nIn some regions of England and in Wales and Northern Ireland, rents were found to be still affordable, according to the ONS metric. The most affordable region in England was the north-east, with average rents of £641 per month, or 19.8% of income.\nIn Wales, all but two of the 24 council areas had average rents that were below the 30% affordability threshold. Only in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan was it above this level.\nIn Northern Ireland, rents were relatively flat with the ratio ticking up to 25.3% from 25.1% from the previous year.\nTom Darling, the director at the Renters’ Reform Coalition, said: “These figures show that the biggest issue facing renters – the cost of their rent – isn’t going away any time soon.\n“Though the government’s renters’ rights bill will introduce crucial improvements to security and standards, it won’t put a lid on the affordability crisis. While millions are forced to spend less on essentials like groceries to afford their rent, the government will have a hard time making the case at the next election that they’ve delivered for renters.”\nDarling added: “The government should establish a national rental affordability commission to look at ways to bring rents down relative to incomes – including investigating different types of rent regulation.”\nSarah Coles, the head of personal finance for Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Renters faced a horrible squeeze on their incomes, and there’s every sign it has got worse since. Landlords are continuing to sell up – concerned about higher costs from more regulation and more tax.\n“It means more tenants chasing dwindling numbers of properties, so rents are continuing to rise. At the same time, although wages have risen impressively, they have been consistently outpaced by private rental increases.”\nJoseph Elliott, the lead analyst at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “High rents are locking people out of secure homes and driving poverty and homelessness.\n“The government needs to tackle the root causes of the housing crisis – unaffordable rents, frozen housing support, and a chronic shortage of social housing.”", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:47:32 GMT", "author": "Matthew Weaver", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

Always creating new plots with twists and surprises, they have been gaslighting cowering customers for years. Here are three acts that should keep you on the edge of your seat.\nAct I\nThe scene is Oxford where 90-year-old AB is battling phantoms. Ovo, his supplier, can’t decide whether it has received his monthly electricity payment. After a spate of demands for the £99.62 in question, it concedes, apologetically, that it received his cheque the previous month. Two months later it tells him he owes the £99.62 it has already cashed and adds a £15 late payment fee.\nWhen AB’s next payment is due he makes it over the phone. It comes to £129.19 and he asks for a receipt. Instead, he receives a letter accusing him of defaulting and demanding £129.19 plus a second £15 late payment fee.\nAB remonstrates; OVO says it will commence legal action. The card payment is never collected.\nEnter the consumer champion. Dealing with Ovo is like wrestling ectoplasm. Its first response blames AB for paying £99.62 by cheque. It claims it was invalid, despite having cashed it. And it says the “cheque” for £129.19 was also invalid, when, in fact, he made that payment by card. Oddly, since it insists AB was at fault, it says it will “write off” the £238 it says has, by now, accrued on the account.\nWhen I query these discrepancies, it claims it never received the £99.62, despite having twice confirmed receipt in writing, and that the £129.19 was only partly settled by cheque, despite a card payment AB says he made.\nBack I go again. This time Ovo has a new line. It admits that the second payment was paid by card, but that it left an outstanding balance on the account. And it says it is not writing off the balance despite having told me, in writing, that it is. Instead, it is making a “generous goodwill gesture” for the “inconvenience” caused, although the common theme of its various explanations is that the “inconvenience” was entirely caused by him. By this time, the account is finally sorted, legal action is called off and I think it is all over. But no.\nA month later AB pays his latest £140 bill by cheque. This prompts three weeks of demands for £140. OVO tells me delays beyond its control prevented it cashing it, and offers to waive the inevitable £15 late payment fee as a “goodwill gesture”. I need a lie down.\nAct II\nShepperton, Surrey. A routine boiler service reveals that 81-year-old widower DG has been paying for a stranger’s gas since switching to E.ON Next four months previously. A meter mix up is blamed. No one knows who is footing the bill for DG’s consumption, but whoever it is, they are getting a good deal because he only spends three days a week in the home. E.ON is in no hurry to act.\nIt informs him it could take up to 20 months to get answers because of a long list of similarly transposed meters. It tells me vaguely that his predicament could be caused by “any number of factors” and states, three months after he reported the problem, it is in the “preliminary stages” of its investigation, which it will complete in a “timely manner”. This, the more optimistic customer service agents told DG, could be within just 18 months or even as few as 14.\nIn the meantime, it asks him to provide regular meter readings to ensure bills are fair. The logic of that eludes me since DG’s meter is measuring someone else’s supply. Progress is made – backwards.\nMy interference prompts a technician appointment, only no one shows up. DG has to wait five weeks for another slot. No one turns up. One day a technician arrives unsolicited. His intervention leaves DG with no heating or hot water. E.ON says it can’t help because it hadn’t arranged the visit. The problem is eventually resolved a speedy six months after he reported it.\nAct III\nNow we’re in Worcester. WL’s father, Walter Turner (assumed name) has sadly died. She wants to claim an eye-popping £1,896 credit accumulated on his British Gas account. She has been trying for nine months.\nBritish Gas acts promptly at first. It sends a cheque addressed to “Mr Estate of Walter Turner”. Unsurprisingly, it can’t be cashed.\nFour times WL asks that it be issued in her name, as executor. Four times British Gas promises to do so, and fails.\nThe happy ending is that the corporate behemoths do empathise with private grief when they’re caught in the media spotlight. The cheque, plus a £75 apology, arrives a week after I enter stage left.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 06:00:53 GMT", "author": "Anna Tims", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

But do not fall for it.\nThis week, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned that drivers were being targeted by scammers posing as lenders. The FCA is in charge of working out who lenders will need to compensate and how, and says it will be October before it has announced how the scheme is likely to work – next year before payouts can be made.\nIn the meantime, lenders will not be contacting customers to arrange a payment, so you can safely assume that anything promising money is a scam.\nWhat it looks like\nIt could be a call from a mobile number or a text – on the website Whocalledme one number used had also been linked to other frauds.\nSome have reported being called by someone claiming to be working for a car finance company. Other reports say drivers have received a text with their car model and registration in it, and a message telling them they needed to follow a link and complete a registration.\nIn one message shared online it looks like the driver was told they might be entitled to a payment of up to £16,000.\nWhat to do\nThe FCA says if you receive a call like this you should hang up immediately. Do not share any information with the caller.\nIn the UK you can report scam calls and texts to Ofcom by forwarding them to 7726.\nIf you do think you may be owed money, sit tight.

{"title": "Work-life balance: why quality data and personal development tools are crucial for employee wellbeing", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/empowering-your-employees/2025/jul/07/employee-wellbeing-tools-that-make-a-difference", "text": "Employers have long recognised that promoting wellness and helping employees achieve a good work-life balance are key to business success. Staff who have a healthy work-life balance tend to be happier, more engaged and more productive. They take less time off sick and they stick around longer because they enjoy their jobs. Moreover, companies that are known for this tend to become employers of choice and attract the best staff, creating a virtuous circle.\nBut while many businesses strive to promote employee wellbeing, the area is in a state of flux and uncertainty, leaving many employers and HR professionals unsure about how best to approach it. Problems can be difficult to pin down, and the effectiveness of interventions can be hard to measure.\nFor one thing, recent upheavals to typical working practices have prompted a host of fresh challenges and workplace stresses – from managing hybrid teams to knock-on effects on staff engagement and a sense of belonging. Likewise, there are still many lingering bad habits from the pandemic-related lockdowns, when work and life seemed to merge. One example is an always-on culture. When people worked from home, they would often reply to emails at 10pm because there were no boundaries between work and life. But this isn’t desirable, either for the business or its employees.\nThe accelerating pace of new technologies can present further challenges. For instance, wellness programmes devised three years ago may not factor in the impacts of AI.\nSo what are some of the best ways to ensure a mentally and physically healthy workplace, one where staff want to be and deliver good work because they’re happy?\nLampros Sekliziotis, a product leader at software company Sage, says data plays a key role. “If you spot a problem based on insights from the data, you can target it.” This might be through training or it might be flagging wellness initiatives. Both these can be targeted to individuals.\nEmployee pulse surveys – short, quick surveys that are sent to employees on a regular basis – have long been particularly useful for gathering insights, says Sekliziotis. “You could ask: ‘Are you aware of the various wellness initiatives that we have?’” Alternatively, he says, data around holidays, timekeeping, and job satisfaction might suggest “the company isn’t as good as we think in terms of life balance”. Again, interventions can be targeted, and their effectiveness can be measured. Pulse surveys are one of the features built into Sage People, an all-in-one HR and payroll solution.\nAnother key part of wellness is a feeling of personal fulfilment and life progression. HR systems have therefore been extending their capabilities and offerings to help businesses nurture a more fulfilled, happy and productive workforce. For example, micro-learning platforms can give employees all the joy of gaining new skills and knowledge in their own time and at their own pace without them feeling overwhelmed.\nOne such offering is Uptime, a learning and personal development app that Sage offers to its customers. Kate Travers, principal solutions consultant at Sage, explains how Uptime can help: “This has been designed to help users absorb key insights from books and podcasts, documentaries and courses, but all filtered down into just five-minute chunks.” It taps into the way people use streaming platforms to pick and choose the content they consume. “It’s designed to provide user engagement through learning, combining smart technology with a people-first approach.”\nAnother way Sage’s platform can be used to improve wellness and ensure a good work-life balance is by providing a single point-of-entry for employees. This is important because properly promoting wellness and wellbeing can be an extremely wide-ranging and holistic undertaking. After all, wellness takes in areas ranging from time management and job satisfaction to engagement and office design.\nFor example, what kinds of new training needs should HR identify to help people upskill and reskill? How can office spaces be better planned to best suit employees who haven’t been in the office for years, or who are reluctant to return? What provisions should be made for staff to improve their commutes? Do employees feel like they’re doing meaningful work? Do they feel empowered and in control of their work and careers? And how can you keep them better engaged and informed?\nThis is why good businesses now realise that work-life balance and wellness need to be baked into the company ethos and mission rather than just an afterthought. And it also means that wellness tools should be easily accessible and seamlessly integrated into the wider workplace experience. Steve Watmore, HR and payroll product manager at Sage, says familiarity with an app can be a huge help here. “If you use a platform or an app regularly, you’re always in that space, and anything else that happens within that app is engagement,” he says.\nThe more that people use these apps, the better they know them and the better they become at leveraging their resources. Staff soon start to view these tools as places they can go to not just for information but for personal growth and development, and that can be very empowering. “It becomes a real focal point for employees,” says Watmore. “We see that within the Sage People app and we’ve seen that with the Sage People platform.”\nGiving people the right tools is a huge part of fostering engagement. Staff feel happy when they’re in control and making their own decisions. This perhaps shows us where the thinking about wellness is going next. In the past, you might have provided some wellness initiatives, but now you have more of a smorgasbord of wellness-related initiatives, ranging from distraction-free zones to cycle parking and illness policies to mental health support. You offer them to employees, but staff make the choices themselves, and are all the happier and empowered for it.\nDiscover more about the importance of a work-life balance and employee wellbeing", "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 10:20:22 GMT", "author": "Rhymer Rigby", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

A visual guide", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2025/aug/16/could-wealth-tax-work-in-the-uk-visual-guide", "text": "A rise in taxation at the autumn budget looks inevitable, as Rachel Reeves grapples with £40bn hole in the public finances.\nThat figure comes from a recent report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), which blames the deficit on higher-than-expected borrowing levels and a weaker growth outlook for the UK economy.\nThe question now facing the chancellor is: who should pay more?\nA growing chorus of voices across the Labour party say a wealth tax is the answer.\nSo how would a wealth tax work?\nPoliticians from across the divide have the habit of talking about wealth taxes in vague terms, often perpetuating misconceptions.\nHere’s a visual breakdown of the key elements of a wealth tax system. The analysis uses figures from the most in-depth study of a potential UK wealth tax so far, produced in 2020 by the Wealth Tax Commission, a panel of leading economists assembled by tax experts Arun Advani, Emma Chamberlain and Andy Summers.\nSummers, director of CenTax and co-author of the 2020 study, said: “Given the limited information HMRC currently hold on wealth, a wealth tax would be difficult to deliver any time soon. A better way to raise money from wealth would be to reform Capital Gains Tax (CGT). This is not just about raising rates. The Government should introduce an investment allowance and close gaps that currently allow some business gains to go completely untaxed. Doing this would be good for investment and growth, and raise over £13bn annually by the end of the Parliament.”\nThe Institute of Fiscal Studies has similarly argued that an annual wealth tax would be a “poor substitute for properly taxing the sources and uses of wealth”. Treasury officials are understood to favour the latter.\nCritics say a wealth tax would be too difficult and costly to implement, and that wealthy individuals would be able to move their holdings or to simply leave the country. They point to countries such as Austria, Denmark and Germany’s decision to scrap similar taxes in the past.\nHowever, other countries including Spain and Switzerland have been successfully using wealth taxes to raise significant sums for generations. In their letter to the government the economists in favour of a wealth tax argue that the UK can overcome these difficulties – by leveraging digital technology and studying previous attempts to tax wealth – and pioneer a progressive tax system “fit for the 21st century”.\nSources and methodology\nTax revenue figures for income tax freeze, national insurance rise and pension contribution relief are taken from NIESR. The figures for capital gains equalisation are taken from the Centre for the Analysis of Taxation.\nWealth distribution by asset class data is taken from the ONS Survey of Personal Incomes 2022-2023. UK Wealth inequality data and figures on UK total wealth ownership are from 2023 and are provided by the Wealth Inequality Lab.\nWealth tax model and figures are from the Wealth Tax Commission (WTC) report and their 2020 tax simulator (the WTC study input figures are from 2018). The Guardian uprated the WTC figures by a nominal GDP increase of 39.13% between 2018 and 2025. 2018 GDP figures are from the ONS, while 2025 GDP figures are from the OBR.

The former Waitrose boss turned big company adviser Mark Price certainly thinks so.\nSolving widespread worker unhappiness would be good for the UK’s army of workers and getting people back into the workforce, as well as being the answer to many of Britain’s economic woes, he says.\nSince leaving a decades-long career in retail, followed by a stint in government as trade minister, Lord Price – known during his days running the supermarket chain as the “Chubby Grocer” – has embarked on a mission to make organisations recognise the value of a happy workforce, while empowering employees to gain more satisfaction from their toil.\n“If people are happy in their jobs they don’t leave, you retain knowledge, you have lower levels of sick absence, all of which leads to more profitable and more effective organisations. And it’s good for individuals,” says Price.\nHe has the data to back this up, thanks to the 1.5 million workers globally, half of whom are in the UK, who have completed the How Happy Are You at Work? survey run by Price’s organisation WorkL.\nBritons are, on average, the unhappiest workers in the G20 group of nations, a fact he believes has a direct link with the economy’s productivity problem, where the UK also has the unhappy position as bottom of the G20.\nOne of the aims of the Labour government is to get more people back to work – which has been a pervasive problem in Britain since the pandemic, far more than in its European neighbours – and which ministers believe is the best way of cutting the benefits bill.\nReeling off a list, Price says: “All our research shows that if you are happy in your job, you work harder, you’re more productive, you’ll give extra discretionary effort, you’re more likely to be paid more highly than your unhappy colleagues, you’re more likely to be promoted, your mental health will be better and your wellbeing in general will be better.”\nWorkL – the L doesn’t stand for anything, Price says, although some presume the name stands for “work-life” – is paid to advise large employers including the retailer Next, the restaurant chains Burger King and Wagamama, as well as many of the UK’s universities, who tend to score poorly for employee satisfaction.\nThe organisation was also called in to advise the Scottish brewer and bar chain BrewDog during the tenure of the previous chief executive, James Watt, following accusations by former workers that Watt presided over a “culture of fear”.\nPrice’s focus on happiness will resonate at a time of continual tussles between employers and their staff in the post-pandemic world of work.\nMany workers have come to expect a certain degree of flexibility in where and when they fulfil their duties. There have, however, been warnings that such flexibility is not offered to nurses, transport and retail workers among others, dividing Britain into a two-tier workforce.\nPrice is calling for a contract between all kinds of employees and their employers, a “work happiness charter” which he outlines in his latest book, Work Happier, to be published next month.\nHe believes that recent decades have brought great strides in workplace safety and in legal rights for employees, without telling them “how work should feel”.\nThe burden has traditionally been placed on employers to improve treatment of their teams, or to offer them training to allow them to advance.\nPrice believes that people have a “right to be happy at work”, along with other rights including fair pay, to be equipped with the tools to carry out the job, but also to be “well informed”, “treated with respect” and “given the opportunity to show your ability”.\nIn return, he says employees have responsibilities and should commit to give their best effort, to be punctual and positive, take responsibility and keep the best interests of their organisation in mind.\nSuch a mutual undertaking would allow workers to figure out whether they can improve their current position, advance through training, or whether they should consider moving roles within an organisation or even look for a new job elsewhere, even in a different sector.\nJust under a third of respondents to WorkL’s survey are “very unhappy”, Price says, which can harm workers’ mental health and damage relationships with their friends and family, who have to listen to their complaints.\nThe research has also found that sectors such as technology tend to have happier workers, while defence scores bottom; the retail and hospitality sectors also tend to have staff who are less content.\nPrice traces his interest in workplace happiness back to his 34 years at the John Lewis Partnership, the owner of John Lewis department stores and the Waitrose supermarket chain, where he rose from graduate trainee to deputy chair.\nJohn Spedan Lewis established the co-owned business in 1929, when he decided to transfer all the shares in the family business he had inherited into a trust.\nPrice says he was told on his very first day that, rather than commercial considerations, the partnership’s “supreme purpose … was the happiness of its workers”.\nMore than a decade after leaving, he still does not have a bad word to say about a business he describes as “magical” and “very forward-looking”, although he concedes it “may have made a few mis-steps” in recent years.\nIndeed, the retailer has had a tricky few years since the pandemic, and it has not paid a bonus to its staff for three of the past four years. Meanwhile, hourly pay rates at Waitrose are below most of its main supermarket rivals, as well as the discounters Aldi and Lidl.\nPay, according to WorkL’s data, is not the main motivator for most employees, with workers reporting they “want to feel that they’re being paid fairly for the job that they’re doing”. This holds true for jobs across all sectors, even lower-paid or lower-skilled roles.\n“People want to feel valued,” Price says. “It’s not a pay issue. It’s about how you are being treated in the workplace, the value that you feel you are getting from that, and how your employer is developing you.”\nSince the pandemic, surveys have shown that work-life balance now ranks more highly than pay for many employees.\nDespite the string of return-to-office mandates from large employers in recent months, Price says WorkL’s data shows that hybrid working does not have a positive or negative effect on productivity, but being able to work in a hybrid way makes most employees happier. “All our data clearly points to the fact that the people who are happiest have that blend of some time in the office, doing office things and connecting, and some time at home.”\nPrice, a Conservative peer, believes that the Labour government’s employment rights bill, expected to become law in the autumn, “misses the really big point, it should be about how people feel at work”. This, he says, would also help it with its goals of cutting the welfare bill and encouraging people back into the workforce.\n“Work is a noble thing. You’re helping yourself, you’re helping your family, you’re helping society … Working is good and I think we have lost sight of that,” he says.", "published": "Sat, 16 Aug 2025 12:00:00 GMT", "author": "Joanna Partridge", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}
{"title": "Farmers in US midwest squeezed by Trump tariffs and climate crisis", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/16/farmers-trump-tariffs-climate-change", "text": "Seventh-generation farmer Brian Harbage grows corn, soybeans and grass, and runs a cattle operation across five counties in western Ohio. In the world of agriculture, his work makes up a large business.\nAnd still, the past two years have been immensely challenging amid the twin threats of the climate crisis and the Trump administration.\nLast year, regions of the eastern corn belt saw just 20% of crops harvested due to a drought that brought little precipitation between June and October. It was part of a climatic cycle that involved drought, heat and wildfires that cost crop producers $11bn nationally.\n“Last year, we got a good crop started, and then it just quit raining. Our yields were definitely reduced by at least 25-30%,” says Harbage.\nThis year, it’s been almost the complete opposite.\nExcess rainfall has fueled severe disease and pest pressure on the several thousand acres of soybeans and corn he planted in the spring.\n“There were three-day windows, it seemed like. It would just start to get dried out and it would rain,” he says.\n“We finished up [planting] at the beginning of June. We like to be finished by 15 May. Anything that’s planted later means that it was probably planted in marginal conditions since we were rushing to get it in, and secondly, it doesn’t have near enough time to mature before harvest.”\nWith the 2025 harvest of corn and soybeans approaching – America’s biggest two crops and the linchpins of agriculture – crop growers are facing down the gauntlet. Climatic swings, rocketing operating costs and low international demand, caused, in large part, by government policy in the shape of tariffs, has created the perfect storm.\n“Farming is not for the worrisome,” says Harbage. “We always kid that we are crisis managers.”\nSuicide rates among farmers are 3.5 times the national level.\nIn 2023-24, China bought 24.9m metric tons of soybeans worth $13.2bn, largely used to feed its 427-million-strong pig herd. At under 6m metric tons, US farmers’ second biggest international soybean market, Mexico, lags far behind.\nSince 2017, when tariffs were first introduced by President Trump, crop farmers have been struggling with the decline of China as the leading market for soybeans and an important market for corn exports.\nLast month, reports emerged that exports of soybeans – America’s largest grain export by value – had hit a 20-year low.\n“Tariffs are probably something that will help in the long run, for the whole country; in the short run it’s terrible for farmers,” says Harbage.\n“We’re really taking it on the chin now because if we can’t export, our prices are low. And if we can’t export and we have a terrible crop then it’s a one-two punch. I see what the government wants to do, but it’s hurting me in the near term.”\nFarmers and rural Americans are keen to highlight that their political and voting preferences are rarely fueled by a single issue or event such as tariffs. Many continue to back Trump, despite the obvious financial challenges the president’s policies are fomenting.\nTrump has been largely silent on addressing the pain his tariffs have caused farmers and ranchers, despite rural voters being a cornerstone of his political base. On 10 August, he posted to Truth Social a demand that China quadruple its purchases of American soybeans. The president claimed that China was “worried” about having a soybean shortage, although China has vowed to increase its domestic soybean production yield by 38% by 2034.\nWhat’s more, some market analysts say that Trump’s post didn’t make the rounds on Chinese social media, suggesting his demand may not have been heard by the country’s political leaders.\nWith the soybean harvest in the midwest set to start about a month from now, and corn following weeks later, the fear that China may not buy a single shipload of grain this season is growing for many.\n“With [tariffs] in place, we are not competitive with soybeans from Brazil. Our marketing year starts 1 October and usually by now we’d see China making commitments to pre-purchases for soybeans. China has not made a single purchase for US soybeans,” says Virginia Houston, director of government affairs at the American Soybean Association, a lobbying organization.\n“No market can match China’s demand for soybeans. Right now, there is a 20% retaliatory duty from China.”\nTo appease his farming base, the Trump administration announced $60bn in subsidies for farmers over the next decade in the recent tax bill, but that has drawn criticism from those who say that farmers shouldn’t be subsidized on taxpayers’ dime.\nOthers have reported that funding is going to select producers in specific regions of the US, benefiting bigger producers rather than family farms. Adding to the export challenges, the price of commodity crops in the US has been in steady decline for the past three years due to a smaller cattle herd and falling ethanol production.\nHouston says that when she speaks with the White House and Congress to share the struggles farmers are facing due to tariffs, the response is that “they support farmers [but] we are one cog in the wheel of this complex relationship.\n“The farm economy is in a much tougher place than where we were in 2018 [during Trump’s previous China trade war]. Prices have gone down while inputs – seed, fertilizer, chemicals, land and equipment – continue to go up.”\nAll the while, unpredictable weather conditions continue to make planning more difficult.\nFor much of this summer, afternoon storms had been a near-daily occurrence in Indiana, Ohio and elsewhere in the eastern corn belt, causing ponding that kills early plant growth. Diseases such as northern corn leaf blight, gray leaf spot and tar spot soon followed.\n“When it’s being attacked by disease, it’s not growing to its full potential because it’s trying to fight off the disease,” says Harbage.\nAlthough he treated his crops for disease, the heat and humidity that have been an uncommon feature of life this summer can overcome the effects of fungicides.\nOn top of that, Harbage says he’ll have to spend additional money on propane to dry his corn before sending it to consumers, again due to the high moisture content.\nIf Trump walked into his farm today, Harbage says he’d have one message.\n“The exports is number one. That’s the number one fix. We have to get rid of what we’re growing, or we have to be able to use it,” he says.\n“China, Mexico and Canada – we export $83bn worth of commodities to them a year. So if they’re not buying, we’re stuck with our crop.”\n-\nIn the US, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988, chat on 988lifeline.org, or text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

{"title": "These exercise apps reward steps with freebies – but which ones are worth the effort?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/aug/16/exercise-apps-reward-steps-freebies-which-ones-worth-the-effort-paace-betterpoints-sweatcoin", "text": "Getting your steps in could do more than just lift your mood: walking is linked to lower rates of depression and anxiety; better cardiovascular health; and improved memory. The NHS says just 10 minutes of brisk walking a day is enough to make a difference.\nAnd alongside health benefits, your steps could also earn you rewards such as coffee and other small treats, thanks to a growing number of apps that turn your footsteps into freebies.\nThe government is looking at whether financial incentives could encourage more people to increase the amount they walk and improve their diet. It is now reviewing the results of an official pilot scheme in Wolverhampton where people were given fitness trackers and earned rewards such as money off their supermarket shop.\nIn the meantime we tested some apps that let you swap your steps for stuff.\nPaace\nIf you are looking for immediate, tangible rewards, Paace is the most straightforward of the bunch. It will not tell you exactly how many steps equal a point, but the points you earn can be exchanged for offers such as money off your coffee, sandwiches, or even a packet of smoked salmon at independent cafes and restaurants (mostly) in London.\nThe app has had more than 98,000 downloads and there are now more than 200 Paace partner vendors.\nThe app sets a daily target of 8,000 steps. It took me about a week to earn enough points to get my first reward – an iced latte for £1 and 90 points – a discount on the £3.70 the cafe normally charges. For this, I walked an average of 14,000 steps a day over that period (I was on a city break for part of it), which gave me just under 100 points.\nTo make a purchase, you add the items to your basket and swipe to “unlock” the reward. Be careful: you only have 15 minutes to use the voucher after you have unlocked it, so do not make the mistake I almost made and open it too early.\nIn total, I have saved £15.10 and spent just under 500 Paace points (that is the maximum you can store without upgrading and paying for Paace+ at £29.99 a year, or £4.99 a month).\nWhen signing up, you have to share personal information, including your name, email address, and phone number. It is also recommended you share location data so you can see what is available locally. You can turn this off in settings and still search for places near you in the map feature, but some features may not work.\nJack Blackwell, the owner at Debbie Jo bakery in west London, says Paace has helped increase footfall and attracted new customers to his business. “I liked the idea of getting people moving. For me, that’s always something to encourage,” he says.\n“But it’s also great for customer acquisition. If someone comes in, you’re hoping that customer is finding out about your cafe and coming back. It’s definitely driven traffic.”\nThe app has also brought a new kind of customer. “Paace definitely brings a younger audience, especially people in their 20s, people who are active,” Blackwell says.\nHe adds that businesses can customise the rewards available “as much as we like”, which can help on days where it tends to be less busy.\n“On a weekday, if it’s quieter I can shift my offering on Paace, which is great for getting people in,” Blackwell says.\nSweatcoin\nYou must be at least 13 to sign up to this app, which rewards your steps with its own digital currency (Sweatcoin) that you can then spend on offers in its in-app marketplace.\nThe marketplace mostly features promotional offers, such as free trials or “just pay postage” deals on anything from discounted protein bars and socks to money off yoga subscriptions and fitness gear, rather than straightforward rewards you can claim without a catch.\nYou can also earn daily rewards (up to 21 coins if you build a streak) for watching adverts.\nSweatcoin sets a 12,000 steps-a-day target, a goal I usually failed to reach. And unlike Paace, the rewards are not local or particularly immediate. There is also a whole separate crypto-element – “Sweat”, a token you can earn if you opt into its blockchain-based version of the app. I didn’t.\nAfter a month using the app, I was able to get various free trials, including: a week’s supply of magnesium glycinate (though I had to cover the £3.95 postage); free discounts on HelloFresh and Green Chef; a one-month audible free trial for 25 sweatcoins; and 10% off full-priced items at Nike for 130 coins.\nYou can get more if you upgrade to the Premium account for £24.99 a year, or £4.99 a month, which can earn you extra Sweatcoins for your steps. You can also earn daily rewards (up to 21 coins if you build a streak) for watching advertisements.\nSweatcoin does not require much from you. Like Paace, it runs in the background, logs your steps and every so often you remember it exists and check how many coins you have got. Whether you will ever actually use them is another matter.\nUsers must input their mobile phone number for verification, and their email address. Sweatcoin says it may also collect data about your contacts, photographs and payment information.\nBetterPoints\nThis app rewards active commuting, with points for walking, cycling, taking public transport and, in some cases, recycling or attending exercise classes. You can exchange points for vouchers to use on Amazon, Argos and New Look. You can also choose to donate them to charities including Air Ambulances UK and Cancer Research UK.\nHowever, there is a catch: BetterPoints only works properly if the local council or a partner organisation is running a programme in your area. Participating councils include: Newham and Southwark in London; Sheffield; York; Oxfordshire, Leicestershire, and East Dunbartonshire, Wrexham and Deeside.\nIf you are in an active area, you will earn points for specific activities – such as tracking a walk with GPS (rather than steps), scanning a QR code on a council recycling bin, or checking in at a participating gym. In other parts of the country, you can still track your activity in the app, but you will not earn redeemable points. You may still be able to enter prize draws.\nYou can turn on tracking so it logs your trips automatically, but it is not always accurate. For example, it recorded a cycle on an e-bike as a car journey, and you cannot edit it after the day is done – so it is worth checking regularly if you are trying to earn points. Unfortunately, my borough is not on the scheme, which means all I could do was track my walks without benefiting financially.\nWhen signing up, you share your name, email address, year of birth, location, and postcode. You have to allow location tracking, and must be at least 13 years old.\nWhat about your data\nAll of the apps ask for – and collect – information about you.\nDr Maryam Mehrnezhad, a reader in the information security department at Royal Holloway, University of London, says that the tradeoff is simple: you are paying for the app’s free rewards with your personal data.\n“These companies may use it for various things. For instance, your data – like where you walk and how often – is used for targeted ads. Or when you redeem a reward or a discount from a brand, the app gets paid a commission,” she says.\n“They can also sell large amounts of potentially anonymised data to other companies. This helps those companies understand big trends.”\nMehrnezhad says users should be wary of how their health and location data is being used.\n“While apps claim to use anonymised data, it can often be re-identified to reveal sensitive information about your routines, like where you live and work.\n“This data is highly valuable and can be used to create detailed profiles for targeted advertising or other commercial purposes, and it also creates a risk of a data breach, which could expose your health information and personal locations to hackers,” she adds.\nUsers can limit the data that walking apps collect by managing their phone and in-app settings.\n“One effective way is to adjust app permissions on their device, such as setting location services to ‘Only While Using the App’ to prevent background tracking,” Mehrnezhad says.\nHowever, she notes that this may affect the usability of the app.\n“You must decide if the benefits are worth these risks. I personally have a problem with any app that wants to know my location at all times,” she says.\nThe best of the rest\nOther apps and companies also offer rewards for getting fit and staying healthy. They include:\nThe health insurer Vitality, which offers policyholders the chance to earn points when they get active – such as when walking every day or going to the gym. Points unlock weekly and monthly “Active Rewards”. For example, earn 12 activity points in a week and you can choose either a weekly “reward” at Caffè Nero (a free drink or 50% off one, depending on the plan you have), plus 25% off a meal at Itsu; or 50% off an Odeon or Vue cinema ticket. A workout at a participating gym could earn you five points, a 5km parkrun earn you eight. You’ll need to download the app and connect your phone or fitness tracker.\nThe retailer Decathlon lets customers earn points and turn them into vouchers for use online or instore. On top of 10 points for every £1 you spend at the retailer, you can earn 150 points a week by taking part in 150 minutes of sport. This involves logging your sport activity via a connected app such as Strava, Garmin or Kiprun. You can also earn points by sharing product reviews on items you have bought. For 2,000 points, you get a £3 Decathlon voucher, while 6,000 gets you a £10 voucher.", "published": "Sat, 16 Aug 2025 10:00:03 GMT", "author": "Mabel Banfield-Nwachi", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

That now includes four of the traditional Big Six clubs, with Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal all attracting U.S. investment.\nRapid growth in revenues has been the key attraction.\nIn the 1996-97 season, when the Premier League was established in England, revenues across the five biggest European leagues totaled 2.5 billion euros, according to Deloitte analysis.\nIn 2023-24, that figure ballooned by 750%.\nThat growth has led to sharp increases in valuations for Europe's biggest soccer teams. The Glazer family, which also owns the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, bought Manchester United for £790 million ($1.07 billion) in 2005. In 2024, a minority stake sale to billionaire Jim Ratcliffe pegged the club at around £5 billion, or the biggest valuation in world soccer.\nKieran Maguire, associate professor in football finance at the University of Liverpool, told CNBC on Wednesday that the rising levels of U.S. ownership in European soccer have been driven by higher wealth aggregation Stateside.\n\"It's actually a bit of a no brainer … what else you can do with your cash? You can only have so many helicopters, you can only have so many super yachts.\"\nAccording to Maguire, the small number of top professional sports teams available to purchase has also contributed to rising demand, with investors unable to meet the multi-billion dollar price tags attached to NFL or NBA teams in the U.S. looking to European soccer as an alternative.\nPrivate equity\nMore than 36 of clubs in Europe's five biggest leagues now have private equity, venture capital or private debt participation through majority or minority stakes, including a majority of clubs in the Premier League, according to PitchBook research.\nThe data shows a sharp increase in M&A deal activity in European soccer clubs, from just 66.7 million euros in 2018 to almost 2.2 billion euros in 2024.\nMany private equity investors in soccer have looked to the multi-club ownership model to boost their investments. Speaking to CNBC, PitchBook Senior EMEA Private Capital Analyst Nicolas Moura said many U.S. investors want to \"build a variety of different football clubs,\" and that the model can have marketing and financial benefits.\nBut the increasing prevalence of multi-club ownership has risked the ire of regulators, with Moura saying that European soccer body UEFA is \"starting to crack down on clubs.\"\nThis summer, England's Crystal Palace was barred from participating in UEFA's Europa League competition due to a breach of multi-club ownership rules. American businessman John Textor owns a stake in the English club as well as in France's Lyon, which also qualified for the competition.\nMoura says the decision — which Crystal Palace labelled as an \"injustice\" — could become more of an issue as more clubs involved in multi-club structures move into Europe's top divisions.\nWhat's next?\nThe growth of soccer revenues has slowed in recent years, with Deloitte saying it sees income \"plateauing\" in the 2025-26 season on the back of slowing growth in the value of sports media rights.\nThat has left commercial revenue — up 6% in the 2023-24 season, per Deloitte — as a main driver, as clubs clinched new sponsorship deals and looked to utilize stadiums for non-soccer events.\nMoura says lots of U.S. private equity investors are \"looking to do their stands, their entire stadiums\" in a bid to diversify away from broadcast income.\nThe search for growth in commercial and match day revenues could see more clubs holding regular matches overseas. Spain's La Liga will take its first regular season game abroad this season, as current champions Barcelona prepare to play Villareal in Miami. Italy's Serie A is also considering an international game, with the country's governing body approving plans for a match in Australia. Until now, games in domestic leagues have not been allowed to be played outside of their home country, with global governing body FIFA considering a formal change to its rules on overseas matches.\nMaguire says Premier League clubs will eventually look to hold games overseas to compete with rival European leagues, and that the money generated will mean games \"will be sold to the fan base … effectively as a fait accompli.\"\nThe Premier League has not publicly entertained the idea of taking regular season games out of England, with CEO Richard Masters telling CNBC the league is \"very different\" from American peers when it comes to international games.", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 05:10:27 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

Then I moved here, and this was the last place that I expected these kinds of events. It's definitely filled that gap. I've made some really good friends that I meet up with on weekends as well,\" Haria said.\nFor Sinny Wei, a 27-year-old human resources professional, moving from New Zealand to London meant she didn't have an established network or community in the U.K.\n\"For me, personally, it is difficult to make friends, because I've moved over here as well, so you've really got to put yourself out there a lot. I really do like it [Wharf Connect] for that as well,\" she said.\nWei said it's a good way to socialize informally, with free tickets, food and drinks being a great draw to the events.\n\"I've only been to two events, so maybe if you ask me after three events, I'll have made some friends by then,\" she said.\nHaria noted that, although he returned to the office, many of his colleagues weren't physically at the workplace. The Wharf Connect events makes going to the office worthwhile, because he has something to look forward to in the evenings, he noted.\n\"So I go into the office as many times a week as I can…working from home after Covid has been a bit s--- like I'll go into the office three or four times a week and most of my team won't be in,\" Haria said.\nIn fact, a 2023 survey by employee background screening company Checkr, which polled 3,000 U.S. workers, found that 68% of managers were keen to continue remote and hybrid work in 2024, while only 48% of employees felt the same way.\nSenior professionals have less motivation to be in the office, according to Schawbel. With more established social lives, less of a need for mentorship, and better home office setups, older professionals are less drawn to the in-person workplace. This is creating a social void for younger workers.\nIn-person events are trendy now\nOrganized in-person events, from professional networking to speed dating, are in vogue right now, and they are very appealing for Gen Z — some of whom may have underdeveloped social skills.\n\"Covid, plus over-reliance on technology equals socially awkward,\" Schawbel said. \"I'm not saying everyone is socially awkward. I'm just saying it's a recipe to create socially awkward individuals.\"\nActivity-focused events enable young people to socialize in a structured environment, rather than forcing them to spark up conversations at random.\nDating giant Hinge is even funding free activity-based social events for young people in London, Los Angeles, and New York to make friends. Another example is social app Time Left, which arranges weekly dinners for strangers to meet up, with over 80,000 strangers brought together in 60 countries each month.\nMorayo Adesina, a 25-year-old equity research bank analyst, said that London changed after the Covid-19 pandemic, with many restaurants and bars not staying open as late — making it hard to get out of the house spontaneously.\n\"Speed dating has definitely become very popular amongst my friends. I just think in general, there's been, a real push to have different kinds of events,\" she said.\nWharf Connect has been an opportunity for Adesina to meet \"a lot of cool people\" and try new things. \"The events that they put on are quite fun, like it's not every day that I get to go to Din Tai Fung to do dumpling making or sushi making.\"\nSchawbel said that for many years, people have over-relied on technology to form connections, such as on dating apps or social media, but the abundance of options has created a sense of overwhelm. The rise of in-person events and the demand for them is a rejection of online culture, he added.\n\"They're resisting this digital age, because the digital age has become very cluttered and unreliable, therefore, they're yearning to connect in person more,\" Schawbel said.", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 05:00:01 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

But during the past few months of transition planning, NBCUniversal leaders decided MSNBC should take on a new name \"to accelerate the distinction between the MSNBC and NBC News organizations,\" Lazarus wrote in the memo Monday.\nMSNBC President Rebecca Kutler added in her own note to employees that the news group's focus won't change.\n\"While our name will be changing, who we are and what we do will not. Our commitment to our work and our audiences will not waiver from what the brand promise has been for three decades,\" she wrote.\nMSNBC has been undergoing aggressive hiring for about 100 new positions to stand up its own newsroom independent from NBC News. The network has already hired about 40 journalists from CNN, Bloomberg, Politico and other news organizations to establish its first-ever Washington, D.C., bureau.\n\"During this time of transition, NBCUniversal decided that our brand requires a new, separate identity,\" Kutler wrote. \"This decision now allows us to set our own course and assert our independence as we continue to build our own modern newsgathering operation.\"\nWhile MSNBC and NBC News will have duplications in coverage, CNBC's news organization is already separate enough from NBC News that executives decided it didn't need a name change. Also, technically, the \"NBC\" in \"CNBC\" never stemmed from National Broadcasting Co. Rather, CNBC stands for \"Consumer News and Business Channel.\"\nStill, CNBC will likewise be getting a new logo without the famed NBCUniversal peacock. This will be true for all of Versant's brands that have a peacock in the logo. Sports content on the USA Network and Golf Channel will be branded together under USA Sports.

Valuations have become \"insane.\" Capital is chasing a \"kernel of truth\" with feverish speed.\nThe OpenAI CEO still believes the long-term societal upside of AI will outweigh the froth, and he's ready to keep spending in pursuit of that goal.\n\"Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,\" he said at a recent dinner with reporters. \"Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.\"\nHe repeated the word 'bubble' three times in 15 seconds, then half-joked, \"I'm sure someone's gonna write some sensational headline about that. I wish you wouldn't, but that's fine.\"\nWhile Altman warned that valuations are now out of control, he's ready to shell out on more infrastructure.\n\"You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on datacenter construction in the not very distant future,\" Altman said. \"And you should expect a bunch of economists wringing their hands, saying, 'This is so crazy, it's so reckless,' and we'll just be like, 'You know what? Let us do our thing.'\"\nOpenAI is already looking beyond Microsoft Azure's cloud capacity, and is shopping around for more.\nThe company signed a deal with Google Cloud this spring and, according to Altman, OpenAI is \"beyond the compute demand\" of what any one hyperscaler can offer.\n\"You should expect us to take as much compute as we can,\" he added. \"Our bet is, our demand is going to keep growing, our training needs are going to keep going, and we will spend maybe more aggressively than any company who's ever spent on anything ahead of progress, because we just have this very deep belief in what we're seeing.\"\nIt's not just OpenAI. All the megacaps are trying to keep up.\nIn their most recent earnings, tech's biggest names all raised capital expenditure guidance to keep pace with AI demand: Microsoft is now targeting $120 billion in full-year capital expenditures, Amazon is topping $100 billion, Alphabet raised its forecast to $85 billion, and Meta lifted the high end of its capex range to $72 billion.\nWedbush's Dan Ives said Monday on CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" that demand for AI infrastructure has grown 30% to 40% in the last months, calling the capex surge a validation moment for the sector.\nIves acknowledged \"some froth\" in parts of the market, but said the AI revolution with autonomous is only starting to play out and we are in the \"second inning of a nine-inning game.\"\n\"The actual impact over the medium and long term is actually being underestimated,\" he said.\nCiti's Rob Rowe, speaking Monday on CNBC's \"Money Movers,\" pushed back on comparisons between today's AI boom and the dotcom bubble.\n\"Back then, you had a lot of over-leveraged situations. You didn't have a lot of companies that had earnings,\" Rowe said. \"Here you're talking about companies that have very solid earnings, very strong cash flow, and they're funding a lot of this growth through that cash flow. So in many respects, it's a little different than that.\"\nHe added that the current wave of AI investment is being driven by structural shifts in the global economy, particularly the rapid growth of digital services, which now account for a large share of global exports. Also unlike the dotcom cycle of the late 90s, companies today are funding their infrastructure spending with strong cash flow rather than relying on debt.\nStill, concerns about overheating have been mounting.\nAlibaba co-founder Joe Tsai pointed to worrying signs in the AI sector well before the hyperscalers raised their annual capex guidance during the latest earnings prints.\nIn March, he warned of a brewing AI bubble in the U.S.\nSpeaking at HSBC's Global Investment Summit in Hong Kong, Tsai said he was astounded by the scale of datacenter spending under discussion. Tsai questioned whether hundreds of billions in spending is necessary, and flagged concern about companies starting to build datacenters \"on spec,\" without clear demand.\nAltman, for his part, sees these cycles as part of the natural rhythm of technological progress.\nThe dotcom crash wiped out scores of companies, but still gave rise to the modern internet. He expects AI to follow a similar path: a few high-profile wipeouts, followed by a lasting transformation.\n\"I do think some investors are likely to get very burnt here, and that sucks. And I don't want to minimize that,\" he said. \"But on the whole, it is my belief that... the value created by AI for society will be tremendous.\"\nWATCH: OpenAI staffer reportedly to sell $6 billion in stock to SoftBank and other investors", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 00:51:21 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

Meanwhile, Intel has been awarded about $10.9 billion in Chips Act grants, including $7.9 billion for commercial manufacturing and $3 billion for national security projects.\nThe report noted, however, that it remains unclear if the idea has gained traction broadly within the administration or whether officials have broached the possibility with affected companies.\nIt added that the exact size of the stake remains in flux, and it remains unclear whether the White House will actually proceed with the plan. Intel and the White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's queries regarding the report.\nIntel, once a dominant force in the U.S. chip industry, has fallen behind global competitors in advanced chip manufacturing. Reviving the former U.S. chip champion has become a national priority in Washington, with reports about a potential government stake in the company first circulating last week.\nThe company has been the largest recipient of the 2022 Chips Act, passed with bipartisan support under the Biden administration, as part of efforts by Washington to revitalize U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing.\nThe bill allocated $39 billion in grants for American semiconductor manufacturing projects, with funding committed to many of the world's chipmakers such as TSMC and Samsung, as well as American chip companies such as Nvidia, Micron and GlobalFoundries.\nU.S. President Donald Trump, though supporting the general goals of the Chips Act, has been a vocal critic of the bill and even called for its repeal earlier this year. While republican lawmakers in Washington have been reluctant to act on that call, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in June that the administration was renegotiating some of the bill's grants.\nIf Intel's Chip Act funds were to be converted into a potential government stake in the company, it could decrease the total amount of capital infused into the company as part of any deal by Washington.\nHowever, it would serve as the latest example of the Trump administration's interest in building government-backed national champions in strategic industries.\nIntel has struggled to gain an advantage in the artificial intelligence boom and has yet to capture a significant customer for its manufacturing business despite spending heavily on it.\nSome analysts have argued that government intervention is essential for the struggling chipmaker and for the sake of U.S. national security. Others contend that Intel's problems are deeper than funding, and it is not clear how the government can help with that.\nAnalysts have also noted that Trump may be able to sway companies to buy Intel chips or assist indirectly, through tariffs and regulation.\nOn Tuesday, it was announced that SoftBank was investing $2 billion in Intel. According to LSEG, the investment is worth about 2% of Intel, making SoftBank the fifth-biggest shareholder. Masayoshi Son, Chairman & CEO of SoftBank Group, said: \"This strategic investment reflects our belief that advanced semiconductor manufacturing and supply will further expand in the United States, with Intel playing a critical role.\"\nIntel investors had initially welcomed news of the government investment, which resulted in a share rally of nearly 9% on Aug. 14. Shares of Intel fell over 3% on Monday on the Bloomberg report, but rebounded by more than 5% in overnight trading on the trading platform Robinhood following news of a Softbank investment.\nIntel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who was appointed in March 2025, met with Trump at the White House last week, after the U.S. president had called for his ousting due to his past ties to China.\nAfter the meeting, Trump had changed his tune on the Intel chief, saying he had \"an amazing story.\" It's unclear if a potential government stake in the company had been discussed at the time.\nRead the full Bloomberg story here.", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 05:38:05 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

Nearly half of the 2,000 adults surveyed said they're afraid they won't have enough money to retire.\nSome people have gone beyond considering the strategy. \"Two in 10 workers adjusted their target retirement age in 2024,\" according to a recent report from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, \"with most of them now planning to retire later.\"\nBut experts say that plan to work longer may not be as reliable as workers hope.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nInvestors shouldn’t try to be a ‘hero’ in this economy: analyst\nFewer young adults reach key life, money milestones\nSocial Security marks its 90th anniversary: What may happen to benefits\nAbout 58% of workers retire earlier than they intended, according to 2024 research from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies in collaboration with the Transamerica Institute. Of those who did, 46% did so for health-related reasons, while 43% cited employment issues and 20%, family reasons.\nOnly 21% said they retired early because they are financially stable.\n\"The 2008 recession kind of knocked all those assumptions about being able to work longer with enough money out of reality,\" said Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economics and policy analysis at The New School for Social Research. \"We had 50-year-olds, 55-year-olds, being really pushed out of the labor market or lose their career jobs, and having to come back and having to spend their savings while they were still in their 50s and 60s because of the hardship of that recession.\"\n\"So you can't [always] work longer because of age discrimination, and because the labor market may not want the skills that you've acquired over 40 years, because the labor market and the skills required have moved forward,\" she added.\nA system built for a different generation\nThe instinct to delay retirement is understandable, experts say.\nLife expectancy across developed countries has climbed significantly over the last several decades, according to World Bank data analyzed by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. At the same time, the burden of investing for retirement has shifted to workers.\nFor much of the 20th century, the American retirement system relied on what economists call the three-legged stool: Social Security, employer pensions and personal savings.\nBut one of those legs, Social Security, has a looming funding shortfall that has left some workers concerned about what kind of retirement benefits they may receive.\nAnother leg, pensions, has rapidly declined for private sector workers. In 1989, 63% of full-time workers at companies with more than 100 employees had pensions, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As of early 2023, only about 15% of private industry workers did.\nWorkers now largely depend on 401(k)s and other defined-contribution plans, which rely on them to determine how much to contribute and how to invest those funds.\nSome younger workers are rising to the challenge. Younger workers today often have more money in retirement accounts by age 30 than boomers did, according to Federal Reserve research.\n\"Millennials are saving at a higher rate at this age than Gen Xers or Boomers,\" said Christine Mahoney, global pensions leader at the pension consulting firm Mercer. \"So I guess I would say if they're nervous and it's making them save, that's not necessarily a bad thing.\"\nBut personal savings may not be enough. Unexpected medical bills, market downturns or job losses can quickly derail even disciplined savers, leading to what experts call 401(k) \"leakage.\" Add in the growing weight of student loan debt, and retirement becomes even harder to afford for some workers.\nIs working longer the solution?\nSome policymakers and economists say extended careers could help Americans close their retirement gaps.\n\"We have more options for extended work lives today than we've ever had before, and Americans are taking advantage of them,\" said Andrew Biggs, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\nThe number of employed Americans age 65 and older grew 33.2% between 2015 and 2024, according to a CNBC analysis of BLS data.\nBiggs also emphasized that older workers continue to bring value to the labor force. \"There's great demand for older workers,\" he said. \"They still have a lot of skills, a lot left to give, and so they can be valuable to employers.\"\nBut others say that perspective doesn't align with how the labor market actually works.\n\"The labor market doesn't always want you when you want the labor market,\" said Ghilarducci. \"Employers have the biggest role in the decision about whether or not you work and what the quality of your work is.\"\nWatch the video above to learn more about why Americans may end up working longer than their parents and whether planning to work longer will actually help people in retirement.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:00:01 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

Following such a loss, insurers send checks typically made out jointly to both the homeowner and the mortgage lender or servicer. The lender will then deposit the funds into an escrow account, where it earns interest that the lender could keep.\nCalifornia Assemblymember John Harabedian, D-Pasadena, the author of the bill, said he is fighting to change that after hearing from his constituents about their struggles getting insurance payouts released from their lenders.\n\"If the homeowners are not given their money right away, the interest on that money, which the banks and the mortgage lenders are holding onto and earning [interest on], should be paid to the homeowner, not the banks,\" Harabedian told CNBC. \"The more we looked into this, the more we realized that this was a huge problem across the board.\"\nThe bill will now head to Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk to be signed into law.\nAfter a disaster, insurance settlement checks can often be held in an escrow account by the mortgage servicing company until rebuilding is complete, which can take months or even years. During this time, the funds can accrue significant interest that the servicing company could keep.\nNow, the homeowner will be guaranteed at least 2% interest on those funds.\nThe bill will apply to both existing insurance payouts that are still being held in escrow accounts and to any new escrow accounts that are opened following a catastrophic event. For any funds already in an escrow account, interest at 2% simple per annum will begin accruing on the bill's effective date.\nNewsom, who sponsored the state legislation, said homeowners rebuilding after a disaster need all the support they can get.\n\"This is a commonsense solution that ensures that [homeowners] receive every resource available to help them recover and rebuild,\" Newsom said in a statement in February when the bill was first introduced.\nCalifornia law had already required lenders to pay homeowners interest on escrowed funds for property taxes and insurance, but it didn't explicitly include insurance payments. The bill aims to close that loophole.\n\"It's sad that we have to introduce a bill to make the banks and the mortgage lenders do the right thing, but this is about homeowners getting all the financial help that they can throughout this difficult period,\" Harabedian said.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 22:11:19 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

The shares rose about 6% in extended trading to $25.\nThe investment, equal to about 2% of Intel, makes SoftBank the fifth-biggest shareholder, according to FactSet. It's a vote of support for Intel, which hasn't been able to take advantage of the artificial intelligence boom in advanced semiconductors and has spent heavily to stand up a manufacturing business that's yet to secure a significant customer.\n\"Masa and I have worked closely together for decades, and I appreciate the confidence he has placed in Intel with this investment,\" Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a statement, referring to SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son.\nIntel shares lost 60% of their value last year, their worst performance in the company's more than half-century on the public market. The stock is up 18% in 2025 as of Monday's close.\nTan took over as Intel CEO in March after his predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, was ousted in December.\nIntel has been a major topic of discussion in Washington of late, due to the company's role as the only American company capable of manufacturing the most advanced chips.\nHowever, Intel's foundry business, which is designed to manufacture chips for other companies, has yet to secure a major customer, a critical step towards stabilization and expansion. Last month, Intel said it would wait to secure orders before committing to certain future investment in its foundry.\nTan met with President Donald Trump last week after the president had called for the CEO's resignation. The U.S. government is considering taking an equity stake in Intel, according to reports.\nSoftBank, meanwhile, has become an increasingly large player in the global chip and AI markets.\nIn 2016, SoftBank acquired chip designer Arm in a deal worth about $32 billion at the time. Today the company is worth almost $150 billion. Arm-based chips are part of Nvidia's systems that go into data centers.\nAnd in March of this year, SoftBank announced plans to acquire another chip designer, Ampere Computing, for $6.5 billion.\nSoftBank was also part of President Trump's Stargate announcement in January, along with OpenAI and Oracle.\nThe three companies committed to invest an initial $100 billion and up to $500 billion over the next four years in the AI infrastructure project.

And also lakes and rivers are favorable destinations,\" a spokesperson for the Slovenian Tourist Board told CNBC by email.\nTourism challenges\nWhile a shift in travel preferences may help to alleviate overtourism in Europe's traditional hotspots, the coolcations trend could have significant economic consequences.\nSouthern European countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal are all heavily reliant on tourism, with the latest available data showing the sector accounted for 18%, 12.3% and 11.9% of gross domestic product, respectively.\nLinda Jonczyk, a spokesperson for TUI, Europe's largest tour operator, said the company was seeing growing interest in Nordic destinations such as Iceland, Norway and Sweden due to the coolcations trend. Yet, bookings were still relatively low compared to other traditional summer hotspots.\n\"Classic sun and beach destinations around the Mediterranean continue to be high in demand – Spain, Greece and Turkey are and remain the undisputed favourites,\" Jonczyk told CNBC by email.\nFor its part, Portugal's national tourism authority said summer demand in key regions remains robust. A spokesperson for Turismo de Portugal said that while some regions in the north and center were managing localized wildfires, the vast majority of the country was unaffected.\n\"Portugal's tourism infrastructure is highly prepared to respond to such challenges, with contingency measures in place to ensure minimal disruption,\" Turismo de Portugal told CNBC by email.\n\"Airports and ports across the country are operating at full capacity, and the tourism sector remains strong — with summer arrivals in key regions matching or surpassing last year's numbers,\" they added.\nA 'climate risk zone'\nGlobetrender's Southan said she expects the coolcations trend to solidify over the coming years.\nShe predicted that by the late 2020s, the Mediterranean's peak travel season could shift to May-June and September-October, with July-August \"becoming a 'climate risk zone' for mass tourism.\"\n\"Southern destinations will increasingly invest in climate-resilient infrastructure – shaded public spaces, heat-adaptive hotels, wildfire prevention corridors – while promoting alternative experiences beyond the midday sun,\" Southan said.\n\"Meanwhile, northern Europe, once a niche summer escape, may need to manage its own version of 'overtourism' as hotter summers drive demand.

Outside of the initial days of the Covid-19 pandemic, levels haven't been that consistently low since early 2016.\nThe quits rate is a barometer of workers' perceptions of the broader labor market, said Laura Ullrich, director of economic research in North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab. In this case, they may be nervous about getting another job or aren't enthusiastic about their ability to find one, she said.\nThe current clinging is a stark contrast from the historic rate of job-hopping that workers exhibited in 2021 and 2022, but experts say it makes sense given current labor market trends.\nThe share of jobseekers who are \"not confident at all\" that there are \"plenty of jobs\" available has increased steadily, to 38% in the second quarter from about 26% three years earlier, according to a quarterly poll by ZipRecruiter.\n\"There is this stagnation in the labor market, where the hires, quits and layoff rates are low,\" said Ullrich. \"There's just not a lot of movement at all.\"\n'Uncertainty in the world'\n\"There's quite a bit of uncertainty in the world — economic, political, global — and I think uncertainty causes people to naturally\" remain in a holding pattern, said Matt Bohn, an executive search consultant at Korn Ferry.\nHe equated the dynamic to skittish investors who sometimes sit on the sidelines, waiting for an investment opportunity.\nThe job market has also gradually cooled amid a regime of higher interest rates, which makes it more costly for businesses to borrow money and expand their operations.\nThe hiring rate over the past year or so has plunged to its lowest pace in more than a decade (excluding the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic) — meaning those who want to look for a new job may have a relatively tough time finding one.\nJob growth in recent months has also slowed sharply, which economists point to as evidence of a broader economic slowdown. The ratio of job openings per unemployed worker has fallen by about half since peaking at about 2:1 in March 2022; it was roughly 1:1 in June 2025, the latest month of available federal data.\nMore CEOs reported plans to shrink their workforce over the next 12 months than expand it — the first time that's occurred since 2020, according to a Conference Board quarterly poll published earlier this month.

Employers may also decide such workers are no longer meeting their performance standards, he added.\nAdditionally, a lack of movement in the job market may make it harder for new entrants like recent graduates to find work, Ullrich said.\nCorrection: This article has been updated to correct the timing of the Korn Ferry and Conference Board reports.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 17:31:17 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

He warned that the U.S.–China AI race is deeply entangled — and more consequential than a simple who's-ahead scoreboard.\n\"There's inference capacity, where China probably can build faster. There's research, there's product; a lot of layers to the whole thing,\" he said. \"I don't think it'll be as simple as: Is the U.S. or China ahead?\"\nDespite escalating U.S. export controls on semiconductors, Altman is unconvinced that the policy is keeping up with technical reality.\nAsked whether it would be reassuring if fewer GPUs were reaching China, Altman was skeptical. \"My instinct is that doesn't work,\" he said.\n\"You can export-control one thing, but maybe not the right thing… maybe people build fabs or find other workarounds,\" he added, referring to semiconductor fabrication facilities, the specialized factories that produce the chips powering everything from smartphones to large-scale AI systems.\n\"I'd love an easy solution,\" added Altman. \"But my instinct is: That's hard.\"\nHis comments come as Washington adjusts its policies designed to curb China's AI ambitions. The Biden administration initially tightened export controls, but in April, President Donald Trump went further — halting the supply of advanced chips altogether, including models previously designed to comply with Biden-era rules.\nLast week, however, the U.S. carved out an exception for certain \"China-safe\" chips, allowing sales to resume under a controversial and unprecedented agreement requiring Nvidia and AMD to give the federal government 15% of their China chip revenue.\nThe result is a patchwork regime that may be easier to navigate than enforce. And while U.S. firms deepen their dependence on chips from Nvidia and AMD, Chinese companies are pushing ahead with alternatives from Huawei and other domestic suppliers — raising questions about whether cutting off supply is having the intended effect.\nOpen source and China\nChina's AI progress has also influenced how OpenAI thinks about releasing its own models.\nWhile the company has long resisted calls to make its technology fully open source, Altman said competition from Chinese models — particularly open-source systems like DeepSeek — was a factor in OpenAI's recent decision to release its own open-weight models.\n\"It was clear that if we didn't do it, the world was gonna head to be mostly built on Chinese open source models,\" Altman said. \"That was a factor in our decision, for sure. Wasn't the only one, but that loomed large.\"\nEarlier this month, OpenAI released two open-weight language models — its first since GPT-2 in 2019 — marking a significant shift in strategy for the company that has long kept its technology gated behind application programming interfaces, or APIs.\nThe new text-only models, called gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, are designed as lower-cost options that developers, researchers, and companies can download, run locally, and customize.\nAn AI model is considered open weight if its parameters — the values learned during training that determine how the model generates responses — are publicly available. While that offers transparency and control, it's not the same as open source. OpenAI is still not releasing its training data or full source code.\nWith this release, OpenAI joins that wave and, for now, stands alone as the only major U.S. foundation model company actively leaning into a more open approach.\nWhile Meta had embraced openness with its Llama models, CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggested on the company's second-quarter earnings call it may pull back on that strategy going forward.\nOpenAI, meanwhile, is moving in the opposite direction, betting that broader accessibility will help grow its developer ecosystem and strengthen its position against Chinese rivals. Altman had previously acknowledged that OpenAI had been \"on the wrong side of history\" by locking up its models.\nUltimately, OpenAI's move shows it wants to keep developers engaged and within its ecosystem. That push comes as Meta reconsiders its open-source stance and Chinese labs flood the market with models designed to be flexible and widely adopted.\nStill, the open-weight debut has drawn mixed reviews.\nSome developers have called the models underwhelming, noting that many of the capabilities that make OpenAI's commercial offerings so powerful were stripped out.\nAltman didn't dispute that, saying the team intentionally optimized for one core use case: locally-run coding agents.\n\"If the kind of demand shifts in the world,\" he said, \"you can push it to something else.\"\nWatch: OpenAI's enterprise bet pays off as startups in Silicon Valley switch to GPT-5", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 00:41:41 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes,\" he was quoted as saying.\nAltman appeared to compare this dynamic to the infamous dot-com bubble, a stock market crash centered on internet-based companies that led to massive investor enthusiasm during the late 1990s. Between March 2000 and October 2002, the Nasdaq lost nearly 80% of its value after many of these companies failed to generate revenue or profits.\nHis comments add to growing concern among experts and analysts that investment in AI is moving too fast. Alibaba co-founder Joe Tsai, Bridgewater Associates' Ray Dalio and Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok have all raised similar warnings.\nLast month, Slok stated in a report that he believed the AI bubble of today was, in fact, bigger than the internet bubble, with the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 more overvalued than they were in the 1990s.\nIn a Monday email to CNBC, Ray Wang, research director for semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at Futurum Group, said that he thought Altman's comments carry some validity, but that the risks are company-dependent.\n\"From the perspective of broader investment in AI and semiconductors... I don't see it as a bubble. The fundamentals across the supply chain remain strong, and the long-term trajectory of the AI trend supports continued investment,\" he said.\nHowever, he added that there is an increasing amount of speculative capital chasing companies with weaker fundamentals and only perceived potential, which could create pockets of overvaluation.\nMany Fears of an AI bubble had hit a fever pitch at the start of this year when Chinese start-up DeepSeek released a competitive reasoning model. The company claimed one version of its advanced large language models had been trained for under $6 million, a fraction of the billions being spent by U.S. AI market leaders like OpenAI, though these claims were also been met with some skepticism.\nEarlier this month, Altman told CNBC that OpenAI's annual recurring revenue is on track to pass $20 billion this year, but that despite that, it remains unprofitable.\nThe release of OpenAI's latest GPT-5 AI model earlier this month had also been rocky, with some critics complaining that it had a less intuitive feel. This resulted in the company restoring access to legacy GPT-4 models for paying customers.\nFollowing the release of the model, Altman has also signaled more caution about some of the AI industry's more bullish predictions.\nSpeaking to CNBC, he said that he thought the term artificial general intelligence, or \"AGI,\" is losing relevance, when asked whether the GPT-5 model moves the world any closer to achieving AGI.\nAGI refers to the concept of a form of artificial intelligence that can perform any intellectual task that a human can — something that OpenAI has been working towards for years and that Altman previously said could be achieved in the \"reasonably close-ish future.\"\nRegardless, faith in OpenAI from investors has remained strong this year. CNBC confirmed Friday that the company was preparing to sell around $6 billion in stock as part of a secondary sale that would value it at roughly $500 billion.\nIn March, it had announced a $40 billion funding round at a $300 billion valuation, by far the largest amount ever raised by a private tech company.\nIn The Verge article on Friday, the OpenAI CEO also discussed OpenAI's expansion into consumer hardware, brain-computer interfaces and social media.\nAltman also said that he expects OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on its data center buildout in the \"not very distant future,\" and signaled that the company would be interested in buying Chrome if the U.S. government were to force Google to sell it.\nAsked if he would be CEO of OpenAI in a few years, he was quoted as saying, \"I mean, maybe an AI is in three years.

Yieldstreet says it gives retail investors such as Klish access to the types of deals that were previously only the domain of Wall Street firms or the ultrarich.\nSo Klish, a 46-year-old financial services worker living in Miami, logged on to Yieldstreet's platform, where a pair of offerings jumped out to him.\nHe invested $400,000 in two real estate projects: A luxury apartment building in downtown Nashville overseen by former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann's family office, and a three-building renovation in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York. Each project had targeted annual returns of around 20%.\nThree years later, Klish said he has little hope of ever seeing his money again. Yieldstreet declared the Nashville project a total loss in May, according to an investor letter, wiping out $300,000 of his funds. The Chelsea deal needs to raise fresh capital to avoid a similar fate, according to another letter. Both letters were reviewed by CNBC.\n\"There isn't a day that goes by without me saying, 'I can't believe what happened,'\" Klish told CNBC. \"I lost $400,000 in Yieldstreet. I consider myself moderately financially savvy, and I got duped by this company. I just worry that it's going to keep happening to others.\"\nDistributed risk\nYieldstreet, founded in 2015, is one of the best-known examples of American startups with the stated mission of democratizing access to assets such as real estate, litigation proceeds and private credit. To do so, it gathers funds from thousands of investors such as Klish, who typically put in at least $10,000 each for projects vetted by Yieldstreet managers.\nThe startup's central premise is that the world beyond public stocks and bonds — often called alternative assets or private market investments — provides both smoother sailing and the possibility of higher returns, a win-win proposition. This month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order designed to allow private market investments in U.S. retirement plans.\nBut Yieldstreet customers who participated in its real estate deals in recent years say they've learned the flip side of the private markets: They face huge losses on investments that turned out far riskier than they thought, while their money has been locked up for years with little to show for it besides frustration.\nThe company said in a statement that its real estate equity offerings from 2021 and 2022 were \"significantly impacted\" by rising interest rates and market conditions that pressured valuations industrywide.\nThis article is based on dozens of investor letters that were sent to customers by Yieldstreet and reviewed by CNBC.\nThe documents show investors put more than $370 million into 30 real estate projects that have already recognized $78 million in defaults in the past year. Yieldstreet customers who spoke to CNBC say they anticipate deep or total losses on the remainder.\nThe breadth of Yieldstreet's struggles in real estate — its biggest single investment category — hasn't previously been reported.\nCNBC's analysis covers a wide swath of deals that the company offered between 2021 and 2024, but doesn't include every project, of which there were at least 55, according to Yieldstreet.\nThe troubled projects vary. They include apartment complexes in boomtowns such as Atlanta, Dallas and Nashville, Tennessee; developments in coastal cities including New York, Boston and Portland, Oregon; apartment buildings in the Midwest and single-family rental homes across Florida, Georgia and North Carolina.\nOf the 30 deals that CNBC reviewed information on, four have been declared total losses by Yieldstreet. Of the rest, 23 are deemed to be on \"watchlist\" by the startup as it seeks to recoup value for investors, sometimes by raising more funds from members. Three deals are listed as \"active,\" though they have stopped making scheduled payouts, according to the documents.\nAdditionally, Yieldstreet shut down a real estate investment trust made up of six of the above projects last year as its value plunged by nearly half, locking up customer money for at least two years.\nYieldstreet's overall returns in real estate have plunged in the past two years; the category went from a 9.4% annual return rate in 2023 to a 2% return rate in the company's most recent update on its website.\nBut only customers participating in a specific fund get information about its performance, and Yieldstreet labels its investor updates \"confidential,\" warning customers that the information in them can't be shared without consent from the startup. While not uncommon in the private markets, those limitations make it hard for investors to know if their experience is unique.\nKlish said he began to worry about his investments in early 2023 when updates became late and began to hint at deteriorating market conditions.\nFrustrated by those delays and what he described as a lack of candor from Yieldstreet about his sinking investments, Klish turned to forums on Facebook and Reddit for a sense of the bigger picture. There he said he found a few dozen other customers who shared their Yieldstreet experiences.\n\"When I dug into the other deals, I realized that this is systemic,\" said Klish. \"Almost every single deal is in trouble.\"\nIn July, Klish filed a complaint, which CNBC has reviewed, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleging that Yieldstreet misled its investors. Klish said he has yet to receive a response to his complaint.\nMissing ships, busted tie-up\nYieldstreet calls itself the leading platform offering access to the private markets, a category that has boomed over the past decade as professional investors seek sources of yield beyond stocks and bonds.\nFounded 10 years ago by Michael Weisz and Milind Mehere, the company has well-known VC backers including Khosla Ventures, Thrive Capital and General Catalyst. Yieldstreet was part of a wave of fintech startups created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, including Robinhood and Chime, with a populist message.\n\"Our mission at Yieldstreet is, how do we help create financial independence for millions of people?\" Weisz said during a 2020 CNBC interview. \"You do that by helping people generate consistent, passive income.\"\nWeisz, who became CEO of Yieldstreet in 2023, brought experience in litigation finance, where hedge funds lend money to plaintiffs for a slice of the payout if the lawsuit wins. Mehere, a former software engineer who had co-founded online marketing startup Yodle, was the more technical of the pair.\nYieldstreet declined to make the co-founders or other executives available for this article.\nIn early 2020, Yieldstreet announced a partnership with BlackRock, the biggest asset manager in the world. The startup said at the time that its new Prism fund would contain a mix of its private market assets with conventional bond funds managed by BlackRock.\nHere is the 2020 interview with Yieldstreet co-founder Weisz:\nThe move seemed to signal that Yieldstreet was primed for mainstream success. BlackRock had spent 18 months vetting the company before agreeing to the tie-up, Yieldstreet's co-founders told CNBC at the time.\nThe month after its public announcement, though, Yieldstreet had tougher news to share. It was becoming clear that customers in another one of its product lines — loans backed by commercial ships that are torn apart for scrap metal — would suffer losses, the firm told them in March, according to a Wall Street Journal report.\nYieldstreet lost track of 13 ships in international waters that backed $89 million in member loans, according to an April 2020 lawsuit filed by the startup against the borrower in that project, which it accused of fraud. In October 2020, a British court sided with Yieldstreet in the lawsuit against the borrower, a Dubai-based ship recycler.\nThe episode scared off BlackRock, which ended the partnership weeks after it was announced, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked to remain unnamed so they could speak freely about private conversations.\nA Yieldstreet spokeswoman at the time told The Wall Street Journal that the BlackRock launch was initially successful but the fund \"was then faced with the market environment caused by Covid-19.\"\nThree years later, the SEC fined Yieldstreet $1.9 million for selling a $14.5 million marine loan to investors even when it had reason to believe the borrower had stolen proceeds from related deals. Yieldstreet also didn't use \"publicly available\" methods to track the ships it was relying on for collateral, the SEC said.\n\"YieldStreet aims to unlock the complex alternative investments market for retail investors but failed to disclose glaring red flags it had about the security of the collateral backing this offering,\" an SEC official said in a 2023 release accompanying the settlement, for which the company neither denied nor admitted to the agency's findings.\nStill, the company continued to rack up assets on its platform, in part by ramping up activities in real estate. By 2023, real estate funds made up 26% of all investments on the platform, the largest asset category and well ahead of runners-up such as private credit, Yieldstreet said at the time.\nLate that year, Yieldstreet announced it had acquired Cadre, a startup co-founded by Jared Kushner that focused on broadening access to commercial real estate. The companies declined to disclose terms of the deal, but Yieldstreet said the combined entities' \"investment value\" was nearly $10 billion.\nIn May 2025, Yieldstreet replaced Weisz as CEO with Mitch Caplan, a former E-Trade chief who joined the startup's board in 2021. That's the year the venture firm where Caplan serves as president, Tarsadia Investments, took a stake in Yieldstreet. The company declined to say why Weisz was replaced.\nIn July, Yieldstreet announced a $77 million capital raise, led by Tarsadia Investments.\n'Difficult news'\nYieldstreet continued to make moves in real estate well after a seismic shift that made the industry far harder to navigate had begun.\nIn early 2022, the Federal Reserve kicked off its most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in decades to combat inflation, turning the economics of many projects from that period upside down. The value of multifamily buildings has dropped 19% since 2022, according to Green Street's commercial property index.\nProjects that Yieldstreet put its customers into struggled to hit revenue targets amid price competition or had problems filling vacancies or raising rents, and thus began to fall behind on loan payments, according to investor letters.\nCombined with the use of leverage, or borrowing money that amplifies both risks and returns, Yieldstreet investors suffered complete losses on projects in Nashville, Atlanta and New York's Upper West Side neighborhood, the letters show.\n\"After exhausting all options to preserve value, YieldStreet determined there was no reasonable path to recovery,\" the firm told customers who invested $15 million in the Upper West Side deal. \"We sold our position for $1.\"\nIt's unclear if Yieldstreet, which makes money by charging annual management fees of around 2% on invested funds, itself suffered financial losses on the defaults.\nIn at least a half dozen cases, Yieldstreet went to its user base again in 2023 and 2024 to raise rescue funds for troubled deals, telling members that the loans combined the protections of debt with the upside of equity.\nBut if the project was doomed, a bailout loan was, at least in one case, effectively throwing good money after bad. A $3.1 million member loan to help rescue the Nashville project, located at 2010 West End Avenue, was wiped out in just months.\n\"We are reaching out to share difficult news,\" Yieldstreet told investors of the Nashville project and its member loan in May. \"Following multiple restructuring attempts, the property has been sold to Tishman Speyer ... resulting in a complete loss of capital for investors.\"\nIn a statement provided in response to CNBC's reporting for this article, Yieldstreet said it has offered 149 real estate deals since inception and has delivered positive returns on 94% of matured investments in the category.\nThat 94% figure likely doesn't include the distressed projects that CNBC has identified, since those funds aren't yet classified as matured while Yieldstreet seeks to salvage projects on its watchlist. The watchlist designation doesn't always result in the loss of investor funds, Yieldstreet said in another statement.\n\"Of the nearly $5 billion invested across the platform, a set of real estate equity offerings originated during 2021–2022 were significantly impacted by rising interest rates and broader market conditions that pressured multifamily valuations across the industry,\" Yieldstreet said through a spokeswoman.\nAdverse selection\nOn its website, the startup says it offers only about 10% of the opportunities it reviews, signaling its discernment when it comes to risk.\nBut several professional investors pointed to the possibility that, instead of securing only top-quality deals in real estate, Yieldstreet may be getting ones that are picked over by more established players.\n\"There's no question you've seen deals that institutions have passed on that went to the platforms because retail investors might have less discipline than the institutional ones,\" said Greg Friedman, CEO of Peachtree Group, an Atlanta-based commercial real estate investment firm.\n\"It's a reflection of a lack of discipline in underwriting and market conditions going against them,\" Friedman said of Yieldstreet's track record. \"Anything done after 2022, they should have done more carefully knowing that we are in a higher-rate environment.\"\nIn late 2022, Yieldstreet even told investors that real estate was a \"safe(er) haven\" asset during periods of rising rates and high inflation. By then, the Fed's intent to squash inflation with higher rates was well understood.\n\"Real estate can be an effective inflation hedge, carries low correlation to traditional markets, and has even benefitted in times of market downturns, generating outsized returns,\" the startup said in a blog post at the time.\nIn the post, Yieldstreet gave the example of the Alterra Apartments, a multifamily project in Tucson, Arizona, where it said rent increases and a contractual cap on interest rates protected it from the Fed hikes.\nBut this year, Yieldstreet told investors in the $23 million deal that the Tucson development was in technical default and headed for a full write-off.\n'Mind-boggling'\nCustomers interviewed by CNBC accuse the company of downplaying investment risks and say that its disclosures around performance can be sloppy or misleading.\nMark Underhill, a 57-year-old software engineer, said he invested $600,000 across 22 Yieldstreet funds and faces $200,000 in losses on projects that are on watchlist and have never made payouts.\n\"With any investment, there's a risk of loss,\" Underhill said. \"But there's no consideration of these type of gut-punch losses. They talked about how their deals were backed by collateral, and they gave you all these reasons that make you feel there's something left if the deal goes south.\"\nUnderhill, who was treated with chemotherapy for multiple myeloma last year and travels the American West in a camper van, said his losses are forcing him to work beyond his expected retirement date.\n\"The thing that is mind-boggling is, how did they fail so badly on so many deals in so many markets?\" Underhill said.\nThe offering sheet for the Upper West Side project said sales prices would have to plunge 35% for Yieldstreet members to see any losses, a worse hit than what New York experienced during the 2008 recession, Klish wrote in his July complaint to the SEC.\nBut the project defaulted even though prices in the area didn't fall by that much, Klish wrote.\nIn another example, while participants in the Nashville deals got letters showing a complete loss, or a -100% return, Yieldstreet's public-facing website listed a 0% internal rate of return, or IRR, giving the false impression that investors got all their capital back.\nAfter CNBC asked Yieldstreet for comment on the discrepancy, the website was updated to reflect the -100% return.\nThe company also stopped issuing quarterly portfolio snapshots after early 2023, making it harder for prospective investors to see how Yieldstreet's overall investments are performing.\nSo besides marketing materials, customers are mostly left to rely on the company's disclosures about its performance as a gauge of whether to invest with the startup.\nYieldstreet says it updates its metrics quarterly, and its website shows a 7.4% internal rate of return through March 2025 across all investments. That period likely excludes the impact of the Nashville defaults, which were disclosed in May 2025.\n'Winter is coming'\nYieldstreet's real estate woes threaten to wipe out decades of savings for Louis Litz, a 61-year-old electrical engineer from Ambler, Pennsylvania.\nSeeking income and stability, Litz put $480,000 into Yieldstreet funds, he said. Three of those projects have defaulted, while seven developments are on watchlist, he said.\n\"At least half of this stuff is going under,\" Litz said. \"I'm 61, so there's no way I can really recover.\"\nUnder its new CEO, Caplan, Yieldstreet has decided to pivot away from a business model of mostly offering bespoke investments like the ones that cratered for its real estate customers.\nThis month, Yieldstreet said that it officially became a broker-dealer, allowing it to offer funds from outside asset managers including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group. The plan is to become a distribution platform where 70% of funds are from these established Wall Street giants, Caplan said this month.\nThe move is worlds away from the confidence that Yieldstreet co-founder Weisz had in the company's original model.\nIn the 2020 CNBC interview, Weisz said that he often reminded his staff that \"winter is coming\" and to prepare for turbulence.\nYieldstreet would protect its customers from losses because of the underlying collateral the firm was investing in: real buildings with tenants in sought-after locations all over the country, Weisz said.\n\"I'm not here to tell you that Milind and Michael are the world's smartest investors and there's never going to be something that goes wrong,\" Weisz said, referencing himself and his co-founder. \"We understand that when winter comes, there will be challenges, but we take comfort in knowing that there's underlying collateral.\"\n\"Anybody could put money out,\" Weisz said. \"It's about bringing it back home.\"\n— CNBC's Gabriel Cortes contributed to this report.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:27:56 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}
{"title": "How retail accounting could distort profitability as tariffs take effect", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/18/retail-earnings-how-accounting-could-change-profitability-amid-tariffs.html", "text": "As more tariffs take effect on goods imported into the U.S., a specific accounting method could have major implications for how American retailers calculate the impact.\nA tariff adds to the cost of an imported item when it's received and paid for when it crosses a border. While there's debate over who pays that tariff — the manufacturer, the retailer, the consumer or some combination — the hit will likely show up in retailers' bottom lines.\nBut a specific accounting practice, called retail inventory method accounting, or RIM, can make profitability appear stronger than it is in the short term.\n\"Retail inventory method accounting (RIM) is less responsive to initial product cost changes compared to cost accounting, and can initially overstate profitability,\" said Ali Furman, PwC U.S. consumer markets industry leader. \"This would normalize once tariffs stabilize, depending on how much of the cost retailers absorb.\"\nBecause RIM uses an average cost-to-retail price ratio across a broad group of items, rather than the actual cost of every item, like in cost accounting, RIM does not entirely capture the immediate impact of rising costs.\nNearly a quarter of U.S. retailers use the retail inventory method of accounting, according to PwC. Walmart, Target and Home Depot are among them. All three retailers report quarterly earnings this week, and their results may not fully show how tariffs have cut into their profitability so far.\nTake Walmart, the largest U.S. retailer, which will post fiscal second-quarter earnings Thursday.\nTD Cowen analyst Oliver Chen estimated about half of Walmart's quarter will include the impact of levies, as the company brought in inventory at different cost levels before and after new tariff rates took effect. That could temporarily distort gross margin profitability, Chen said.\nWalmart's accounting has in part informed its strategy in recent months as it navigates President Donald Trump's unpredictable tariff policy.\nA week after Trump's April 2 announcement of so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on a wide swath of trade partners, Walmart withdrew its guidance for operating income in its first fiscal quarter. However, the company maintained its annual forecast, citing in part the influence of RIM accounting.\nThen when it reported its fiscal first-quarter earnings in May, Walmart said it would mitigate higher costs as much as possible, but would likely have to increase some prices at the current tariff rates.\nIn response, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that Walmart should \"just eat\" the tariffs.\nDoing so could actually benefit a retailer's bottom line, at least initially, according to Furman.\n\"The more costs retailers absorb in retail accounting, the greater the risk of overstating profitability during periods of increasing costs, such as tariff increases,\" she said.\nWalmart management briefed Trump this spring about the impact its accounting method may have on results in a high-tariff environment, according to a person familiar with the discussion, who asked to remain unnamed while speaking about private conversations.\nStill, James Bowie, managing director in EY's technical accounting advisory group, warned \"all of the inventory costing methodologies will be affected in some ways.\"\nIt typically takes a large, non-fast fashion retailer using RIM roughly two to four quarters for cost volatility to settle and profitability to get closer to its true level, according to PwC. The method could make profitability look higher initially, then lower in a subsequent quarter, before it has time to stabilize.\n\"It's kind of like you've got a speed boat on the price,\" he said. \"I can turn pretty quickly, but I've got a cruise liner that is carrying all my average of my inventory. It takes a little longer for it to turn and so even though they might ultimately be able to go the same speed, it takes a little bit of time for that one turn to take place.\"\nWhile RIM is more likely to lead to a temporary overstating of profitability, it can also wind up understanding profits if tariffs are negotiated lower.\nBowie said if a retailer responds to lower tariff rates by cutting retail prices, under RIM accounting, \"it looks like my margin has eroded, but it's only because I now am waiting for the cost relationship to catch back up, so [it] might look like there's margin compression even in a period of decreasing tariffs.\"\nFurman added that PwC is seeing \"a clear disconnect\" for companies that use RIM accounting.\n\"Companies might be doing all the right things: navigating sourcing challenges, managing suppliers, and even mitigating tariffs,\" she said. \"But, those efforts often aren't reflected in the financials. That misalignment between operational execution and reporting for those using RIM is exacerbating the challenges retailers face.\"\nWhy use RIM?\nThe retail inventory method of accounting is an older method that was most useful for retailers when they had many items from a range of categories without an easy, or technological, way to track inventory.\n\"Inventory accounting methods existed before this thing called Excel,\" said Bowie. \"[A retailer] had an abacus and a dream trying to figure out what you're going to do.\"\nOver time, technology made it easy to use actual costs rather than averages, so cost accounting became more common.\nAs retailers grow and accounting methods become ingrained, it's difficult, though not impossible, to switch tactics. Macy's and Nordstrom recently made the change to cost accounting.\nPwC said it takes an average of two to three years to make the transition from one accounting method to another and can require millions of dollars and a restatement of previous years' financials to provide apples-to-apples comparisons. Still, the accounting firm said about half of retailers that use RIM have considered switching.\nA case study\nCNBC worked with PwC's Furman and Suni Shamapande, the firm's U.S. retail customer experience and operations leader, to develop a simplified example demonstrating the difference between RIM and weighted average cost accounting in how they affect gross profit margins.\nThe example demonstrates how RIM accounting can \"overstate\" true profitability at a moment in time when costs increase quickly.\nFor the purposes of this example, PwC and CNBC used weighted average cost accounting, which takes a SKU-level weight average and blends all costs together, regardless of purchase date. A SKU is a stock-keeping unit, which retailers use to track inventory of specific items.\nBase case: No tariffs\nThe base case, which does not include tariffs, uses three different T-shirts types from three different countries. Each type of T-shirt, or individual SKU, has a different cost and is sold to consumers at a different retail price. The retailer bought each type of T-shirt in different quantities, as did consumers.\nHere's how the math differs to start.\nThe gross profit margin for the items calculated using weighted average cost accounting is 46%. Using RIM, it's 53%.\nTariff case 1: Retailer's costs increase, all else remains the same\nIf the retailer's cost for each T-shirt goes up as a result of tariffs, but everything else — units bought, units sold and retail price — remains the same, gross margin falls if calculated using cost accounting and RIM. But it would still be higher under RIM than if the company used cost accounting.\nHere's the math for our simplified example:\nTariff case 2: Retailer raises prices to offset higher costs\nIf the retailer passes on the full dollar value of the tariff cost to the customer, and units bought and sold stay the same, gross margin improves under both accounting methods.\nIn our example, it goes to 36% in cost accounting and 47% with RIM.\nBoth gross margin percentages are lower than the base case, which assumes no tariffs, but the percentage change is smaller under RIM than under cost accounting.\nTariff case 3: Retailer raises prices and units bought and sold both fall\nHere's where it gets interesting, and likely more realistic, to reflect supply and demand choices a retailer and consumer would likely make as costs rise.\nIf the retailer passes on the full dollar value of tariffs to the customer and also sells fewer items to consumers at the higher retail price, RIM makes profit margins look temporarily rosier.\nGross margin in our example falls to 27% under cost accounting, but holds steady under RIM at 47% even though units sold have changed.\nHere's where you see how the ratio of cost of goods sold to selling price hasn't had time to adjust.\n— CNBC's Jodi Gralnick contributed to this report.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 19:38:31 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

Novo also announced that it has partnered with GoodRx to offer the same price for Ozempic and the weight-loss drug Wegovy at U.S. pharmacies. While the news may spark concerns that a price war is heating up in a battle for market share, we don't see this specific Ozempic development advancing that narrative. The main reason why is that the cash-pay market for GLP-1s to treat Type 2 diabetes is not as important as it is for their obesity counterparts. It all comes down to insurance coverage, which is much higher for these medications for diabetes than weight loss. Indeed, Lilly does not offer Type 2 diabetes treatment Mounjaro on its LillyDirect platform, while sister drug Zepbound for obesity is on there. Lilly executives were asked about this on the company's August earnings call, and the president of Lilly USA, Ilya Yuffa, had this to say: \"With Mounjaro, we have significant coverage. So, over 90% coverage in both commercial as well as [Medicare] Part D. And so, we're not sure if [adding Mounjaro to LillyDirect] necessarily provides additional avenue. With Zepbound, we see significant growth because we do have coverage gaps in commercial. And obviously, we also have coverage gaps without having the ability to cover anti-obesity medications in Part D. So, we see this as an opportunity for us to meet that need. For what it's worth, we still like where Lilly sits in the obesity side of the GLP-1 market. Back in February, Eli Lilly announced that self-pay patients could get Zepbound single dose vials for $499 per month through its LillyDirect platform. That's on par with the price for Wegovy on NovoCare. Since head-to-head studies have found Lilly's Zepbound to be superior to Novo Nordisk's Wegovy on weight loss, patients should continue to prefer Lilly's GLP-1s. We initially downgraded our rating on Eli Lilly after its earnings a few weeks ago, partly due to concerns about a potential price war. However, we reversed course and upgraded the stock back to a buy-equivalent 1 following signs of confidence driven by significant insider buying activity. Nuclear win : Alphabet's Google and the nuclear energy company Kairos Power announced on Monday the deployment of an advanced nuclear plant to the grid. Per the agreement, a reactor operated by Kairos Power will deliver up to 50 megawatts of reliable, 24/7 energy to the Tennessee Valley Authority electric grid that powers Google data centers in Tennessee and Alabama. The electricity will come from Kairos' Hermes 2 plant, which is scheduled to begin operations in 2030. The collaboration underscores how hyperscalers are creating new partnerships with nuclear energy providers to secure, around-the-clock power supply toward the end of the decade. Unlike gas-fired electricity, nuclear power offers tech giants like Alphabet a way to run their data centers on clean energy while advancing their decarbonization goals. While Club name GE Vernova is probably best known for its heavy-duty gas turbines , the power generation company also makes small modular reactors that have gained in popularity, so nuclear developments are important to follow closely. Up next: Palo Alto Networks reports after the closing bell , the first of three Club stocks with earnings this week. Before the opening bell on Tuesday, we'll see earnings from Club name Home Depot , Medtronic , and Viking Holdings . On the data side, we'll see July housing starts and building permits, but we'll take are cue on the housing sector from what Home Depot management says on the earnings call.

No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE,\" Trump added in the post, mirroring demands by the Kremlin for recognition of its annexation of Crimea and for Ukraine to be excluded from the NATO alliance.\nRussia seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 and backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, a move that was widely condemned by the international community. Moscow then launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nTrump's comments come ahead of an Aug. 18 meeting in Washington with Zelenskyy and a number of European leaders.\nThe gathering follows Trump's Aug. 15 talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska, which lasted three hours but did not yield a ceasefire agreement, though the U.S. President described the talks as \"productive.\"\nTrump reportedly told Zelenskyy after the meeting with Putin that Moscow had offered to freeze most of the front lines in Ukraine in exchange for Kyiv withdrawing from the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.\nZelenskyy had rejected the proposal ahead of the summit, saying this would deprive Ukraine of key defensive positions and allow Moscow to launch further offensives into Ukraine. Kyiv currently holds about one quarter of Donetsk, including its so-called \"fortress belt\" of cities, which has been its main fortified defensive line since 2014.\nIn an Aug. 12 report, Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War said \"Putin's reported proposal reportedly demands that Ukraine concede this critical defensive position, which Russian forces currently have no means of rapidly enveloping or penetrating, apparently in exchange for nothing.\"\nIn a Fox News interview after the meeting with Putin, Trump urged Zelenskyy to strike a deal to end the war in Ukraine. \"Look, Russia is a very big power, and [Ukraine is] not. They're great soldiers,\" he said.\nIn 2024, then-U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said to the United Nations: \"If Russia stops fighting, the war ends. If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ends.\"\nISW also highlighted in a separate report on Aug. 17 that Russia's demands to address the \"root causes\" of the war are massive NATO concessions that would jeopardize the alliance's integrity, as well as the security of Europe and the U.S.\nMoscow has said any peace agreement must eliminate the \"root causes\" of the war, a term that includes NATO's eastward expansion, and the alleged discrimination against Russian speakers in Ukraine.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 04:27:54 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

But it noted investment in assembly plants abroad was also \"growing rapidly.\"\nThe spending plans come as Chinese automakers face intense competition at home and higher tariffs on exports. Boosting investments abroad can help Chinese businesses win foreign governments' support for market expansion.\n\"Growing regulatory pushback in host markets like the EU is raising barriers to entry and will push more Chinese companies to establish local manufacturing operations,\" the Rhodium report said.\nThe Chinese electric car industry's domestic investment in manufacturing tumbled sharply to $15 billion in 2024 from $41 billion in 2023 — after peaking at over $90 billion in 2022 in announced projects, according to Rhodium data.\nWhile overseas investment has remained far lower, it \"narrowly surpassed\" domestic levels in 2024 for the first time, the report said, without sharing an exact figure.\nMore deals in the pipeline\nAutomotive was the second-most active sector for Chinese outbound investment in the second quarter this year, according to a separate Rhodium study released late July. The materials and metals sector ranked first.\n\"We recorded higher than usual activity by EV parts manufacturers, with eight transactions exceeding $100 million,\" the July report said. \"The largest among them was led by GEM, a Chinese battery materials manufacturer, which committed $293 million to expand its ternary precursors facility in Indonesia.\"\nSeveral overseas factory projects announced in recent years have also begun operations.\nGreat Wall Motor announced over the weekend it opened its first factory in Brazil on Friday local time.

In currencies, the U.S. dollar surrendered 0.18% against the rupee.\nIn an extensive Independence Day speech on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a concerted push for self-reliance and proposed a spate of financial reforms. New Delhi now plans a two-rate structure of 5% and 18% under wide-spanning changes to the goods and services tax (GST) regime, and plans to abolish the previous 12% and 28% levies imposed on some items, Reuters cited a government official as saying on Friday. The news was also reported by local media.\n\"The reforms aim to simplify compliance, lower tax rates, and modernise the GST framework to make it more growth-oriented. Industry executives expect measures such as rationalising rates into two slabs, easing the tax burden on micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), cutting levies on essential goods, and using technology-driven processes like pre-filled returns and faster refunds to encourage investment,\" the India Brand Equity Foundation said, adding that manufacturing, logistics, housing and consumer goods could stand to gain.\nIndia's autos industry could also emerge as one of the beneficiaries of the new tax policies after a sluggish stretch in recent months. Sales of India's passenger vehicles, which include cars, added 4.2% percent in the 2024 calendar year, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers said in January – the slowest growth pace in four years, according to Reuters.\nAuto sector stocks saw increases during the Monday session, as Maruti Suzuki India adding 8.75%, while Hyundai Motor India rose by 8.15%.\n\"I'm certainly positive about the announcement, and the autos sector being a relative laggard in recent quarters, so not surprising to see that sector bounce back quite strongly,\" James Thom, senior investment director on the Asian equities team at Aberdeen, told CNBC's \"Inside India on Monday.\"\nModi's tax overhaul could shore up India's economy, which the Reserve Bank of India sees growing 6.5% in the 2025-2026 fiscal year, at a time of deep geopolitical uncertainty stoked by Washington's sweeping so-called \"reciprocal tariffs.\" New Delhi in particular has fallen in the crosshairs of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration over its ongoing purchases of Russian crude, with Washington imposing an additional 25% levy on Indian imports — bringing total duties to 50% — due to take effect at the end of this month.\n\"India is a domestic consumption story. Exports is a relatively small contributor. So this [tax overhaul] could more than offset that impact of tariffs,\" Aberdeen's Thom said.\n\"From a fundamental standpoint, absolutely, I think the changes to the GST regime will be supportive near-term for consumption as it comes through later in the year. And consumption has been weak in India for quite some time now, so this is a real sort of boost to the economy, if you like, given India's economy is so dependent on domestic consumption.\"\nDomestic intake is \"one of the most compelling indicators investors are closely monitoring,\" and the \"largest driver of economic growth in India,\" with a 61.4% GDP contribution in the 2024-25 fiscal year, Deloitte said in an August report.\n\"Notably, urban consumption and a shift in spending preferences toward luxury goods are emerging as key pillars of this momentum,\" it said.\nIndia Ratings & Research meanwhile forecast India's private final consumption rate in the fiscal year to the end of March 2026 will expand by an annual 6.9%, outpacing a broader 6.3% GDP growth outlook over the period, on the back of low real wage increases, declines in household savings and a boost to personal loans.\n\"A sharp decline in inflation has improved the prospects for stable consumption growth in FY26,\" it added.

It is the first utility in the U.S. to sign a power purchase agreement with an advanced reactor like Hermes 2, according to the companies.\nHermes 2 is the first deployment under an agreement that Google and Kairos signed last year to launch the startup's nuclear technology at a commercial scale. The reactor's output is the equivalent of the consumption of about 36,000 homes. The electricity will help power Google's data centers in Montgomery County, Tennessee, and Jackson County, Alabama.\nGoogle, Kairos and TVA said their collaboration will move the U.S. a step closer to deploying advanced nuclear reactors by making sure consumers are not on the hook for the cost of building the plant.\nKairos and Google will bear the financial risk associated with building the first-of-a-kind project, the companies said. TVA, meanwhile, is providing the revenue stream the plant will need to operate through the power purchase agreement.\n\"We think this solves the problem of making sure that consumers don't carry that first-of-a-kind cost and risk,\" TVA CEO Don Moul told CNBC. \"But it also allows innovators like Kairos Power and thought leaders like Google to bring this to market.\"\nHermes 2 is expected to start operating at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in 2030. Kairos received a construction permit for the reactor from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in November 2024. It will need to apply for an operating license with the NRC before the plant can start operations.\nTVA declined to disclose how much it will pay for electricity from Hermes 2 when asked by CNBC. Kairos declined to disclose the estimated cost of the plant.\nBuilding nuclear again\nThe U.S. has basically stopped building nuclear plants due to the huge cost overruns and delays that plague the industry. The last two reactors built in the U.S. at Plant Vogtle in Georgia cost $18 billion more than expected and started operations seven years behind schedule in 2023 and 2024. The project's problems contributed to the bankruptcy of industry stalwart Westinghouse.\nStartups like Kairos believe their smaller plants will prove to be faster and more affordable to build than large reactors like those at Vogtle, helping to usher in a new era of nuclear construction in the U.S. Despite these promises, utilities have been reluctant to commit to small advanced reactors over concerns about the initial price tag.\nTechnology companies like Google, meanwhile, are investing in advanced nuclear because they want reliable, carbon-free power to meet the demand from artificial intelligence while adhering to their environmental goals. Google has placed orders with Kairos for reactors totaling 500 megawatts of power that are targeted to come online through 2035.\n\"We specifically want to help commercialize,\" Amanda Peterson Corio, Google's global head of data center energy, told CNBC. \"We want to see how can we take this from something small to something bigger that we can deploy at scale. That's really what the Hermes 2 project is doing.\"\nOne of Kairos' goals with Hermes 2 is to create a standardized reactor design which will help cut the cost of future deployments, CEO Mike Laufer told CNBC. Kairos will also develop the supply and manufacturing infrastructure needed to launch at scale through the construction of Hermes 2, he said.\n\"We'd be ready to deploy multiple reactors in series at the same sites in a very cost-efficient way to deliver that power at affordable rates in the not too distant future,\" Laufer said. Kairos and Google are exploring options on where future plants will be deployed, he said.\nOak Ridge, TVA nuke hub\nKairos' technology is different than the reactors currently operating in the U.S. Its reactor design uses liquid salt as the coolant rather than light water, which allows the plant to operate at near atmospheric pressure. This means Kairos can use thinner and less expensive materials because the reactor is not under high pressure. Operating at low pressure also has safety advantages.\nThe 50-megawatt plant is also much smaller than the reactors in the current U.S. fleet that average 1,000 megawatts in output, which is enough to power an entire city. The Kairos reactor will increase its output to 75 megawatts when it launches on a commercial scale, Laufer said.\nHermes 2 will be deployed near Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which has a long history in nuclear science dating back to the Manhattan Project during World War II. TVA was established by Congress during the Great Depression as a public corporation to electrify the region. The utility remains owned by the federal government.\n\"This kind of sets the stage for east Tennessee to really be what we see as a regional hub for innovation for nuclear construction and operation, and that's going to be valuable for the nation as well,\" Laufer said.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:50:39 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

Seven remote-controlled gantry cranes are still at work, stacking containers in the ship’s bays. Some 11,000 containers pass through this port each day, making it Britain’s primary conduit to the arteries of global trade. The Ruby’s next call is Gran Canaria—then, the long run down the coast of Africa. Watching the scene, Adam Gibson, the lone police officer at the port whose job is finding stolen cars, sounds rueful: “There’s no way in hell I can search even a small fraction of them. We could be standing here now and there could be three or four boxes of stolen cars just there in those stacks. They could be manifested as teddy bears.”\nWithout many people noticing Britain has become a leading exporter of stolen goods. In the past decade the number of vehicles stolen in the country has risen by 75%. Most end up on container ships; the top destination is west Africa. More recently London has become known as the “phone-snatching capital of Europe”. If the victims manage to track their devices, the goods are most likely to turn up in China. British farmers are plagued by raiding gangs. Their tractors and GPS kits usually head east, to Russia or eastern Europe.\nFor centuries criminals have nicked valuable products and smuggled them across borders, beyond the reach of the law. Britain today shows how this model has evolved in new and alarming ways. Encrypted communications have enabled criminal gangs to operate and co-operate more freely than ever before, and establish global supply chains. As countries in Africa and Asia have become richer, demand for the products common on the streets of the rich world is growing. This combination has spawned a flourishing criminal enterprise. Call it Grand Theft Global Inc.\nBritain is a “perfect place” for this business, says Elijah Glantz of RUSI, a think-tank, because of its saturated consumer market and weak export controls. There are lots of expensive cars and phones to steal, and it is easy to get them away. There is also almost no deterrent: Britain’s police solve only 5% of crimes (and 2% of vehicle thefts). In continental Europe and America such criminal enterprise is growing, too, though America has stronger scrutiny of exports due to fear of fraud and tax evasion. Canada has been hit by a rash of vanishing vehicles. But for now, Britain has the dubious title of world leader. “The UK sees itself as a recipient of criminality, not an exporter,” says Mr Glantz.\nCars show how the model has evolved. Like other rich countries, Britain experienced a sharp drop in vehicle crime in the 1990s, thanks to immobilisers and other technology. In 2013 Britain had only 2.7 thefts for every 1,000 privately owned cars, according to RUSI. Now it is 4.4. Thefts have risen from 90,000 in 2020 to 130,000 last year. That has fed into a 45% real-terms rise in the cost of car insurance (in the EU it has risen only in line with inflation). Vehicle crime is “my number-one issue”, says Dan Tomlinson, the Labour MP for Chipping Barnet, a leafy north London suburb.\nThe method is typically as follows. To defeat sophisticated security systems, thieves use specialised equipment. Once in, they mask the car with fake number plates and use jammers to override GPS tracking. Then they move it, usually across county lines (collaboration between police forces is often poor), where it will be sold to a group that handles logistics. Sometimes the car is hidden in a shipment of other goods, under a false manifest. More often, the gang employs a third group to give the car a “new identity”—not only paperwork but markers including the vehicle identification number, a unique code stamped on the chassis.\nUncontained\nThis whole process—from theft to container—often takes less than a day. That is partly because Grand Theft Global Inc is not one outfit but a sophisticated supply chain. It is also lucrative. Consider a Toyota Hilux, which when new costs around £40,000 ($54,000). The group that steals one might be paid £1,500 for a night’s work. If another gets it to west Africa, where Hiluxes are sought after, they can sell it for more than it fetches in Britain.\nIn his large inspection tent at Felixstowe, Mr Gibson provides a guided tour. The cars are all shiny SUVs, though most have been dented by ratchet straps (the thieves don’t mind because that can be fixed cheaply at the other end). Shelves are piled with engines, batteries and sundry parts from cars taken to a “chop shop”, a freelance operator who will break them up without asking questions. Some are literally sawn into thirds. Gangs have also begun to target rental companies using fake documents. On the day your correspondent visits, Mr Gibson opens a container, following a tip-off. Inside is a Porsche 911 Carrera S that was rented in Germany two weeks ago: somehow it has found its way into a box in Britain, bound for Africa.\nBetween 2021 and 2024 almost four in ten stolen cars intercepted at Britain’s ports were heading for the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service (NaVCIS). The DRC seems to be acting as an entry point to a wider African market. One in five was heading for the United Arab Emirates. From there gangs reach customers across the Gulf. Most thefts in Canada follow the same two routes. Buyers largely want SUVs that can handle poor roads. Increasingly, however, the elite also want sports cars, which often stick out on the streets of Kinshasa (not least because many are right-hand-drive). Sometimes, says Mr Gibson, thieves seem to work to an “order”.\nGrand Theft Global Inc works in a similar way for phones. Some 70,000 phones were stolen in London last year, a rise of more than a third on the year before. Britain accounts for 40% of the stolen phones in Europe. As with cars, low-level thieves sell them on to a fence (a thief might get £100-200 for one that is unlocked, or £30-60 for one that isn’t). Again, third-party services have popped up, such as shops that specialise in overcoming security features. Large batches of phones are then wrapped in tinfoil to prevent tracking, and exported, often via container ships.\nRemarkably, investigations have found that most end up in one place: Huaqiangbei market in Shenzhen. Demand in China for second-hand phones is huge; those that cannot be unlocked are broken apart and rebuilt. And there is no better place to do that than Huaqiangbei, the world’s largest electronics market. Because Shenzhen is where many of the phones were made in the first place, there is a ready supply of skilled workers. According to a study by Zituo Wang of the University of Southern California, the primary source of stolen phones identified in China is Britain. British farms, meanwhile, have been targeted since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to sanctions on legal trade. In 2023 the value of claims for stolen GPS kits rose by 137%.\nToday London, tomorrow the world\nIt may be that Grand Theft Global Inc is thriving in Britain because the country has particular vulnerabilities. Or perhaps criminals there have just been quicker to pick up on them. London is, after all, often a city where innovative methods in criminality first emerge. There is little reason to think this one will not be exported, too.\nTo see why, consider four factors. First is the way containerised shipping works. Around the world, border agencies overwhelmingly focus on imports, hunting for people and drugs. In many countries, exports are hardly checked at all. Anyone can book a container. The way ships are filled—tiers of “freight forwarders” buy batches of containers and sell them on—makes auditing hard. Only a tiny proportion of containers will ever be opened up, let alone X-rayed; typically just when authorities receive a tip-off. For each container Mr Gibson holds up and searches, the police must pay the port a fee of £200.\nSecond, the ability to covertly communicate, sell goods and transfer money online has tipped the scales in favour of criminal groups. Until recently, even highly professional outfits found it hard to do this (case files abound with stories of drug kingpins struggling to make themselves understood on clunky satellite phones). Now someone who wants a Porsche in Kinshasa can be linked seamlessly, via several intermediaries, with someone prepared to steal one in Kent. “These groups are just doing business in a very modern way,“ says Ruggero Scaturro of the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime, a think-tank. In Britain Grand Theft Global Inc is seen as so low-risk that many drug gangs are shifting into it.\nThat links to the third factor: supply and demand. As cars and phones have become more sophisticated, they have become more expensive in relation to incomes. That alone has made stealing them more attractive. But it has also fuelled a particular type of demand: most middle-class consumers in China cannot afford a new iPhone. Many Africans want better vehicles, but the used-car market remains dominant, legal dealerships scarce, and premium cars have not yet reached the economies of scale that bring costs down. These gaps will continue. As the market for stolen goods becomes more efficient, prices will fall. Once a particular model is sold, there will be demand for parts.\nFourth, police forces largely remain in the dust. NaVCIS has enjoyed some success, intercepting 550 cars in the past year. But that is a small fraction of what gets through. Mr Gibson is one of three officers on the whole south coast. Britain’s police have yet to catch any high-ups in the business. European forces do not even have dedicated investigation teams. Across the rich world, police resources tend to be directed towards “higher harm” offences.\nThe gains to trade\nIn some ways the success of Grand Theft Global Inc is a story of globalisation. It uses the infrastructure of global commerce, designed for frictionless trade. Identifying stolen goods amid so many containers is like finding “needles in haystacks”, says Tim Morris of the Association of British Ports. Globalisation created the supply chain that allows each iPhone—assembled from nearly 3,000 components—to reach the hands of a consumer. The same forces inverted see that phone yanked out of it, re-exported and broken apart again.\nYet Grand Theft Global Inc can also thrive in a world that is increasingly fragmented. Tariffs make stolen goods only more competitive. Sanctions, like those on Russia, boost demand for criminal activity. When countries are less co-operative, it is easier to ship goods to places from where they are unlikely to be recovered.\nIndeed, while Grand Theft Global Inc hurts the rich world’s consumers, the countries benefiting from the trade have little incentive to curb it. Unlike those in Europe, authorities in China do not make it hard to sell stolen phones. The country is not part of the Central Equipment Identity Register, a global database that networks use to block stolen devices. “China really doesn’t care about this problem,” says Mr Wang. Even if African countries wanted to clamp down, says Mr Glantz, they would struggle. “Enforcement capability in Cameroon or the Congo is almost none.”\nIn theory sending goods halfway round the world is an added cost. But the way the shipping industry works, a container is paid for only when it reaches its destination. If it is intercepted, the cost is borne by the freight forwarder. Extra distance can also reduce the willingness of insurers to pursue recovery. One officer says French police have shown her videos of stacks of stolen cars in Senegal that cannot be repatriated. Once the MSC Ruby leaves port, its contents are as good as gone. ■\nCars, phones, tractors: how high-end products are increasingly stolen to serve distant markets\n|Felixstowe\nThe MSC Ruby is almost ready to leave Felixstowe.

In Britain Grand Theft Global Inc is seen as so low-risk that many drug gangs are shifting into it.\nThat links to the third factor: supply and demand. As cars and phones have become more sophisticated, they have become more expensive in relation to incomes. That alone has made stealing them more attractive. But it has also fuelled a particular type of demand: most middle-class consumers in China cannot afford a new iPhone. Many Africans want better vehicles, but the used-car market remains dominant, legal dealerships scarce, and premium cars have not yet reached the economies of scale that bring costs down. These gaps will continue. As the market for stolen goods becomes more efficient, prices will fall. Once a particular model is sold, there will be demand for parts.\nFourth, police forces largely remain in the dust. NaVCIS has enjoyed some success, intercepting 550 cars in the past year. But that is a small fraction of what gets through. Mr Gibson is one of three officers on the whole south coast. Britain’s police have yet to catch any high-ups in the business. European forces do not even have dedicated investigation teams. Across the rich world, police resources tend to be directed towards “higher harm” offences.\nThe gains to trade\nIn some ways the success of Grand Theft Global Inc is a story of globalisation. It uses the infrastructure of global commerce, designed for frictionless trade. Identifying stolen goods amid so many containers is like finding “needles in haystacks”, says Tim Morris of the Association of British Ports. Globalisation created the supply chain that allows each iPhone—assembled from nearly 3,000 components—to reach the hands of a consumer. The same forces inverted see that phone yanked out of it, re-exported and broken apart again.\nYet Grand Theft Global Inc can also thrive in a world that is increasingly fragmented. Tariffs make stolen goods only more competitive. Sanctions, like those on Russia, boost demand for criminal activity. When countries are less co-operative, it is easier to ship goods to places from where they are unlikely to be recovered.\nIndeed, while Grand Theft Global Inc hurts the rich world’s consumers, the countries benefiting from the trade have little incentive to curb it. Unlike those in Europe, authorities in China do not make it hard to sell stolen phones. The country is not part of the Central Equipment Identity Register, a global database that networks use to block stolen devices. “China really doesn’t care about this problem,” says Mr Wang. Even if African countries wanted to clamp down, says Mr Glantz, they would struggle. “Enforcement capability in Cameroon or the Congo is almost none.”\nIn theory sending goods halfway round the world is an added cost. But the way the shipping industry works, a container is paid for only when it reaches its destination. If it is intercepted, the cost is borne by the freight forwarder. Extra distance can also reduce the willingness of insurers to pursue recovery. One officer says French police have shown her videos of stacks of stolen cars in Senegal that cannot be repatriated. Once the MSC Ruby leaves port, its contents are as good as gone. ■\nCars, phones, tractors: how high-end products are increasingly stolen to serve distant markets\n|Felixstowe\nThe MSC Ruby is almost ready to leave Felixstowe. Seven remote-controlled gantry cranes are still at work, stacking containers in the ship’s bays. Some 11,000 containers pass through this port each day, making it Britain’s primary conduit to the arteries of global trade. The Ruby’s next call is Gran Canaria—then, the long run down the coast of Africa. Watching the scene, Adam Gibson, the lone police officer at the port whose job is finding stolen cars, sounds rueful: “There’s no way in hell I can search even a small fraction of them. We could be standing here now and there could be three or four boxes of stolen cars just there in those stacks. They could be manifested as teddy bears.”\nWithout many people noticing Britain has become a leading exporter of stolen goods. In the past decade the number of vehicles stolen in the country has risen by 75%. Most end up on container ships; the top destination is west Africa. More recently London has become known as the “phone-snatching capital of Europe”. If the victims manage to track their devices, the goods are most likely to turn up in China. British farmers are plagued by raiding gangs. Their tractors and GPS kits usually head east, to Russia or eastern Europe.\nFor centuries criminals have nicked valuable products and smuggled them across borders, beyond the reach of the law. Britain today shows how this model has evolved in new and alarming ways. Encrypted communications have enabled criminal gangs to operate and co-operate more freely than ever before, and establish global supply chains. As countries in Africa and Asia have become richer, demand for the products common on the streets of the rich world is growing. This combination has spawned a flourishing criminal enterprise. Call it Grand Theft Global Inc.\nBritain is a “perfect place” for this business, says Elijah Glantz of RUSI, a think-tank, because of its saturated consumer market and weak export controls. There are lots of expensive cars and phones to steal, and it is easy to get them away. There is also almost no deterrent: Britain’s police solve only 5% of crimes (and 2% of vehicle thefts). In continental Europe and America such criminal enterprise is growing, too, though America has stronger scrutiny of exports due to fear of fraud and tax evasion. Canada has been hit by a rash of vanishing vehicles. But for now, Britain has the dubious title of world leader. “The UK sees itself as a recipient of criminality, not an exporter,” says Mr Glantz.\nCars show how the model has evolved. Like other rich countries, Britain experienced a sharp drop in vehicle crime in the 1990s, thanks to immobilisers and other technology. In 2013 Britain had only 2.7 thefts for every 1,000 privately owned cars, according to RUSI. Now it is 4.4. Thefts have risen from 90,000 in 2020 to 130,000 last year. That has fed into a 45% real-terms rise in the cost of car insurance (in the EU it has risen only in line with inflation). Vehicle crime is “my number-one issue”, says Dan Tomlinson, the Labour MP for Chipping Barnet, a leafy north London suburb.\nThe method is typically as follows. To defeat sophisticated security systems, thieves use specialised equipment. Once in, they mask the car with fake number plates and use jammers to override GPS tracking. Then they move it, usually across county lines (collaboration between police forces is often poor), where it will be sold to a group that handles logistics. Sometimes the car is hidden in a shipment of other goods, under a false manifest. More often, the gang employs a third group to give the car a “new identity”—not only paperwork but markers including the vehicle identification number, a unique code stamped on the chassis.\nUncontained\nThis whole process—from theft to container—often takes less than a day. That is partly because Grand Theft Global Inc is not one outfit but a sophisticated supply chain. It is also lucrative. Consider a Toyota Hilux, which when new costs around £40,000 ($54,000). The group that steals one might be paid £1,500 for a night’s work. If another gets it to west Africa, where Hiluxes are sought after, they can sell it for more than it fetches in Britain.\nIn his large inspection tent at Felixstowe, Mr Gibson provides a guided tour. The cars are all shiny SUVs, though most have been dented by ratchet straps (the thieves don’t mind because that can be fixed cheaply at the other end). Shelves are piled with engines, batteries and sundry parts from cars taken to a “chop shop”, a freelance operator who will break them up without asking questions. Some are literally sawn into thirds. Gangs have also begun to target rental companies using fake documents. On the day your correspondent visits, Mr Gibson opens a container, following a tip-off. Inside is a Porsche 911 Carrera S that was rented in Germany two weeks ago: somehow it has found its way into a box in Britain, bound for Africa.\nBetween 2021 and 2024 almost four in ten stolen cars intercepted at Britain’s ports were heading for the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service (NaVCIS). The DRC seems to be acting as an entry point to a wider African market. One in five was heading for the United Arab Emirates. From there gangs reach customers across the Gulf. Most thefts in Canada follow the same two routes. Buyers largely want SUVs that can handle poor roads. Increasingly, however, the elite also want sports cars, which often stick out on the streets of Kinshasa (not least because many are right-hand-drive). Sometimes, says Mr Gibson, thieves seem to work to an “order”.\nGrand Theft Global Inc works in a similar way for phones. Some 70,000 phones were stolen in London last year, a rise of more than a third on the year before. Britain accounts for 40% of the stolen phones in Europe. As with cars, low-level thieves sell them on to a fence (a thief might get £100-200 for one that is unlocked, or £30-60 for one that isn’t). Again, third-party services have popped up, such as shops that specialise in overcoming security features. Large batches of phones are then wrapped in tinfoil to prevent tracking, and exported, often via container ships.\nRemarkably, investigations have found that most end up in one place: Huaqiangbei market in Shenzhen. Demand in China for second-hand phones is huge; those that cannot be unlocked are broken apart and rebuilt. And there is no better place to do that than Huaqiangbei, the world’s largest electronics market. Because Shenzhen is where many of the phones were made in the first place, there is a ready supply of skilled workers. According to a study by Zituo Wang of the University of Southern California, the primary source of stolen phones identified in China is Britain. British farms, meanwhile, have been targeted since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to sanctions on legal trade. In 2023 the value of claims for stolen GPS kits rose by 137%.\nToday London, tomorrow the world\nIt may be that Grand Theft Global Inc is thriving in Britain because the country has particular vulnerabilities. Or perhaps criminals there have just been quicker to pick up on them. London is, after all, often a city where innovative methods in criminality first emerge. There is little reason to think this one will not be exported, too.\nTo see why, consider four factors. First is the way containerised shipping works. Around the world, border agencies overwhelmingly focus on imports, hunting for people and drugs. In many countries, exports are hardly checked at all. Anyone can book a container. The way ships are filled—tiers of “freight forwarders” buy batches of containers and sell them on—makes auditing hard. Only a tiny proportion of containers will ever be opened up, let alone X-rayed; typically just when authorities receive a tip-off. For each container Mr Gibson holds up and searches, the police must pay the port a fee of £200.\nSecond, the ability to covertly communicate, sell goods and transfer money online has tipped the scales in favour of criminal groups. Until recently, even highly professional outfits found it hard to do this (case files abound with stories of drug kingpins struggling to make themselves understood on clunky satellite phones). Now someone who wants a Porsche in Kinshasa can be linked seamlessly, via several intermediaries, with someone prepared to steal one in Kent. “These groups are just doing business in a very modern way,“ says Ruggero Scaturro of the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime, a think-tank.

The second was one he theorised: the terrestrial impact 65m years ago of an asteroid sufficiently powerful to drive the dinosaurs to extinction. It may be for the asteroid theory—developed alongside his son and widely accepted after his death—that Alvarez is best remembered, rather than his groundbreaking contributions to the Manhattan Project.\nExplore more\nThis article appeared in the Culture section of the print edition under the headline “On the case”\nCulture\nAugust 16th 2025- The largest dig in a lifetime is under way in Pompeii\n- Bombs, dinosaurs and UFOs: Luis Walter Alvarez’s eclectic career\n- Private chefs are spilling the culinary secrets of the super-rich\n- The four years when old New York died and a new one was born\n- What’s your preferred playback speed: 1x, 1.5x or 2x?\n- Thought John Proctor was one of the good guys?

The two skeletons, male and female, were clearly physically close when they died: she on a bed, he on the floor. Archaeology offers other hints. She seems to have been richer (or at least was carrying gold); they spent their last hours together (debris trapped them in the room); those hours were terrible (he, his injuries show, died first). Archaeology offers one final clue: their ages. She was in her 30s or 40s; he in his teens or early 20s. Perhaps they were lovers, or mother and child, or total strangers. Even at the distance of 2,000 years you find yourself hoping she did not watch her own son die.\nWelcome to Pompeii. This is the ancient city both as you have seen it before—graffiti, frescoes, tiles, toilets and some highly enviable terrazzo—and as you have never seen it before. The largest dig in 70 years is under way: 3,200 square metres have been uncovered and innumerable tonnes of soil, rubble and pumice have been moved. In them are, so far, three houses, a bathhouse, a fresco that looks so like a pizza that archaeologists call it the “not-pizza” fresco, five human skeletons and, this being Pompeii, lots of phalluses.\nThe dig feels faintly surprising, less for what is being found (little has been able to surprise archaeologists since Pompeii’s infamous god-having-sex-with-a-goat statue was unearthed in 1752) than that there is anything left to be found at all. Pompeii feels so familiar: it has appeared in films (“POMPEII” in 2014) and fiction (Robert Harris’s “POMPEII”) and non-fiction (Mary Beard’s—guess what—“POMPEII”).\nIn the three-odd centuries since excavations began, it has been used—and, critics say, abused—by almost every generation. It has been used as a stone quarry (nice stones) and a classical one (nice statues). It has been held up as a parable of sexual liberty (its frescoes); sexual immorality (that goat) and debauchery (ditto). It has been seen as a paradigm of civilisation (its plumbing) and barbarism (its slavery).\nEvery generation has offered a reaction: Christians tutted at it; Mussolini had dinner in it; Professor Beard metaphorically winked at it. It is often called a “lost city” but few cities have had such exposure per square metre. Its art is found on fridge magnets and its mosaics made into doormats. The city has been recast as a souvenir. So much of Pompeii is known that it is easy to forget how much is not known: one-third of Pompeii is still unexcavated.\nThat is obvious once you look closely. Walk through the popular bits of Pompeii—past the theatre, amphitheatre and brothel—and keep going and you will find yourself in quieter streets with fewer people and more pigeons. There are shopfronts here too, but their windows open onto a wall of earth: nothing seems to be behind them. These are the undug streets.\nBut, after an injection of EU cash, archaeologists started digging in 2023. The dig is “complicated”, says Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the director of the site and author of “The Buried City”, a recent book. If you were to add an archaeologist to your novel, you would add Dr Zuchtriegel: German, handsome, he is fluent in three languages and mildly forbidding in all of them. (To cheer himself up, he reads the New Testament in ancient Greek.) Ask him his feelings on uncovering this stuff and he says “nothing”: you are just “so concentrated”. The epigraph of his book comes from Herman Melville’s diary: “Pompeii like any other town. Same old humanity. All the same whether one be dead or alive.”\nTo call this a “dig” is to underplay the speed of it. Pompeii offers some of the finest archaeology in the world; it also offers some of the fastest. When Vesuvius erupted in 79AD, sending a cloud of ash 32km into the sky and surprising the locals—who not only did not know that Vesuvius was a volcano, but had no word for “volcano”—what fell on Pompeii was not lava but pumice stones, so light that locals, as Pliny the Younger, a Roman writer watching from a nearby villa noted, “tied pillows over their heads…for protection”.\nThe stones kept falling at a rate of 15cm an hour. In three hours, they reached people’s knees; in six, the height of a toddler. Most people fled—perhaps 90% escaped. Those who sheltered and stayed became, like the skeletons in the house, trapped. Their room, says Sophie Hay, an archaeologist, “became their tomb”. Walls started to collapse under the weight (one killed the young man). Then the volcanic cloud collapsed and a wave of superheated pumice, gas and ash raced, at speeds of 100kph and temperatures of over 200°C, down the slope. In Pompeii, people suffocated. In Herculaneum, people’s brains boiled.\nIt is hard to imagine a more appalling end—or, for archaeologists, a better one. The grains of pumice beneath were so light and dry that they protected all they fell on; so easy to remove that archaeologists, says Dr Hay, call it “Amazon packaging material”. You less excavate Pompeii than unbox it, brushing grey, frozen-foam crumbs of pumice from a fresco here and shovelling it out of a swimming pool there. In days columns start to emerge, inverse Excaliburs, from a slowly sinking lake of grey.\nThe problem with Pompeii is not getting stuff out: it is keeping it upright once you have. The same pumice-pyroclastic one-two that caught bodies as if in freeze-frame—this one clawing at a throat, or that little boy writhing—caught buildings in the same way. A shattered column or wall mid-fall can be wholly held up by pumice. Take it away and, like a game of giant Jenga, the whole thing might fall. A cat’s cradle of scaffolding winds its way around the walls. Dr Zuchtriegel likens digging to performing “a complicated operation”.\nIt has been worth it, as what has been found is breathtaking. That is partly because, like so much else in Pompeii, it is untouched by time and partly because, like very little else in Pompeii, it is untouched by archaeologists. Pompeii’s relics have suffered as much from enthusiasts as eruptions. The Bourbons plundered Pompeii (you can still see the holes, cut as if by giant mice, in the walls). Napoleon’s sister, Caroline, planned, with Napoleonic efficiency, to uncover it all in three years. Everyone has stolen from it.\nThe new excavations, by contrast, are pristine. A bathhouse has such perfect curved steps on its plunge pool you could imagine slipping into it today. A nearby wall is painted with such rich pigment you might find it on a Farrow & Ball colour chart (“Cataclysmic Ochre”). Many of the houses are mid-refurbishment. In one, roof tiles sit stacked, ready, on the floor; a builder’s plaster-splashed bucket waits by a wall. Archaeologists play a game—a Roman Rightmove—of which house is nicest: the not-pizza-fresco one? The baths one?\nIt is a bit of fun. But there is a ghoulish guiltiness to ogling Pompeii. Posterity accuses the Bourbons of “collector syndrome”—the urge to acquire antiquity. But, Dr Zuchtriegel suggests, tourists are guilty of it too, acquiring experiences as greedily as Bourbons snatched artefacts. Millions visit each year, sweating across its forum, smirking in the brothel where the audio guide tells you about “la vie sexuelle de Pompéi” in nine languages. Dr Zuchtriegel has limited the daily number of visits to 20,000, down from 36,000.\nHe would prefer people not to tick off lists but to look at one thing, carefully. Which thing? He shows a favourite: in a small house there are little charcoal drawings of some gladiators. When they first uncovered this last year, they thought it might have been a stylised adult’s drawing. Then they dug further and found that the artist had, in their way, autographed it, drawing round their own hand in charcoal. To judge from the size of the hand, the artist must have been six or seven. When they see it, everyone does the same thing, Dr Zuchtriegel says: they stretch out their own hand to hold it over where the Pompeiian child put theirs. Same old humanity, whether one be dead or alive. ■\nThe largest dig in a lifetime is under way in Pompeii\nWhat lies beneath the pumice in the ancient city is magnificent\n|Pompeii\nWas he her lover?

It is often called a “lost city” but few cities have had such exposure per square metre. Its art is found on fridge magnets and its mosaics made into doormats. The city has been recast as a souvenir. So much of Pompeii is known that it is easy to forget how much is not known: one-third of Pompeii is still unexcavated.\nThat is obvious once you look closely. Walk through the popular bits of Pompeii—past the theatre, amphitheatre and brothel—and keep going and you will find yourself in quieter streets with fewer people and more pigeons. There are shopfronts here too, but their windows open onto a wall of earth: nothing seems to be behind them. These are the undug streets.\nBut, after an injection of EU cash, archaeologists started digging in 2023. The dig is “complicated”, says Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the director of the site and author of “The Buried City”, a recent book. If you were to add an archaeologist to your novel, you would add Dr Zuchtriegel: German, handsome, he is fluent in three languages and mildly forbidding in all of them. (To cheer himself up, he reads the New Testament in ancient Greek.) Ask him his feelings on uncovering this stuff and he says “nothing”: you are just “so concentrated”. The epigraph of his book comes from Herman Melville’s diary: “Pompeii like any other town. Same old humanity. All the same whether one be dead or alive.”\nTo call this a “dig” is to underplay the speed of it. Pompeii offers some of the finest archaeology in the world; it also offers some of the fastest. When Vesuvius erupted in 79AD, sending a cloud of ash 32km into the sky and surprising the locals—who not only did not know that Vesuvius was a volcano, but had no word for “volcano”—what fell on Pompeii was not lava but pumice stones, so light that locals, as Pliny the Younger, a Roman writer watching from a nearby villa noted, “tied pillows over their heads…for protection”.\nThe stones kept falling at a rate of 15cm an hour. In three hours, they reached people’s knees; in six, the height of a toddler. Most people fled—perhaps 90% escaped. Those who sheltered and stayed became, like the skeletons in the house, trapped. Their room, says Sophie Hay, an archaeologist, “became their tomb”. Walls started to collapse under the weight (one killed the young man). Then the volcanic cloud collapsed and a wave of superheated pumice, gas and ash raced, at speeds of 100kph and temperatures of over 200°C, down the slope. In Pompeii, people suffocated. In Herculaneum, people’s brains boiled.\nIt is hard to imagine a more appalling end—or, for archaeologists, a better one. The grains of pumice beneath were so light and dry that they protected all they fell on; so easy to remove that archaeologists, says Dr Hay, call it “Amazon packaging material”. You less excavate Pompeii than unbox it, brushing grey, frozen-foam crumbs of pumice from a fresco here and shovelling it out of a swimming pool there. In days columns start to emerge, inverse Excaliburs, from a slowly sinking lake of grey.\nThe problem with Pompeii is not getting stuff out: it is keeping it upright once you have. The same pumice-pyroclastic one-two that caught bodies as if in freeze-frame—this one clawing at a throat, or that little boy writhing—caught buildings in the same way. A shattered column or wall mid-fall can be wholly held up by pumice. Take it away and, like a game of giant Jenga, the whole thing might fall. A cat’s cradle of scaffolding winds its way around the walls. Dr Zuchtriegel likens digging to performing “a complicated operation”.\nIt has been worth it, as what has been found is breathtaking. That is partly because, like so much else in Pompeii, it is untouched by time and partly because, like very little else in Pompeii, it is untouched by archaeologists. Pompeii’s relics have suffered as much from enthusiasts as eruptions. The Bourbons plundered Pompeii (you can still see the holes, cut as if by giant mice, in the walls). Napoleon’s sister, Caroline, planned, with Napoleonic efficiency, to uncover it all in three years. Everyone has stolen from it.\nThe new excavations, by contrast, are pristine. A bathhouse has such perfect curved steps on its plunge pool you could imagine slipping into it today. A nearby wall is painted with such rich pigment you might find it on a Farrow & Ball colour chart (“Cataclysmic Ochre”). Many of the houses are mid-refurbishment. In one, roof tiles sit stacked, ready, on the floor; a builder’s plaster-splashed bucket waits by a wall. Archaeologists play a game—a Roman Rightmove—of which house is nicest: the not-pizza-fresco one? The baths one?\nIt is a bit of fun. But there is a ghoulish guiltiness to ogling Pompeii. Posterity accuses the Bourbons of “collector syndrome”—the urge to acquire antiquity. But, Dr Zuchtriegel suggests, tourists are guilty of it too, acquiring experiences as greedily as Bourbons snatched artefacts. Millions visit each year, sweating across its forum, smirking in the brothel where the audio guide tells you about “la vie sexuelle de Pompéi” in nine languages. Dr Zuchtriegel has limited the daily number of visits to 20,000, down from 36,000.\nHe would prefer people not to tick off lists but to look at one thing, carefully. Which thing? He shows a favourite: in a small house there are little charcoal drawings of some gladiators. When they first uncovered this last year, they thought it might have been a stylised adult’s drawing. Then they dug further and found that the artist had, in their way, autographed it, drawing round their own hand in charcoal. To judge from the size of the hand, the artist must have been six or seven. When they see it, everyone does the same thing, Dr Zuchtriegel says: they stretch out their own hand to hold it over where the Pompeiian child put theirs. Same old humanity, whether one be dead or alive. ■", "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 13:05:09 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.economist.com/latest/rss.xml"}

{"title": "The great Syrian beach trip", "url": "https://www.economist.com/interactive/1843/2025/08/15/the-great-syrian-beach-trip", "text": "When Syrian schools broke up for the summer in July, Nesrine al-Haj Ali decided to go to the beach. Syria has a substantial stretch of Mediterranean coastline, but al-Haj Ali, 40, had never seen it before. Still dressed in her manto, the overcoat many veiled Syrian women wear, she walked over the hot sand into the waves, not stopping until the water reached her shoulders. She was nearly out of her depth and, suddenly afraid, started to turn back. Her husband, who was beside her in the water, pointed out that her manto would cling to her when she emerged. It was such a ridiculous bit of fussing that she forgot about her fear and laughed. “What, should I wait for everyone to leave before getting out?”\nSyria’s beaches are receiving a large number of first-time visitors this summer. Resorts remained open throughout the 14-year civil war, but for many Syrians the political and sectarian geography of the conflict rendered them off-limits. The coast is home to the bulk of Syria’s Alawites, a minority group from which Bashar al-Assad and most of his security forces were drawn. Though many Sunnis lived there too, the area became a stronghold for Assad and his Alawite fighters during the civil war, and was protected by a network of checkpoints. People from the predominantly Sunni towns and cities that had risen up against the regime risked being stopped at them. Many of those detained were taken away, tortured and killed. Coming from Daraa, as al-Haj Ali did, was particularly dangerous, because the uprising had started there. “Anybody with a Daraa ID card was under suspicion,” she said.\nOn December 8th 2024 Assad fled the country, and Ahmed al-Sharaa, the leader of the most powerful Islamist rebel group, assumed control. Regime checkpoints were abandoned. The soldiers who manned them melted away, leaving their uniforms discarded on the roadside. On the M4 motorway leading to the coast only the pockmarks left by shells suggest that it was recently a heavily guarded front line.\nI met al-Haj Ali the day after her first plunge. She was sitting on a concrete wall overlooking the beach in the city of Tartus, together with her sister Khoula, who was also visiting for the first time. Children splashed at the water’s edge, while adults swam farther out. It was late afternoon, and the heat was becoming less fierce. Vendors had arranged plastic chairs and tables into neat rows on the sand outside their kiosks. Young men ferried cold drinks and shisha pipes to customers up and down the beach. On the corniche the fairy lights strung round corn-on-the-cob stalls glowed in the gathering dusk. Khoula surveyed the scene contentedly. “I’m really happy to be here,” she said.\nA little farther up the coast I met another post-war holidaymaker, 56-year-old Rawaa al-Rajab. She was from the central city of Homs, the heart of the uprising. The regime pummelled it over the course of several years, reducing her neighbourhood to rubble. Eventually rebels surrendered the city and al-Rajab, along with thousands of others, was put on a bus to northern Syria, where opposition forces still maintained control.\nThroughout the war al-Rajab was separated from her brother, Khaled. He had been working in a factory on the coast when the uprising started, and decided to stay there. It was risky for people in rebel-held areas to phone people in regime strongholds – you never knew if Assad’s security forces were listening – so al-Rajab barely even spoke to her brother. “In all those years I heard my brother’s voice just twice,” she said. “He called me once when my other brother died, and once when my husband died.”\nWhen she heard the regime had finally fallen the first thing she did was to call Khaled. Two days later al-Rajab was on the M4 driving towards him. “It felt like flying,” she said. When I saw her she was sitting on a plastic chair wedged into the black sand of Wadi Qandil beach: hijab on, shoes off and a cigarette in hand. Khaled was by her side.\nAl-Rajab was in her element, a matriarch holding court with four generations of her family gathered around the fold-up table they’d brought with them. It was piled with packets of potato crisps and fruit in tupperware containers. She poured me some cardamom-laced coffee in a small ceramic cup, and we chatted.\nBefore the war, al-Rajab had written tourist guides to the country, extolling the virtues of its archaeological sites and ancient souks. She knew that persuading foreign visitors to return would take a long time, but was unimpressed with the start made by the new tourism ministry. A few weeks earlier it had issued a statement that appeared to ban women from wearing bikinis or swimming costumes on public beaches (officials later claimed it had been a recommendation, not an order). “I’m against that,” said al-Rajab. “Wear a bikini if you want. Every human is free and your religion is only between you and Allah.”\nWhat people needed now, she said, was security. “I have a big family and none of them wants revenge for the blood they lost, we just want peace for all Syrians. And when my son is out of the house I don’t want to be worrying about whether he’s going to come back.”\nI asked her what her losses had been and her hand drifted to her heart. Al-Rajab used to have another brother, she told me, who was arrested in 2012. She believes a female relative reported him to the intelligence services for working with the opposition. When rebels opened up Sednaya, the Assad regime’s notorious prison, she was able to confirm what she had long suspected: he had died in its labyrinth of torture chambers.\nHer family has intermarried with Alawites, and it is this branch which is now feeling vulnerable. In March this year supporters of the old regime in the coastal areas attempted an uprising against al-Sharaa, which sparked brutal reprisals. Over three days, forces aligned with the new government killed more than a thousand Alawite civilians. Many young Alawites have been kidnapped or murdered since. Among those affected is the relative who al-Rajab believes betrayed her brother. Her son has been missing for some time. She feels sorry for the woman, in spite of everything.\nLooking out over the bustling beach, al-Rajab reflected on the juncture the country is at. “Syria is heaven,” she said. “But it needs pure hands to build it again.” When I asked her whether al-Sharaa’s hands were clean enough, she equivocated. “The new government isn’t bad, and we need to have hope. One hand doesn’t clap on its own; it must be the people and the government working together.”\nAt the southern end of Wadi Qandil is a row of wooden chalets. On Friday nights these are full of young people up from Damascus for the weekend, and the sounds of a beach bar that pumps out music until 3am.\nThe DJ was playing an eclectic mix when I visited – songs from the Syrian revolution, modern and traditional Lebanese artists, a Palestinian resistance anthem and the theme tune from “Friends”. The Damascene clientele, who were dancing and drinking beer, would probably have been free to visit the coast during the war, but were clearly relishing the opportunity to express themselves more freely now that Assad has gone.\nThey had other concerns though. After the recommendations on beach attire were circulated, the owner of one of the chalets had a meeting with an official from the new government. “I told him, ‘If you force people to dress a certain way you’re damaging Syria’s reputation,’” he said. “Syria will never be ruled religiously, it’s impossible.”\nHe was less worried about al-Sharaa’s forces than conservative vigilantes. He and some fellow chalet-owners have pooled cash to hire a security guard. So far, the only incident has been a raid by the new security forces, who said they came looking for a man they considered fulul, a newly popular word in Syria that refers to Assad loyalists. According to the chalet-owner the security forces beat everyone at the scene to try to extract information about the fulul. He says if he’d had any he would have volunteered it the need for violence. “I don’t want the headache.”\nThirty kilometres down the coast in the city of Latakia, a group of suntanned teenage boys were gathered on the rocks beneath the seafront promenade. They ran to the water and pushed and pulled each other in, then clambered out to do it again and again. One of them, Mustafa, was 15 but looked younger. He told me he’d just finished his last exam, and was looking forward to a long summer of swimming and football.\nRegime-affiliated gangs known as shabiha used to rule Latakia. They were violent and untouchable, and their turf extended to the waterfront. Mustafa said you needed the patronage of one of these men even to take part in local sports; they leaned on the coaches who selected the teams.\nNow the shabiha have slunk away, and their networks of influence have collapsed. “There is no wasta anymore,” said Mustafa, using the Arabic word for the practice of working connections. “Anybody can play football.”\nOn the promenade above Mustafa, three men in the black uniforms of Syria’s new police force were smoking shisha. They had fought in the rebellion, spending the last years of the war in the north-western province of Idlib. When Assad fell they were redeployed to Damascus, and had decided to come to the beach on their day off. “We’re happy to be here,” said one of them, a handsome 30-year-old called Sultan Nasser. “We haven’t come here since 2011, so it’s kind of strange.”\nNasser was originally from Ghouta, one of the Damascus suburbs where resistance to the regime was particularly active. He joined the armed rebels in 2011 after his brother-in-law was shot dead at a peaceful protest. Having spent most of his adult life at war, he was ready to start thinking about other things: setting up a home, looking after a family.\nThe seaside wasn’t all that relaxing for him. He was conscious that people there didn’t like the new security forces. There are estimated to be as many as 10,000 insurgents loyal to the old regime hiding out in the coastal areas. Even in Damascus he’d felt resentment when he searched people’s cars at checkpoints.\n“Sometimes we hear them say that ‘It’s the same as the Assad days’,” he said indignantly. “People aren’t thankful, they’re not grateful to the people who won them their freedom.”\nSitting beside him was a younger fighter, Mohammed Tahhan, a 19-year-old who grew up in rebel-held Idlib and then joined the military arm of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, al-Sharaa’s group. He had turned away from my translator and me when we first approached, uncomfortable speaking to two young women. But he slowly warmed up, and eventually insisted on buying us two wilted roses from a child street-hawker. Until he entered Damascus with his triumphant colleagues in December 2024, Tahhan had never seen the capital, let alone the sea. “It felt like coming home,” he said. “All of Syria feels like home now.”\nNot long after we spoke al-Sharaa sent his security forces into the heartland of another religious minority. Suwayda, a region in southern Syria, is mostly populated by members of the Druze sect, whom Sunni fundamentalists see as heretics. Druze leaders were no fans of Assad but worried about being ruled by a hardline Islamist government. Al-Sharaa’s troops ostensibly came to keep the peace after armed clashes between Druze men and local Sunni tribes, but many saw their deployment as an attempt to project power on a region that had not yet submitted to the transitional government’s rule. Violence increased, and men wearing the uniforms of the new authorities were seen participating in massacres of Druze civilians. Then Israel intervened on behalf of the Druze, bombing the ministry of defence in Damascus. Challenges to al-Sharaa’s authority are rising throughout the country, and next year’s beach season may be less peaceful.\nHeidi Pett is a journalist in Damascus\nPHOTOGRAPHS GABRIEL FERNEINI", "published": "Fri, 15 Aug 2025 08:13:55 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.economist.com/latest/rss.xml"}

The European formula, they say, is the new “global standard”. That would imply a massive increase in defence budgets from Sapporo to Sydney. To hit 3.5% would add over $150bn per year in defence spending, the biggest rise among allies in the Pacific in 50 years.

To help convince the ANC of the merits of capitalism—before it won power in South Africa’s first all-race election in 1994—the firms proposed “empowerment deals” instead.

Powerful, compact motors sporting magnets made from rare-earth elements are vital to the emerging electric economy, used in everything from wind turbines to electric cars. Recently, they have also become a catalyst for geopolitical tensions.\nRare earths make the magnets that go into high-quality, compact speakers and microphones. They power the motors that make phones vibrate and help produce vivid colours in touchscreens. They are also found in camera lenses and wireless devices.\nThe metals are used in some hard drives, which rely on specialised, ultra-precise electric motors to both record and retrieve data.\nThey are also used in the electrical generators inside wind turbines, which convert the kinetic energy of the spinning blades into electrical energy for the power grid. Rare-earth magnets are powerful, light and can resist the effects of high temperatures, all of which helps simplify design and reduce maintenance costs.\nRare-earth magnets are also used in cars. In many electric cars, they are used in the motors that drive the wheels—though they also turn up in motors that power the windows or the power steering. Rare-earth elements can also be found in electronic components such as inverters or in the touchscreen displays common in modern cars.\nRare-earth elements help to steer the beam of radars and to process the signal that comes back. They go into flight-control systems and the light but powerful engines of weight-sensitive jets. They are key to laser-guided missiles, night vision and jam-resistant communications.\nRare earths are rare only in the sense that they tend to be found in very low concentrations and are chemically difficult to isolate. Their production, in contrast, is highly concentrated, with Chinese firms accounting for 69% of the ore dug up, over 90% of the refined minerals produced and nearly all of the manufacture of rare-earth magnets. In April, after America slapped China with 54% tariffs, China began to restrict exports of seven rare earths. Lately some shipments have resumed, but the West remains anxious. Rare earths are a buzzword at intergovernmental summits. The Pentagon is investing in projects to mine them. Is the world hostage to China’s near-monopoly and, if so, can it free itself?\nChina began mining rare earths in the 1950s. At first it trailed behind America, which had discovered rare-earth deposits in the 1940s as it searched for uranium to make atomic bombs. But in the 1980s China granted licensing authority to local governments even as it began welcoming foreign investment and encouraging exports. Landlocked provinces saw a chance to industrialise. Hundreds of mining firms sprang up. By the 2000s there was a rare-earth glut. America’s main mine, Mountain Pass, had shut. Chinese producers were the last men standing, but even they were suffering: the industry was fragmented, illegal mining was rife and profits were scarce.\nTo shore up the industry, China’s government enlisted ministries, institutes and universities to foster research. Between 2000 and 2016 the Chinese Academy of Sciences produced 2,018 papers on rare earths. The authorities also encouraged consolidation in the industry, culminating last year in the formation of two state-owned giants. China Northern Rare Earth, in inner Mongolia, extracts “light” rare earths by digging. China Rare Earth (CRE), based in Ganzhou, cranks out the “heavy” kind through leaching. The pair account for nearly all of China’s rare-earth mining.\nThe same firms also refine rare earths from the ores—an area in which China is even more dominant. As well as domestic feedstock, they have access to cheap ore from neighbouring Myanmar, where a bitter civil war has allowed a completely unregulated mining industry to flourish. Refining is a complicated business, requiring lots of electricity, solvents and reagents. Processing some ores involves more than 100 separate steps, the details of which are fiercely guarded secrets. These techniques are also tailored to the local geology, so are not easy to replicate.\nExperience breeds efficiency, allowing yields to rise and costs to fall. A patent filed in July aims to push the concentrate grades at Bayan Obo, a northern rare-earth mine that is the world’s largest, past 60%, says Cory Combs of Trivium, a consultancy (40-50% is typical). The presence of all elements of the supply chain within China, be it producers of such inputs as machinery and chemicals or consumers of rare earths, such as manufacturers of magnets, generates more savings.\nAll this makes China’s domination of the industry hard to challenge. Although alternative suppliers are starting to master a few links in the chain, they “are always missing something”, says Wang Yue of Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy. The Chinese authorities are determined to keep it that way. In 2023 they restricted the export of equipment used to process rare earths. Some people with special expertise in the field are barred from travelling abroad.\nChina’s support for the rare-earths industry probably originally owed more to economic opportunism than to geopolitical calculations. “I don’t buy the argument that Beijing spent 50 years developing rare earths as a tool for conflicts that hadn’t happened yet,” says Mr Combs. But, intentionally or not, rare earths have become a source of pride and clout. A staffer at JL MAG, a rare-earth magnet firm in Ganzhou, says the city’s prowess “has surpassed expectations”. A snack vendor agrees: “Now everyone in the world recognises that our country is strong.” In another part of the city, the gates of Yueci Mag-Tech, which makes magnetic materials for aerospace and other industries, bear a bright-red sign: “We will not waver as we forge ahead in the direction indicated by General Secretary Xi Jinping!”\nAt the moment, Mr Xi seems to be steering China towards using rare earths as a means of economic coercion. At first glance, they seem well suited to the task. Their production does not depend on imports of raw materials, unlike other vital commodities that China produces the bulk of, such as copper and lithium. And the costs of curbing exports are strikingly asymmetrical: for a few tens of millions of dollars in forgone sales, whole foreign industries can be crippled.\nRaring for a fight\nThe export controls China put in place on April 4th gave an indication of the pain it could inflict. The rare earths involved (and magnets using them) could no longer be exported without a special licence. The ostensible justification was to prevent military uses. In practice, all sorts of industrial supply chains snarled. Applications for export licences piled up and exports plunged. The scant stocks available outside China soared in price. Ford and Suzuki, among other carmakers, had to suspend production at some factories.\nWestern executives and officials rushed to negotiate. Some companies agreed to disclose commercially sensitive information about how they used rare earths, including technical drawings, to secure the necessary export licences. Approvals, especially for magnets, began to accelerate in June. But exports remain low and inconsistent. German firms have received more magnet licences than American ones, for instance. Carmakers in India, which has strained relations with China, appear to be at the back of the queue.\nEven if exports revert to their previous levels, it could take months to replenish stocks. Moreover, some of the licences that have been issued are valid for only six months, after which buyers must reapply. And the rules may always change again.\nA refurbished bunker from the second world war at a confidential location in Frankfurt gives a sense of how precious rare earths have become—and how vulnerable the West remains to shortages. The bunker holds 300 tonnes of minerals amid brutalist-chic security. The walls are two metres thick; the door weighs 4.6 tonnes. For some rare-earth elements, the bunker holds 10% of the world’s annual output. In one corner an Asian manufacturer maintains a stash worth nearly $10m. Another firm, from Europe, stores enough here to cover two years’ worth of use.\nYet most consumers have no buffers. The majority of the metal in the bunker is owned not by end-users but by Tradium, a metals merchant whose sister company, Metlock, runs the facility. Buyers who usually haggle over pennies per kilogram “want material at any price”, says Matthias Rüth, Tradium’s founder.\nWestern leaders consider the threat grave. Gracelin Baskaran of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank in Washington, DC, says “a whole-of-government effort” is under way in America to reduce dependence on China. Mountain Pass, which resumed operations in 2018, produced 47,000 tonnes of light rare-earth oxides last year. It aims to reach 60,000 tonnes by 2030. America’s Department of Defence has agreed to guarantee a minimum price for its output well above the level that prevailed before China curbed exports. In May Lynas, an Australian firm backed by the American and Japanese governments, began producing heavy rare earths in Malaysia, making it the first commercial producer outside China. In June the European Union said it would back rare-earth projects in Malawi and South Africa. Hundreds more schemes are being mooted around the world.\nThe problem is that most of these are years away from starting up, if they ever do. Project Blue, a consultancy, lists just 22 projects that hope to be up and running by 2030. Delays are frequent in mining and rare earths present particular difficulties. Chinese producers are so efficient it is hard to compete with them and the current export restrictions are so mercurial it is hard to know how long they will last. Financing big upfront investments in mines under such circumstances is tricky.\nBut there are other options besides simply trying to replicate China’s supply chain in the West.\nOne possibility is recycling, which is currently negligible. After all, says Frédéric Carencotte, the founder of Caremag, a rare-earth startup, recycled magnets “are the richest kind of ore we know”. The EU, which has no rare-earth mines of its own, is especially keen to foster a recycling industry. A law adopted last year aims to satisfy a quarter of the bloc’s demand for critical minerals, including rare earths, through recycling by 2030.\nNext year Caremag, which has raised €216m ($253m) from private investors and the French government, hopes to begin producing recycled rare earths at a plant in Lacq, in southern France. It plans to recycle around 2,000 tonnes of magnets a year. The feedstock will include everything from big electric motors in cars to the tiny ones in hard drives. A good deal of it, says Mr Carencotte, will come from the swarf left over from manufacturing virgin magnets in the first place. In 2024 the firm signed a ten-year supply contract with Stellantis, a carmaker that owns the Chrysler and Fiat brands, among others (and whose biggest shareholder owns a stake in The Economist’s parent company).\nCyclic Materials, a startup based in Canada which has raised $84m from investors including Amazon, Hitachi and Microsoft, has similar ambitions. It is building two plants, one in America and another in Canada, which should between them produce 500 tonnes of recycled rare earths a year, including heavy ones. In May Cyclic inked a deal with Lime, an American firm that makes rentable e-bikes, to recycle the vehicles at the end of their lives. Besides rare earths, says Ahmad Ghahreman, its founder, it will also recover aluminium, steel and copper. Mr Ghahreman hopes that will help the firm stay viable even if rare-earth prices tumble.\nSome companies may be able to slash their consumption of rare earths. The car industry provides possible examples. Most electric cars built today rely on permanent-magnet motors (PMMs), in which powerful rare-earth magnets are mounted on the rotor (the bit of the motor that moves), while electromagnets are mounted on the stator (the bit that doesn’t). Electromagnets are coils of wire that generate a magnetic field when an electric current is passed through them. The interaction between the two magnetic fields makes the rotor spin and the wheels turn.\nPMMs are powerful, efficient and compact. But they are not the only way to turn electricity into motion. Tesla’s early electric cars used induction motors. These eschew magnets on the rotor and rely instead on a phenomenon called electromagnetic induction to make it spin. Induction motors avoid rare earths, but are generally bigger. They can be more efficient in some circumstances, however. A few contemporary vehicles, such as Audi’s Q6 e-tron, use induction motors alongside PMMs.\nAnother option is to replace the permanent magnets on the rotor with a second set of electromagnets like the ones found on the stator. Such “externally excited” motors (EEMs) are more complicated than permanent-magnet machines. The engineering tricks necessary to transfer electricity from the battery to the spinning rotor means they tend to be bigger, too. But, like induction machines, they can be built without any rare earths.\nBoth BMW, a German carmaker, and Renault, a French one, sell cars powered by externally excited motors, and boast about their lack of reliance on rare earths in their ads. The technology is improving rapidly. ZF Friedrichshafen, a big German supplier to the car industry, has developed an EEM that is no bigger than an equivalent PMM. With no rare earths, the motor is cheaper too, says Otmar Scharrer, who runs electric-powertrain research for ZF. And the ability to control the magnetic field in the rotor precisely means it can sometimes be more efficient, especially at high speeds. Dr Scharrer says several carmakers are interested in ZF’s new EEM. It hopes to start manufacturing at scale in 2028.\n“Nearly all the big car companies at least have the option to build electric motors without using rare earths,” says James Edmondson of IdTechEx, a research firm. The question, he says, is whether they regard the current shortages as a short-term disruption that can be ridden out or a longer-term problem that will require changes to their business plans.\nRareguard action\nThat question—of how long the disruption might last, and how willing China might be to use rare earths as a weapon in future—will determine how quickly and resolutely firms and governments seek to insulate themselves from Chinese pressure. One the one hand, the woolliness and inconsistency of the current Chinese restrictions may blunt the incentives to adapt. On the other hand, this is not the first time China has weaponised rare earths.\nIn 2010, amid a Sino-Japanese maritime dispute, China throttled exports of rare earths to Japan. Japanese manufacturers, with their lean, “just in time” supply chains, were caught off guard. The Japanese government was forced to release the captain of a Chinese vessel it had detained, after which China allowed exports to resume. But the supply scare encouraged Japan to use less rare earths, produce more of them itself and build stockpiles. Although some of this caution has since dissipated (witness Suzuki’s difficulties), Japan is still much less dependent on Chinese imports than it was 15 years ago.\nFurthermore, the West does not need to develop a home-grown substitute for the entire Chinese rare-earth industry to reduce the threat China’s monopoly poses. That would be prohibitively expensive and would require open-ended subsidies. Instead, argues David Merriman of Project Blue, the West could “significantly derisk” by cutting its reliance on China to 60-70% of consumption. That would provide sufficient alternative supply for the most critical uses. Recycling, thrift and innovation could sort out the rest. And of course, the more aggressive China is about using its market power, the greater the incentive the rest of the world has to find ways round it. The only way China can preserve its monopoly in the long run is to keep rare earths both cheap and abundant. ■\nChina’s power over rare earths is not as great as it seems\nThere are lots of ways for the West to get around its near-monopoly\n|Frankfurt and Ganzhou\nThe rare earths are a group of 17 metallic elements that find their way into products and industries from smartphones to fighter jets. Powerful, compact motors sporting magnets made from rare-earth elements are vital to the emerging electric economy, used in everything from wind turbines to electric cars. Recently, they have also become a catalyst for geopolitical tensions.\nRare earths make the magnets that go into high-quality, compact speakers and microphones. They power the motors that make phones vibrate and help produce vivid colours in touchscreens. They are also found in camera lenses and wireless devices.\nThe metals are used in some hard drives, which rely on specialised, ultra-precise electric motors to both record and retrieve data.\nThey are also used in the electrical generators inside wind turbines, which convert the kinetic energy of the spinning blades into electrical energy for the power grid.

Some people with special expertise in the field are barred from travelling abroad.\nChina’s support for the rare-earths industry probably originally owed more to economic opportunism than to geopolitical calculations. “I don’t buy the argument that Beijing spent 50 years developing rare earths as a tool for conflicts that hadn’t happened yet,” says Mr Combs. But, intentionally or not, rare earths have become a source of pride and clout. A staffer at JL MAG, a rare-earth magnet firm in Ganzhou, says the city’s prowess “has surpassed expectations”. A snack vendor agrees: “Now everyone in the world recognises that our country is strong.” In another part of the city, the gates of Yueci Mag-Tech, which makes magnetic materials for aerospace and other industries, bear a bright-red sign: “We will not waver as we forge ahead in the direction indicated by General Secretary Xi Jinping!”\nAt the moment, Mr Xi seems to be steering China towards using rare earths as a means of economic coercion. At first glance, they seem well suited to the task. Their production does not depend on imports of raw materials, unlike other vital commodities that China produces the bulk of, such as copper and lithium. And the costs of curbing exports are strikingly asymmetrical: for a few tens of millions of dollars in forgone sales, whole foreign industries can be crippled.\nRaring for a fight\nThe export controls China put in place on April 4th gave an indication of the pain it could inflict. The rare earths involved (and magnets using them) could no longer be exported without a special licence. The ostensible justification was to prevent military uses. In practice, all sorts of industrial supply chains snarled. Applications for export licences piled up and exports plunged. The scant stocks available outside China soared in price. Ford and Suzuki, among other carmakers, had to suspend production at some factories.\nWestern executives and officials rushed to negotiate. Some companies agreed to disclose commercially sensitive information about how they used rare earths, including technical drawings, to secure the necessary export licences. Approvals, especially for magnets, began to accelerate in June. But exports remain low and inconsistent. German firms have received more magnet licences than American ones, for instance. Carmakers in India, which has strained relations with China, appear to be at the back of the queue.\nEven if exports revert to their previous levels, it could take months to replenish stocks. Moreover, some of the licences that have been issued are valid for only six months, after which buyers must reapply. And the rules may always change again.\nA refurbished bunker from the second world war at a confidential location in Frankfurt gives a sense of how precious rare earths have become—and how vulnerable the West remains to shortages. The bunker holds 300 tonnes of minerals amid brutalist-chic security. The walls are two metres thick; the door weighs 4.6 tonnes. For some rare-earth elements, the bunker holds 10% of the world’s annual output. In one corner an Asian manufacturer maintains a stash worth nearly $10m. Another firm, from Europe, stores enough here to cover two years’ worth of use.\nYet most consumers have no buffers. The majority of the metal in the bunker is owned not by end-users but by Tradium, a metals merchant whose sister company, Metlock, runs the facility. Buyers who usually haggle over pennies per kilogram “want material at any price”, says Matthias Rüth, Tradium’s founder.\nWestern leaders consider the threat grave. Gracelin Baskaran of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank in Washington, DC, says “a whole-of-government effort” is under way in America to reduce dependence on China. Mountain Pass, which resumed operations in 2018, produced 47,000 tonnes of light rare-earth oxides last year. It aims to reach 60,000 tonnes by 2030. America’s Department of Defence has agreed to guarantee a minimum price for its output well above the level that prevailed before China curbed exports. In May Lynas, an Australian firm backed by the American and Japanese governments, began producing heavy rare earths in Malaysia, making it the first commercial producer outside China. In June the European Union said it would back rare-earth projects in Malawi and South Africa. Hundreds more schemes are being mooted around the world.\nThe problem is that most of these are years away from starting up, if they ever do. Project Blue, a consultancy, lists just 22 projects that hope to be up and running by 2030. Delays are frequent in mining and rare earths present particular difficulties. Chinese producers are so efficient it is hard to compete with them and the current export restrictions are so mercurial it is hard to know how long they will last. Financing big upfront investments in mines under such circumstances is tricky.\nBut there are other options besides simply trying to replicate China’s supply chain in the West.\nOne possibility is recycling, which is currently negligible. After all, says Frédéric Carencotte, the founder of Caremag, a rare-earth startup, recycled magnets “are the richest kind of ore we know”. The EU, which has no rare-earth mines of its own, is especially keen to foster a recycling industry. A law adopted last year aims to satisfy a quarter of the bloc’s demand for critical minerals, including rare earths, through recycling by 2030.\nNext year Caremag, which has raised €216m ($253m) from private investors and the French government, hopes to begin producing recycled rare earths at a plant in Lacq, in southern France. It plans to recycle around 2,000 tonnes of magnets a year. The feedstock will include everything from big electric motors in cars to the tiny ones in hard drives. A good deal of it, says Mr Carencotte, will come from the swarf left over from manufacturing virgin magnets in the first place. In 2024 the firm signed a ten-year supply contract with Stellantis, a carmaker that owns the Chrysler and Fiat brands, among others (and whose biggest shareholder owns a stake in The Economist’s parent company).\nCyclic Materials, a startup based in Canada which has raised $84m from investors including Amazon, Hitachi and Microsoft, has similar ambitions. It is building two plants, one in America and another in Canada, which should between them produce 500 tonnes of recycled rare earths a year, including heavy ones. In May Cyclic inked a deal with Lime, an American firm that makes rentable e-bikes, to recycle the vehicles at the end of their lives. Besides rare earths, says Ahmad Ghahreman, its founder, it will also recover aluminium, steel and copper. Mr Ghahreman hopes that will help the firm stay viable even if rare-earth prices tumble.\nSome companies may be able to slash their consumption of rare earths. The car industry provides possible examples. Most electric cars built today rely on permanent-magnet motors (PMMs), in which powerful rare-earth magnets are mounted on the rotor (the bit of the motor that moves), while electromagnets are mounted on the stator (the bit that doesn’t). Electromagnets are coils of wire that generate a magnetic field when an electric current is passed through them. The interaction between the two magnetic fields makes the rotor spin and the wheels turn.\nPMMs are powerful, efficient and compact. But they are not the only way to turn electricity into motion. Tesla’s early electric cars used induction motors. These eschew magnets on the rotor and rely instead on a phenomenon called electromagnetic induction to make it spin. Induction motors avoid rare earths, but are generally bigger. They can be more efficient in some circumstances, however. A few contemporary vehicles, such as Audi’s Q6 e-tron, use induction motors alongside PMMs.\nAnother option is to replace the permanent magnets on the rotor with a second set of electromagnets like the ones found on the stator. Such “externally excited” motors (EEMs) are more complicated than permanent-magnet machines. The engineering tricks necessary to transfer electricity from the battery to the spinning rotor means they tend to be bigger, too. But, like induction machines, they can be built without any rare earths.\nBoth BMW, a German carmaker, and Renault, a French one, sell cars powered by externally excited motors, and boast about their lack of reliance on rare earths in their ads. The technology is improving rapidly. ZF Friedrichshafen, a big German supplier to the car industry, has developed an EEM that is no bigger than an equivalent PMM. With no rare earths, the motor is cheaper too, says Otmar Scharrer, who runs electric-powertrain research for ZF. And the ability to control the magnetic field in the rotor precisely means it can sometimes be more efficient, especially at high speeds. Dr Scharrer says several carmakers are interested in ZF’s new EEM. It hopes to start manufacturing at scale in 2028.\n“Nearly all the big car companies at least have the option to build electric motors without using rare earths,” says James Edmondson of IdTechEx, a research firm. The question, he says, is whether they regard the current shortages as a short-term disruption that can be ridden out or a longer-term problem that will require changes to their business plans.\nRareguard action\nThat question—of how long the disruption might last, and how willing China might be to use rare earths as a weapon in future—will determine how quickly and resolutely firms and governments seek to insulate themselves from Chinese pressure. One the one hand, the woolliness and inconsistency of the current Chinese restrictions may blunt the incentives to adapt. On the other hand, this is not the first time China has weaponised rare earths.\nIn 2010, amid a Sino-Japanese maritime dispute, China throttled exports of rare earths to Japan. Japanese manufacturers, with their lean, “just in time” supply chains, were caught off guard. The Japanese government was forced to release the captain of a Chinese vessel it had detained, after which China allowed exports to resume. But the supply scare encouraged Japan to use less rare earths, produce more of them itself and build stockpiles. Although some of this caution has since dissipated (witness Suzuki’s difficulties), Japan is still much less dependent on Chinese imports than it was 15 years ago.\nFurthermore, the West does not need to develop a home-grown substitute for the entire Chinese rare-earth industry to reduce the threat China’s monopoly poses. That would be prohibitively expensive and would require open-ended subsidies. Instead, argues David Merriman of Project Blue, the West could “significantly derisk” by cutting its reliance on China to 60-70% of consumption. That would provide sufficient alternative supply for the most critical uses. Recycling, thrift and innovation could sort out the rest. And of course, the more aggressive China is about using its market power, the greater the incentive the rest of the world has to find ways round it. The only way China can preserve its monopoly in the long run is to keep rare earths both cheap and abundant. ■\nChina’s power over rare earths is not as great as it seems\nThere are lots of ways for the West to get around its near-monopoly\n|Frankfurt and Ganzhou\nThe rare earths are a group of 17 metallic elements that find their way into products and industries from smartphones to fighter jets. Powerful, compact motors sporting magnets made from rare-earth elements are vital to the emerging electric economy, used in everything from wind turbines to electric cars. Recently, they have also become a catalyst for geopolitical tensions.\nRare earths make the magnets that go into high-quality, compact speakers and microphones. They power the motors that make phones vibrate and help produce vivid colours in touchscreens. They are also found in camera lenses and wireless devices.\nThe metals are used in some hard drives, which rely on specialised, ultra-precise electric motors to both record and retrieve data.\nThey are also used in the electrical generators inside wind turbines, which convert the kinetic energy of the spinning blades into electrical energy for the power grid. Rare-earth magnets are powerful, light and can resist the effects of high temperatures, all of which helps simplify design and reduce maintenance costs.\nRare-earth magnets are also used in cars. In many electric cars, they are used in the motors that drive the wheels—though they also turn up in motors that power the windows or the power steering. Rare-earth elements can also be found in electronic components such as inverters or in the touchscreen displays common in modern cars.\nRare-earth elements help to steer the beam of radars and to process the signal that comes back. They go into flight-control systems and the light but powerful engines of weight-sensitive jets. They are key to laser-guided missiles, night vision and jam-resistant communications.\nRare earths are rare only in the sense that they tend to be found in very low concentrations and are chemically difficult to isolate. Their production, in contrast, is highly concentrated, with Chinese firms accounting for 69% of the ore dug up, over 90% of the refined minerals produced and nearly all of the manufacture of rare-earth magnets. In April, after America slapped China with 54% tariffs, China began to restrict exports of seven rare earths. Lately some shipments have resumed, but the West remains anxious. Rare earths are a buzzword at intergovernmental summits. The Pentagon is investing in projects to mine them. Is the world hostage to China’s near-monopoly and, if so, can it free itself?\nChina began mining rare earths in the 1950s. At first it trailed behind America, which had discovered rare-earth deposits in the 1940s as it searched for uranium to make atomic bombs. But in the 1980s China granted licensing authority to local governments even as it began welcoming foreign investment and encouraging exports. Landlocked provinces saw a chance to industrialise. Hundreds of mining firms sprang up. By the 2000s there was a rare-earth glut. America’s main mine, Mountain Pass, had shut. Chinese producers were the last men standing, but even they were suffering: the industry was fragmented, illegal mining was rife and profits were scarce.\nTo shore up the industry, China’s government enlisted ministries, institutes and universities to foster research. Between 2000 and 2016 the Chinese Academy of Sciences produced 2,018 papers on rare earths. The authorities also encouraged consolidation in the industry, culminating last year in the formation of two state-owned giants. China Northern Rare Earth, in inner Mongolia, extracts “light” rare earths by digging. China Rare Earth (CRE), based in Ganzhou, cranks out the “heavy” kind through leaching. The pair account for nearly all of China’s rare-earth mining.\nThe same firms also refine rare earths from the ores—an area in which China is even more dominant. As well as domestic feedstock, they have access to cheap ore from neighbouring Myanmar, where a bitter civil war has allowed a completely unregulated mining industry to flourish. Refining is a complicated business, requiring lots of electricity, solvents and reagents. Processing some ores involves more than 100 separate steps, the details of which are fiercely guarded secrets. These techniques are also tailored to the local geology, so are not easy to replicate.\nExperience breeds efficiency, allowing yields to rise and costs to fall. A patent filed in July aims to push the concentrate grades at Bayan Obo, a northern rare-earth mine that is the world’s largest, past 60%, says Cory Combs of Trivium, a consultancy (40-50% is typical). The presence of all elements of the supply chain within China, be it producers of such inputs as machinery and chemicals or consumers of rare earths, such as manufacturers of magnets, generates more savings.\nAll this makes China’s domination of the industry hard to challenge. Although alternative suppliers are starting to master a few links in the chain, they “are always missing something”, says Wang Yue of Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy. The Chinese authorities are determined to keep it that way. In 2023 they restricted the export of equipment used to process rare earths. Some people with special expertise in the field are barred from travelling abroad.\nChina’s support for the rare-earths industry probably originally owed more to economic opportunism than to geopolitical calculations. “I don’t buy the argument that Beijing spent 50 years developing rare earths as a tool for conflicts that hadn’t happened yet,” says Mr Combs.

Starting from a valuation that stratospheric, Cisco’s solid-but-unspectacular growth was a bitter disappointment.

The terms of the Svalbard treaty forbid any military structures there, but Norway is increasingly keen to assert its sovereignty.\nRussia and NATO have the most extensive networks of military and civilian bases in the Arctic. Russia is especially concerned to protect the home port for its nuclear-armed naval fleet at Murmansk, on the Kola peninsula.\nRussia is also keen to develop bases that could also support ships, including those transporting oil and gas, along the Northern Sea Route from Europe to Asia.\nIn future, other sea routes in the Arctic may also become viable, opening up the region both for civilian trade and for increased naval activity.\nThat depends, in turn, on how quickly the sea ice retreats in the Arctic, as a result of climate change. The past four decades have already seen a dramatic reduction.\nNorway’s intelligence chief suggests Russia’s Arctic efforts are also influenced by the effects of the Ukraine war. The expansion of NATO means that Russia is less free to carry out military and other activity in the Baltic Sea. To compensate, it appears to want more opportunities in the Arctic. The relative proximity of Svalbard to an important port for its nuclear-armed naval fleet on the Kola Peninsula of the Russian mainland is also a worry for Russia.\nA second Russian concern is that Svalbard gives Western powers an intelligence advantage. A large array of Starlink receivers and other antennae on mountains above Longyearbyen are used for downloading data, for civilian ends, from transpolar satellites.\nCould heated words one day turn to hostile action? NATO powers suggest it may already be happening. There is evidence of Russian sabotage in the Arctic.

In November the head of German intelligence, Bruno Kahl, described a scenario in which Russia would test NATO members’ commitment to common defence, Article 5, by launching a hybrid attack on Svalbard. Some incidents are suspicious but not proven as harassment. In July, for example, commercial airliners approaching Svalbard reported interference in their GPS signals.\nSvalbard’s position is both advantageous and awkward for Norway. Crucially, Russia recognises the Svalbard treaty granting Norway ownership, even if the Soviet Union, in the 1940s, briefly tried to bully its neighbour to abandon it in favour of a bilateral arrangement between the two countries. Norway refused. The awkward bit is that the same treaty grants nationals of other countries the rights to settle and exploit territory on Svalbard. That includes Russia. A Russian mining company, Arktikugol, has for decades populated and run a town, Barentsburg, just 40km from Longyearbyen. A handful of other tiny Russian-run mining settlements have also existed.\nOne challenge for Norway is to preserve Longyearbyen as a viable economic outpost, and crucially to maintain a year-round population there. All residents in Svalbard are temporary—because of limited medical facilities, the very young and elderly are discouraged from living there. For most of the past century the territory was mostly used for coal mining. But on June 30th the last Norwegian coal shaft was closed. One Norwegian in Svalbard, Svein Jonny Albrigsten, a miner who has lived on the island for 50 years, points out that Russia won’t close its own coal mine at Barentsburg. He argues that as Russia and China show greater interest in exploiting Arctic natural resources, that will eventually spur Western countries to resume mining in Svalbard, too.\nMore likely, however, Norway will double down on making Svalbard a centre for research and tourism. Longyearbyen already hosts Norwegian and international scientists in a research centre. Some miners may be re-employed in building work, as more and better residential structures go up, in part to deal with the effects of melting permafrost. In the long-run, retreating sea-ice in the Arctic may also bring a surge in shipping in the Arctic, including at Svalbard.\nConflict in Svalbard is far from likely, even if increasing competition for influence in the region is guaranteed. For the sleepy settlement of Longyearbyen, on the most extreme edge of the map, ever more visits from military, political and intelligence officials are certain.

Norway refused. The awkward bit is that the same treaty grants nationals of other countries the rights to settle and exploit territory on Svalbard. That includes Russia. A Russian mining company, Arktikugol, has for decades populated and run a town, Barentsburg, just 40km from Longyearbyen. A handful of other tiny Russian-run mining settlements have also existed.\nOne challenge for Norway is to preserve Longyearbyen as a viable economic outpost, and crucially to maintain a year-round population there. All residents in Svalbard are temporary—because of limited medical facilities, the very young and elderly are discouraged from living there. For most of the past century the territory was mostly used for coal mining. But on June 30th the last Norwegian coal shaft was closed. One Norwegian in Svalbard, Svein Jonny Albrigsten, a miner who has lived on the island for 50 years, points out that Russia won’t close its own coal mine at Barentsburg. He argues that as Russia and China show greater interest in exploiting Arctic natural resources, that will eventually spur Western countries to resume mining in Svalbard, too.\nMore likely, however, Norway will double down on making Svalbard a centre for research and tourism. Longyearbyen already hosts Norwegian and international scientists in a research centre. Some miners may be re-employed in building work, as more and better residential structures go up, in part to deal with the effects of melting permafrost. In the long-run, retreating sea-ice in the Arctic may also bring a surge in shipping in the Arctic, including at Svalbard.\nConflict in Svalbard is far from likely, even if increasing competition for influence in the region is guaranteed. For the sleepy settlement of Longyearbyen, on the most extreme edge of the map, ever more visits from military, political and intelligence officials are certain. Interest from neighbouring Russia, too, is only going to grow.■", "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 16:14:54 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.economist.com/latest/rss.xml"}

In 2023 the FDA granted accelerated approval for its gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare genetic disorder that typically causes death in early adulthood. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s biologics centre at the time, approved the treatment despite reviewers’ concerns about limited clinical data. Some hailed that as proof the FDA could be nimble in cases where sufferers had few options. The treatment costs an eye-watering $3.2m per patient, so the drug’s approval delivered Sarepta a major payday. But in the past four months three patients on Sarepta’s treatments have died from acute liver failure. On July 18th the FDA asked the firm to suspend distribution.

Central-government and provincial planners have spent at least 835bn yuan ($116bn) on the city since 2017, when they broke ground in what had been marshy farmland 125km south of Beijing. It has been touted as a solution to China’s urban maladies, with residents promised short commutes through leafy parks instead of cough-inducing traffic jams. The city is part, officials say, of a “one-thousand-year plan” in civilisation-building.

It has remained one of Russia’s biggest customers ever since. Today it imports nearly 2m b/d of Russian “sour”, heavy crude, representing 35-40% of its crude imports.

The soundtrack of Florida’s swamplands is a constant call of cicadas. But an hour from downtown Miami there are almost no people. The narrow offshoots of the main road take you deeper into the grasses, where snakes and alligators lie lazily in and around still water. One bend in the road, however, is busy. A blue sign for “Alligator Alcatraz” marks the turnoff where pickup trucks circle hours before dawn. When your correspondent approached the perimeter, a guard inside a car rolled down her window an inch. She couldn’t talk, she said: “the bugs are too bad.” She was right: if you reached out and grabbed a fistful of air you could catch dozens of mosquitoes.\nAlligator Alcatraz is Florida’s newest immigration detention facility. On a strip of land once used as an airfield the state is housing over 900 immigrants in the kind of plastic tents used for big parties. The facility opened at the beginning of July. The governor, Ron DeSantis, eager to get back in MAGA’s good graces after challenging Donald Trump in the presidential primary, pitched the administration on Florida being the site of its next big immigration project. James Uthmeier, his attorney-general, suggested putting a detention facility in the Everglades where fugitives would have “nowhere to go, nowhere to hide”. The administration embraced the idea. Within just over a week Florida used emergency powers to seize land from Miami-Dade County and build a 3,000-bed prison in the middle of a national preserve.\nUntil now, states have not played such a proactive role in detention. Unlike most civil detention facilities in America designed for immigrants, Alligator Alcatraz is not funded by the federal government, at least initially, nor run by private contractors with experience detaining people. Instead Florida is footing the bill—so far Mr DeSantis has allocated $245m—and the state’s emergency-management agency is in charge of operations. Because of that the facility looks more like a base camp set up for first responders after a natural disaster than the fenced-in concrete complexes that house immigrants awaiting deportation in places like Texas and Louisiana. The contractors hired for logistics are equally unfit for purpose. Dynamic Integrated Security, a firm that does school security, is recruiting correctional officers for the site. Listings on a job forum say the gig pays $10,000 a month and does not require prison experience, and that guards will receive “on-site orientation” and start “ASAP”.\nAccording to Anna Eskamani, a Democratic state representative who toured Alligator Alcatraz last month, each tent contains eight cages with bunkbeds that sleep 32 men. There is no running water or electricity, so water is trucked in and generators keep the power on. Detainees have reported that the water makes them sick. Despite having air-conditioning pumped through big pipes, the tents are hot. After sunset they fill with frogs and biting bugs. Critics worry that if a hurricane hits southern Florida—as often happens in late summer and early autumn—the tents will flood. It is not clear if the state has made proper evacuation plans.\nThe facility expects up to 4,000 detainees by the end of August, which would make it America’s biggest. Construction crews continue to build it out as busloads of immigrants arrive from Krome, another Miami detention facility, and local jails. Because it is not under federal purview there is no readily available public data on who the detainees are and how many have criminal records. Attorneys have sued over not having access to their clients there; in the second week of July there were no visiting rooms. One of two doctors conducting medical exams told Ms Eskamani that she did not know where the nearest hospital was. Kevin Guthrie, the place’s boss, said that ambulances are called daily for emergencies but so far no one has died.\nThis is not the first time that immigrants have been held in tents. Barack Obama put up tents in San Antonio for children who had crossed the border alone and couldn’t legally be held in adult detention centres; Joe Biden housed Afghan refugees in tents in El Paso. Neither of those camps were set up for performative punishment, however, as Alligator Alcatraz clearly is. Republican leaders are revelling in their achievement. Both the Republican Party of Florida and the National Republican Campaign Committee are selling Alligator Alcratraz merchandise. “ICE WITH A BITE”, one T-shirt reads. Mr Trump says that menacing alligators will keep immigrants in. Those who know the swamps understand that the threat is overblown: alligators do not attack people unprovoked.\nIn Miami, where 70% of people are Hispanic, the deportation theatre is not going over well. Many expected the Trump administration to pick up gang members, but not cleaning ladies and Uber drivers. “Arbitrary measures to hunt down people who are complying with their immigration hearings” is “not what we voted for”, the co-founder of Latinas for Trump wrote on X in June. Conditions at Alligator Alcatraz resemble prisons in places their grandparents escaped. “Pick them up, throw them out, but don’t mock them,” one veteran Republican says of criminal immigrants. Another party strategist who “loves everything else Trump is doing” wonders how a country known for taking in “the poor and huddled masses” can also be “dragging them out to be tortured in the Everglades”.\nA majority of Americans agree. In recent polling 52% said the government is trying to deport more people than they expected; 57% opposed building new detention centres. Last month Mr Trump’s net approval rating on immigration flipped from positive to negative. On July 25th the administration announced it would give states $608m in federal emergency-management funds to build detention facilities. Other Republican governors may soon follow Florida’s lead. They might be wise to wait and see if their own base revolts.■\nAlligator Alcatraz: an exercise in performative cruelty\nMany Republican voters don’t like it\n|Ochopee, Florida\nIn the middle of the night the Everglades are loud.

The soundtrack of Florida’s swamplands is a constant call of cicadas. But an hour from downtown Miami there are almost no people. The narrow offshoots of the main road take you deeper into the grasses, where snakes and alligators lie lazily in and around still water. One bend in the road, however, is busy.

When your correspondent approached the perimeter, a guard inside a car rolled down her window an inch. She couldn’t talk, she said: “the bugs are too bad.” She was right: if you reached out and grabbed a fistful of air you could catch dozens of mosquitoes.\nAlligator Alcatraz is Florida’s newest immigration detention facility. On a strip of land once used as an airfield the state is housing over 900 immigrants in the kind of plastic tents used for big parties. The facility opened at the beginning of July. The governor, Ron DeSantis, eager to get back in MAGA’s good graces after challenging Donald Trump in the presidential primary, pitched the administration on Florida being the site of its next big immigration project. James Uthmeier, his attorney-general, suggested putting a detention facility in the Everglades where fugitives would have “nowhere to go, nowhere to hide”. The administration embraced the idea. Within just over a week Florida used emergency powers to seize land from Miami-Dade County and build a 3,000-bed prison in the middle of a national preserve.\nUntil now, states have not played such a proactive role in detention. Unlike most civil detention facilities in America designed for immigrants, Alligator Alcatraz is not funded by the federal government, at least initially, nor run by private contractors with experience detaining people. Instead Florida is footing the bill—so far Mr DeSantis has allocated $245m—and the state’s emergency-management agency is in charge of operations. Because of that the facility looks more like a base camp set up for first responders after a natural disaster than the fenced-in concrete complexes that house immigrants awaiting deportation in places like Texas and Louisiana. The contractors hired for logistics are equally unfit for purpose. Dynamic Integrated Security, a firm that does school security, is recruiting correctional officers for the site. Listings on a job forum say the gig pays $10,000 a month and does not require prison experience, and that guards will receive “on-site orientation” and start “ASAP”.\nAccording to Anna Eskamani, a Democratic state representative who toured Alligator Alcatraz last month, each tent contains eight cages with bunkbeds that sleep 32 men. There is no running water or electricity, so water is trucked in and generators keep the power on. Detainees have reported that the water makes them sick. Despite having air-conditioning pumped through big pipes, the tents are hot. After sunset they fill with frogs and biting bugs. Critics worry that if a hurricane hits southern Florida—as often happens in late summer and early autumn—the tents will flood. It is not clear if the state has made proper evacuation plans.\nThe facility expects up to 4,000 detainees by the end of August, which would make it America’s biggest.

To ward off threats the eu, Japan and South Korea have all hurriedly made deals with America.

EU exports to America will be subject to a 15% tariff. Mr Trump had threatened 30%. The 15% duty applies to cars made in the EU, a lower rate than Mr Trump’s sectoral levy. Meanwhile, the bloc will eliminate tariffs on American-made vehicles and a range of other goods, including aircraft and chipmaking equipment. The EU also committed to buying more American energy and investing more in the United States. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, insisted the deal was “the best we could get”.\nExplore more\nThe world this week\nAugust 2nd 2025From the August 2nd 2025 edition\nDiscover stories from this section and more in the list of contents\nExplore the edition", "published": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 13:02:38 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.economist.com/latest/rss.xml"}

Think of it as a kind of bulk-trade ballet, set to a score of horns, beeps and roaring engines. At the back of warehouses, staff in branded polo shirts handle crates of fresh produce. At the front, wholesale shops entice customers from elsewhere in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and beyond. The one-square-km market, already the largest such hub in the Middle East, plans to double in size to cater to the Gulf’s expanding population. It is one symbol of the region’s consumer appetites. It is also the secret theatre for smuggling on a grand scale—crushing local farmers, compromising supermarket supply chains and providing a lifeline to Iran.\nThe Islamic Republic, on the other side of the Gulf, is in a serious pickle. After its war with Israel, it is more isolated than ever. Its oil exports are still flowing, but it is struggling to collect the proceeds because America keeps cranking up sanctions on anyone helping it move money. Britain, France and Germany are threatening to restore their own embargoes unless it resumes nuclear negotiations in earnest. That is pushing Iran to find new ways to pay for the foreign goods it so desperately needs. Flooding the Gulf with fruit and veg is one of them. Iran now supplies nine out of ten cauliflowers, tomatoes and watermelons imported by the UAE, a near-monopoly built in just a few years.\nImports to UAE, kilotonnes\nFrom Iran\nFrom rest of world\nTomatoes\n0.0\n↑ NaN% on 2018\nCelery\n0.0\n↑ NaN%\nCucumbers\n0.0\n↑ NaN%\nAubergines\n0.0\n↑ NaN%\nHead lettuce\n0.0\n↑ NaN%\nMushrooms\n0.0\n↑ NaN%\nIran's greenhouse offensive has already crushed rivals in more than a dozen fruit and vegetable markets. As volumes boom, quality is improving, too. Berries could be next on the menu.\nThat is a baffling phenomenon. Although Iran’s food exports are not under direct sanctions, most shippers, banks and retailers think the country is too risky to bother dealing with. That should make it impossible for its farm trade to thrive. And there is another puzzle. If you visit supermarkets in Dubai, you will see few obvious signs of Iran’s success. A paltry amount of shelf space is dedicated to Persian produce. So who is buying Iran’s booming food exports? And where do the groceries end up?\nTo find out, The Economist has talked to a range of farmers, wholesalers and retailers, as well as clandestine traders in Iranian goods. To confirm what they told us, we gathered proprietary trade data and corroborated it with official figures. Our investigation suggests groceries from Iran are being flogged in secret and en masse to unknowing customers across the Gulf—including countries that profess to import none, such as Saudi Arabia. The intricate supply chain reveals conflicts of interest at the highest levels. Middlemen make fortunes; local farmers get squeezed. Iran made perhaps $4bn-5bn from such exports in 2024. And it is just getting started.\nBlessed with a varied climate, fertile soil and ample sunlight, Iran has the natural endowments to be an agricultural powerhouse. The industry, which provides a living for 23m Iranians and 80% of their food, already accounts for a fifth of non-oil exports. The government subsidises water, fertilisers and energy until they are virtually free. It also bankrolls farmers so they can afford the nifty technology, such as hydroponics, to grow high-value produce. Iran’s greenhouse cultivation has more than tripled in area since the early 2010s. Much of its modern irrigation equipment comes indirectly from Israel, a leader in the field. (It usually arrives as part of bigger packages of kit and services provided by companies based in friendlier countries, such as the Netherlands.) Lately a growing share of the equipment has also come from China and Russia.\nThe government bestows such largesse on farmers because their foreign sales are now so valuable to the country. Their exports are one of the few ways the country can obtain the imported goods it so desperately needs. Foreign currencies, such as dollars and dirhams, are vanishingly scarce and therefore exceedingly precious. Anything that eases this hard-currency constraint is worth lavishing with vast domestic resources.\nThe veggie-melon hegemon\nNeither Iran nor the UAE release up-to-date, detailed trade figures. But we managed to gather private data, based on customs reports from third countries, which provide a fresh and comprehensive picture. Although the source wishes to remain anonymous, The Economist has cross-checked its figures with partial statistics released by the United Nations and other official bodies. The numbers suggest Iran’s strategy is proving wildly successful. It already dominates the market for 15 commodities in the UAE, from aubergines to melons. The story is similar, on a smaller scale, in Oman and Qatar. Volumes are soaring; quality is improving, too. Once limited to basic tomatoes on the vine, Iran now excels at the cherry variety, the trickiest kind. Sources say it is building strawberry farms which could crush the competition in two to three years.\nTo understand how Iran’s produce gets to market, start at the farm gate. Unlike oil, which is pumped by a state-owned monopoly, the country’s veggies are produced by 36,000 small growers. That output is bundled and stacked onto trailers, which are towed to Bandar Lengeh in the south of Iran. It is then loaded at dawn onto smallish ships, which ferry it to Sharjah, in the UAE’s north. The journey takes only six hours. Transporting a container of fruit from Iran’s farms to Emirati warehouses costs just 8,000 dirhams ($2,200). Shipping fruit from Egypt or Turkey costs four times as much.\nMost of the Iranian produce coming into Sharjah is registered at customs. But then it has to be paid for. Doing so openly is hard, because Emirati banks are reluctant to process transactions involving Iran. The trade therefore relies on an informal payment system called hundi. It is run by tiny entities with offices across Dubai, which often feature “transportation”, “goods” and “services” in their company names. In the UAE, their agents collect dirhams from food importers, which they pass on to exporters of appliances, auto parts and machinery that Iran desperately needs. These goods are then shipped across the Gulf to Iran. Foodstuffs, priced in Iranian rials, flow one way. Vital manufactured goods, priced in dirhams or dollars, flow in the opposite direction. But dirhams need never be exchanged for rials.\nFrom Sharjah, local lorries pull the trailers to Al Aweer—which is where the real magic happens. The Gulf-wide trade in Iranian produce is run by the market’s wholesalers, according to interviews with direct witnesses. It is they who place orders with Iranian traders, find buyers in the UAE and beyond, and orchestrate logistics. They also feed intelligence back to Iran on the evolution of consumer demand, say two market participants. Emirati merchants are behind Iran’s novel push into strawberries, for example.\nWholesalers rarely import from Iran directly, preferring to source the goods via one or more intermediaries. That affords some deniability. In a message seen by The Economist, an executive at one such firm makes oblique references to his Iranian offerings, boasting about the big volumes he is able to secure. Most wholesalers of Iranian goods also hide their origin by mixing them with groceries from elsewhere. Camouflaging teams sometimes occupy a warehouse’s entire floor. One classic trick is to keep legitimate produce on the top layer of a box while swapping the rest for cheaper fruit. Sometimes the Iranian food is repackaged in fake versions of boxes from reputable brands, in the hope of deterring inspections.\nThese tactics shield wholesalers from unwanted scrutiny. Hiding Iranian fruit also helps them make a lot more money. On the day we visited one trader in Al Aweer, he had a container of cut-price Iranian broccoli just outside his office. In 2024, he said, an Iranian exporter offered him ten containers a day of tomatoes—equivalent to 200 tonnes—at the cost of 1 dirham per kg (including transport). Farmers in the UAE must typically charge 2 dirhams per kg to break even; Dutch supplies cost at least five times that. By pretending they are selling full boxes of this pricier fruit, without any cheap Iranian varieties in the mix, wholesalers inflate their margins.\nThe same goes for the supermarkets that buy their produce. Purchasing officers who turn a blind eye to the fraud often get a kickback from the wholesaler. It is not rare for managers of fruit-and-vegetable sections to do some blending themselves, too. They might mix Iranian tomatoes with Dutch varieties to make a bigger display. “Instead of 4-5 dirhams, they sell the lot for 20-25 dirhams” per kg, says an insider. There is a lot of money to be made. One local supermarket chain is known for flying its staff in business class and lodging them in five-star hotels. Other UAE supermarkets, which include the local franchises of European giants like Carrefour and Waitrose, try harder to root out the deception. That explains why many retailers replace their grocery chiefs nearly every year.\nRootless veggies and undercover kiwis\nThe UAE is also a base for shady re-exports. One insider reckons a third of the country’s imports of Iranian veggies end up in other countries. Much of this produce is smuggled. Saudi Arabia, for example, has long blocked fruit imports from Iran, a regional rival subject to Western sanctions that are tricky to navigate. The kingdom’s customs officers will reject an entire shipment if they find a lone box with Farsi writing or even Persian numbers. Its enforcers also require sanitary certificates for incoming cargo that specify where it is from. Yet fooling them is easy, says an Emirati trader who does it a lot. “We just put a sticker on the carton with a new origin: Azerbaijan, Turkey—anything but Iran.” To launder Iranian produce, traders also re-use paperwork issued for legitimate shipments: Italian kiwis and Spanish broccoli are frequent covers.\nThis kind of fruit impersonation annoys bona fide exporters. Diplomats from various European countries have complained about it, to no avail. The crushing dominance of Iranian produce, facilitated by local firms, also makes a mockery of government plans to revive homegrown agriculture. In its national economic strategy, the UAE aims to top the Global Food Security Index—a benchmark by Economist Impact, our sister company—by 2051. Dubai is building a two-square-km “Food Tech Valley”. Abu Dhabi is planning the world’s largest indoor farm, to grow 10,000 tonnes of greens a year. Sharjah is sowing 1,400 hectares with wheat. Such flashy ventures, backed by a who’s who of state funds and Western investors, are all meant to advance one goal: “enhancing local food production”.\nIn reality, local farms are withering. The UAE counts 35,000 estates, some of them large. One vegetable grower in Al Ain, the country’s farming hub, employs nearly 400 staff to cultivate an area equivalent to 100 football pitches. He says his production of tomatoes has plummeted because a glut in overall supply has dragged prices down. The government’s laissez-faire approach, he says, is “destroying local farmers”.\nEmirati officials are aware of the problem. Their trade analysts have access to up-to-date data, says someone familiar with the country’s government. Last year the economy ministry launched an anti-dumping investigation into mushrooms exported from Iran, according to a poster seen by The Economist. But the trade continues apace. Adding a layer of intrigue, some of Al Aweer’s biggest wholesalers are controlled by people in power. Silal, an outfit founded to bolster food security during the covid-19 pandemic, belongs to ADQ, one of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign-wealth funds. NRTC, a 50-year-old trader with 1,000 staff, is 41% owned by IHC, a conglomerate run by an Emirati royal.\nWhy would the UAE—and other Gulf countries—tolerate Iran’s green invasion? Perhaps they hope cheap imports will keep inflation down. They may also think that appeasing Iran will reduce the chances it lashes out against them if Israel strikes again. Some even posit that some Gulf leaders are ready to sacrifice local farming to help save scarce groundwater in a notoriously dry part of the world. Whatever the reason, relying on Iran is hardly a safe choice. Should it be bombed again, trade may dwindle. More frequent droughts are making its output increasingly volatile anyway, exposing importers to price shocks. However tempting, bingeing on Iranian produce looks like a recipe for trouble. ■\nWe uncover the secret food trade that corrupts Iran's neighbours\n|Al Aweer and Dubai\nIn the small town of Al Aweer, about 20km east of Dubai’s city centre, lorries full of fruit and vegetables approach, circle and pass each other, in a skilful dance.

The government subsidises water, fertilisers and energy until they are virtually free. It also bankrolls farmers so they can afford the nifty technology, such as hydroponics, to grow high-value produce. Iran’s greenhouse cultivation has more than tripled in area since the early 2010s. Much of its modern irrigation equipment comes indirectly from Israel, a leader in the field. (It usually arrives as part of bigger packages of kit and services provided by companies based in friendlier countries, such as the Netherlands.) Lately a growing share of the equipment has also come from China and Russia.\nThe government bestows such largesse on farmers because their foreign sales are now so valuable to the country. Their exports are one of the few ways the country can obtain the imported goods it so desperately needs. Foreign currencies, such as dollars and dirhams, are vanishingly scarce and therefore exceedingly precious. Anything that eases this hard-currency constraint is worth lavishing with vast domestic resources.\nThe veggie-melon hegemon\nNeither Iran nor the UAE release up-to-date, detailed trade figures. But we managed to gather private data, based on customs reports from third countries, which provide a fresh and comprehensive picture. Although the source wishes to remain anonymous, The Economist has cross-checked its figures with partial statistics released by the United Nations and other official bodies. The numbers suggest Iran’s strategy is proving wildly successful. It already dominates the market for 15 commodities in the UAE, from aubergines to melons. The story is similar, on a smaller scale, in Oman and Qatar. Volumes are soaring; quality is improving, too. Once limited to basic tomatoes on the vine, Iran now excels at the cherry variety, the trickiest kind. Sources say it is building strawberry farms which could crush the competition in two to three years.\nTo understand how Iran’s produce gets to market, start at the farm gate. Unlike oil, which is pumped by a state-owned monopoly, the country’s veggies are produced by 36,000 small growers. That output is bundled and stacked onto trailers, which are towed to Bandar Lengeh in the south of Iran. It is then loaded at dawn onto smallish ships, which ferry it to Sharjah, in the UAE’s north. The journey takes only six hours. Transporting a container of fruit from Iran’s farms to Emirati warehouses costs just 8,000 dirhams ($2,200). Shipping fruit from Egypt or Turkey costs four times as much.\nMost of the Iranian produce coming into Sharjah is registered at customs. But then it has to be paid for. Doing so openly is hard, because Emirati banks are reluctant to process transactions involving Iran. The trade therefore relies on an informal payment system called hundi. It is run by tiny entities with offices across Dubai, which often feature “transportation”, “goods” and “services” in their company names. In the UAE, their agents collect dirhams from food importers, which they pass on to exporters of appliances, auto parts and machinery that Iran desperately needs. These goods are then shipped across the Gulf to Iran. Foodstuffs, priced in Iranian rials, flow one way. Vital manufactured goods, priced in dirhams or dollars, flow in the opposite direction. But dirhams need never be exchanged for rials.\nFrom Sharjah, local lorries pull the trailers to Al Aweer—which is where the real magic happens. The Gulf-wide trade in Iranian produce is run by the market’s wholesalers, according to interviews with direct witnesses. It is they who place orders with Iranian traders, find buyers in the UAE and beyond, and orchestrate logistics. They also feed intelligence back to Iran on the evolution of consumer demand, say two market participants. Emirati merchants are behind Iran’s novel push into strawberries, for example.\nWholesalers rarely import from Iran directly, preferring to source the goods via one or more intermediaries. That affords some deniability. In a message seen by The Economist, an executive at one such firm makes oblique references to his Iranian offerings, boasting about the big volumes he is able to secure. Most wholesalers of Iranian goods also hide their origin by mixing them with groceries from elsewhere. Camouflaging teams sometimes occupy a warehouse’s entire floor. One classic trick is to keep legitimate produce on the top layer of a box while swapping the rest for cheaper fruit. Sometimes the Iranian food is repackaged in fake versions of boxes from reputable brands, in the hope of deterring inspections.\nThese tactics shield wholesalers from unwanted scrutiny. Hiding Iranian fruit also helps them make a lot more money. On the day we visited one trader in Al Aweer, he had a container of cut-price Iranian broccoli just outside his office. In 2024, he said, an Iranian exporter offered him ten containers a day of tomatoes—equivalent to 200 tonnes—at the cost of 1 dirham per kg (including transport). Farmers in the UAE must typically charge 2 dirhams per kg to break even; Dutch supplies cost at least five times that. By pretending they are selling full boxes of this pricier fruit, without any cheap Iranian varieties in the mix, wholesalers inflate their margins.\nThe same goes for the supermarkets that buy their produce. Purchasing officers who turn a blind eye to the fraud often get a kickback from the wholesaler. It is not rare for managers of fruit-and-vegetable sections to do some blending themselves, too. They might mix Iranian tomatoes with Dutch varieties to make a bigger display. “Instead of 4-5 dirhams, they sell the lot for 20-25 dirhams” per kg, says an insider. There is a lot of money to be made. One local supermarket chain is known for flying its staff in business class and lodging them in five-star hotels. Other UAE supermarkets, which include the local franchises of European giants like Carrefour and Waitrose, try harder to root out the deception. That explains why many retailers replace their grocery chiefs nearly every year.\nRootless veggies and undercover kiwis\nThe UAE is also a base for shady re-exports. One insider reckons a third of the country’s imports of Iranian veggies end up in other countries. Much of this produce is smuggled. Saudi Arabia, for example, has long blocked fruit imports from Iran, a regional rival subject to Western sanctions that are tricky to navigate. The kingdom’s customs officers will reject an entire shipment if they find a lone box with Farsi writing or even Persian numbers. Its enforcers also require sanitary certificates for incoming cargo that specify where it is from. Yet fooling them is easy, says an Emirati trader who does it a lot. “We just put a sticker on the carton with a new origin: Azerbaijan, Turkey—anything but Iran.” To launder Iranian produce, traders also re-use paperwork issued for legitimate shipments: Italian kiwis and Spanish broccoli are frequent covers.\nThis kind of fruit impersonation annoys bona fide exporters. Diplomats from various European countries have complained about it, to no avail. The crushing dominance of Iranian produce, facilitated by local firms, also makes a mockery of government plans to revive homegrown agriculture. In its national economic strategy, the UAE aims to top the Global Food Security Index—a benchmark by Economist Impact, our sister company—by 2051. Dubai is building a two-square-km “Food Tech Valley”. Abu Dhabi is planning the world’s largest indoor farm, to grow 10,000 tonnes of greens a year. Sharjah is sowing 1,400 hectares with wheat. Such flashy ventures, backed by a who’s who of state funds and Western investors, are all meant to advance one goal: “enhancing local food production”.\nIn reality, local farms are withering. The UAE counts 35,000 estates, some of them large. One vegetable grower in Al Ain, the country’s farming hub, employs nearly 400 staff to cultivate an area equivalent to 100 football pitches. He says his production of tomatoes has plummeted because a glut in overall supply has dragged prices down. The government’s laissez-faire approach, he says, is “destroying local farmers”.\nEmirati officials are aware of the problem. Their trade analysts have access to up-to-date data, says someone familiar with the country’s government. Last year the economy ministry launched an anti-dumping investigation into mushrooms exported from Iran, according to a poster seen by The Economist. But the trade continues apace. Adding a layer of intrigue, some of Al Aweer’s biggest wholesalers are controlled by people in power. Silal, an outfit founded to bolster food security during the covid-19 pandemic, belongs to ADQ, one of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign-wealth funds. NRTC, a 50-year-old trader with 1,000 staff, is 41% owned by IHC, a conglomerate run by an Emirati royal.\nWhy would the UAE—and other Gulf countries—tolerate Iran’s green invasion? Perhaps they hope cheap imports will keep inflation down. They may also think that appeasing Iran will reduce the chances it lashes out against them if Israel strikes again. Some even posit that some Gulf leaders are ready to sacrifice local farming to help save scarce groundwater in a notoriously dry part of the world. Whatever the reason, relying on Iran is hardly a safe choice. Should it be bombed again, trade may dwindle. More frequent droughts are making its output increasingly volatile anyway, exposing importers to price shocks. However tempting, bingeing on Iranian produce looks like a recipe for trouble. ■\nWe uncover the secret food trade that corrupts Iran's neighbours\n|Al Aweer and Dubai\nIn the small town of Al Aweer, about 20km east of Dubai’s city centre, lorries full of fruit and vegetables approach, circle and pass each other, in a skilful dance. Think of it as a kind of bulk-trade ballet, set to a score of horns, beeps and roaring engines. At the back of warehouses, staff in branded polo shirts handle crates of fresh produce. At the front, wholesale shops entice customers from elsewhere in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and beyond. The one-square-km market, already the largest such hub in the Middle East, plans to double in size to cater to the Gulf’s expanding population. It is one symbol of the region’s consumer appetites. It is also the secret theatre for smuggling on a grand scale—crushing local farmers, compromising supermarket supply chains and providing a lifeline to Iran.\nThe Islamic Republic, on the other side of the Gulf, is in a serious pickle. After its war with Israel, it is more isolated than ever. Its oil exports are still flowing, but it is struggling to collect the proceeds because America keeps cranking up sanctions on anyone helping it move money. Britain, France and Germany are threatening to restore their own embargoes unless it resumes nuclear negotiations in earnest. That is pushing Iran to find new ways to pay for the foreign goods it so desperately needs. Flooding the Gulf with fruit and veg is one of them. Iran now supplies nine out of ten cauliflowers, tomatoes and watermelons imported by the UAE, a near-monopoly built in just a few years.\nImports to UAE, kilotonnes\nFrom Iran\nFrom rest of world\nTomatoes\n0.0\n↑ NaN% on 2018\nCelery\n0.0\n↑ NaN%\nCucumbers\n0.0\n↑ NaN%\nAubergines\n0.0\n↑ NaN%\nHead lettuce\n0.0\n↑ NaN%\nMushrooms\n0.0\n↑ NaN%\nIran's greenhouse offensive has already crushed rivals in more than a dozen fruit and vegetable markets. As volumes boom, quality is improving, too. Berries could be next on the menu.\nThat is a baffling phenomenon. Although Iran’s food exports are not under direct sanctions, most shippers, banks and retailers think the country is too risky to bother dealing with. That should make it impossible for its farm trade to thrive. And there is another puzzle. If you visit supermarkets in Dubai, you will see few obvious signs of Iran’s success. A paltry amount of shelf space is dedicated to Persian produce. So who is buying Iran’s booming food exports? And where do the groceries end up?\nTo find out, The Economist has talked to a range of farmers, wholesalers and retailers, as well as clandestine traders in Iranian goods. To confirm what they told us, we gathered proprietary trade data and corroborated it with official figures. Our investigation suggests groceries from Iran are being flogged in secret and en masse to unknowing customers across the Gulf—including countries that profess to import none, such as Saudi Arabia. The intricate supply chain reveals conflicts of interest at the highest levels. Middlemen make fortunes; local farmers get squeezed. Iran made perhaps $4bn-5bn from such exports in 2024. And it is just getting started.\nBlessed with a varied climate, fertile soil and ample sunlight, Iran has the natural endowments to be an agricultural powerhouse. The industry, which provides a living for 23m Iranians and 80% of their food, already accounts for a fifth of non-oil exports.

{"title": "The climate needs a politics of the possible", "url": "https://www.economist.com/interactive/leaders/2025/07/31/the-climate-needs-a-politics-of-the-possible", "text": "Curbing climate change was never going to be easy. The fundamental energy balance of a planet cannot be changed overnight; nor can a fossil-fuel-based economy that serves billions of people be replaced without furious political objections. But today the problem looks particularly hard.\nOn July 29th, continuing President Donald Trump’s gutting of efforts to reduce emissions, America’s Environmental Protection Agency said it would renounce its main authority to regulate greenhouse gases. That goes along with his reckless attacks on climate science. In Europe the war in Ukraine has spurred growth in defence budgets, squeezing spending on green policies, which also face renewed political opposition. Some voters think the cost of cutting emissions is too high, or should fall on others. In poor countries, which have historically emitted far less than rich ones, many resent green policies they see as foreign and heedless of the desperate local need for energy. Sensing the political winds, big global firms have gone quiet about greenery, though many still pursue it. None of this deprives the world of its technical ability to decarbonise a great deal of its economy; on that score things have never looked better. The cost of clean energy is tumbling, as the demand for it continues to grow.\nThe problem is politics. Many people do not believe that the strict “net zero” targets to which some governments have tied their climate policies are in their interest—or that they will bring benefits to anyone else. Some think they are being taken for chumps, paying good money to meet bad targets while businesses and people elsewhere are belching out carbon, chuckling as they do so. Seeing an ever-more-powerful China emitting more than Europe and America combined makes resentful Western voters seethe.\nThe scientific rationale for net zero is strong. An end to warming requires the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to stop increasing. That means either a world with no such emissions or one which takes as much greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere as it puts in (the “net” in net zero). The logic is inescapable. The political rationale is clear, too. Saying you will hit net zero by a certain date is a definite goal, easily articulated. Hard, ambitious targets have advantages: you never know for sure what can be done until you try.\nHowever, reaching net zero in the nearish future would require emission cuts to be quick, deep—and painful. For countries which have not yet seen any decline in emissions—which, worldwide, is most of them—the steepest cuts would have to come very early. In many cases such scenarios are barely physically imaginable, let alone politically feasible.\nIf a target is so hard that it cannot win consent, then it needs to be changed. But how? For rich countries to abandon stringent net-zero targets outright would demoralise greens, energise climate nihilists and make sensible reforms harder. Better to find ways to ease them into the “more of a guideline” category. There will be resistance from those who believe that all problems can be solved by “more political will”, but as a famously iron-willed German once said, politics is the art of the possible.\nBetter to be Bismarck\nSome politicians get it. Mark Carney, Canada’s prime minister and an economist, understands that, in many situations, the most efficient way to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions is to tax them. But many voters hate such taxes, so he has been quick to rescind the aspects of Canada’s carbon-pricing scheme that affect them directly.\nInstead of charging for pollution, many governments have subsidised its avoidance. Some subsidies have borne fruit. Extra demand has driven the virtuous cycle of larger volumes and lower prices that have seen wind, solar and batteries become more available and cheaper. Costs are now so low that unstimulated demand will drive them even lower. That more or less guarantees a growing amount of decarbonisation come what may. Even post-Big-Beautiful-Bill America will see its emissions shrink, albeit more slowly than they could have.\nNonetheless subsidies still distort markets and reduce emissions less cheaply than a carbon price normally would. So it makes sense to charge for emissions when it is politically feasible (for example, when it does not affect voters directly). Governments should also scrap the many subsidies that harm the climate, such as those still applied to fossil fuels.\nThey should try harder to reduce the pain inflicted when decarbonisation involves lots of ordinary people. Do not bully them into buying heat pumps when there are too few technicians to install them. Make switching to an electric car easier by building charging infrastructure and letting in cheap imports from China. Apply the same pain-reducing logic to adaptation. Marine Le Pen, the leading French populist, struck a chord when she complained that France’s elite had air conditioning but its masses did not.\nAmerica will play an unusual role so long as Mr Trump is in charge: as a cautionary tale. Some promising clean-energy technologies, such as advanced geothermal and possibly even fusion, now have bipartisan support. But Mr Trump’s war on climate action will leave the country worse off. At a time of rising energy demand, some of it needed to power artificial intelligence—a national-security priority—prices will rise. Efforts to establish an American renewables industry to rival China’s will wither. Voters everywhere prefer cleanliness to pollution and a future in which they can thrive to one that looks dangerous. Those are more potent rallying cries than an abstract target. Stories that make people feel they are participating in progress still play well. The idea of not being subject to swings in fossil-fuel prices is attractive, too. “The art of the possible” may sound flat. But a politics of new possibilities could put climate policy on a more sustainable footing, as well as offering hope. That is what those fighting climate change need to offer. ■", "published": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 11:14:19 +0000", "author": null, "source": "https://www.economist.com/latest/rss.xml"}

{"title": "Nir Zuk leaves Palo Alto Networks after two decades", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001519307#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Palo Alto Networks (Nasdaq: PANW) announced last night that founder and CTO Nir Zuk is retiring after more than 20 years in the job. He will be replaced by CPO Lee Klarich, who was part of the cybersecurity company's founding team. Klarich joins the board of directors and will be responsible for the company's technological vision and leading, organizational, product and engineering development.\nZuk founded Palo Alto Networks in 2005 and built it into one of the world's major cybersecurity players. The company's success has made him one of the wealthiest billionaires Israeli high-tech has produced, with estimated wealth of $1.6 billion by Forbes.\nPalo Alto said that Zuk is \"stepping away to turn his attention to a new set of challenges and untapped ideas he is passionate about pursuing.\" It is possible that the \"challenges\" that Zuk is seeking are in the Israeli media, an industry in which he has shown increasing interest in recent years but has struggled to make an impact. For example the failure of his liberal TV channel Relevant followed by his failure in talks to acquire Reshet 13.\nJust a few weeks ago, Palo Alto Networks announced that it is acquiring Israeli cybersecurity company CyberArk (Nasdaq: CYBR) for $25 billion - the second largest exit in Israeli history. The deal is mainly in Palo Alto Networks shares.\nDespite last night's dramatic announcement, Palo Alto Network's share price has been rising sharply in afterhours trading on Wall Street, probably because the company published strong second quarter results, beating the analysts' expectation of earning per share of $0.89 with $0.95.\n\"I started Palo Alto Networks with a radical idea\"\nIn his resignation announcement, Zuk said, \"I started Palo Alto Networks with a radical idea and the conviction to challenge a stagnant industry with a cybersecurity platform. Our vision has always been to lead from the front, and our recent intent to acquire CyberArk is a testament to that enduring ambition. With the most comprehensive security portfolio today, I am confident in Nikesh's leadership and thrilled to pass the torch to Lee Klarich . He is a phenomenal technologist who will carry that competitive fire into our next chapter. This has been an incredible journey, and I leave with deep satisfaction, knowing the company we built together is stronger than ever.\"\nZuk, 54, was born and raised in Rehovot. In the army he was the head of the development department in the 8200 intelligence unit and graduated with a B.Sc. in math from Tel Aviv University. After leaving the army he joined a small startup called Check Point Software.\n\"There were less than ten people there at the time,\" Zuk once recalled. \"In 1997, I moved to the US for the company and stayed there for a few years. Then I left, founded OneSecure, sold it for $45 million in shares, and left. That's when I founded Palo Alto Networks.\" Since then, his venture has become the most valuable cybersecurity company in the world with a market cap of $117.67 billion.\nPalo Alto Networks chairman and CEO Nikesh Arora said, \"Niir is a legend in cybersecurity, and his contributions are forever etched in our history books.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 19, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 03:27:00 GMT", "author": "Meytal Vaizberg and Nevo Trabelsy", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Israel to widen fiscal deficit target to fund war", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001519250#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Israel's planned fiscal deficit for 2025 will widen to 5.2% of GDP to finance the ongoing war in Gaza and June's operation against Iran. After months of preparations at the Ministry of Finance, the cabinet will meet tomorrow to decide on opening the state budget for the current year and increasing the spending limit.\nThe Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Defense agreed on an addition of over NIS 28 billion for 2025 but in the end the Ministry of Defense will receive an additional NIS 31 billion.\nThe Ministry of Finance says that the budget increase for the IDF should be enough to continue intense military operations until the end of 2025 and also supports a scenario of occupying Gaza. The total spending limit will increase to about NIS 650 billion.\nThe current 2025 budget was built around a planned maximum fiscal deficit of 4.9% of GDP. In monetary terms, this means a deficit of about NIS 98 billion. An increase of up to 0.3% of GDP reflects a widening of the deficit by about 6 billion shekels - a significant amount, but significantly lower than the budget increase that was agreed upon.\nThe main reason for this is a continuous increase in state revenues from taxes, beyond the forecasts that were taken into account when the original budget was approved.\nThe Ministry of Finance also plans to implement several cuts, including a difficult political measure: the return to the Ministry of Finance of about NIS 600 million shekels allocated in coalition agreements for the New Horizon program in the education networks of the haredi sector. In addition, cuts of about NIS 700 million will be made in the budgets of government ministries, and more such cuts in future years.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 18, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:03:30 GMT", "author": "Oren Dori", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Thoma Bravo in talks to buy Armis at $5b valuation", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001519301#utm_source=RSS", "text": "US private equity fund Insight Partners is in talks to sell Israeli cybersecurity company Armis to US private equity firm Thoma Bravo at a company valuation of $5 billion, sources familiar with the negotiations have told \"Globes.\"\nThe deal will likely be completed by selling control to Thomas Bravo at a valuation of $5 billion and by injecting hundreds of millions of dollars into the company's coffers. At this stage, it is unknown what the holding percentage of existing shareholders will be.\nIf the deal is completed, Insight Partners, which focuses on young growth companies, will generate income of $2-3 billion, while other major shareholders include Canadian fund Georgian, Chicago-based GT Squared, and New York-based One Equity Partners, for whom the investment is managed by Ori Cohen. Other investors include Capital G, Brookfield, General Catalyst and Alkeon Capital.\nNearing an IPO?\nAccording to PitchBook's investment database, since its acquisition by Insight Partners in 2020, which was intended to improve the company for a sale, Armis has raised over $800 million in venture capital and loans from Hercules Capital\nThe company announced earlier this month that its annual revenue growth rate (ARR) is reaching about $300 million - a $100 million increase over 2024. Considering this, this is a valuation multiple relative to ARR of only 16-17, low compared to the double-digit multiples at which cybersecurity companies like Wiz or Dazz have been acquired recently. The company was only recently valued at $4.5 billion during a private sale of shares (a \"secondary\" round) in which long-time investors and employees sold shares totaling $100 million.\nThe sale to Thomas Bravo could be ahead of an IPO. In the past, the people at Armis have stated that they want to take the company in this direction, and Thoma Bravo, which invests in pre-IPO companies, as it did, for example, with Israeli company ironSource, may benefit from this. For Insight Partners, which is currently raising its 13 th fund and is interested in showing investors a quick return, this is a sufficient deal in the current timeframe, without waiting for the IPO. An acquisition by a private equity fund, in this case, a change of hands between Insight Partners and Thoma Bravo, serves mainly to liquidate the former's stake while giving a higher value to the acquired company, and allowing it to continue to improve its business performance, or prepare for an IPO\nArmis operates in the critical infrastructure security, industrial and medical devices markets, and competes with other Israeli companies such as Axonius, Claroty and Shalev Hulio's Dream Security. The company was founded by Yevgeny Dibrov and Nadir Izrael, serial entrepreneurs who have also invested in other cybersecurity companies and venture capital funds - such as Gili Raanan's Cyberstarts. Armis has 900 employees and customers include Colgate-Palmolive, airline giants such as United, and the US Postal Service.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 18, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 17:29:00 GMT", "author": "Assaf Gilead", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Norwegian fund disinvests from six more Israeli stocks", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001519243#utm_source=RSS", "text": "The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund has announced its decision to disinvest from six more Israeli stocks due to their activities in the territories over the green line. As of June 2025, the fund held stakes in 61 Israeli companies. Last week the fund announced that it had sold holdings in 17 companies due to various economic criteria, and now it is reporting that it has sold its holdings in six additional companies. Norwegian financial newspaper \"E24,\" reports that the fund now holds shares in only 38 Israeli companies, and the amount of the investments has been reduced by at least $400 million.\nThe wealth fund, which manages about $2 trillion worldwide and before the disinvestment managed about $2 billion in investments in Israel, did not disclose the names of the six companies from which it is currently in the process of disinvesting. It announced that it will do so as soon as the sale process is completed. In the past year, the fund also sold its holdings in Bezeq and Paz due to their activities in the territories. Decisions on disinvestment due to alleged violations of international law are made by the fund's ethics committee, which reviewed its Israel investments following a request from the government earlier this month.\nNot selling all its Israeli holdings\nThe Norwegian sovereign wealth fund's CEO Nicolai Tangen said last week that the fund, \"Plans ending its investments in additional Israeli companies,\" as has been announced today. However, the fund announced that it is not selling all its investments in Israel. During the restructuring of investments announced last week, the fund announced that it was also terminating its relationship with the financial institutions that manage its investments in Israel, and that it would manage them independently.\nTangen was responding to the public uproar in Norway in recent weeks, when a group of Palestinian activists protested that the fund held shares in Beit Shemesh Engines, which it alleged has links to the Israeli Air Force. The government said that the companies in the wealth fund’s portfolio should be \"seriously reviewed,\" and the fund pledged to do so by August 20. Tangen took \"personal\" responsibility for not examining the investments sooner and continued to rely, he said, on the Israeli financial institutions that managed the investments.\nThe issue has become politically charged, with more than 65% of Norwegians supporting the complete sale of all of the fund's investments in Israel, according to surveys. Norway goes to the polls next month, with its center-left government struggling to hold on to power. The left-wing opposition in Norway, as well as public opinion, has turned sharply against Israel since the Hamas terror attacks of October 7 and the war in Gaza.\nThe fund's statement quoted in Norwegian media said, \"(Israel’s) violations have become more serious since October 7, 2023, and they have become even more serious in 2025. The ethics committee has therefore tightened its requirements for companies involved in the (Israeli-Palestinian) conflict. Accordingly, the fund recommended in July to divest investments from six additional Israeli companies that are considered to be contributing to Israel’s violation of international law.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 18, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:00:00 GMT", "author": "Assaf Uni", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

The Boganem family has signed an agreement to sell control of the company (69%) to telecommunications services provider Accel Solutions Group (TASE: ACCL) for NIS 93 million.\nUnder the agreement, controlling shareholders Gavriel and Erez Boganem will sell their holdings in Synel at NIS 23.75 per share, giving the company a valuation of NIS 134 million, 23% higher than its current market cap.\nOn completion of the deal, Gavriel Boganem will leave the company he founded in 1991 as a merger between a number of human resources software companies. In 2000, Boganem led the company’s IPO on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, where it has a market cap of NIS 109 million. In 2022, the company spun off its real estate activity into a separate company, Dorsel (TASE: DRSL), shares in which were distributed as a dividend in kind and which is now traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange at a market cap of NIS 427 million.\nThe buyer, Accel Solutions Group, became listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 2019 through a merger with a stock market shell company. Under the management of Ronen Shor it has expanded into cybersecurity and artificial intelligence services. Since its IPO, the company’s share price has risen 1,250%, and it currently has a market cap of NIS 359 million.\nAt the same time as announcing the acquisition of Synel, Accel, in which there is no controlling core, also announced a placement of shares and warrants with Clal Insurance (TASE: CLIS) for NIS 40 million. Following the placement, carried out at a discount of 7%, Clal Insurance will become the largest shareholder in Accel, with a holding of 11%.\nThe current largest shareholder, which will become second to Clal Insurance, is Rapac Communications and Infrastructure, controlled by Tanhum Oren, with a 10% holding.

IVIX has already been deployed by government authorities in the US, Europe, and Asia.\nFattal said, \"For decades, publicly available data has been underutilized in combating complex financial crime due to its scattered, opaque nature and challenges in deriving actionable insights. At IVIX, we've embraced this mission. By assembling top-tier tech talent, investing in focused research, and leveraging the new era of LLMs combined with modern graph algorithms, we deliver impactful results to our customers. This is the most complex technology I've ever worked on, and it's a true pleasure.\"\nHe added, \"Our Series B success positions us to advance our capabilities and help more authorities around the world stay ahead of the rapidly evolving shadow economy. Together with our investors and partners, we're committed to delivering innovative solutions that create meaningful impact at scale and serve the greater public good.\"\nLaw enforcement agencies have long faced the challenges of traditional methods of evasion, such as shell companies, offshore accounts, and layered money laundering schemes. Today, these challenges are compounded by modern innovations such as sophisticated cryptocurrency networks, high-speed micro-transactions, anonymity and pseudonymity in blockchain, and the explosion of global e-commerce. Illicit activity in these industries and many others has resulted in a $20 trillion global shadow economy that operates largely beyond the reach of traditional investigative methods.\nIVIX combats this global problem at scale by utilizing publicly available business data and graph analytics to index the internet from a financial perspective, giving authorities full visibility into financial crime and criminal networks that traditional methods often miss. In short, IVIX is the intelligence layer that makes hidden financial networks visible - using its OSINT-driven AI and graph analytics to uncover the unseen connections that power financial crimes.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 18, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT", "author": "Meytal Vaizberg", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Rafael teams with Lulav Space on precise drone interception", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001519239#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Israeli defense electronics company Rafael Advanced Defense Systems has signed a collaboration agreement with Haifa-based startup Lulav Space for the development of a drone interception system, sources close to the matter have told \"Globes.\" For Rafael, this is a major project that could be a force multiplier for it in the field.\nLulav Space, founded in 2021 by engineers from the Beresheet 1 Space IL project, is developing precise guidance and navigation systems based on vision and image analysis. The company has raised $1.5 million from Angular Ventures, and has become a prominent player in the field of space exploration sensors - its systems are lighter, more efficient and cheaper than those based on radar or lidar (laser-assisted measurement).\nThe sensors Lulav Space has developed can operate in all satellite orbits from a low altitude of 200-2,000 km (LEO), to an altitude of 36,000 km (GEO). The company has been chosen to provide landing sensors for the \"Beresheet 2\" mission, which was suspended in April.\nIn March, Israeli aerospace company Parazero Technologies (Nasdaq: PRZO) signed a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) to acquire Lulav Space. The deal, which is subject to due diligence and final agreements, was due to be completed in the second quarter. The purpose of the Lulav acquisition was to add autonomous guidance capabilities and EO/IR sensor systems (Electro-Optics/Infrared) for ParaZero's anti-UAV protection system DefenseAir.\nThe main advantage: navigation without GPS\nLulav's autonomous navigation capabilities are not dependent on GPS, which is a critical advantage in airspace saturated with disruptions. Measures such as jamming (disruption of communications) or spoofing (injecting false signals) directly harm the control and navigation capabilities of drones and UAVs.\nIn jamming, communication between the operator and the vehicle is disrupted, until the drone lands or crashes when the battery runs out. In spoofing, an incorrect signal is sent that diverts the drone from its course. Israelis suffered the consequences of such disruptions during periods of escalation with Hezbollah and Iran, when civilian navigation applications like Waze were disrupted.\nAlong with the new collaboration, Rafael recently established a dedicated directorate for threats at extremely low altitude ranges, within the company's Air Defense Division. The division responsible for Iron Dome, David's Sling and the Spider system, which was recently chosen by the Romanian Ministry of Defense in a deal worth €1.9 billion, will also integrate the Iron Beam laser defense system into Israel's multi-layered air defense array, towards the end of 2025. \"This cooperation creates synergy between Rafael's R&D capabilities, knowledge and operationally proven systems - and the flexibility, creativity and technological innovation of Lulav Space,\" explains Rsafael VP and Managing Director C-UAS & Low Altitude Air & Missile Defense Systems Yossi Margalit. \"This combination will allow us to quickly develop interception solutions for an evolving range of enemy scenarios, cheap and effective solutions at a level never before seen on the global market.\"\nLulav Space cofounder and CEO Dr. Noam Leiter says that the company sees the agreement with Rafael as a leap forward. \"It allows us to bring to move ahead with the unique capabilities we have developed - technology that will help break into new markets and reduce barriers to entry, especially in terms of price. We are currently working with the director of the Israel Low Altitude Defense Administration on integrating a variety of new applications with advanced technology for intercepting drones and UAVs, from the level of a single threat to protection against a swarm of threats.\"\nIs demand moderating following the war?\nRafael is working to expand its collaborations with various Israeli startups, and not only in the field of air defense. On deep tech, for example, which has raised more than $560 billion in the last decade in the US, the company is collaborating with Israeli investment company Elron Ventures to enable tech startups to reduce the risk gap between early development and commercial implementation.\nLooking ahead, Markets and Markets estimates that the market for dealing with UAVs is expected to grow from $4.5 billion annually today to $14.5 billion by the end of the decade. Rafael hopes that the new partnership will help it capture a major share of this developing market.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 18, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 12:03:00 GMT", "author": "Dean Shmuel Elmas", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Metro tax underway", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001519235#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Today, Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich signed the regulations governing collection of the Metro betterment levy, which will apply to owners of property near the stations of the Metro underground railway under construction in the Gush Dan (Greater Tel Aviv) area, and which is intended to finance the Metro project.\nUnder the Metro Law, a precondition for selling rights in land in areas defined in National Outline Plan 70 as impacted by the project is the payment of a levy, the size of which is derived from an appraisal of the increase in value of the land as a result of the project, as assessed by the Local Building and Planning Committee in whose jurisdiction the land is situated.\nThe regulations approved today state that the entity authorized to certify that the owner of the land has paid the levy will be the Israel Tax Authority. Without confirmation by the Tax Authority that the levy has been paid, the owner of the land will not be allowed to change the entry in the Land Registry (Tabu) or to obtain a building permit.\nIn addition, Smotrich signed off on the language of the notification that the local authority will send to the person liable to pay the levy. The Tax Authority will subsequently send notification that the levy is payable through the payments system on its website.\nThe increased betterment levy to finance the Metro was contained in the first part of the Metro Law passed in 2022, which came into force in 2023. It applies to plans deposited from the year in which it came into force. Collection of taxes in connection with the Metro will begin in the coming year.\nAn amendment passed by the Knesset last month represents an important stage along the way to construction of the Metro in the Gush Dan region, the largest ever infrastructure project in Israel. The Metro Law defines the legal framework for the project, which is planned to consist of three lines totaling 150 kilometers and to pass through 24 different local authorities, with 109 stations.\nThe law was passed in part in 2021 and contained four chapters. The amendment to the law adds a fifth chapter consisting of special provisions to remove obstacles to advancement of the Metro project.\nThe main change is a reduction in the Metro betterment levy. Many developers have argued that the betterment levy applying along the Metro route, imposed since the beginning of 2023 and amounting to 75% of the assessed increase in value, is too high, and is in practice causing a standstill in development alongside the route. After many discussions on this point, it was agreed that the rate of the betterment levy would be lowered by 15% until the end of 2030 to 60%, and would be 72% permanently thereafter.\nThe signing of the regulations enables the law to start to be applied, although parts of the Metro project are already at various stages of being realized, including final planning of some of the lines.\nThe government promised that the Metro would be opened gradually between 2032 and 2034, but Haim Glick, outgoing CEO of NTA Metropolitan Mass Transit System, which is responsible for carrying out the project, recently estimated that it would not be operational before 2040.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 18, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:39:00 GMT", "author": "Ela Levi-Weinrib", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

(Nasdaq: ESLT; TASE:ESLT) announced that a European country had signed a $1.63 billion contract for the supply of a range of defense solutions, for delivery over a five year period. \"Globes\" has learned that the customer is Serbia.\nThe order consists of two groups of products. The first group includes long-range precision strike artillery-rocket systems and a broad-spectrum of unmanned reconnaissance and loitering aerial combat systems, from operational to tactical ranges, including personally operated drones. In the second group are sophisticated ISTAR capabilities, including SIGINT, COMINT and electronic warfare systems. Enabled intelligence collection and processing systems will also be delivered, along with advanced electro-optical (E/O) and night-vision systems, combat vehicle upgrade, and protective systems. In addition, Elbit Systems will deliver comprehensive military digitalization and Network Combat Solution, based on the last software generation and cutting-edge hardware communication equipment. This includes intelligence solutions from the C4ISR suite of command-and-control applications.\nThe deal is big by historical standards. The biggest-ever deal by an Israeli defense company is the sale of the Arrow 3 by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) to Germany in 2023 for $3.5 billion. At the end of June, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems won a tender from the Romanian Ministry of Defense to purchase a short-range and ultra-short-range air defense system (V/SHORAD) for about $2.2 billion. Before the Arrow 3 sale, the record sale was of the Barak 8 missile systems (MRSAM) manufactured by IAI to India in April 2017, for approximately $1.6 billion and a month later, the naval version of Barak 8 missiles were sold to India for an additional $630 million.\nNo response has been forthcoming from Elbit Systems.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 17, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 14:01:00 GMT", "author": "Dean Shmuel Elmas", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

{"title": "Iran war depresses Israeli economy", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001519148#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Israel’s economy shrank at an annualized rate of 3.5% in the second quarter, according to initial estimates by the Central Bureau of Statistics. In quarterly terms, this is a decrease of 0.9%. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita fell by 4.4% in annual terms and business GDP fell by 6.2%.\nAll components of GDP fell in the second quarter. Private consumption fell 4.1%, public consumption fell 1%, fixed asset investments fell 12.3%, and exports (excluding startups and diamonds) fell 3.5%. Imports, on the other hand, rose 3.1%.\nThe Central Bureau of Statistics notes that the data \"were significantly affected by the Iran operation, especially private consumer spending and investment in fixed assets,\" which fell 4.1% and 12.3% respectively.\nThese figures are in line with the assessment of the Ministry of Finance chief economist a few days ago, forecasting a hit to the economy in the second quarter of 2025, due to the shutdown of the economy for about two weeks in June during the Iran operation.\nThe chief economist sees partial compensation in the third quarter, \"based on past experience.\" Indeed, in July and August there has already been a certain indication of recovery in some of the data, with Bank Hapoalim chief financial markets strategist Modi Shafrir saying that consumer credit card purchases rose 13.4% in July and August compared with the corresponding period last year and by 3.7% in the last week alone.\nAs a result of the latest war scenario, the Ministry of Finance recently revised the growth forecast for 2025 downward by 0.5% from 3.6% to 3.1%.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 17, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 11:35:00 GMT", "author": "Yuval Einhorn", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Israeli real estate becomes market for wealthy", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001519226#utm_source=RSS", "text": "The home price index of the Central Bureau of Statistics released on Friday fell for the fourth successive month, but in fact, in many cities in Israel, prices actually rose in the second quarter. Analysis by \"Globes\" reveals that the Israeli real estate market is undergoing changes that are not quantitative but structural. The middle class is abandoning the market, and the proportion of buyers of luxury homes is rising.\nThe result is that in several cities in the Tel Aviv region, the region that registered the largest price falls according to the Central Bureau of Statistics, prices of homes bought in the second quarter were actually higher than in the first quarter.\nAccording to the Central Bureau of Statistics, home prices have fallen by 1.3% within four months. In general, the average price of a home in Israel fell by about NIS 30,000 in this period. The district that led the falls was Tel Aviv, where the falls reached the significant level of 4.2%, which in cash terms translates into NIS 145,000 slashed from the average price of an apartment bought in June in comparison with a similar apartment bought in February. This in fact the most important district, and it pulls the whole index downwards, since in other districts there were tiny falls, or even rises.\nIn Jerusalem, the price of an average apartment fell by NIS 15,000 in this period, or 0.5%. In the central district, the fall was 0.4%, or an average of NIS 11,000, while in the south the fall was just 0.3%, amounting to a few thousand shekels only. In the Haifa district, on the other hand, the price of an average apartment rose by NIS 42,000 in this period, or 2.3%. In the northern district, prices rose by a negligible 0.2%.\nTel Aviv market uneven\nDespite the significant decline in the home price index, prices of apartments bought in Tel Aviv were actually 5% higher in the second quarter.\nExamination of the prices of three- and four-room apartments, which represented three quarters of all deals struck in Tel Aviv in the second quarter, shows that the price of a three-year apartment bought in the city rose by 8% to an average of NIS 3.9 million, while the average price of a four-room apartment rose by 6% to NIS 5.2 million.\nIn order to understand the phenomenon, it is necessary look at the general picture in the Tel Aviv market, where the number of transactions has dwindled recently. In the second quarter of this year, 997 apartments were bought in the city, 23% fewer than in the first quarter, and 32% fewer than in the final quarter of 2024.\nAs \"Globes\" has previously noted, there was a steep decline in the number of transactions in the desirable Rova 3 and Rova 4 neighborhoods in the old north of Tel Aviv south of the Yarkon River (bordered by the Bavli neighborhood in the east and Hayarkon Street in the west, and by Bograshov and Shaul Hamelekh streets in the south), which dragged prices down in these neighborhoods.\nBut at the same time as the decline in the number of transactions and the price falls that have hit the \"average\" real estate market, it appears that buyers of luxury apartments have not abandoned the city. Israel Tax Authority data show that 44 homes in Tel Aviv were sold for NIS 10 million or more in the second quarter of the year, which compares with 42 in the first quarter.\nIt emerges then that the exit from the Tel Aviv real estate market is not even across all types of homebuyers, and, at least for the time being, buyers of luxury homes are not much affected by market conditions.\nRecord mortgages on luxury homes\nTo complete the picture in the high end of the market, we also looked at the Bank of Israel’s mortgage data. They strengthen the hypothesis that the real estate market is changing not just numerically, but also structurally, that is, in the identity of the buyers, and is gradually becoming mainly a market for the wealthy.\nAccording to Bank of Israel figures, in the second quarter of this year, buyers of homes costing NIS 5 million or more took mortgage loans totaling NIS 3.6 billion. This is an all-time high; 26% more than the total of such mortgages taken in the first quarter, and 48% higher than mortgages taken on luxury properties in the second quarter of last year.\nThese figures too indicate that the wealthy are less hesitant over buying property, and continue to do so in fair quantities even though special offers by developers are drying up because of Bank of Israel restrictions.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 18, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 08:36:00 GMT", "author": "Arik Mirovsky", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Yemen attack showcases Israeli naval technologies", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001519143#utm_source=RSS", "text": "In the early hours of this morning, the Israel Navy attacked energy infrastructure that serves the regime of the Houthi rebels in Yemen, some 2,000 kilometers from Israel’s shores. The strikes were aimed at the Sanaa area, in an attempt to raise the pressure on Iran’s proxies in Yemen to stop launching ballistic missiles and UAVs at Israel.\nThe strike was carried out by naval vessels stationed in the Red Sea, led by a Sa’ar 6 missile ship, originally intended for protecting the gas production platforms in the Mediterranean. The Sa’ar 6 class ships are equipped with advanced radar and high-quality protection systems. They carry the maritime version of the Iron Dome rocket interception system C-Dome, which forms part of Israel’s layered air defenses. In December 2023, the fourth and last of the Sa’ar 6 class ships was commissioned, and already at that time Israel conveyed the message to the pro-Iranian militias, the Houthi rebels, and Iran itself, that Flotilla 3 was deployed in the Red Sea to protect Israel against threats from the south and east, with 1,000 personnel at sea.\nIsrael also has Dolphin AIP (air-independent propulsion) submarines that can reach Yemen underwater. On the surface, their range is double, and they are capable of operating in the area of Iran as well.\nAnother important layer that began to be operational with the Israel Navy is unmanned maritime vessels (UMV), also known as unmanned surface vessels (USV). The maritime divisions of Israel’s major defense companies have been developing and selling UMVs for a decade. Elbit Systems, for example, sold the Shahaf (Seagull) UMV to an Asia-Pacific country in 2021, and in 2022 that aircraft took part in the international Digital Horizon exercise in the Persian Gulf, close to Iran. In the course of the exercise, collaboration between seventeen UMV producers from around the world was tested, under the aegis of the US Fifth Fleet, which has its home base in Manama, capital of Bahrain.\nRafael produces the Protector, a USV designed to assist and protect forces. It carries a high-pressure water gun, and the Mini-Typhoon stabilized weapon system. It is intended for missions along shorelines and in ports. Another company that has been active in this field for several years is Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), which, in 2014, unveiled the Katana, also meant for routine security operations, for example protection of offshore strategic assets such as drilling rigs and oil pipelines.\nIAI is also very active in the field of unmanned submarines. Its outstanding product is the Blue Whale, the result of collaboration with German company Atlas Electronik. Blue Whale gathers intelligence by means of a telescopic mast (like a submarine’s periscope) on which are mounted radar and electro-optic systems for detecting targets at sea and on shore. Information is transmitted in real time via satellite communications antennae to command posts, that can be anywhere, at sea or on land.\nSuch developments have brought Israeli companies very worthwhile contracts. Just last week, Polish company Thesta announced that it had delivered satellite communications components to the Polish navy produced by Israeli company Orbit Communications Systems. Three months ago, Elbit Systems won several international contracts, some of them from NATO countries, worth an aggregate $330 million. These included the Seagull USV, TRAPS sonar systems, battle management systems, and electronic warfare and electro-optic systems. The contracts also include projects for upgrading and enhancing maritime platforms - offshore patrol vessels and frigates - as well as intelligence gathering, observation and patrol capabilities, and sonar systems for anti-submarine warfare.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 17, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 09:40:00 GMT", "author": "Dean Shmuel Elmas", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

On Friday, Via submitted financial results to the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) showing that it has been losing $100 million a year, although losses have been narrowing in recent quarters.\nVia's revenue in 2024 was $337.6 million, up from $248.8 million in 2023. Net loss in 2o24 was $90 million, narrowing 23% from $116 million in 2023. Total cash as of the end of June 2025 was $78.2 million. Via's R&D spending fell from $95.8 in 2023 to $88.9 million last year, while marketing, sales and administrative spending rose.\nAccording to the prospectus, Israelis Arnon Dinur of 83North and Chemi Peres of Pitango hold the largest number of shares among the directors (6.2 and 5.5 million Class A common shares, respectively). Exor is the largest shareholder, with 14.1 million common shares, followed by 83North with 6.2 million shares, and Pitango with 5.5 million shares.\nSecond attempt at an IPO\nVia was founded by Daniel Ramot and Oren Shoval, graduates of the IDF's Talpiot unit. The company has developed a transport service management system using a smart algorithm that calculates the pick-up point, route and drop-off point of passengers. It began as a company operating services in large cities such as New York, Chicago and operated in Tel Aviv and Haifa through local partners. Eventually, the company changed its business focus and became a provider of travel service management systems for municipal authorities, schools, universities and transportation companies.\nThis is Via's second attempt at an IPO on Wall Street since the peak days of IPOs on Nasdaq in 2021. Back then the company missed the window of opportunity when it published a confidential prospectus only at the end of 2021, as the IPO window began to close. The company's most recent private equity round, in February 2023, was at a company valuation of $3.5 billion. According to PitchBook, the company has raised nearly $900 million since its founding in 2012.

In the plaza outside the Tel Aviv Museum, which has become known as \"Hostages Square\", demonstrators displayed a giant national flag with pictures of the hostages. Hamas is still holding 50 hostages, twenty of them believed to be alive.\nMany main roads around Israel have been closed to traffic. The Histadrut (General Federation of Labor in Israel) decided not to call a general strike, but many firms and businesses are closed, or have allowed their employees to join the demonstrations on behalf of the hostages’ families, among them giant food company Tnuva. Technology companies and major law firms are among those leading the strike action.\nIn a meeting with representatives of the hostages families and senior businesspeople last week, Histadrut chairperson Arnon Bar-David said that the Histadrut would not join the strike, on the grounds that this would divert public discourse on rescuing the hostages in a political direction. \"If I knew that a strike, not just for one day but for longer, would end the matter… I would go for it with full force,\" Bar-David said after the meeting. \"Unfortunately, and despite the fact that the heart is bursting with rage, it’s useless.\" Nevertheless, Bar-David called on businesses to allow employees to take part in the strike without penalty.\nMinister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich posted on his X account this morning: \"Israel awakes this morning to a bad and damaging campaign that plays into the hands of Hamas, buries the hostages in the tunnels, and attempts to make the State of Israel surrender to its enemies.\"\nA statement on behalf of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said, \"Every means has been exhausted. The imperviousness of the government and the hard-heartedness of it head and its ministers oblige us to intensify the struggle and to do everything to bring back our loved ones. They are steadily deteriorating, and unless we bring them back now, we will lose them forever.

It is currently the most prominent parking app that is expanding into the worlds of ticket sales and payments for public transport, while Gett has the largest market share in the taxi app market, after Yango weakened following its separation from Yandex, and after Uber, which operates in most Western countries, withdrew from operations in Israel in 2023. Gett also holds the exclusive franchise to operate taxis to and from Ben Gurion Airport.\nHave the shareholders compromised?\nVNV, a Swedish fund with Russian roots, updates the company's value every quarter. It owned about 44% of the company's shares before selling it, and in a report it published to summarize the first half of 2025, booked Gett's value at $209 million, up 13% from last year. Therefore, it appears that the shareholders have compromised on the company's valuation.\nBefore the deal was signed, VNV wrote, \"Even if the transportation activity in Israel slows down during periods of war entering the country’s airspace, it has demonstrated a high resilience in recent years. The recent escalation in the conflict had a negligible impact on the activity in Israel thanks to a very rapid recovery, while in the UK growth is driven by a record number of new users joining the service.\n\"The company continued to build momentum in the second quarter and is expected to close 2025 significantly ahead of last year’s performance. Cash and cash equivalents exceeded $69 million as of June 30, 2025. We continue to support and be energized by Gett’s trajectory. The company’s resilience, consistent execution and growing profitability have instilled great confidence in its leadership and vision: there is a clear sense of optimism about the value creation ahead.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 15, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Fri, 15 Aug 2025 08:58:00 GMT", "author": "Assaf Gilead", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

The Venice route will begin operating on December 1 with two flights weekly. The return fare will be $265. The Thessaloniki route will open on October 28, with three flights weekly. The return fare will be $187. The new routes are in addition to Wizz Air’s existing destinations in Italy (Rome, Naples, Milan) and Greece (Athens, Crete, and Rhodes).\nAt present, Aegean Airlines and TUS Airways fly from Israel to Thessaloniki, while only El Al flies to Venice. Before Ryanair cancelled operations in Israel, it flew to both places. Ryanair is not expected to return to Israel until the end of October, and has thus foregone the summer vacation season. That generally raises the chances of cancellations being extended to the less profitable winter season as well.\nWizz Air’s decision and its choice of these new routes may indicate that it is pinning hopes on Ryanair not returning to Israel. If it does do so as planned, then there will be welcome competition that should lead to lower fares to these two destinations.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 14, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 17:02:00 GMT", "author": "Stav Livne", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

At the same time, the security sector has been gaining momentum towards dual use - military and civilian. Recently, Combatica redefined dual use, with the inauguration of its first gaming park, in Busika, Uganda.\nIn the coming months, a park based on a similar model to the Ugandan facility will open in the US, while a park in Europe is scheduled to begin operating in the first quarter of 2026. Such a facility is also due to be built in Israel. The potential in the US is also great because of the scope of weapons, and the need for an available and convenient ability to train and not necessarily at live ranges.\nCombatica is used to train combat units using advanced AI capabilities. About six months ago, the company unveiled its 2.0 version, which includes more than 50 scenarios, seven maps and even modes for activating night vision devices. Since then, the system has advanced to Combatica 2.1, which includes improved analytics and data, and allows fighters to check the duration of the response and obtain details of the locations of the damage on or in the enemy.\nThe variety of options presented by the system instead of \"dry\" exercises in the army, leads to more effective training, with the use of metaverse (virtual reality) glasses, and the ability of the operator to introduce new threats during the exercise. To operate it in the field, only two suitcases are required, which makes it practical and convenient. In recent months, the growing Israeli company's sales have tripled, both in Israel and abroad.\nMeanwhile, consulting firm Frost & Sullivan recently recognized Combatica as the global market leader for 2025 in the field of tactical training platforms. Frost & Sullivan found that Combatica excels in its ability to adapt strategic initiatives to market needs.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 14, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 12:55:00 GMT", "author": "Dean Shmuel Elmas", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

The company beat the consensus analysts’ estimate on both revenue and profit, with quarterly revenue of $727 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.01, thanks to the strength of its cloud business.\nOn the release of the results, Nice’s share price jumped by about 4% on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, but it has since fallen back sharply and is now down by 5.2%. On Nasdaq, the stock is down 7.43%, at $137.\nSecond quarter revenue was up 9.4% in comparison with the corresponding quarter of 2024. Cloud revenue grew by 12.2%, and represented 74.4% of the total. In the first half year, revenue grew 7.8% to $1.43 billion, with cloud revenue surpassing $1 billion. Revenue from services declined while revenue from products rose.\nOn a GAAP basis, Nice’s net profit rose to $187 million for the quarter and $317 million for the half. On a non-GAAP basis, the figures were $190 million and $375 million.\nOperating cash flow in the second quarter was $61.3 million. $30.8 million was used for share repurchases. At the end of the quarter, the company had total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.6 billion, and debt of $460 million. Nice recently announced the acquisition of German company Cognigy for $955 million, an acquisition meant to deepen its activity in AI, which up to now has been perceived as a threat to its business.\nThe company reaffirmed its guidance for 2025 non-GAAP total revenue, which is expected to be in a range of $2.92 billion to $2.94 billion, representing 7% year over year growth at the midpoint. It raised its guidance for full-year non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share, which is expected to be in a range of $12.33 to $12.53, representing 12% year over year growth at the midpoint.\nNice CEO Scott Russell said of the second quarter results, \"This performance was driven by continued strength in our cloud business, which grew 12% year-over-year. A key catalyst behind this momentum is the accelerating demand for AI and self-service solutions, with annual recurring revenue in this part of our business rising an impressive 42% compared to the same period last year.\n\"AI is at the core of our strategy, and we are at the forefront of the AI-first transformation in the customer experience market. And this is just the beginning. Our momentum is set to accelerate further with the upcoming integration of Cognigy’s industry-leading CX-AI conversational and agentic capabilities upon closing of the transaction, enabling us to deliver truly human-like, AI-first customer experiences on CXone Mpower.

{"title": "Black Cube: Evolution allowed gambling in banned countries", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001518981#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Israeli private intelligence agency Black Cube has filed with the New Jersey Supreme Court a detailed 118-page affidavit, supported by hours of video and audio recordings, alleging that Swedish gambling company Evolution knowingly allowed access to its online casino games in banned markets. These included countries under US sanctions such as Iran, Syria and Sudan, as well as countries where online gambling is prohibited by law, such as China and Thailand, \"Bloomberg\" reports.\nThe evidence, collected between 2021 and 2024, through agents posing as investors or online casino entrepreneurs, include testimony from current and former company executives, among them Evolution's former US commercial director, Jeff Miller, who described the extent of the activity in prohibited markets and the awareness of management, including the CEO, of what was happening. There are other recordings of Black Cube agents playing and withdrawing winnings from Evolution games in Iran and Syria, without hiding their location, from web addresses with local IP addresses.\nThe current move comes amid a long-running legal dispute that began in 2021, when a Black Cube report submitted to the New Jersey gambling regulator, through a US law firm, was published. The report, which Evolution claimed was \"false, defamatory and unfounded\", led to its market cap losing $10 billion. The regulator’s investigation was closed in 2024 without action, but the court ordered the disclosure of the identity of the person who commissioned Black Cube's report and revelations, although the identity remains confidential.\nBlack Cube says Evolution's denials have only strengthened its determination to expand its investigation to find additional evidence to prove beyond doubt the accuracy of the original report. Evolution, for its part, says it has no interest in operating in banned markets and uses industry-leading solutions to prevent such access.

(Nasdaq: WIX) has announced that it is entering the financial services sector by launching two new products - current business accounts and loans for small businesses. The initiative is in collaboration with Israeli fintech unciron Unit and will allow business owners to manage their businesses and receiving financing directly on the Wix platform.\nWix is emulating platforms like Shopify and Square, which are already managing to combine website building and e-commerce services with financial services\nWix will work with Unit, founded in 2019 by Itay Damti and Doron Somech. Unit’s platform allows tech companies to integrate banking services, such as accounts, cards, and money transfers, into their products, without the need for direct financial operations management and licensing. In 2021, Unit was included in Globes’ list of Israel's ten most promising Israeli startups.\nWix is entering the fintech industry at a sensitive time for the company. Wix's share price has fallen by 45% since the start of the year, amid market concerns about the future of its core business, which is threatened by the rapid development of AI. Tools like ChatGPT and other dedicated platforms now allow users to create professional websites in minutes and at low cost, without using Wix's interface. This undermines one of the key assets that built its success - making website building simple and accessible.\nOperating in a competitive and broad market\nTogether with competition from AI tools, Wix is also facing new players that offer comprehensive service packages, such as Framer and Webflow, which enable the building, hosting, and management of websites and online stores with almost unlimited design freedom.\nThe company also faces competition from social networks like Instagram and TikTok, which allow small businesses to establish a digital presence without a website. Technology giants, including Google and Meta, are also investing in developing tools for small businesses.\nIn this situation, Wix’s entry into the fintech sector is a move aimed at diversifying revenue sources deepening its connection with existing users. The challenge now is to establish trust in a new market, while defending its position in the website building market, which is undergoing fundamental change.\nThe first new product, Wix Checking, is a business bank account with no monthly fees and allows small businesses to manage their financial transactions directly from the website building platform.\nThe second product, Wix Capital, provides loans in the form of Merchant Cash Advances - cash advances given to a business in exchange for a commitment to repay a certain percentage of future sales revenue.\nWix's entry into fintech also faces local competition. The financial market in which it chooses to operate is characterized by a large number of long-standing and reputable players, including large banks and established fintech companies, which have advantages such as extensive experience and operational systems and major development budgets.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 14, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 08:29:00 GMT", "author": "Meytal Vaizberg", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Duty free store opens as Haifa airport tries to take off", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001518974#utm_source=RSS", "text": "At a festive ceremony earlier this week, the first-ever duty free store was opened at Haifa airport by Teddy Sagi's Layam Group. The 200 square meter store will offer practically all the tax free goods available at Ben Gurion airport but without the long lines to pay.\nThe reopening of Haifa airport last December was good news for israel's travel industry and especially resident in the north. If in the past the airport only served aircraft flying out to gas rigs, it is now open to international tourism.\nData from the Israel Airports Authority showed that 67,694 passengers passed through Haifa airport on international flights in the first half of 2025. June was impacted heavily by the operation in Iran and July, August and the holidays are peak season. An additional 21,953 passengers used the airport for domestic flights.\nThe renewal of international tourism from Haifa airport is due to the operations of Air Haifa, a new airline set up by Nir Zuk. Previously the airport had been virtually abandoned for years, except for occasional operations over a short period of time like that of Cypriot airline TUS.\nAir Haifa operates flights to international destinations including Larnaca and Paphos in Cyprus and Athens and Rhodes in Greece as well as domestic flights to Eilat. While Ben Gurion airport is crowded during the peak summer season, passengers at Haifa airport report quick check-in that sometimes takes just 15 minutes.\nEshet Tours VP Shirley Cohen Orkaby explains, \"Haifa airport provides an excellent solution for a very significant region of the country and for the residents of the north. It is a small and efficient airport, the waiting time is short, there is no congestion and you do not have to arrive three hours before the flight. The destinations that can be flown to are very popular among Israelis. I really hope that they will invest in it, so that it will be possible to fly larger planes from it.\"\nDoes the additional airport reduce fares?\n\"Globes' checked the Air Haifa website and found there are almost no last-minute tickets left for August, especially for return flights. Starting fares for Cyprus in August start at $298 for a round-trip ticket. For September, with the decline in demand, there are round trip tickets for $198. In Greece, fares between destinations vary. Last minute round trip tickets to Rhodes start at $448, and in September fares drop to $298. For Athens, fares are slightly higher, starting at $478 for last minute tickets compared with $358 in September.\nAt Ben Gurion airport last minute ticket fares are much higher but in September prices are much more attractive than at Haifa airport because of the much wider choice of destinations.\nA major advantage at Haifa Airport over Ben Gurion Airport is the parking at the airport, which is currently free. Although the airport is not directly connected to a train railway, it can be reached via shuttles from the Lev Hamifratz railway station. For residents of the north, travel costs to Ben Gurion Airport may reach amounts that justify choosing a more expensive flight from Haifa, especially if it saves time and other expenses.\nAir Haifa will remain alone\nCurrently, Air Haifa has three ATR 72-600 aircraft. As part of the company's expansion plan, a fourth aircraft will begin operations in early September, and a fifth aircraft by the end of December. These are aircraft with a relatively small number of about 80 seats, and they were chosen for a reason. Currently, the length of the runway at the airport is too short for large aircraft such as those operated by most airlines - 1,200 meters in total. However, if the runway is extended to 1,500 meters, it would be possible to operate flights from it to nearby destinations and the Greek islands, and if it is extended the runway to 1,900 meters, it will be possible to fly to Europe.\nAccording to Haifa Municipality, the plan to extend the runway at the airport has not been abandoned. The Israel Airports Authority is also working to extend the runway by 300 meters - but even then, its length will not be sufficient for wide-body aircraft. In order to implement the plan, budgetary investment and a new statutory procedure in the planning committees are required - a process that could take years.\nThere is capacity to operate additional flights\nIn its current form, the airport has the capacity to operate additional flights, but its limitations in space and infrastructure make it less attractive to many airlines, which will not allow significant competition to exist at the airport. In the foreseeable future, Air Haifa is the only carrier expected to operate flights, and the company plans to expand its fleet of aircraft and add additional destinations in the East Mediterranean region.\nIn the past, the airport has already proven its importance. During and after the Iran operation, the splitting of flights between two airports, including rescue operations in which Air Haifa also participated, contributed to the operational capacity of the aviation system in an emergency situation.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 14, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 07:45:48 GMT", "author": "Stav Livne", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

{"title": "Tel Aviv home prices falling sharply", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001518970#utm_source=RSS", "text": "\"Globes\" reported a month ago that a penthouse in Tel Aviv's well-heeled Lammed neighborhood in the north of the city was sold for NIS 7.95 million, shortly before the Iran operation in June. The initial asking price was NIS 10.5 million, but the sellers dropped the price by 24%. Since the penthouse did not have a protected room, it could be seen as something isolated, related to the general security situation, but that is not the case.\nA quick browse of the Yad 2 website reveals many homes in Tel Aviv that have dropped in price. For example a three-room 76 square meter apartment on Lillian Street near Kikar Hamedina, has cut its asking price from NIS 6.5 million to NIS 6.1 million. A 109 square meter, four-room apartment in Nahalat Yitzhak, has come down from NIS 4.65 million to NIS 4.49 million. A 100 square meter four-room, ground floor apartment on Tiomkin Street in the heart of the city, has come down from NIS 4.31 million to NIS 4.19 million, and a 180 square meter, 5.5-room, ground floor apartment in the Mishtala neighborhood, has come down from NIS 7.15 million to NIS 6.99 million.\nThere yet clearer examples of price declines, which experienced real estate agents working in Tel Aviv told \"Globes\" about, with the unequivocal message: the slowdown in the city's residential market is being clearly felt.\nA million-shekel drop from the initial asking price\nSome of the realtors operating in Tel Aviv said that they felt a decline in activity, and with it a decline in prices, even before the war. But the actual decline in prices, throughout the city, began in 2024. Data from the Madlan website show that the average price for an apartment in the city peaked at NIS 4.61 million in March 2024, and that by June 2025 it had fallen 8% to NIS 4.21 million.\nIn deals for new apartments, the decline is slight, from an average of NIS 5.3 million before the war, according to the Madlan website, to an average of NIS 5.261 million in June 2025. In the second-hand market, the decline is clearly felt: from a peak of NIS 4.13 million in March 2022, to NIS 3.363 million in June 2025. Since the end of 2022, there has been an 18% decrease in prices.\n\"We are marketing an apartment in the Old North of the city, where the owners asked NIS 6.5 million in September 2024. I believed then that it could have been sold for NIS 6 million, but today it is being marketed and will be sold for around NIS 5.5-5.6 million, down about NIS 1 million from the original asking price, and about NIS 500-600,000 from what it was really worth,\" says Yaron Rosenbaum of RE/MAX-Win Tel Aviv.\n\"For another apartment in the Old North, the owner asked NIS 3.15 million in November 2024. It sold in April for NIS 2.6 million, a fall of more than half a million shekels.\"\nShirli Werner, a realtor at RE/MAX Ocean, tells of an apartment in District (Rova) 3 that was also sold for less than the initial asking price: \"The owner of the property insisted that we put it up for sale for NIS 7.5 million,\" she says. \"We told him that the upper range was NIS 7 million, but we advertised for two weeks at the price he asked for, so that he could feel the market. When he saw that nothing was happening, we revised the asking price to NIS 6.95 million and then the apartment was sold. You can see this as a decrease, but we asked a high price to start with, but with transparency with the property owner who knew that we would update to the real market price. This creates a different level of interest from potential buyers, once apartments are priced correctly.\n\"What is for sure is that, two years ago, at a time when the market was overheating, the situation was exactly the opposite. You could put it on the market at a price of NIS 7 million, and sell for NIS 7.5 million. That's exactly what happened to us at the time, with an apartment on one of the quiet streets of Tel Aviv near the sea. Nothing like that would happen today.\"\nAnglo-Saxon real estate company director of urban renewal in Tel Aviv Ron Weissberg talks in the same vein. He recalls, \"In 2021, the market was absolutely crazy. People felt that if they didn't buy an apartment, they would miss out. Today, experts are talking about 9,000 apartments ready for marketing and not sold in Tel Aviv, and back then it was a case of much smaller numbers, and for sure not at such levels.\n\"I prefer not to share specific details about deals in which there was a price drop, but I say and stand behind it that there are apartments that were sold in the city which were clearly cut by hundreds of thousands of shekels. You see it in ads, in actual marketing, and in deals that were completed. You see significant falls, even taking into account Tel Aviv's high price levels.\"\nEldar Marketing CEO Ronny Cohen says, \"We see price falls throughout the city. There is interest, and there are sales. Marketing is more difficult and challenging, there is no doubt about that, but things are happening and apartments are also being sold in Tel Aviv. By the way, an interesting phenomenon that I've been seeing recently, and that I still can't give a precise explanation for, is that at present more special apartments (penthouses, mini-penthouses and garden apartments) are being sold. As you know, these are the more expensive apartments, but they are currently being successfully marketed in larger numbers. I assume that in the not-too-distant future we will understand the exact reason for this.\"\nCorrection and stabilization, or a 3-year trend?\nCohen describes the lower prices as \"one-off, non-dramatic\" price corrections, mainly in projects approaching occupancy. \"In these projects, the developers and contractors cut prices so as not to be left with unsold apartments when they are occupied, and they do this either through real price drops or through offers of some kind. In general, I have felt these declines mainly in the last year, and especially since the beginning of 2025, but not before.\"\nThe view that the current situation is a market correction is also backed up by the numbers. Although home prices in Tel Aviv fell 8%, according to Madlan, this decline must viewed with the correct perspective. At the end of 2020, according to Madlan, the average home price in Tel Aviv was NIS 3.562 million, so even today, after the declines, the average home price in the city is 18% higher than it was four and a half years ago.\n\"There was a disproportionate rise in 2021, which continued into 2022,\" explains Werner, \"and the market simply underwent a correction in 2022 and 2023. Between 2023 and 2024, prices were generally stable, and there was no real decline. In 2024, there was even an increase of almost 20% in the number of deals, according to data from the Tax Authority. There is no doubt that sellers today are more realistic, and understand that the buyer knows how to check things out and understand how much similar apartments were sold for. Those motivated to sell will price correctly and sell, and this is in contrast to 2021-2022, when the market operated according to the principle of 'any price will hit the mark.' People can look at this as a decline, but it is not really a decline; it's a market that is stabilizing after a disproportionate rise.\"\nHowever, some argue that the downward trend began three years ago, when the government's judicial reform began, and the political-social tension that came with it. The slowdown was then mainly manifest in a steep decrease in activity, but it also brought with it a decline in prices that continues to this day.\n\"We have been feeling a significant change in activity for three years now,\" says Rosenbaum. \"The main trigger was the interest rate hikes that began in the US and Israel, and to this was added the political instability, the reform, and, of course, the war that began on October 7, 2023. In the past 18 months, there has been a clear decline in prices in second-hand apartments, in most areas of the city, and especially in the Old North, the city center and the heart of the city, where the decline is between 10% and 15%. Until a few months ago, it wasn't written about. The statistics showed that prices continued to rise, but we brokers clearly felt the decline.\"\nWeissberg adds, \"The last three years have been bad for the economy, for understandable reasons and they have been especially bad for the housing market in general, and for Tel Aviv in particular. Tel Aviv is an expensive city, and an expensive product is more affected during such periods, especially when you take into account that in Tel Aviv a major portion of the purchases were made by investors, many of whom came from abroad. We saw a halt to this during the reform days, and even more so during the war. We can say that about 90% of foreign investors left the market, and although the vacuum was filled somewhat by Israeli investors, there is no comparison in terms of volume. Activity has clearly decreased significantly.\"\n\"The market has bottomed out and has started to rise\"\nWill activity in the Tel Aviv housing market continue to slow? Will we continue to see significant price declines, or will we see the market recover? The industry believes that the trend is likely to reverse.\n\"About a year ago, buyers started returning to the market, even in larger numbers than on the eve of the war, but the actual number of deals being closed is still low,\" says Rosenbaum. \"It takes much longer to close deals, and many of them 'fall' during the process, and many buyers withdraw. But in the long term, I am optimistic. I believe prices will rise, and a clear distinction will be created for apartments in good condition, renovated and new, the prices of which will increase more easily. Owners of apartments in old buildings, 30-40 years old, without a protected room or shelter, will have a much harder time raising the price.\"\n\"The demand for apartments in Israel, and in Tel Aviv in particular, will not disappear so quickly,\" adds Cohen. \"The birth rate, the increasing immigration rate, the shortage of apartments carried over from previous years, all guarantee that there will continue to be demand and that people will buy apartments. Anywhere else, from a cold and neutral perspective, the current situation should have led to zero sales in the market, but here this is not happening, because of the pressures of demand. They are materializing more slowly, but it is happening.\"\nWeissberg says, \"In recent months, there has been an increase in enquiries, in responses of potential clients to ads, and even a certain increase in deals, but it is a tiny increase. There are more enquiries, but we cannot say we are seeing a surge in sales. It is clear that, looking ahead, this market will revive at some point. There have already been price declines in real estate, this is not the first time there has been a decline and a slowdown, and as soon as the security situation improves significantly, it will happen, and Tel Aviv will maintain its strength and uniqueness.\"\nWerner concludes, \"Last July, we did more than 30 deals in the office. This is a crazy amount that shows the market is picking up. I feel that there has been a radical change for the better in the market, because people understand that the market has reached a point where it is starting to rise. There is a lot of contact with foreign residents. We receive many enquiries from the US, South Africa, and European countries, from Jews looking for a safe haven home.\n\"It is true, today there is still an opportunity, because the market is calmer, and it is still possible to buy an apartment without getting into 'bidding wars' with other buyers that will increase the price. I believe that, in the coming months, the market will clearly return to being a seller's market.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 14, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 06:37:00 GMT", "author": "Yuval Nisani and Bar Lavi", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

{"title": "Investors shunning Israel's homes market", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001518884#utm_source=RSS", "text": "The number of apartment investors, Israelis who own at least two homes, was about 386,000 as of June 2025. This is about 18% of homeowners in Israel, in addition to 1.73 million Israelis who own one home. About 25% of the investors, 92,000, own at least two homes for investment, in addition to the apartment in which they (probably) live. The figure does not include apartment heirs, whose exact number the Ministry of Finance and the Israel Tax Authority are unable to calculate.\nInvesting in homes has been a very popular trend in Israel in recent decades. Low interest rates and price rises in the real estate market encouraged tens of thousands of Israelis to buy apartments for investment every year. But now this trend has ground to a halt.\nThe Ministry of Finance chief economist reports that while the number of apartments purchased by Israelis as their only home fell 11% in the first half of 2025 compared with the first half of 2024, the number of homes bought by investors fell 17%, to an average of 1,000 apartments per month. The trend gained momentum in the second quarter of 2025, with sales falling to a historic low. The monthly average fell to 875 homes purchased by investors. In the last 15 years, only twice has the monthly average not exceeded more than a thousand apartments: during the first Covid lockdown and in the first months of the war.\nThe number of deals has fallen by 50% from last year\nAccording to data from the last decade, about 13,000 new real estate investors were added to the number of home investors each year. But while in the peak year of 2021, almost 30,000 new investors were added to the market, according to the sales rate in the first six months of 2025, the increase in investors this year will be only 8,000.\nThose leading the decline are those referred to by the Ministry of Finance as \"veteran investors.\" Those with a history of buying and selling investment homes. According to the chief economist, between January 2023 and April 2024, they dominated the investment housing market and were responsible for about 70% of deals, buying about 10,000 homes. In this group, multi-asset investors who own at least two investment homes stood out, accounting for about 40% of all purchases.\nHowever, since May 2024, there has been a sharp decline in the relative prevalence of veteran and multiple asset investors within the investor circle. The proportion of veteran investors in the market stabilized at 40% in the first half of 2025, purchasing roughly 2,400 apartments, down over 50% compared with the purchases made in the first half of 2024.\nNegative incentives and high taxes have left their mark\nWhat has caused this heavy fall and why is the share of long-time investors in the fall so high? The chief economist attributes this, among other things, to the first missile launches from Iran in April 2024, but it is difficult to see this as a central or sufficient reason.\nOther negative incentives keeping investors away are: high apartment prices, and especially the talk and predictions of a possible change in trend in the housing market (the Central Bureau of Statistics has already reported three consecutive months of price declines, albeit at a relatively slight rate of 0.6%); high interest rates in the market, as well as the restrictions imposed by the Bank of Israel and the Supervisor of Banks on financial transactions by contractors.\nFurthermore, at the end of 2024, the Knesset Finance Committee approved continued high purchase tax on home investors, which is a minimum rate of 8% (compared with 5% in the past). In a situation where the average gross return reaches roughly 2.5% on renting out an apartment (gross return does not include associated expenses for tax, lawyers, brokers, maintenance, renovation, etc.), this is a tax bracket equivalent of more than three years' returns that is written off at the time of purchase.\nThe alternatives: The capital market or property abroad\n\"There are alternatives to investing in real estate, especially for veteran investors,\" says Nahi Finkelstein, an investor advisor - another popular profession that has seen better days. \"An investor has no reason to put money in a market where prices are stable with a tendency to decline. The market today is less attractive and that same investor will often prefer to invest in the capital market or even in an apartment in Portugal, for example.\n\"Even given that there will be no significant price drop, investors purchase apartments and assume that they will benefit from increases and have capital gains from the purchase. If they anticipate that there will be no such increases, they will not buy. There is currently a relatively high degree of certainty that apartment prices will not rise, but only in certain places.\"\nInvestment advisor Tzahi Kvatinsky agrees, \"Prices, taxation and interest rates have led to a change in trend. A veteran investor tells himself that even if he can allocate 50% equity to an apartment, he will still have to spend thousands of shekels a month on the mortgage compared the the rent, and this weighs. For such investors, the capital market today gives excellent returns, or they can choose to invest abroad.\"\nThe situation is likely to harm those renting apartments\nThe mirror image is, of course, rents. A decrease in the number of investors in the market means fewer apartments available for rent, which could put pressure on rents. All the more so after the Iran operation in June, which damaged tens of thousands of apartments and increased almost overnight the already high demand for renting an apartment.\nLast month, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported a 5.9% increase in rents for new contracts, a figure we haven't seen in a long time. The Bank of Israel Governor also referred to this in order to justify keeping high interest rates. About a quarter of the Consumer Price Index consists of changes in rental prices, which certainly doesn't help to cool inflation.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 13, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Wed, 13 Aug 2025 12:55:37 GMT", "author": "Arik Mirovsky", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

He left Hanaco last year after the affair blew up and after he was sued by the singer Omer Adam and investor Ran Nussbaum over allegations of deceiving investors at foodtech company Infarm.\nLevine, who currently lives in Madrid, is a serial entrepreneur that raises money for his own companies. The new fund called Double Down Is also for investment in Levine's companies and will focus on growth stage startups that have reached the revenue threshold of tens of millions of dollars, some of which are even operating profitably. \"Globes\" has learned that members of the new fund will not join the boards of directors of the companies following investments.\nLaunch of operations - towards the end of 2025\nDouble Down is an opportunity fund raising capital to support existing portfolio companies, and will not make investments in new companies. So far, it has raised, according to estimates, about $20 million of its target, and the launch of its operations is planned towards the end of 2025. Levine and Romanovski are not working to raise capital from institutions in Israel, but are focusing on private investors and wealthy families (family offices) in Europe, the US and South America.\nAmong the companies targeted for investment by the fund: Pontera (formerly FeeX), a pension plan management platform for agents and financial advisors in the US - which raised $60 million 18 months ago at a company valuation of $550 million, according to PitchBook; Oversee (formerly Fairfly,) which provides organizations with a platform that tracks changes in airfares for ticket purchased for employees and managers - and re-tickets when the price falls. Oversee has overcome challenges posed by the Covid pandemic and war, and is now a growing company.\nOther investment targets are: the WeSki tourism platform, which organizes vacations at ski resorts and currently generates millions of dollars in revenue - in the ski tourism market worth $100 billion annually; Cahun Medical, which structures clinical knowledge for Gen-AI use; farming management company Citrii, which provides AI-based information on agricultural produce; software company Dynamo; and the parking app Pumba.\nLevine was Waze CEO on its founding, and later decided to relinquish the position in favor of hired CEO Noam Bardin, who ran the company until the sale to Google. He then served as president and shortly after the exit, left the company to found companies with young entrepreneurs and raise capital for them. Among other things, he was one of the early investors in Moovit and its first board member, before it was sold to Intel. Levine lectures on entrepreneurship at a university in Madrid, and he has written a book on technological entrepreneurship.\nNo response has been forthcoming from either Levine or Romanovski.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 12, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 16:03:23 GMT", "author": "Assaf Gilead", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

Findings is a small Tel Aviv-based firm with 30 employees, which has raised just $15 million.\nFindings has developed a platform that scans supplier systems in organizations with long supply chains and can quickly diagnose problems in areas of compliance, with various regulations and laws in the field of cybersecurity and sustainability. The company's executives say that the system is able to shorten the process of managing supply chain risks in large enterprises from several weeks, as is currently performed manually, to just 20 minutes. The platform is sold to information security managers (CISOs) in companies that are required to comply with certain regulations and rules, such as defense companies, government agencies, banks and industrial corporations, to check whether they or their suppliers are in compliance and receive recommendations for required changes.\nUnlike many supply chain risk management companies, Findings has developed a platform that acts as a digital marketplace for many applications in a way that eliminates the need for vetting for many customers. Once a particular application or company is regularly scanned by its system, new partners can quickly connect to it. Findings has established many networks of such suppliers on its platform in various content areas, such as security, aviation, government, critical infrastructure and finance, and can thus quickly recruit additional customers by verticals.\nCompetitive market\nFindings has maintained a low profile in Israel, without raising tens of millions of dollars each year, competing for talented employees with high salary offers, and without sending out press releases.\nDiginex specializes in risk analysis in the field of sustainability and financial sustainability. The company allows clients to ensure that they meet the required carbon emission thresholds. Among other things, it helps companies meet the required sustainability, social diversity, inclusion and good governance (ESG) rules to attract relevant investors. Diginex sought a partner in the field of cyber risk management in supply chains and found Findings, which has proven that it can work in a variety of industries and countries.\nAmong the Israeli company's clients and partners are NEC and Mitsui in Japan; Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange (LSE), the South African Stock Exchange in Johannesburg; the Polish Industry Organization and the Polish government; IBM, and ST Engineering in Singapore.\nFindings is active in a competitive market for software companies in the field of risk management in value chains - that is, companies that require monitoring and securing supplier activity. The company takes a partner platform approach - a system to which suppliers, companies and technology partners such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft can connect to undergo a faster risk management process or share revenue from customers in the field.\nMillions of dollars revenue\n15% of the acquisition amount, about $45.7 million, will be paid to shareholders in cash, and the rest, about $260 million, will be transferred to them in Diginex shares. The large sum will be divided between the company's two founders - Kobi Freedman and Jonatan Perry, who hold over 50% of the company's shares, the 30 employees and managers who hold options and shares worth about 10% of the total shares in the company, and the rest will be transferred mostly to the company's main investor, an Israeli-Japanese venture capital fund called Magenta Venture Partners, which raised most of the capital in Japan from investors such as the giant Mitsui Corporation. Magenta led the company's $5 million seed round in 2022. Magenta was founded by Giza Fund veteran Ori Israely and Ran Levitzky, together with two Japanese partners, and has raised about $300 million to date. It initially invested in auto-tech investments - in companies such as Valens and Autotalks, and later in companies in cybersecurity, AI and software.\nFindings was founded in 2019 in Modi'in and was initially called IDDRA. The company, which then moved to Itzhak Sadeh Street in Tel Aviv, produces millions of dollars in revenue and is estimated to have surpassed $10 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) from government agencies, critical infrastructure, national security, finance, manufacturing, and the chip manufacturing sectors.\nOne of the company's founders and CEO is Kobi Friedman, a serial entrepreneur who previously founded Comilion, which raised capital from Shlomo Kramer and Mickey Bodai, which he sold to Dell-EMC, and later sold Consienta to Yael Software. In addition to his role at the company, he serves as a member of the New York State Department of Finances Financial Innovation Advisory Board. The other founder at Findings, Jonatan Perry, has served in several senior positions at fintech companies since 2011.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 13, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Wed, 13 Aug 2025 02:51:00 GMT", "author": "Assaf Gilead", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

Now Israeli carrier Arkia is rejoining the fray, with flights starting at the end of November.\nAt this stage, Arkia will operate two weekly flights on Mondays and Wednesdays, switching to Mondays and Fridays in January 2026. The flights will be operated on an Airbus 330 aircraft with business class, and return fares will start at $998, including baggage (suitcase in the hold and trolley bag on board) and two meals.\nFor comparison, for a departure date in November and a return in early December, the price of a flight on El Al will be $860, but with trolley and meals only. Adding a suitcase, which is almost necessary when flying to long haul destinations, raises fare to $955, according to the company's website. The price of a direct round trip flight from Tel Aviv to Bangkok on Thai Airways is $1,126, including baggage (suitcase and trolley), according to the company's website.\nIn addition to direct flights, connection flights with one or two stops are available which make fares much cheaper but are less convenient and can take much longer.\n400,000 Israelis visit Thailand each year\nIn a launch event for the new route held by Arkia, Thailand's Ambassador to Israel Boonyarit Vichienpuntu said that more than 400,000 Israelis visited Thailand in 2024, which \"makes it the most popular long-haul destination for Israelis after the US.\"\nDirect flights to Vietnam\nArkia is also launching flights for the first time between Israel and Vietnam with flights from Tel Aviv to Hanoi on A330 aircraft. Arkia CEO Oz Berlowitz says his company will be the only airline operating direct Israel-Vietnam direct flights.\nFrom January 2026 Arkia will operate one weekly flight to Vietnam with the frequency rising to two weekly flights in March 2026. Return fares including baggage and two meals begin from $1,398.\nVietnamese Ambassador to Israel Ly Duc Trung said, \"The route will strengthen bilateral relations between Vietnam and Israel in the areas of tourism, trade, business, and people-to-people and cultural exchanges. It comes just in time, as the Vietnam-Israel Free Trade Agreement (VIFTA) came into force in November 2024. Due to it, doing business in Vietnam is easier and more accessible, with high-tech, innovation, and startups at the top of the list of priorities.\"\nStrategic Expansion\nThe new routes to East Asia are part of Arkia's strategic expansion plan, which began with the launch of a route to New York last January.\nBerlowitz said, \"Hanoi and Bangkok is not just a commercial business move, but another key step in a careful plan, aimed at placing Arkia on a par with the major international airlines.\" Another goal, he said, is to \"establish the company's status both in the transatlantic arena and in the East Asia arena, which is very popular with Israelis.\"\nBerlowitz added, \"The launch of the route to New York marked the beginning of the road for us - a significant step that allowed us to learn, improve and prepare for a large-scale move like the one we are now launching. After two difficult years of war and dealing with unprecedented crises, Arkia is looking ahead and is working on all fronts: expanding the offer and availability of destinations, upgrading the service experience and creating real competition in Israel's aviation industry.\"\nArkia also announced that the route to Sri Lanka will continue to operate in September and October, as well as from December to February.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 12, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 14:47:00 GMT", "author": "Stav Livne", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "ZIM jumps as management buyout reports resurface", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001518774#utm_source=RSS", "text": "For the second time this year, the share price of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. (NYSE: ZIM) has made a double digit percentage jump on reports that the Israeli shipping company may be acquired. According to reports, the potential acquisition is being led by the company's CEO Eli Glickman, meaning it is a management buyout (MBO) deal, in which a company would be acquired by its senior executives.\nGlickman currently holds 1.2% of ZIM's shares (worth $25 million), and according to reports he may join forces with automotive and shipping tycoon Rami Ungar in the acquisition attempt.\nZIM's shares jumped 14.95% yesterday on Wall Street, to give a market cap of $2.145 billion. After the share price surge, ZIM announced that, \"It is aware of the rumors in the market regarding a possible acquisition proposal. As a matter of policy, the company does not comment on market rumors or speculation.\"\nJefferies marine shipping equity analyst Omar Nokta wrote that he has difficulty seeing a deal that would turn Zim into a private company materialize. He stresses, the details of such a deal are unclear, but according to publications it would be worth about $2.4 billion for the company, about $20 per share.\nNokta says, ZIM is the ninth largest company in the industry, shipping about four million containers per year, and its costs are at the upper end of the industry. He adds that if a ZIM acquisition deal were financed with 50% debt, the interest and principal would increase the amount to break even per container. \"Taking on debt at this point in the cycle would be a big gamble in our view,\" writes Nokta.\nJefferies also raises the question of whether the shareholders of ZIM, which was previously controlled by Idan Ofer, would agree to sell for less than the cash accumulated in its coffers. \"Is it realistic to\nassume investors are willing to accept a take-out offer that comes below ZIM's cash position of $2.9 billion? asks Nokta, adding that the company has traded below cash value for most of the past two years. He estimates that a price of $20 per share (a 12% premium over the market price after the jump on Monday) sounds fair, but he notes that Wall Street can be \"stingy\" with acquisition offers.\nTaking ZIM private would increase its financial risks\n\"Irrespective of the bearish container outlook that has persisted for some time yet not truly materialized, ZIM's platform has been a cash cow,\" the analyst writes, noting that since its IPO in 2021, the shipping company has posted a net profit of $4.6 billion in each of 2021-2022, lost $575 million in 2023, and returned to a profit of $2.1 billion in 2024 (the company reported a profit of $296 million in the first quarter of 2025).\nNokta adds another element that could make a takeover bid difficult: He says ZIM’s high cost structure requires it to have a \"cash cushion\" or an exceptional freight market. He says the company is unique in its ability to capture high freight rates, but this comes with a higher operating cost. \"This has paid off for the company well since the IPO,\" he noted.\n\"We believe it is essential for ZIM to maintain a high cash balance to fall back on in case of periods of low freight rates. Its structure today puts it in a position to generate substantial free cash flow in a strong freight market environment but a balanced \"mid-cycle\" environment or oversupplied \"down-cycle\" market lead it to burn cash. Thus, we find it difficult to envision a take-private transaction materializing: the financial risks would be more amplified as a private entity and yet investors may not let it go for below cash. ZIM may simply be stuck in \"no man's land\"\"\nJefferies recommendation remains \"Hold,\" with a price target of $17, 4.5% below the share's current market price.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 12, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 13:47:00 GMT", "author": "Shiri Habib-Valdhorn", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

The fund's chairman Nicolai Tangen said that the fund had reduced the number of Israeli companies in its portfolio from 65 at the beginning of the year to 61 at the beginning of this month and over the past week has sold its stakes in 11 more Israeli companies.\nTangen said that the process of reducing holdings is not yet over, and \"The fund is expected to end its investments in additional Israeli companies.\" The Norwegian banker did not specify which companies are in question. The fund has until August 20 to respond to the Norwegian government, which has asked it to review all its investments in Israel.\nNorwegian newspaper \"E24\" is the only local media outlet to have published the list of companies whose shares the fund has sold. According to the newspaper, which was not been confirmed by officials of the fund, these are 17 companies in which holdings have been disinvested over the past year: Luzon Group, Turpaz, Azorim, Beit Shemesh Engines, Delek Motors, El Al, Energix, eToro, Max Stock, Levenstein Engineering, Priortech, Rami Levy, Reit 1, Retailers, and Sela Real Estate.\n\"E24\" reports that at the end of the process the fund will remain with 44 Israeli companies in its portfolio.\n\"We should have done this sooner\"\nThe fund reported that it increased its investments in Israel by 500 million Norwegian kroner ($50 million) in the first half of 2025, and held Israeli assets worth $2.15 billion before the disinvestment process. Worldwide, the fund reported returns of about $60 billion in the first half of the year, on assets worth about $2 trillion. The fund holds 1.5% of all traded stocks in the world.\nLast week, following allegations of a connection between the Beit Shemesh Engines, which was in the fund's portfolio, and the Israeli Air Force, and due to next month’s elections in Norway, the center-left government in Oslo ordered the fund to review its holdings in Israel. The majority of the Norwegian public wants to completely get rid of its holdings in Israel, according to polls, but the fund has made it clear that it will liquidate investments only according to defined criteria.\nIn the past, the fund has divested from Israeli companies for their activities across the Green Line, but in its decision in recent days, it decided to sell holdings in 11 Israeli companies that are not in the \"basic index\" of its investments, based on economic criteria. The fund also terminated its relationships with three Israeli investment institutions that managed its holdings in Israel, and said it would operate independently and manage the investments alone.\nTangen said at the press conference that he \"takes responsibility\" for not recognizing that the fund should \"withdraw its financial management from Israeli bodies, because Israel is a country at war,\" and make its investments in Israel independently. \"We should have done this earlier, and we take into account the criticism on this issue,\" he said. He added that it was important for the fund to \"maintain the trust of the Norwegian people.\"\nAccording to a poll on Norwegian television yesterday, 62% of respondents support diverting all investments away from Israel due to the war in Gaza, 19% oppose it, and 19% said they did not know.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 12, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 08:57:00 GMT", "author": "Assaf Uni", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

However, it can now be revealed that during the visit, which included a meeting with Tesla VP EMEA Joe Ward, it was agreed that he would come to Israel to examine the possibility of establishing a Tesla hub for smart transport for Israel and the Middle East.\nTesla is in the midst of a global move to achieve global leadership in autonomous driving, which the company's chairman, Elon Musk, has identified as a strategic goal for the company. As part of this, Tesla is running advanced tests of its fully autonomous driving system, known as FSD, in several locations in the US and China, both as robot taxis and as tests on public roads, using volunteer drivers in Tesla car they own.\nDespite this, Tesla has not yet succeeded anywhere in the world in surmounting the regulatory hurdle that would allow it to begin unlimited use of the technology for its millions of customers. Although there are currently thousands of Tesla vehicles on Israeli roads, whose owners paid about NIS 36,000 for the smart system in their cars, in the hope that it will receive regulatory approval to operate it via a remote software update. But it is doubtful whether this was the reason Tesla insisted on including the software in these models, since the commercial potential in Israel is negligible compared with the volume of Tesla's sales worldwide.\nIsrael's advantages\nIt seems that the real importance of Israel for Tesla is its potential as a kind of ideal \"testing ground\" for the commercial operation of FSD systems in cars.\nIsrael has an advanced technological infrastructure in the field of autonomous driving, which allows monitoring the performance of such systems in the field and studying malfunctions under real conditions. This is a valuable asset for a project with global ambitions, and Mobileye, for example, has been doing this on public roads in Israel for several years, for the global market.\nAnother advantage is Israel's relatively small size, which provides advantages for the navigation systems and terrain recognition of smart driving systems installed in vehicles. Also advantageous is the support of Israeli vehicle regulation for US and European standards, which allows testing the performance of smart systems in cars that meet all types of standards.\nFinally, from the point of view of the automotive industry, Israel is a sophisticated but geographically isolated market. In other words, if vehicles equipped with such systems fail or have an accident, the global resonance of the event is limited, as is its impact on the shares of car manufacturers.\nEasing regulation in Israel\nDespite all this regulatory moves in Israel towards allowing autonomous systems in cars has lagged behind other countries. But last month, a breakthrough was recorded, when the Ministry of Transport allowed, for the first time, the legal use of autonomous parking systems in Israel when the driver is outside the car. Admittedly, this is only one and relatively marginal function of smart driving systems, and even this is subject to restrictions in Israel, such as the driver being within six meters of the vehicle. Still, this is an important step for many customers of models imported to Israel and its timing is probably related to Regev's visit to Germany in May.\nAlmost every new car priced at NIS 160,000-300,000 or more that rolls off the production line in China today is equipped with software and hardware designed to support what the Chinese call \"smart driving.\" That is, a system that is capable of taking on a significant portion of the physical driving activity for extended periods of time and in complex situations. The trend will only grow, and Tesla is also currently placing such systems at the center of its strategic development for the coming years.\nIn the meantime, these systems are not yet intended to replace the driver, but mainly to assist in driving for long periods of time, including complex situations, without human intervention, but with the presence of a driver in the vehicle and their immediate readiness to take command if necessary.\nChinese teams in Israel\nMany Chinese vehicle manufacturers are also currently using Israel as a kind of testing ground to try out the feasibility and upgrade of smart driving systems in vehicles.\nAccording to estimates, there are currently tens of thousands of Chinese-made vehicles in Israel that support such systems, and whose capabilities can be upgraded through software updates. Many are going to need them in the coming quarters. This is a critical mass, which makes Israel an ideal development center for the Chinese.\nFor example, Huawei, which develops smart driving systems for many Chinese manufacturers, and even participates with some of them in the development of entire vehicles, has permanent technical teams in Israel, whose main role is to test the functioning of the systems in real-time conditions. Presumably the removal of regulatory barriers, which is currently underway in Israel, will boost this activity.\nThe Ministry of Transport confirms that the issue was discussed during the visit of the Minister of Transport and the Ministry's director general to Tesla in Europe, during which driving demonstrations were also held of the company's autonomous vehicles, which are not yet marketed to the public.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 11, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 11 Aug 2025 14:04:59 GMT", "author": "Dubi Ben-Gedalyahu", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Israelis stranded abroad in June still await compensation", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001518643#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Israel's Ministry of Finance has announced that it opposes the compensation plan for passengers stranded abroad during the Iran operation in June. According to the main proposed outline plan, each passenger will receive compensation of $150 for five days, and a total of up to $750 per passenger, with two days being paid by the airlines and three additional days by the state. Today, the fourth discussion on the subject took place, with the Ministry of Finance announcing that it opposes the plan, and the decision passed onto Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nAt the end of the discussion, members of the Knesset Economics Committee unanimously approved the proposed resolution of committee chairman, MK David Bitan. He said, \"The decision of the Minister of Finance to oppose providing any compensation as part of a specific outline plan for the aviation industry is an unreasonable decision under the circumstances. We demand, unanimously, that the prime minister himself gets involved, as needed by the circumstances and the dispute between the Ministers of Finance and Transport, and lead us to a fair and appropriate compensation outline without delay.\"\nWhat is the significance for passengers and airlines?\nEstimates are that between 150,000 and 200,000 Israeli passengers were unable to return home when Israeli airspace was closed during Israel's operation in Iran. Airlines reported huge losses during the operation.\nArkia CEO Oz Berlowitz said during a previous Knesset Economics Committee discussion. \"The company has received loads of claims, and we will transfer them to the state as a third party.\" This means: If passengers who sued the company receive compensation, Arkia will ask that the state bear responsibility for this, claiming that it had caused the damage when it closed airspace. This is a legal process that means that if the state does not form a compensation plan, the airlines will go to court.\nAdv. Raz Nizri, who represents Arkia, adds \"There are costs to these claims, which will ultimately be borne by the state, and delaying the process will cost much more. It seems strange to me that the chairman asked for a plan, and nothing has happened after a week and a half.\"\nThe lack of agreement between the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Transport and the Economic Affairs Committee leaves the passengers who were stranded during the Iran operation, and the airlines, in legal and economic limbo. Without a dedicated compensation plan, the existing law, which has not been adjusted to an exceptional situation in which airspace is closed for such a long time, remains the only framework for regulating rights, thus exposing airlines to a wave of claims from passengers stranded abroad.\nMinister of Transport Miri Regev refuses to limit compensation to two days, as demanded by the Ministry of Finance, and airlines are already signaling that they will go to court, claiming that the damage was caused by a government decision.\nPassengers seeking compensation must meanwhile independently file claims with the airlines, which have a clear interest in delaying the decision until they reach agreements on an adjusted plan.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 11, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 11 Aug 2025 12:14:09 GMT", "author": "Stav Livne", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

The fall in fiscal deficit has thus resumed after it fell for eight consecutive months before remaining unchanged at 5% at the end of both May and June.\nIn July itself, there was a fiscal deficit of NIS 4.8 billion compared with a deficit of Nis 4.8 billion in July 2024. The deficit was Nis 37 billion in the first seven months of 2025, half the deficit of almost Nis 72 billion in the corresponding period of 2024, in the early stages of the war.\nThe improvement in the deficit is driven mainly by state revenues, not spending. The flow of cash to the state coffers is still recording impressive growth - total state revenues since the start of 2025 amounted to roughly NIS 324 billion, up 16.6% from the same period in 2024. July itself was relatively strong, with revenues of NIS 48.1 billion, compared with NIS 40.9 billion in July 2024..\nOn the expenditure side, the government spent NIS 52.9 billion in July, up about NIS 3.4 billion from July 2024. Since the start of the year, spending has totaled about NIS 361 billion, up from about NIS 350 billion in the same period last year - up 3.1%.

Amir Baram has signed orders with Israeli defense electronics company Elbit Systems Ltd. (Nasdaq: ESLT; TASE:ESLT) worth about $260 million for airborne munitions for the Israel Defense Forces. Production of the munitions will be undertaken by Elbit's plants around Israel, which have been operating with extra staff since the start of the war, according to the requirements of the Ministry of Defense.\nThese deals are a main element of the Ministry of Defense's policy to expand the Israeli defense production base, as part of the lessons of the war and to fully support all the needs of the IDF both in the current campaign and in the future.\nFor Elbit, this is reassuring news, a day after the partial German embargo on arms exports to Israel and other developments focused on expectations about the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, and hopes of a ceasefire in Ukraine. All this saw Elbit's share price fall 5.8% yesterday on the TASE, following a sharp fall on Wall Steeet on Friday.\nJust two weeks ago, Elbit won a contract worth $260 million to supply DIRCM self-protection systems for Germany's A400M aircraft fleet. The contract was signed with Airbus Defence and Space and as part of it Elbit will supply self-defense systems against infrared guided missiles (DIRCM) for installation on the German Air Force’s A400M transport aircraft. The contract will be delivered over six years, and Elbit notes in its announcement that it follows the procurement decision by the Federal Office for Equipment, Information Technology and Operations of the Bundeswehr (BAAINBw).\nElbit Systems president and CEO Bezhalel Machlis said, \"We continue supporting the Israel Ministry of Defense with advanced solutions that enhance the operational readiness of the Israel Defense Forces. These new contracts underscore our commitment to delivering cutting-edge technologies that meet the evolving needs of Israel’s defense forces. These newly developed products join Elbit Systems' growing portfolio of cutting-edge solutions, and I believe they will attract interest from armies around the world, given their relevance to emerging operational needs.\"\nBaram said, \"The important partnership between the Ministry of Defense, the IDF, and the defense industries constitutes a significant force multiplier in the force-building processes and ensures the ability to self-supply in a challenging period.

{"title": "Wizz Air's resumption of Israel flights helps cut fares", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001518627#utm_source=RSS", "text": "At the end of last week Hungarian low-cost carrier Wizz Air resumed flights to Israel for the first time in three months.\nThe airline took a major step towards Israel by bringing forward its renewal of Israel operations after aircraft had already been allocated to other destinations. Sources say that Wizz Air made major changes to its flight schedules in order to divert planes back to Israel.\nThe return to operations at Ben Gurion Airport will be gradual. Last weekend, the airline began five weekly flights to each of Budapest and Larnaca. On August 22, the airline's route to London Luton will be renewed, with five flights a week. On September 1, additional routes will be added to Vienna, Sofia, Rome and Milan - each with three to four flights a week. The route to Bucharest will also be added with five flights a week and the route to Iasi with two flights a week. Starting September 15, flights to Athens, Crete, Rhodes, Warsaw, Vilnius, Lorraine and Krakow will also resume. Flights to Cluj and Naples will be renewed on October 27 and 28, respectively.\nHow will Wizz Air's return influence fares?\nThe resumption of Wizz Air's services to Israel should help cut fares by increasing the supply of flight tickets when demand is at its peak. The low-cost airline's fares already reflect the high prices typical of periods of high demand but it has been marketing the first tickets, which are sold at the lowest price according to the pricing algorithm used in the aviation industry Indications are that Wizz Air's impact on lower fares is particularly noticeable on routes to destinations where supply is limited and there is little competition.\nFor example, according to data from Ophir Tours, Wizz Air is offering last-minute round-trip tickets to Budapest in August for $248, compared with $327-536 being asked by Israeli airlines. For flights to London during the High Holidays, Wizz Air's round trip fares are $558, compared with $977- $2,624 for its Israeli competitors. The gap is also significant for tickets to Vienna: $558 versus $586-1,390. This gap is due, among other things, to the fact that El Al has no more tickets left in economy class on most routes during peak demand periods, and the initial prices the company offers are in the premium and business classes, while the other airlines are offering the final tickets in economy classes.\nOn the other hand, on shorter routes, where competition is more significant, the picture changes. On flights to Larnaca at the end of August, for example, Wizz Air's fares are lower ($140 versus $198-164), but during the High Holidays fares are similar to Arkia ($400 versus $308-442). On flights to Sofia, fares are identical ($390 on Wizzair and Arkia).\nWizz Air's return comes as the airline seeks to set up a regional hub in Israel. Israel's Minister of Transport Miri Regev supports the idea while the Civil Aviation Authority opposes such a hub at Ben Gurion Airport, due to the potential harm to Israeli airlines. Regev will be eager to please the voting public, because such a hub would reduce fares to and from Israel, but she will come under huge pressure from the Israeli airlines and their workers' committees.\nThe government is also considering allowing Wizz Air to fly between Ben Gurion airport and Eilat, including compensation if the airline cannot fill flights.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 11, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 11 Aug 2025 08:03:00 GMT", "author": "Stav Livne", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

This is in contradiction to the new cabinet's decision to occupy Gaza City in an operation that is expected to last at least six months and cost tens of billions of shekels. Thus, although the Ministry of Finance has cut the forecast, it has remained overly optimistic in its estimates and the forecast was already out of date at the time of publication.\nThis is the second consecutive cut in the growth forecast for 2025, within just two months. At the beginning of the year, the Ministry of Finance expected growth of 4.3%, and this was lowered to 3.6% in the previous revision. The latest forecast is for growth of 3.1% this year, and a a sharp recovery in 2026 with growth of 5.1%.\nThe forecast for 2026 was revised upwards from 4.4% to 5.1%. The Ministry of Finance wrote \"According to the latest scenario, 2026 is expected to see a strong economic recovery.\" Despite the improved forecast for next year, until the most recent revision two months ago, the Ministry of Finance's forecast for 2026 was at a higher level - 5.4%.\nThe new forecast assumes an end to the war and a return to normal growth next year.

{"title": "Petah Tikva house and lot fetches NIS 25.3m", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001518541#utm_source=RSS", "text": "A 1,500 square meter plot on Partizanim Street in the Kfar Ganim neighborhood of Petah Tikva, on which an old detached house stands, was recently sold for NIS 25.3 million. According to realtor Yaniv Shitrit of Gold Properties and Developments, which specializes in the luxury market in this area, says that the asking price had been NIS 26 million, and the buyer is an Israeli businessman who currently plans, after demolishing the existing house, to build a new 700 square meter detached house on the land, with a large garden and swimming pool.\nThe lot has building rights for three houses and the price reflects this. Shitrit says, \"A huge house can be built on the land, and in the future the buyer can build another house on the land, for his children or for business purposes.\"\nThe land itself cost a little over NIS 25 million, but the buyer still has to demolish the existing structure and build the new house. According to estimates, based on a construction cost of at least NIS 20,000 per square meter built in the luxury market, building a new house will cost about NIS 14 million, meaning the cost of the entire transaction, plus the cost of the land, will be about NIS 40 million.\nThe Kfar Ganim A and adjacent Neve Oz neighborhoods of Petah Tikva have many detached houses. About a decade ago, Moti Zisser's estate, which was built on land spanning 5,000 square meters in the neighborhood was sold for NIS 28 million.\nShitrit, who has been worked in the city for 20 years, says, \"The two neighborhoods have recently been enjoying some of the highest demand ever here. Land for houses and gardens is among the most expensive in Gush Dan today, in my opinion - around NIS 20,000 per square meter of land, before construction. Quite a few deals are made in these neighborhoods for houses and gardens, meaning there is a certain supply of such lots, but there are not that many and the demand is enormous.\"\nPrevious deals: The Neve Oz and Kfar Ganim neighborhoods have seen quite a few deals in the past year for high amounts. At the end of 2024, an 11-room, 428 square meter detached house, with a 576 square meter garden and two parking spaces, was sold for NIS 12.392 million. In May 2024, a 648 square meter lot on HaKeshet Street in Neve Oz was sold for NIS 11.15 million. Shitrit himself recently brokered the sale of a 650 square meter lot in this area for about NIS 13 million and the sale of a 354 square meter lot, for semi-detached house, for about NIS 12 million. In Ramat Verber, slightly north of this area, a lot slightly bigger than 1,000 square meters was sold last March for NIS 7.5 million.\nPrices of land in the area are skyrocketing. \"I expect the price increases to continue,\" says Shitrit, \"because prices are mainly influenced by foreign residents, who are constantly looking for apartments here. Although in the not-so-distant past it was customary to see purchases by foreign residents in Israel only in the coastal area and in Jerusalem, this trend has changed a lot recently. Today there are quite a few foreign residents who are looking for a community, rather than proximity to the coast, and these neighborhoods in Petah Tikva - in Neve Oz and Kfar Ganim - offer exactly that. I receive calls almost every day from foreign residents from the US, France, Belgium and more, who are interested in an apartment in these areas of the city, in order to move and settle here.

Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich had planned to oppose the approval to ensure construction of the Shomron Interchange. But market sources say he agreed to withdraw his objections to the Reindeer power station after being told that its construction would not be at the expense of the interchange.\nNow the power station required closing of financing between Powergen (the energy arm of the Generation Fund), together with Phoenix and Rapac Communications, and financing institutions that will allow construction to go ahead. When completed the power station will be capable of producing up to 900 MW and will be powered by natural gas.\nPlanning for the power station began eight years ago, and even before its construction, it is worth hundreds of millions of shekels.\nThe Reindeer power station has been approved twice by the National Planning Commission. In 2024, it failed to receive cabinet approval, when several ministers opposed it, each for their own reasons. The ministers were pressured by the local councils of Kfar Saba, Darom Hasharon and Alfei Menashe, which opposed the station due to its proximity to residents' homes. Following its second approval by the National Planning Commission three weeks ago, the same councils petitioned the High Court of Justice and demanded that approval of the station be canceled. But market sources believe that the chances of the petition being upheld are slim.\nAn important power station in strategic terms\nThis is a strategically important power station, due to its proximity to the centers of demand in the Tel Aviv metropolitan region. It is located in a top priority area and is anchored in a cabinet decision on the construction of power plants in the coming decade.\nElectricity consumption in Israel is increasing, especially due to the rise in the number of electric vehicles and data centers needed for AI. Therefore, approval of many new conventional power plants is required, along with a rapid push for renewable energy production.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 10, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Sun, 10 Aug 2025 09:57:09 GMT", "author": "Idan Eretz", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

At the end of the course, 50 graduates will be employed by the company or its customers.\nElad’s VP Human Resources Inbal Cinman said, \"Discharged combat soldiers and serving soldiers often struggle to find their place in the labor market, both because of lack of relevant professional experience and because of frequent call-ups to reserve duty and months in which they are unavailable for regular work.\n\"Contrary to these perceptions, we see reserve soldiers as a strategic asset, and believe that the values and qualifications they acquire during their military service, such as a high level of self-discipline, uncompromising determination, ability to work under pressure, persistence and problem-solving abilities, represent a clear, critical advantage in the modern technological world.\"\nThe Tech Warriors program, is now open for Summer 2025 enrollment.

In the final quarter of 2025, a series of new showrooms is due to open around Israel, at a total investment of tens of millions of shekels.\nChinese brand GAC Aion, which is due to go on sale in Israel shortly through Union Motors unit Orion Mobility, announced last week that it would initially open five showrooms around Israel towards September.\nThe brand’s flagship showroom will be in Ra’anana, an unusual location in the industry for a main showroom. The showroom, 300 square meters in area including management offices, will be located in a new complex at Hanofar Street 2a in the industrial zone. Other showrooms will be opened in Tel Aviv, Haifa, Rishon LeZion, and Modi’in. The showrooms will exhibit advanced design and online marketing technologies. The initial investment is NIS 7.5 million.\nGAC will launch a series of new electric models in Israel, addressing different segments, with an estimated range of prices from about NIS 140,000 to over NIS 250,000. A first consignment of the Chinese company’s vehicles arrived in Ashdod last week, including a large electric crossover aimed at competing directly in the Tesla Y’s market segment.\nLubinski switches showroom\nAnother Chinese electric brand setting up showrooms in advance of its impending launch in Israel is the premium IM brand of the Chinese SAIC group. The main showroom of the brand, which is imported by the Lubinski group, will be located at Hamanofim Street 2, Herzliya instead of the DS brand, also imported by Lubinski, which will move to Tel Aviv.\nAnother IM showroom will be located in the Check Post interchange area at Ba’alai Melacha Street 1, Haifa. It will replace the existing MG showroom on the site, which will move to a new, larger showroom in a new building at Hahermesh 28, near the Check Post interchange. Sales of the IM brand will shortly begin in Europe and Israel with two large premium electric models, a sedan and a crossover, pitted against Tesla’s Y and 3 models, at an estimated price range of NIS 200,000-300,000, depending on the model, but with a higher specification to price ratio.\nColmobil builds a complex\nColmobil has also started constructing a new complex, at Nesher, in the outskirts of Haifa, that will bring together all the group’s current showrooms currently located in Haifa and the Check Post interchange area. The complex is expected to open in the middle of next year. It will have a built area of some 8,000 square meters. The group has also begun construction of a 6,600 square meter showroom complex in Beersheva, due to be completed in early 2027.\nChinese company BAIC, which is due to launch its products in Europe and Israel in the final quarter of 2025, is negotiating on renting new showrooms in Herzliya and Rishon LeZion.

{"title": "Germany halts arms exports to Israel", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001518511#utm_source=RSS", "text": "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced this afternoon that Germany will no longer supply Israel with arms that might be used in the Gaza Strip. This is a drastic measure by a country that had been Israel's main ally in Europe until now, and helped torpedo many initiatives that sought to impose sanctions on Israel. Germany is Israel's second-largest arms supplier, providing about 30% of Israel's defense imports.\nMerz justified the move by the Israeli cabinet's decision last night to expand the war in Gaza. He said that it is \"difficult to see\" how the decision advances the release of the hostages or the defeat of Hamas. Therefore, Merz announced, \"The German government will immediately stop exporting weapons that could be used in Gaza until further notice.\"\nThe pressure on the German government to impose sanctions on Israel has increased sharply in recent weeks, following the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Gaza, images of famine, and the fact that Israel has not acted decisively to improve the situation, as it promised the EU last month. The Social Democratic partners of the CDU/CSU party led by Chancellor Merz also demanded to join the European Commission's initiative to suspend Israeli companies from accessing the Horizon resear4ch and innovation program and to impose sanctions on extremist Israeli ministers. A meeting held on Wednesday by the German cabinet decided to \"wait and see\", but the cabinet's move last night has altered the picture.\nThe military equipment that Germany supplies to Israel includes submarines and naval vessels, as well as shells, tank engines, light and heavy weapons and more.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 8, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 11:48:49 GMT", "author": "Assaf Uni", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Elon Musk's Starlink launches Israel Internet services", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001518509#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Elon Musk's low orbit satellite company Starlink has launched services in Israel to the general public directly from its Internet site. The SpaceX division will offer Israelis fast Internet at download speeds between 40 and 200 Mbps and upload speeds between 8 and 25 Mbps.\nStarlink is the only company worldwide currently providing high-speed low-latency relatively stable Internet services from anywhere in the world in the most remote and underserved locations on land, in the air and at sea. The company will offer private stationary users a package starting at NIS 230 shekels per month for up to 200 Mbps, and packages that allow internet on the go as well as for businesses at customized prices. The company has inaugurated services in Israel in a manner reminiscent of Tesla: sales are made directly through the website without mediation by an Israeli importer.\nIsraeli Internet Service Providers need not worry\nStarlink has not invented satellite Internet. This form of communication has been operating for many years, but it has been done inefficiently using distant satellites orbiting earth at an altitude of 35,000 kilometers. As a result, the data transfer time between users and the satellite - or the latency - is long and can reach up to 600 milliseconds. Therefore, it has difficulty supporting high-volume data transfer such as streaming, gaming or video calls.\nMusk's satellites cruise at a much lower altitude, about 550 kilometers, and are therefore also called \"low-orbit satellites\" (LEO), so the latency is lower and reaches, according to the company, about 25 milliseconds. Starlink is the world's largest low-orbit satellite company in the field of Internet connection, with over 8,000 satellites. Musk's biggest rival, Amazon's Project Kuiper, has launched only 54 satellites into space so far.\nBased on Starlink's prices, Israeli Internet Service Providers (ISPs) need not be worried. Prices are expensive compared with Israeli providers - therefore, most Israeli customers are expected to be heavy users who require online connection on flights, although more and more airlines are offering Starlink connection themselves. Most of the use in Israel is likely to come from the business sector and provide redundancy - that is, the ability to enable connectivity in emergency situations or during power or internet outages.\nIsrael's Ministry of Communications has confirmed that Starlink has begun Israel operations and described this as \"important news for authorities, businesses and the public at large. Following the license granted by Communications Minister Dr. Shlomo Karhi to Starlink in 2024, and after completing all the required coordination with the company, Starlink began providing a basic service in Israel today, which includes the establishment of fixed stations for households and public buildings that will enable satellite internet connections. The ministry will continue to work to expand services, including the operation of mobile stations and more.\"\nWill Gaza also be connected?\nKarhi and Musk have crossed swords in the past. At the beginning of the war, the Ministry of Communications was in talks with Musk’s Starlink to connect Israeli settlements in the south and north using a satellite connection. Musk then also agreed to connect up Gaza when responding to a tweet by Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, in which she wrote that \"Cutting off all communications to a population of 2.2 million people (in Gaza) is unacceptable. Journalists, medical personnel, humanitarian aid, and innocent people are all at risk.\"\nKarhi responded to Musk, writing that Israel would use \"all means at its disposal to fight this decision, and that Hamas would use it for terrorist activity.\" Musk hit back, saying that they were \"not that naive,\" and that \"not a single Starlink terminal has attempted to connect from Gaza.\" He also noted that they would verify that these terminals were only used for purely humanitarian reasons.\nAfterwards, and in the wake of a visit by Musk to Israel during the war, Karhi announced that the two had reached agreements in principle, according to which the only way to operate the terminals is with the approval of Israel's Ministry of Communications, \"including in the Gaza Strip.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 8, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 08:12:00 GMT", "author": "Assaf Gilead and Nevo Trabelsy", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Securities Authority approves Monday to Friday trading", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001518505#utm_source=RSS", "text": "The official approval came this week from the Israel Securities Authority, and, unless something extraordinary happens, from this January, Sunday trading will be cancelled, and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange’s trading days will switch from Sunday to Thursday to Monday to Friday. The Friday session will be short, from 9:25 to 13:50, to accommodate the Jewish sabbath, which begins on Friday evening. There will be no change in trading hours on the other days.\nThis is one of the biggest changes in the local stock market’s history. It was announced just over a year ago. The change in working days to come into line with those of the major stock exchanges worldwide is a strategic move, meant to make the Israeli exchange more accessible to global investors and boost their presence in the Israeli market.\nIt is also a move that requires special preparation, for the banks and investment houses, which have been used to Sunday to Thursday trading for decades, for retail traders, and hedge funds and foreign investors. The pension and provident funds, and the stock exchange itself, will also have to adopt new working habits. For thousands of workers, it’s a big change.\nThe move to change the working week aroused fears at first, chiefly over how the strong bank unions, which in the past could have prevented it, would react. For them, however, the world has changed. These days, bank customers trade via the bank’s website or app. Very few customers go to their bank branch to give a buy or sell order; at most they will go there to receive advice from an investment consultant.\n\"The banks are ready for the change as far as their infrastructure is concerned,\" a senior banking source says. \"Some branches already work on Fridays and carry out trading in overseas securities and in foreign currency.\"\nThe source says he understands the motives of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and the Israel Securities Authority, to come into line with global trading as far as possible. \"Mainly, they wanted us to be trading in parallel with Europe, since trading in the US begins at 16:30 Israel time (the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange will close at 14:00 on Fridays). This may perhaps be enough for Israeli stocks to be included in the MSCI Europe index. From conversations we have had we understand that this is a necessary condition, but it might not be sufficient. At any rate, the stock exchange wanted to fulfil a criterion that would advance us towards that goal.\"\nA new reality for the financial institutions\nAs far as readiness for the new working hours is concerned, the banking source says, \"People are used to not working on Friday, so the investment houses, pension and provident funds, and so on, will have to undergo a cultural change. It will not just be a technical change. They will have to come with an appetite and mindset for working on Friday. People will have to adapt their family lives, since most people don’t work on Fridays, so few people will come into the office and few will want to engage in trading.\"\nNimrod Sapir, CEO of the Investment Houses Association of Israel, believes that the step will require a broad reset, and he even says that, at this stage, it is not clear that it can be implemented yet.\n\"Switching to trading Monday to Friday could have positive consequences for the attractiveness of the capital market in Israel, particularly for foreign investors,\" he says, \"but it requires complex rearrangement by all capital market players, including the investment houses, because of the different operating and regulatory format that applies to the various activities and investment instruments.\"\nA senior source at one of the investment houses says, \"I cautiously estimate that there won’t be flotations on a Friday, and that trading volumes will be thin, even thinner than on a Sunday.\"\nThe addition of a new trading day could lead to demands for change in labor agreements, although the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange says that, for its part, work on Fridays is already covered in current agreements. There are those at the banks who say that it’s too early to tell, since the Securities Authority’s announcement only came out this week and the matter will presumably be examined in due course.\nMixed feelings among traders\nTraders cannot be regarded as all of a piece. They include hedge funds, institutions, foreign investors, and independent and small retail traders. For all of them, it’s a significant change.\nOne hedge fund manager, Ori Tuval, CEO of Tuval Investment House and chairperson of the Allamanda Capital hedge fund, told \"Globes,\" \"I secretly hoped that they might drop the idea, after so many investment houses and traders objected to it. There are advantages to trading on Sundays, when the rest of the stock markets around the world are closed. We and the Saudi Arabian stock exchange are the only ones open. So it’s possible to react on Sunday to what has happened over the weekend.\"\nTuval says that Friday trading will actually harm local traders. \"You won’t be able to respond online to trading in the US, which opens at 16:30 our time, on that day. There will be no trading in dual-listed stocks (traded in Tel Aviv and New York) on Friday itself. The Americans are asleep between 10:00 and 13:50 our time. The Europeans start working at 11:00 Israel time, and in the UK trading starts at 12:00. So this isn’t really what will move the cheese. This change is not for the better.\"\nAnother senior hedge fund manager sees things completely differently. \"It’s finally happening, and we’re switching to working like the rest of the world. In general, Sunday has been a dead day for decades as far as we are concerned. There are no trading volumes on the stock exchange. There are no futures contracts traded around the world. So in my view it should have happened long ago. It’s true that people are used to not working on Friday. But at our fund we’re ready for it. The employees work shifts in any case. Hedge funds also trade in large volumes overseas, so we always have someone stuck to a screen during Friday night meals.\n\"This year there were also many crises on Fridays. There was a run of Fridays with difficult security events in Israel, and President Trump is wont to come out with declarations on a Friday. When the Israeli market is inactive, you can’t do anything in the core of your portfolio, so you first and foremost respond to overseas trading. This is a move that will ultimately bring more foreign money to Israel, activity in ETFs, and so on. Taking a global view, it’s something positive, despite the difficulty for traders.\"\nEffect overseas\nHarel Gillon, co-CEO of Oppenheimer & Co. Israel, believes that the change in trading hours will not lead to drastic change in the activity of foreign investors, but that it could bring a slight improvement.\n\"It gives the foreign investors flexibility that their position will be managed at that time, so if there’s an extraordinary macro-economic event in the world, and the foreigners want to change their entire portfolios, they won’t now have to wait for Israel to open its capital market on Sunday.\" Gillon thinks that accession to the MSCI Europe index, which the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange says openly is its aim, could be a game-changer, \"and lead to huge trading volumes.\"\nHow will the companies be affected?\nMarket sources find the impact of the change on listed companies hard to estimate. The investment institution source says that difficulties could arise in respect of the duty to report. \"It’s likely that there will some disorganization among the reporting public companies, because they will start to report on Fridays as well. This is not the same as putting a few young shift workers on call at investment houses. When a company needs to issue an immediate report, only someone with a token (a special digital key from the Securities Authority) can do so. This is generally the legal counsel or some other senior person at the public company. It’s a headache for the reporting companies, but their alternative is to go private. I don’t think that they will abandon the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange because of this, it will just be a headache for them.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 7, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 18:30:00 GMT", "author": "Hezi Sternlicht", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

A logistics center spanning tens of thousands of square meters will be built for it on land owned by Tidhar and Harel (75%) and Delek Group (25%).\n\"Globes\" understands that the rent Rafael will pay will be NIS 22 million per year, for 25 years, totaling more than NIS 500 million. As part of the company's expansion, due to major growth in the defense industries, Rafael has decided to merge several logistics complexes into a hub to be built in Akko. Rafael is the biggest employer in northern Israel, and the choice of location stems from its proximity to the David Institute in Haifa Bay, the main plant in the company's production division.\nAs part of the deal, Rafael, led by CEO Yoav Tourgeman, will be given an option to buy part of the logistics center at a later date.\nTidhar and Harel purchased their 75% share from Delek in 2021 for NIS 150 million. The land has remained vacant since 2003 due to soil contamination, and the companies will have to clean up the soil before construction can begin.\nRafael said: \"Rafael is growing at a very fast pace and its activity is increasing significantly year by year.

Companies are usually eager to add new investors with each new funding round in order to attract higher-profile investors and bring a larger number of strategically valuable experts to the investor table. In this case, these are existing investors, including Sequoia, Valley Capital, Benchmark and Zeev Ventures - the venture capital fund of the Israeli investor Zeev Ventures, in which Peter Thiel, the first investor in Facebook and Palantir, is also invested. New investors, such as the Israeli Aleph Fund, joined the financing round - apparently due to the connection of partner Michael Eisenberg to Benchmark, in which he previously served as a partner.\nDecart explains that although it has raised $153 million so far - it has actually used less than $10 million of the investors' money because it has covered the heavy costs for graphics processors, which amounted to tens of millions of dollars, from its revenue.\nThe Tel Aviv-based company has transformed from a startup that developed a model that reduces the costs of training and operating LLMs, into an AI lab that produces revenue from three main areas, involving AI applications for the individual user: an optimization service that is capable of performing more training and operating operations on the same graphics processor - in other words, reducing the cost of Nvidia processors (optimization); a model development service that interfaces with customers' existing models (API) and is provided to the end user via their cloud; and a new product - research or model development services in the video field, a niche in which the company has positioned itself through the launch of the Oasis and Mirage video generators. The company also plans to launch language models for the audio field, and does not limit itself to a specific format, but calls Decart an AI lab that studies the behavior of AI models as well as the interface between humans and machines.\nThe company's latest video language model, Mirage, has received positive market feedback after demonstrating the ability to generate virtual reality using real-time text queries (prompts) faster than models like OpenAI's Sura or Google's Veo3. This feature is advantageous, for example, in creating personalized advertisements, video games, or other commercial experiences based on the user's characteristics, interests, and query content.\nDecart was founded in 2023 by CEO Dr. Dean Leitersdorf, CPO Moshe Shalev, both veterans of the IDF 8200 intelligence unit. Over the past year the company has grown from 15 to over 60 employees most working in the Tel Aviv headquarters as well as in offices in northern Israel, San Francisco and New York.\nDecart says it became profitable almost from day one. The company generated millions of dollars in revenue through agreements for use of the GPU optimization technology it developed, which is deployed by prominent cloud providers and AI labs. This technology also forms the basis of the company's video models, and enables a significant reduction in costs, from tens to thousands of dollars (such as $1,400 per hour for producing a prompt-based video, in advanced models) to less than 25 cents per hour in Decart's models. This cost reduction opens the door to a new era of real-time applications - from the worlds of gaming, through personalized entertainment experiences to advanced robotics. This has led to strong demand for the model's API, which is expected to be launched soon and join the company's optimization activities as another key growth engine.\nInvestor enthusiasm for the company's achievements may also spill over to potential buyers. Last year, Nvidia completed a billion-dollar acquisition of two companies in Israel that have some similarities to Decart: Run:AI, which developed technology to streamline calculations on GPUs and extract more training and execution capabilities from the same GPU; and Deci AI, which developed algorithms to \"shrink\" large language models. Nvidia is increasing its presence in Israel by expanding its software team, and a company like Decart could once again whet its appetite for AI acquisitions in Tel Aviv.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 7, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 11:32:00 GMT", "author": "Assaf Gilead", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

The deal involves 22% of the entire Leviathan gas field and 13% of all Israel's natural gas reserves.\nThe deal follows up the 2019 agreement in which 19 BCM of gas was sold to and in effect triples the amount of gas being exported to Egypt. The Leviathan partners said that the deal paves the way for expanding production.\nNewMed Energy (TASE: NWMD) CEO Yossi Abu said, \"This is a historic day. Leviathan, the biggest natural gas field in the Mediterranean is a tool for changing the strategic reality.\"\nNewMed (formerly Delek Drilling) reports that Egypt will buy the gas via Blue Ocean Energy. The deal will include the sale of 20 BCM starting in the first half of 2026, and an additional 110 BCM after completion of the expansion of production from Leviathan. Although it requires final approval from the Petroleum Commissioner at the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, the green light has already been given in-principle for a deal up to 145 BCM, thus NewMed is not concerned about any regulatory obstacles.\nThe export deal will finance two major infrastructure projects for the Leviathan field. Firstly, a pipeline from the field to the production platform, which will increase annual production from Leviathan from 12 to over 14 BCM per year, and the connection of the Ashkelon-Ashdod pipeline, which will increase conveyance capacity from Ashkelon to El-Arish in Egypt by 2 BCM.\nIn the longer term, NewMed says that this is an anchor deal that will also allow for further expansions of production capacity from Leviathan, up from 21 BCM to 23 BCM per year. The Leviathan field produced 11 BCM in 2024. Of this, about 50% was exported to Egypt and the rest was divided between the domestic Israeli economy and Jordan. The plan until 2035 is that 60% of the gas in Leviathan will be exported, and 40% will go to the domestic economy, with Leviathan also increasing its production capacity for the local economy and supplying the new gas-fired power plants in Israel\nRegarding supply to the Israeli economy, NewMed promises that \"the expansion will ensure that, starting in the 2040s, Leviathan will make available to the Israeli economy the vast majority of the gas produced from the field in a way that will meet most of the natural gas consumption in Israel until the end of production from the reservoir..\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 7, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 08:13:00 GMT", "author": "Idan Eretz", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

{"title": "How much does a protected room add to the value of a home?", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001518377#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Have the prices of homes with protected rooms risen compared with the prices of homes without a protected room, since the war began in October 2023? Two weeks ago, the Bank of Israel published a surprising study, which found that the premium on a protected room since the start of the war - the price difference that the market prices for an apartment with a protected room compared with an apartment without a protected room - has actually decreased when it comes to buying apartments, but has risen significantly in the rental market.\nHowever, another study commissioned by \"Globes\", and conducted by the Israel Real Estate Appraisers Association, did not compare time periods, but rather home prices as of now, and it shows much bigger differences than those found by the Bank of Israel study.\nBank of Israel: 99,000 deals since 2023\nIn the Bank of Israel study, researchers, Yossi Yakhin and Aya Talmon, examined some 99,000 deals carried out since 2023, two-thirds of which were second-hand apartments, as well as ads for the sale and rental of apartments.\nThe study found that on the eve of October 7, 2023, apartments with a protected room were about 8.2% more expensive than similar apartments without a protected room, and that this premium had fallen to about 6.4% by the end of 2024. However, initial findings from the Iran operation indicate that this premium jumped to levels of 11%, although the significance of this data is not yet fully clear.\nIn contrast, the rent sought in apartment rental ads showed a slight increase in the premium with the outbreak of the war, and starting in May 2024, after the first missile attack from Iran, continued to rise. From May 2024 until December 2024, the premium for a protected room was 3.7%-4.1% higher than its level in the first nine months of 2023, before the outbreak of the war.\nThe Bank of Israel study did not examine the reasons for these results, which contradict the accepted narrative that the price difference widened between apartments with a protected room and those without a protected room. In their assessment, during the period studied, there was an expectation of an improvement in the security situation after the end of the war, and considering that the date of occupying the apartments was estimated by the buyers as coming after the end of the war, this lowered the premium for the protected room.\nOn the other hand, rental deals are for shorter terms, and therefore tenants examined the situation according to current criteria and were willing to raise the rent they pay, for an apartment with a protected room.\nThe study also conducted an initial examination of apartment prices during the Iran operation, and found a certain increase in the premium for the protected room, both in apartment prices and in rent, but at least at this stage their statistical significance is unclear.\nWhen the Bank of Israel researchers examined the big cities, they found a significant decrease in the premium for protected rooms received in Tel Aviv and Ashdod, and a significant increase in Beersheva and Netanya. In the remaining places, the findings are described in the study as non-significant, but there were places, such as Haifa and Jerusalem, where a strange situation is described, in which apartments receive a premium for not having a protected room. The researchers have no answer as to why this occurs.\n\"Globes\" possible explanation for this is that apartments with a protected room are often located in relatively new neighborhoods, while apartments without a protected room tend to be located in older and more sought-after neighborhoods, where apartment prices are higher. For example, the expensive Rehavia and Beit HaKerem neighborhoods in Jerusalem, most of which do not have protected rooms, compared with Kiryat Yoval, where there is a wave of urban renewal with relatively cheap apartments.\nAt the same time, the researchers also found that the owners of apartments with protected rooms, who put them up for sale started with high initial prices, which represented a very high premium for protected rooms, and later lowered them when it became apparent that they had no buyers at these prices.\nReal Estate Appraisers Association: 4-room apartments in five cities\nThe second study, which was conducted exclusively for \"Globes,\" was by the Real Estate Appraisers Association was different in almost every aspect, from the examination method to the final conclusions.\nThe Real Estate Appraisers Association examined the price differences of four-room apartments with a protected room versus without a protected room in five cities: Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, Ashkelon and Nahariya, over the last three months. Nahariya and Ashkelon experienced more rockets from Gaza and Lebanon, while Jerusalem largely remained \"out of the war.\"\nThe association did not make do with just comparing prices, but made the comparisons based on prices per square meter, because the higher absolute price of apartments built in recent decades stems, among other things, from the differences in apartment sizes.\nThe Association explains, \"Apartments built in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s usually have a smaller number of square meters, with an average of about 80 square meters for a four-room apartment. In contrast, the more modern construction of the 2000s and onwards produced an average four-room apartment with an area of about 100 square meters. Therefore, the more correct comparison is the average cost per square meter.\"\nThe Association further explains that there are additional parameters that affect apartment prices, primarily age, since apartments without a protected room are also older. The focus on the last three months was intended to try to eliminate additional parameters that could affect the price of the apartment.\nThe study found that the highest price difference per square meter between apartments with a building permit and apartments without a building permit is in Tel Aviv, at about 20%. Haifa, Ashkelon and Nahariya show gaps of about 19%. These are cities that were hit by many missiles during the war, but since the defeat of Hezbollah in Lebanon and the elimination of Hamas's rocket capability from the south, there have been almost no missile alerts in Ashkelon and Nahariya.\nApart from this, even in Iran operation, Ashkelon and Nahariya were not targeted by Iranian missiles, compared with Haifa, which suffered several direct hits. This may have had a slight impact on the relative price gap, which is slightly higher in Haifa.\nIn Jerusalem, there is a significantly smaller difference in the gaps between the prices of apartments with and without protected rooms, compared with other cities examined. The explanation for this is that there were very few missiles targeting the city.\nIn addition, the Association explains, \"There are neighborhoods and areas in Jerusalem that are in greater demand, and new construction is less substantial there, and therefore the lower the supply there and the higher the demand, the price difference narrows, even though these are old apartments without protected rooms.\"\nThis explanation, which applies primarily to the haredi neighborhoods, can probably also explain the negative premium received by apartments with a protected room in Jerusalem.\nA similar study conducted by \"Globes\" on apartment prices in the last six months in Tel Aviv's 3rd and 4th (rova) districts revealed findings similar to those of the Appraisers Association. New apartments and apartments with a protected room reached prices of about NIS 71,000 per square meter, while apartments without a protected room cost about NIS 54,000 per square meter. In these places, the differences found were higher, but these are two of the most expensive neighborhoods in the city, so it is reasonable that the differences are also greater.\nThe question is whether increasing the price difference between apartments with a protected room and apartments without a protected room could lead to a reduction in tenants' demands in urban renewal projects, for adding space. The chairwoman of the Appraisers Association chair Nehama Bogin, does not believe so. \"We are not at a stage where tenants will give up on changes in the urban renewal process. For tenants, urban renewal is an opportunity to improve the quality of life and not just an economic return on paper. Following the war, there is a certain acceleration on the part of tenants who realize and understand the importance of an apartment with a protected room and a new building and do not delay the process, and neither do they give up on increasing the size.\"\nThe chief economist: Demand grew after the missile hits\nAnother study conducted by the Ministry of Finance chief economist found that demand for apartments with a protected room increases mainly after significant missile damage.\nThe chief economist's May review of the housing market found that the Iranians are the best promoters of sales of apartments with a protected room, since after each time missiles were launched from there in May and October 2024 and as part of the Iran operation in June 2025, sales of apartments with a protected room increased. Between attacks, the homebuyers reduced demand for protected rooms.\nThis indicates that our memory is probably shorter than we thought during the war, and that already today people are willing to compromise on unprotected apartments, but in places that suit their tastes and needs. If this is indeed the case, and the relative calm from missiles continues, the price differences between protected and unprotected apartments that the Bank of Israel found will continue to narrow.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 7, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 06:40:00 GMT", "author": "Arik Mirovsky", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

After protracted negotiations lasting a month and a half, Azrieli Group chairman Danna Azrieli, who has a controlling 56% stake in the company, has reached agreement with institutional investors to raise the value of the deal by NIS 18 million to NIS 873 million.\nAs part of the agreements, which should receive support at ZMH Hammerman's general meeting, Azrieli agreed to an increase in value in exchange for the support of the institutional bodies that threatened to vote against the agreement. In doing so, Azrieli has removed the final obstacle on the way to acquiring the company, which will add residential development activity to its real estate empire, and will result in ZMH Hammerman delisting from the TASE.\nAzrieli Group said, \"After direct and transparent discussions, we reached respectful agreements that will enable the closing of the deal. As part of the understandings, we reached an agreement that the company's value will be linked to the consumer price index from March 2025, with an addition of NIS 5 million shekels, as a sign of goodwill to complete the move. We appreciate all parties involved for their flexibility and commitment to the success of the deal.\"\nIt was also agreed that accounting firm Ernst & Young (EY) partner Yuval Ganani, who mediated between Azrieli and ZMH Hammerman, would waive about half of the brokerage fee, which was supposed to be NIS 13 million, which Azrieli planned to pay from ZMH Hammerman's funds.\nThe institutional investors threatened to scupper the deal\nThe agreements between the parties come after Azrieli reported in June that it had signed an agreement to acquire control of ZMH Hammerman at a valuation of about NIS 855 million. Under the terms of the agreement Azrieli was to buy 67% of the shares of the company for NIS 559 million, while the remaining shares would stay with ZMH Hammerman controlling shareholders Haim Feiglin and Ran Ben-Avraham.\nHowever, the TASE rally and sharp jump in the share price of the company, reshuffled the deck, and led the institutional entities invested in ZMH Hammerman to demand a much higher value. Opposition to the deal was led by the Brosh activist investment fund (4.9%) managed by Amir Efrati, which joined the other institutional entities (Phoenix, Harel and Clal), which hold 30% of the shares.\nThe fact that the Tel Aviv Construction Index jumped by over 30% in the month following the launch of the Iran operation led the institutional bodies to demand a value of about NIS 1 billion, about 17% higher than the original value. \"We always thought that the value of ZMH Hammerman should be over NIS 1 billion, even higher than the updated value in the deal with Azrieli,\" said a source who was among the group of opponents at the time. At one stage ZMH Hammerman's market cap on the TASE exceeded its valuation in the deal. On the other hand, Azrieli resolutely declared that it had no plans to increase the valuation in the deal, even if the deal had to be abandoned. In the end both sides compromised, with Azrieli adding to the valuation.\nExpanding Azrieli's real estate empire\nZMH Hammerman, managed by Haim Feiglin, develops and builds real estate projects, mainly in the residential market. The company was founded in 1997 and was floated on the TASE ten years later. By the end of 2024, it had built over 10,800 apartments around Israel, as well as 356,000 square meters of commercial, office and industrial space.\nOver the past year, the company's stock has been volatile, among other things due to the negotiations for the deal and the renewed interest of investors in development companies following the Iran operation. Since the start of 2025, the company's stock has risen by about 11%, completing a jump of about 61% in the past year and is currently trading with a market cap of NIS 829 million.\nAzrieli Group said after the agreement was reached. \"Our entry into the world of residential development in Israel complements the group's diverse areas of activity and strengthens our commitment to continuing to build and develop the country - a Zionist value that has accompanied us all along the way. We believe that by combining the group's experience and capabilities, with the expertise of ZMH Hammerman, we will be able to further expand our contribution to the Israeli economy and the local real estate industry.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 6, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 13:11:43 GMT", "author": "Eitan Gerstenfeld", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

{"title": "Israel Tax Authority targets fictitious invoices", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001518248#utm_source=RSS", "text": "The initiative to tighten company reporting is gaining momentum: The Israel Tax Authority is joining the move, and is even demanding that the transfer of ownership in a company and any significant change in its holdings be conditioned on receiving the green light from the tax authorities, \"Globes\" has learned.\nThe Israel Tax Authority is also considering significantly tightening sanctions on controlling shareholders who sell companies but do not immediately report this to the Tax Authority.\nThe tightening measures being promoted by the Authority are intended to apply mainly to companies known as shelf companies. These are usually sole proprietorships and small private companies, which may be used by criminals to distribute fictitious invoices.\nThe move comes in the wake of the reporting reform being promoted by the Ministry of Justice Corporations Authority, in which changes in the identities of shareholders and directors will not take effect until the Registrar of Companies confirms that the company has reported them.\nThis is in contrast to the current situation, in which companies are allowed to appoint directors, add investors and allocate shares, and can report this to the Registrar of Companies retrospectively, within 14 days, and not as a condition for approving the action.\nThe Israel Tax Authority supports the Corporations Authority's initiative, and sees it as an opportunity to intensify the fight against fictitious invoices, which cost the state billions of shekels annually.\nThe 2023 State Comptroller's report indicated that the ability to report on new shareholders two weeks after they have already entered the company allows criminals to add straw men as company officials and use them to distribute fictitious invoices. These straw men later disappear from the company. It is estimated that 80% of fictitious invoices are distributed this way.\nCriminals take over inactive companies\nThe Israel Tax Authority is concerned that the existing reporting system allows criminals to easily take over inactive companies by buying their shares for tiny sums of a few thousand shekels. Thus, instead of opening a company in an orderly way through the Registrar of Companies and VAT - a process that requires regulatory inspections and approvals - the same criminals enter the front door of an existing company and turn it into a conduit for distributing fictitious invoices. Instead of supervision, the criminals receive a blank check to defraud the state.\nOfficials in the Tax Authority describe a situation in which, when illegal activity surrounding the distribution of invoices is identified, those summoned for investigation are generally the previous owners of the company.\nThis is because there is no requirement to report in a timely manner to the Registrar of Companies about the transfer of ownership in the business, and the information that investigators extract from the Registrar regarding the holdings in the company is not up-to-date.\nThe tightening of reporting on a change in the identity of shareholders from a declarative to a constitutive format, meaning that the reports will become a condition for the change in the company to take effect, and will have to be made immediately, is intended to ensure that the information will be updated and transmitted in real time to the tax authorities as well.\nThe move is not aimed at the hundreds of public companies traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, nor in the vast majority of private companies that operate legally. So no change is expected with regard to the routine purchase of shares in such companies. The Tax Authority is targeting those shelf companies that have halted activities, and instead of closing down, are being sold to criminal elements.\nCompanies are advertised for sale on Facebook and TikTok\nSuch companies are sometimes sold by posting ads on social networks such as TikTok and Facebook. The perpetrator who takes over the company usually purchases between 50% and 100% of its shares - a pattern of behavior that is very unlike the normal trading of the general public, who invest normatively in securities.\nThe Tax Authority is therefore striving for a situation in which information about changes in holdings in the company will be reported to the Registrar of Companies in a binding and immediate way, and will then be transferred to them digitally. Such an online interface already exists for declarative reports, which are made late (if at all), and the Tax Authority wants to expand it.\nAt this stage, the Tax Authority is aiming for the stricter reporting method to apply to any transfer of 50% of shares, but the exact transfer rate may change. Either way, after receiving the information from the Corporations Authority, the Tax Authority plans to review the new shareholders and decide whether to approve them. The dramatic change will be that the Tax Authority will now have veto power, and without its approval, the change in the company will not be updated and will not be implemented.\nStricter and more deterrent fines\nAnother move on the agenda is a significant tightening of the sanctions on those who sell companies to criminals. Currently, company owners are required to update the Tax Authority with changes in the company's details, but the sanctions for failure to report are weak - a NIS 500 fine. The idea is to be stricter, and to impose fines of a size that will be a significant deterrent (the exact amounts have not yet been set) in any event of a violation of reporting on the sale of the company.\nThe Tax Authority's involvement in the move is part of a reform launched last year under the name Israel Invoices, which strives to make it more difficult for dubious businesses to offset VAT payments. According to the reform, every invoice over NIS 20,000 requires receiving an allocation number from the Tax Authority for the purpose of deducting VAT.\nThus, as part of the pilot phase of the reform, fictitious invoice transactions worth NIS 8 billion were thwarted in 2024. The Tax Authority expects that by 2025 they will be able to thwart fictitious transactions worth NIS 1 billion per month - amounts that are supposed to flow into the state coffers.\nFierce controversy, especially in the tech industry\nThe reform in corporate reporting is currently in an early stage of public participation. The Corporations Authority has issued a call for comments, and is promoting the issue in cooperation with the Advisory and Legislative Division and the Policy and Strategy Planning Division at the Ministry of Justice.\nThe move is already causing intense controversy, especially in the tech industry. There, the tightening of reporting is being criticized, and it is claimed that it could paralyze urgent appointments and capital raising for startups and tech companies.\nAmong other things, lawyers in the industry believe that the additional bureaucracy and possible delays in receiving approvals from the Companies Registry will mean that foreign investors will not be able to appoint directors on their behalf in their portfolio companies in a timely manner. Those investors may even demand that their investment funds be deposited in trust until registration is completed, meaning the company would not receive the money it needs on time. The backing that the Tax Authority is currently giving the reform is therefore expected to increase the controversy on the move.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 6, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 08:27:23 GMT", "author": "Amiram Gill", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

(Nasdaq: WIX) has announced its financial results for the second quarter in which it beat the analysts' expectations and raised its guidance for 2025. The results have dispelled investors' concerns and after the company's share price fell 19% recently, the share price is up 9.3% in premarket trading. At close of trade yesterday the company had a market cap of $7.131 billion.\nWix reported revenue of $490 million in the second quarter, above the analysts' forecast of $487 million and 12.4% higher than revenue in the corresponding quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.28, compared with the analysts' forecast of $1.76.\nWix has raised its annual orders guidance to $2.04-2.075 billion, up 11%-13% from 2024, and says this is due to continued positive trends, the contribution of the Base44 acquisition and currency rates. Annual revenue will grow by 12%-14% to $1.975-2 billion, meaning Wix has revised upwards the lower end of the forecast, and in the third quarter, revenue will total $498-504 million. Wix expects to generate free cash flow of $595-610 million this year, about 30%-31% of revenue.\nAbrahami: Looking ahead, we're thinking bigger\nWix enables small and medium-sized businesses to easily create and manage websites. Wix cofounder and CEO Avishai Abrahami said, \"Demand for AI-powered online creation continues to accelerate, and Wix is leading the way as more people use our platform to build sophisticated, high-quality projects with greater speed and ease. This ongoing momentum drove our new cohort bookings to their highest levels since peak-COVID, setting the stage for continued growth in the second half of the year and beyond. Looking ahead, we’re thinking bigger - not just transforming website building, but unlocking new markets enabled by AI, such as vibe coding.\"\nIn the field of vibe coding, Wix recently completed the $80 million acquisition of Base44, founded by Israeli entrepreneur Maor Shlomo. According to Abrahami, Wix identifies early momentum in ARR, which should reach $40-50 million by the end of the year.\nIn response to the results, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said that the second quarter report will be received with relief, after the share price has fallen 40% since the start of the year. He gives a positive mention to the results and the speed up in orders and the fact that the company bought back $100 million of its own shares. He leaves his \"Buy\" recommendation unchanged, with a price target of $200 per share, a 56% upside in Wix's current share price.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 6, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 10:00:11 GMT", "author": "Shiri Habib-Valdhorn", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

Yotpo will sell divisions that were founded before the ChatGPT era, including email marketing products and customer messaging, and will remain with its two flagship products - customer club activities and user review management on e-commerce sites.\nThis is about a third of the company's workforce, which is located in offices in New York, various European countries and Hamasger Street in Tel Aviv. Yotpo's main product deals with managing customer reviews.\nBut by implementing AI, the company plans to allow e-commerce sites to quickly summarize the total number of reviews from all customers for each product and present it briefly to the user, and in the field of customer club management, Yotpo will allow the creation of personalized recommendations for consumers.

If the two apartments are purchased by one buyer, it will be one of the biggest deals ever in Israeli real estate.\nSelling apartments of this caliber has always required patience, and at a time when the market is stagnant, and the luxury and mega-luxury markets are also affected by this, it may take even longer.\nEven individually, these are among the most expensive properties in Tel Aviv. \"These are properties of 470 square meters each and balconies with a total area of 156 square meters.

{"title": "Battle heats up to house Nvidia's Israel campus", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001518106#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Dozens of proposals from many authorities throughout Israel have been submitted to US chip giant Nvidia over the past few weeks after it issued a request for information (RFI) last month for a new development center. The Israel Land Auhority (ILA) alone offered 14 locations it thought suitable for Nvidia's new campus.\nThe deadline was a week and a half ago for companies, authorities and various bodies to provide Nvidia with information on a land plot that would meet the criteria defined in the request - including an area of 70 to 120 dunams (17.5-30 acres), and a zoning plan that allows for the establishment of a center in a built-up area of up to 180,000 square meters.\nThe number of applicants was large. One of the intriguing applicants, which did so in the last week for submitting applications, is the Ministry of Agriculture, which is offering Nvidia a partnership in land at the Volcani Institute's research center in Neve Yaar in Ramat Yishai. The Ministry of Agriculture's director general Oren Lavie sent a letter to the Israel Land Authority, requesting that it rezone agricultural land in for building Nvidia's campus. \"Globes\" has learned that the Ministry of Agriculture hopes that building the new development center on the institute's grounds will enable cooperation between the company and the institute on AI and agricultural research.\nCampus named after Nvidia\nThe Afula Municipality also submitted an interesting proposal to Nvidia to build the development center in the city's new high-tech campus, and suggested that the entire campus be named after the company. The municipality offered Nvidia specific land, which it said was \"available for construction immediately and covers an area significantly larger than the company requires.\" It is also offering the company \"particularly significant discounts\" on local taxes.\nThe Harish Municipality has also put itself forward as a candidate, and is included in the list of locations submitted by the ILA to Nvidia, even though it is slightly outside the search area defined by Nvidia.\nEven though Nvidia specified it will build its campus in northern Israel, it has also received a proposal from the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council, which is part of the Gaza border area. The area is located near the Sderot railway station, in the OfirTech innovation park, currently under construction and named after the late former council head Ofir Libstein, who fell in battle on October 7. The land does meet the criteria for transport accessibility, but not the criteria for area and construction size. The area covers 18 dunams, and offers approximately 21,000 square meters of built-up space - much less than the numbers defined by Nvidia.\nThe deadline for submitting proposals has passed, and Nvidia is currently reviewing dozens of different types of applications - a process that is expected to take some time until a final decision is made on the most suitable location for building its development center.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 5, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 12:22:00 GMT", "author": "Yuval Nisani", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "What's been weighing on Check Point?", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001518104#utm_source=RSS", "text": "The timing of Palo Alto’s announcement of a deal to acquire CyberArk coincided with Israeli company Check Point’s release of its second quarter financials. It’s unlikely that this was deliberate: Palo Alto wanted the deal to be an established fact in advance of one of the two largest cyber events in the world, Black Hat, which is taking place this week, but the combination of the two announcements led investors to penalize Check Point, sending it tumbling by no less than 15% in one session.\nSince then, the share price of the company, headed by Nadav Zafrir, has risen by one percentage point, but it is traded at a market cap of $20 billion, just under that of CyberArk ($21 billion), and a long way below rival company Fortinet, which has a market cap of $74 billion, although it too has fallen fairly sharply, by 7%, in the past week.\nOn the face of it, it would appear that the market is punishing Check Point for the huge merger in the cyber industry, in which Palo Alto - founded by its CTO Nir Zuk, formerly of Check Point - agreed to acquire CyberArk for $25 billion, mostly in Palo Alto stock. The latter, as is well known, was founded to compete with Check Point as a company protecting enterprise networks, and expanded to become a kind of cybersecurity products supermarket in the cloud, cyber alerts management, and now identity security as well.\nThe assessment is, however, that Check Point’s fall was mostly nothing to do with the huge merger, but rather stemmed from the fact that the company did not raise its revenue guidance, and reported customer billings lower than forecast, and that some of them would be recognize only in the third quarter.\nWill Check Point suffer from the huge Israeli cyber merger? Not necessarily. The merger is aimed at areas unconnected with Check Point’s activity, or even that of its competitors, such as Fortinet, Cisco, and privately held companies such as Shlomo Kramer’s Cato Networks. While Palo Alto Netwroks is promoting the \"supermarket\" approach, on the grounds that data security managers are looking for a single supplier from which to buy all the products, Check Pont, and for that matter the rest of the market, advocates an expertise approach. The companies make many acquisitions, but tend not to cross boundaries into other fields.\nIn remarks made at the same time as Palo Alto’s announcement of the CyberArk acquisition, Zafrir indicated that Check Point was headed in a quite different direction. Not only is it not interested in expanding into identity management, but in its view the right protection against AI threats lies elsewhere.\nWhile Palo Alto talks about identifying malicious AI agents and security of virtual machines (through CyberArk) as though they were human users, Check Point, like Cato Networks and other companies, sees unified cloud security, SASE (Secure Access Service Edge), as the right solution, without different products for identity management.\nUnified cloud security is a kind of virtual brain that analyzes all the traffic between users and endpoint devices, and the organization’s databases and AI models. Its quality is determined by the degree of its oversight of the whole network and the way in which its rules for enforcement against wayward players - be they AI agents, virtual machines, or flesh and blood users - are formulated. With development in the right place, network control can be expanded to AI prompts, to detect whether a prompt is malicious (a prompt injection attack), and thus to render a product like that of CyberArk unnecessary.\nCato Networks developed such a network itself, and initiated the SASE rating category of market research company Gartner (despite which Palo Alto, which also has this activity, was quickly placed top of the category). Check Point is making mighty efforts to compete in this market. It bought Israeli company Perimeter 81, and this year it entered Gartner’s rankings, although it is still placed low in relation to veteran companies in this field. \"We continue to accelerate our investment in SASE, we opened a new development center in India, and we doubled the size of our development team in this area,\" Zafrir said last week.\nFocus on four main areas\nIt’s important to mention that not just Check Point but also Palo Alto has fallen 15% since the middle of last week. The huge acquisition is perceived by the market as a move designed to boost the company’s growth rate, which has been below expectations so far this year, and as the acquisition of a product that is not synergetic with its other products, to consolidate Palo Alto’s status as a supermarket of products, even if they are not necessarily connected one with another.\nThat, as mentioned, is the opposite approach to that of companies like Check Point, Fortinet, and even Cato Networks, which remain close to the concept of network security and prevention. When Zafrir took up his post as CEO, Check Point realized that it could not specialize in a range of products, and it placed application protection on the cloud in the hands of a partnership with Wiz, at the expense of internal development through an Israeli company it bought called Dome9.\nAccording to Zafrir, Check Point will focus on four areas, all connected to management of organizational network policy: connectivity between elements of the network; prevention of threats to the network; the joint platform concept; and AI-based protection, that is, integrating AI into the rules that the organization defines for protecting the network.\nWhat do the analysts say?\nAfter the release of Check Point’s financials and the report of the huge cyber acquisition deal, the market is still bullish on Check Point even if some analysts have cut their price targets. On the TipRanks analysis website, there is a majority for \"Hold\" for Check Point stock, the rating of fifteen analysts, while eleven recommending \"Buy\", and none recommending \"Sell.\"\nJefferies did cut its price target for the stock from $260 to $230, but that is still 22% higher than the current price of $188.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 5, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 12:16:00 GMT", "author": "Assaf Gilead", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Comprehensive rebuilding of missile-hit areas nears approval", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001518097#utm_source=RSS", "text": "There has been a breakthrough in the plan for rehabilitating buildings damaged by Iranian ballistic missiles. \"Globes\" has learned that, after weeks of stagnation and internal disputes, the inter-ministerial committee formed in June by order of the ministers of finance, the interior, and housing and construction, has managed to reach agreement that will allow fast-track reconstruction for areas badly damaged by Iranian attacks. The main innovation is that undamaged buildings will also be able to be included in renewal projects, in order to allow faster and more efficient planning. The compromise was reached after a prolonged standoff with the Ministry of Justice over the property rights of residents.\nIt will, however, take a long time for the required legislation to be passed, and even longer before there is any movement on the ground.\nThe entire area will be upgraded\nThe idea behind the work of the committee is clear. The sites of Iranian missile hits need to be rehabilitated quickly. Since the damage is enormous and the buildings in question are no longer fit for habitation, they need to be rebuilt. Instead of them being reconstructed as they were, the state, with the aid of the plan that the team is currently formulating, proposes a special track, which will allow urban renewal projects for the damaged buildings. They will be replaced with new, stronger buildings, at higher density, with a view of taking advantage of the situation to upgrade the entire area.\nThe main innovation formulated at the last meeting of the inter-ministerial team is the possibility of including in the urban renewal plan buildings that have not been damaged at all. The committee set up a classification of three types of damage: red buildings, that is, buildings that have been destroyed or are uninhabitable; orange and yellow buildings, that have sustained serious damage but can be rehabilitated, although this might take a long time; and green buildings, that have not been damaged at all.\nUnder the scheme being formulated, at the initiative of the Planning Administration headed by Rafi Elmaliach, about 80% of the buildings covered by the renewal plan will be red, orange or yellow buildings. Even though some of them could be repaired, they will be included in the renewal site and slated for demolition and new construction. The remaining 20% will include green buildings, but only if there is a professional opinion justifying their inclusion in the renewal site.\nThe idea is that an entire area that has been hit can be renewed at one go, including buildings that have not themselves been damaged, on the assumption that this will make the reconstruction process shorter, as the site will be more integrated and easier for planning and construction.\nA majority in each individual building\nThe issue that has prevented progress in the inter-ministerial committee in the past few weeks relates to property rights: the majority required among residents of a multi-occupancy building for an urban renewal project to be carried out. The committee sought to promote a plan whereby a project could be carried with a bare 51% majority of residents on the site as a whole, even if in a particular building the proportion of those agreeing to the plan was lower than that. The representatives of the Ministry of Justice on the committee vehemently opposed that idea, and argued that there were legal impediments to the plan. Deputy Attorney General Carmit Yulis called the plan \"a forced arrangement.\"\nIt would appear that agreement has been reached on this issue as well. The Ministry of Justice’s stance that a 51% majority will be required in each individual building has been accepted.\nThe team has already designated several sites for implementation of the new plan, which is mainly suited to high-density areas.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 5, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 09:27:00 GMT", "author": "Hilit Yanai-Levison and Yuval Nisani", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

In afternoon inter-bank trading the shekel is 1.16% higher against the dollar at NIS 3.451/$, and 0.57% higher against the euro at NIS 3.978/€.\nYesterday, the Bank of Israel set the representative shekel-dollar rate down 0.293 from Friday, at NIS 3.404/$, and the representative shekel-euro rate was set 0.962% higher at NIS 3.936/€.\nMizrahi Tefahot chief markets economist Ronen Menachem says, \"Due to the strong increases recorded by both the stock markets and the shekel in recent weeks, and because of the opposite trends of the strengthening of the dollar worldwide and increases on Wall Street in the past two days, it seems the market is now reacting to local events, including question marks regarding the security environment in the near future.\n\"I would also attribute the lack of clarity on the implications of the tariffs on the Israeli economy and concern about developments in economic relations with EU countries. So far, these are only concerns and it is not yet possible to point to any clear data that shows this in practice. In general, the current devaluation of the shekel cannot be separated from the major volatility it has shown since the start of the year. The shekel has depreciated 2.4% against the dollar in the past month - a reasonable figure. Combined monitoring of both the stock markets, the foreign exchange market, and risk premiums in the economy will be needed before it can be ascertained that we are facing a change in trend.\"\nPoria Finance chairman Or Poria agrees with Menachem. He says, \"The leading currencies are trading stronger against the shekel this morning, due to local developments including the dismissal of the Attorney General, the dismissal of the chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, and the worsening of tensions between the military and political echelons regarding the continuation of the fighting in the south. This is compounded by the increase in the probability of escalation and expansion of the security conflict.\n\"However, there is no change in the medium and long-term estimates, according to which the shekel's strengthening trend is expected to return. Accordingly, any decline in the shekel's exchange rate against the major currencies may constitute a buying opportunity.\n\"At the same time, there are declines in stock exchange indices in Israel, contrary to the global trend. However, it is important to note that these declines come after a period of sharp increases, which resulted from a lack of significant pricing of the local stock market and a significant fall in the risk premium.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 5, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 11:12:00 GMT", "author": "Globes correspondent", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

Those profiting from the exit include Hetz Ventures, which led Prompt Security's seed round in August 2023 and Jump Capital, which led the Series A round last November. In total the Tel Aviv-based company raised just $23 million.\nThis is an impressive cybersecurity exit, without the involvement of large Israeli venture capital funds, but with a combination of small funds that invested modest amounts in an AI cybersecurity company. Prompt Security was founded by Check Point and Orca Security veterans CEO Itamar Golan and CTO Lior Drihem to help organizations manage generative AI risks and identify, analyze, and secure vulnerabilities in LLM-based applications. The company maps employee use of AI tools, including unauthorized tools in the organization, monitors their use and enforces the organization's rules, in order to prevent leakage of organizational data to the AI tools, or to prevent malicious queries (prompts) on the organization's authorized AI models, with the aim of damaging its trust.\nPrompt Security competes with Israeli company Lasso Security as well as Apex Security, which was sold to Tenable in May for $105 million.\nSentinelOne was founded in 2013 by CEO Tomer Weingarten, Almog Cohen and Ehud Shamir, and has been one of the fastest growing cybersecurity companies over the past decade, among other things, due to AI-based technology that detects attacks based on behavioral patterns. The company has about 2,400 employees and operates from several countries, including Israel, where it has one of its main development centers.

The matter will now be considered by the Supreme Court, which is expected to issue a temporary injunction against the cabinet's decision until a ruling on the petition against the ousting. Justice Noam Solberg has already ruled that her dismissal will not take immediate effect to allow for a judicial review, even though the cabinet decision says the dismissal is due to come into immediate effect.\nMinister of Justice Yariv Levin hinted during the cabinet meeting that any Supreme Court decision to cancel the dismissal of the Attorney General should not be obeyed. He said, \"The cabinet has reached its red line. It is not possible to accept a situation in which the court will try to force an Attorney General who is completely political on the cabinet, which has no trust in her, which has no cooperation with her, and who obstructs the cabinet and refuses to represent it. It is not possible for the court to decide for the cabinet who will be the Attorney General who will represent it and who will advise it.\"\nBaharav-Miara did not attend the cabinet meeting. She claimed in a letter that her dismissal will influence the trial of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and criminal investigations of ministers and associates. According to her, the cabinet is effectively dismissing the prosecutor in Netanyahu's trial, \"Using new rules, lacking supervision, moving the goalposts, to ensure the result it wants.\"\nBaharav-Miara added, \"From now on the cabinet will be able to dismiss any attorney general - the attorney general in the country - without any control mechanisms and even for extraneous considerations.

The Israel Innovation Authority contributed a $4?million non-dilutive grant. This brings the total funding raised by the company to $35?million.\nQuamCore is a deep-tech startup tackling quantum computing’s hardest scalability challenges. The company has developed a fully designed and simulated architecture capable of scaling to 1 million qubits in a single cryostat. This milestone, long considered out of reach, fundamentally changes the economics of quantum computing by eliminating the need for massive multi-cryostat infrastructure.\nQuamCore’s innovation lies in tightly integrating superconducting digital control logic directly into the cryostat. This reduces the cabling burden by orders of magnitude and eliminates the primary thermal bottleneck that has blocked large-scale adoption. The design also includes built-in error correction, a critical feature for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing.\nQuamCore CEO Alon Cohen said, \"From day one, we focused on the minimum viable system to unlock real-world quantum advantage - and that number is 1 million qubits. We chose to radically rethink the architecture of the most mature and performant platform: superconducting qubits. The result is a blueprint that can scale, stay compact, and remain aligned with where the industry is already headed. This funding allows us to accelerate both chip production and prototype integration. The quantum industry is maturing - and with our approach, superconducting qubits will remain in the lead.\"\nQuamCore’s founding team blends deep expertise in quantum information, superconducting devices, and large-scale semiconductor systems. With this funding, the company will move from design to fabrication of its first-generation processors, establish a dedicated quantum lab, and scale up operations.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 4, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 13:00:00 GMT", "author": "Globes correspondent", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

{"title": "Analysts see huge upside in Teva", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001517992#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE: TEVA; TASE: TEVA) last week published its second quarter financial results in which it presented lower revenue but higher profit than predicted by the analysts - $4.2 billion and $0.66 per share respectively. Teva also raised sales guidance for branded drugs and annual profit guidance. On the day the report was published, Teva's share price rose 1.8% on Wall Street but in the following days fell 8.6%. This morning Teva is down 4.74% on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE).\nSince the start of 2025, Teva has underperformed compared to other major companies in the sector. Since the start of the year the company's share price has fallen 30.2% compared with an average fall of 4.8% in the S&P health care sector indices. The latest fall comes after a phenomenal year for Teva in 2024, in which it doubled its value. Today, after recent declines, the company's stock has a market cap of $9 billion.\nAccording to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the average target price of 11 investment institutions covering Teva's stock is $24.29, a 57.9% premium on the current share price, and almost all of them have positive recommendations for the stock.\nOppenheimer: \"Excellent buying opportunity\"\nOne of the investment banks whose price target for Teva's stock is among the highest is Oppenheimer with a price target of $30, 95.1% higher than the price on the NYSE. Oppenheimer's recommendation for Teva is \"outperform.\"\nOppenheimer writes, \"In our opinion, the current market value of Teva's stock does not reflect its future earnings potential, and constitutes an excellent buying opportunity for long-term investors.\"\nOppenheimer adds, \"Teva reported excellent results for the second quarter of the year and affirmed its strategic aims for 2027.\" Teva's aims for 2027 include a non-GAAP operating margin of 30%. In May Teva reported laying off 8% of its workforce - about 3,000 employees by 2027 - in order to save $700 million. The company's CEO Richard Francis said after publication of the results last week that there is rapid progress in the plan, which is already generating annual savings for the company of $140 million in 2025.\nOppenheimer notes that achieving the 2027 aims needs significant growth in sales of branded drugs, operational efficiency and higher profit margins from branded drugs, which will allow creation of strong free cash flow. In their assessment, Teva will be able to achieve the aims earlier than expected. According to the Oppenheimer analysts, the drug Duvakitug, which is being developed together with Sanofi for gastrointestinal infections, is expected to begin phase 3 clinical trials in the fourth quarter, thus making Teva eligible for a payment of $500 million from Sanofi. In their assessment, the drug will be of equal importance to Copaxone in the future and may even overtake it in revenue in the far future.\nThe sale of Teva's active ingredients division will free up capital. Management said that a final decision will be made during the current quarter, and Oppenheimer estimates that its value will be $1.5-2 billion. \"The US government places special emphasis on the sustainability of supply chains, and therefore this is likely to have a positive impact on the price that Teva is able to demand in the deal.\"\nCan rise by tens of percent?\nNot only Oppenheimer believes in the Israeli pharmaceutical giant. A recent \"Globes\" survey of 14 institutional investors in the Israeli capital market found that many of them believed Teva's stock is undervalued. For example, Migdal noted that it \"currently trades at a 6.5-fold earnings multiple. Our assumption is that as confidence in revenue and profit levels in the coming years increases, the company will begin to trade at an earnings multiple that is more similar to ethical companies (branded drug manufacturers), which could result in a share price of $23-27.\" This is while the stock is currently trading at a price that is over 50% lower.\nMigdal believes that Teva is on the right track to get there, after over the past decade, \"Succeeding in reducing debt 60%, significantly cutting expenses, improving production efficiency and creating a broader revenue mix, with a variety of new branded drugs. In addition, the company has built an impressive branded drug pipeline that is expected to provide it with a growth engine in the coming years.\"\nAt the same time, Shmuel Ben-Arie, CIO at Pioneer Capital Management, also estimated last week in an interview with Globes that Teva is trading at a relatively low cash flow multiple, \"and could easily rise 30%-40% in the coming year.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 4, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 08:36:21 GMT", "author": "Shiri Habib-Valdhorn", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Cybersecurity emerges as Israel's most prolific tech sector", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001517967#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora has stressed again and again in interviews with journalists that until seven years ago when he was appointed to the job by CTO and founder Nir Zuk, he knew nothing about cybersecurity. \"They made fun of the fact that they appointed a Google veteran who doesn't understand the field and made him the CEO of a large cybersecurity company,\" he said on Wednesday at a press conference hours after announcing the acquisition.\nBut one business principle that guided him along the way teaches the entire doctrine of the cybersecurity industry: \"My method is to take the best company in its field, quickly integrate it into Palo Alto Networks and bring it to market very quickly along with the rest of our products - that's what I've always done. When we bought a browser (Israeli company Talon), no one understood why we did it, but very quickly we saw other companies like Google and Microsoft launch their own secure browser. The same was true in the database field and in the field of command and control centers. I'm not going to spend four years developing a product from scratch now, hoping that it will fit into the market. I'm panicking about AI and we're already behind in securing artificial intelligence agents.\"\nArora understood that the way to succeed in cybersecurity is to acquire the companies that lead the category, preferably when they are still early stage and relatively cheap. It is not always the leading and more expensive company, sometimes it's possible to settle for number two. This was the case, for example, with Palo Alto's acquisition of Israeli corporate data security company Dig Security for $400 million (competing with Cyera, which is currently worth $6 billion), and the acquisition of the secure browser company Talon for $458 million (competing with Island, which is currently worth $5 billion). These retained very high-quality teams and generated initial revenue, even if quite small. Until this week, Palo Alto had made nearly 30 acquisitions since 2013, according to the PitchBook database, none of which exceeded the billion dollar mark. Only earlier this month, Globes reported its acquisition of cybersecurity company AI Protect for $700 million, just three years after its founding.\nIn fact, it seems that CyberArk, a company only 20% the size of Palo Alto Networks, has been much more daring in its acquisitions. Last year, it acquired its major rival Venafi for $1.5 billion.\nPalo Alto Networks will pay $25 billion for CyberArk, the vast bulk of which will be paid in shares. This deal is a kind of \"fine\" that Nir Zuk's cybersecurity giant is paying for being late to the field of AI. As technology advances at a dizzying pace, so too are the vulnerabilities and the possibilities of hackers and other cyber attackers.\nPalo Alto has taken acquisitions to the extreme\nPalo Alto Networks has taken acquisitions to the extreme, but it is not the only major cybersecurity company to do so. US rival CrowdStrike has made no less than 41 acquisitions since 2017 - some of them, like Adaptive Shield and Flow Security, are Israeli company. Veteran cybersecurity company Fortinet has made 37 acquisitions, and Israel's Check Point has made 26 acquisitions. Even Wiz understood the rules of the game and, just before being acquired by Google in a huge $32 billion deal, it acquired four companies, the largest of which, Gem and Dazz were for a total of almost $800 million.\nNot every acquisition by Palo Alto has been successful. It acquired Israeli cybersecurity company Cider Security for the application security field, and after a year, employees were laid off. To date, the field has not really taken off within the company. Palo Alto's Prism cloud security product is generating sales, but it has hit a glass ceiling and is reportedly being challenged by giants like Wiz, Orca, and CrowdStrike.\nSuccessfully merging companies is no easy task. Cisco acquired companies in Israel like LightSpin and PortShift, which were supposed to be the answer to Wiz, but had difficulty integrating the product into the market. Epsagon, which it acquired for $500 million, had its key employees transferred to develop other products while it became open source. Even if products do not ultimately fit into the market, the employees are easily moved to other development projects.\nHow do you become a superpower: Check Point v Palo Alto\nOne fact is undeniable. When it comes to the cybersecurity market, mergers and acquisitions are shaping the industry and changing it from end to end. In 2023, 20 acquisitions were made for more than $200 million, for a total of $43 billion. A year later, the number of deals at the high threshold increased to 30, for a total of over $35 billion. So far in 2025, deals worth $60 billion have already been closed, and that’s without counting Amiram Shahar’s Upwind in talks to be sold for $1 billion.\nThese acquisitions have contributed to the creation of cybersecurity superpowers - giant companies that serve as a kind of department store where you can find a variety of solutions in one place. \"A decade ago, the two largest cybersecurity companies - Palo Alto Networks and Check Point - were at the top of the largest companies in the field with a market value of about $15 billion each,\" says Oren Yunger, managing partner at venture capital fund Notable, which invests in cybersecurity and enterprise software companies, including Israeli companies, and has conducted special research on mergers and acquisitions in the field. \"Palo Alto began to make more aggressive acquisitions of small players that led their market, and tended to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for companies with single-digit annual revenue growth even in areas that were outside its expertise - corporate network security.\n\"Check Point, on the other hand, was more conservative, focusing on acquiring less flashy companies and usually paying amounts ranging from tens of millions of dollars, sometimes down to a few hundred thousand. Today, with Palo Alto Networks worth over $115 billion and Check Point worth about $20 billion, it is clear that aggressive acquisitions of companies with prominent entrepreneurs and strong talent was a profitable move, even if it did not seem profitable at first.\"\nCheck Point has acquired 26 companies over the years. It has not yet bought a company for more than $1 billion. One of the acquisitions by the Israeli network security giant could have been CyberArk. In 2016, it was reported that then Check Point CEO Gil Shwed was interested in acquiring CyberArk, which was then worth only $1.7 billion.\nToday, the cybersecurity powerhouses are Palo Alto, with a market cap of $115 billion, Crowdstrike with a value of $115 billion, and Fortinet with a value of $71 billion. After losing 15% of its value in one day this week, Check Point is ranked eighth with a value of about $20 billion. \"In 2015, the aggregate value of cybersecurity companies was $97 billion, today there are at least two powerhouses that are each traded for over $100 billion,\" says Yunger. \"Strategic acquisitions have become the driving force behind the surge in cybersecurity mergers and acquisitions, which reflects growing confidence in this industry. Between 2022 and 2025, they were responsible for deals worth over $100 billion, even before the CyberArk deal.\"\nThe logic behind the acquisitions is clear: While the industry continues to grow, with an average annual growth rate of 19% in sales, the number of cybersecurity software products used by the average data security manager in a US organization ranges from 70 to 90 and can even reach 135 different products, according to Silicon Angel. Palo Alto has mastered the art of \"bundling,\" or cybersecurity packages, in which it offers an additional product at a discount to those who already use several of its other products, to save security managers the need to find additional suppliers. Sometimes Palo Alto goes the extra mile and buys an expensive product, such as Expanse for $670 million, and offers it for free to customers just to keep them.\nCybersecurity is driven, of course, by mergers and acquisitions, but there is a drawback: the number of potential buyers is limited, certainly if it is a company worth billions of dollars like CyberArk or Wiz. CyberArk has repeatedly said that it is not for sale, until the right offer comes along. \"On the other hand, the funds that invest in cybersecurity are quietly living with the existing model,\" says Yunger. \"Look at what happened with the data protection company market (DSPM), with companies like Dig, Eureka, Polar, Flow - most of them were eventually acquired, even if for smaller amounts. Cybersecurity managers wake up in the morning and ask what they are missing and that's how new industries are born all the time. This is a dynamic that you don't see in other fields, like fintech, for example, due to the nature of the market, which is biased towards consumers, rather than purchasing managers in large enterprises.\nAre valuations already too inflated?\nIsraeli cybersecurity proves time and again that it exists separately from the rest of the tech industry, with a different economic logic, as a kind of state within a state. Within six months, two deals from the field have climbed to first and second place on the list of the largest-ever Israeli exits.\nThe privately-held tech company market - growth companies and startups - proves this point. According to IVC - LeumiTech, fundraising for cybersecurity companies stands out above all others with a total investment of $2.5 billion in the first half of 2025, compared to only $1 billion in fintech companies and $500 million for the growing field of defense-tech. Even the glamorous AI industry is unable to compete with cybersecurity and raised \"only\" $1.5 billion in the first half of 2025. Although the recovery from the financing crisis of 2022-2023 affects the entire tech industry, cybersecurity crashed less and is growing much faster. The average Series A round funding for a company is $24.5 million in cybersecurity, compared with $12.8 million in insurtech and fintech, and $15.5 million in enterprise software.\nThe large gap is also reflected in the inflated valuations of cybersecurity companies. According to data from Altshare, which has developed a platform that allows mainly private companies, entrepreneurs and investors to manage their shares, the average value of investment in seed companies in the cybersecurity sector increased from $8 million at the end of 2024 to $12.4 million in the second quarter of 2025 and is expected to reach $13 million by the end of the year. For more mature companies in Series A funding, the valuation of companies in new funding will increase from $50 million at the end of 2023 to $80 million by the end of 2025. The earnings multiple is also relatively high throughout all stages of the companies, with an average of 5.3 compared with 4 in fintech.\nAltshare CEO Ronen Solomon explains that cybersecurity companiesw distribute more options as a relative proportion of the company's total shares - 15% more than in other companies, and that at cybersecurity companies, the rate of companies that have a secondary round (in which entrepreneurs and employees sell shares directly to investors) has doubled since the end of 2023. \"In cybersecurity, the team doesn't come for the salary, because they know they can get upside in options and secondary rounds,\" says Solomon.\n\"You get a premium simply by being Israeli\"\n\"The cybersecurity market is currently in its golden age for a variety of reasons: the proliferation of solutions from various fields, the rise of AI that is deterring many players, and also the increase in defense budgets among countries around the world,\" Adv. Guy Lachmann, partner and co-head of the IL high-tech practice group at Pearl Cohen, tells Globes. \"Within this market, Israel has been considered a global leader for several years and Israeli companies are generally at the forefront of various branches within cybersecurity. They are also less sensitive to the political risks that other Israeli technology companies experience and here there is a premium you receive simply by being Israeli. However, this market is conducted almost separately from other markets with its own strategic buyers, regular serial entrepreneurs and a few investors who understand and are well-connected in it.\"\nThe big entrepreneurs invest in each other\nIn Israel, for example, most investments in cybersecurity are concentrated in the hands of a small number of funds: Gili Raanan's Cyberstarts - the fund behind successes such as Wiz and Cyera, alongside Team8, Picture Capital, Glilot Capital, Yoav Leitersdorf's YL and Natan Shohami's Hyperwise. Serial entrepreneurs, such as Shlomo Kramer, Assaf Rapaport, Yevgeny Dibrov, Nir Zuk, Mickey Bodai and Amichai Shulman, invest in each other and create a highly concentrated fabric in the industry. Foreign venture capital giants such as Sequoia, Greylock, Index and Insight have identified the niche and are currently leading some of the seed rounds in the field, creating another problem - Israeli entrepreneurs who do not have even one Israeli investor on the board of directors, a problem that could lead to losing their way in the early stages.\nLachmann says, \"The celebration of exits in cybersecurity creates a kind of effect that pushes more and more entrepreneurs into cybersecurity, which may create a greater challenge down the road. Because when a giant like Palo Alto arrives and acquires a giant like CyberArk, it means that the other companies active in the same market (identity management) will receive smaller acquisition offers, if any. In addition, this may lead to degeneration in other technology areas - every golden age reaches a certain saturation point.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 3, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Sun, 03 Aug 2025 16:22:00 GMT", "author": "Assaf Gilead", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

On the other hand, the Ministry's economic affairs division sees the move as an opportunity to increase competition, and cut fares. Minister of Transport Miri Regev must decide between making flights cheaper for Israeli consumers or taking steps to protect Israeli airlines.\nIn May, Regev declared her plan to promote the opening of a foreign airline hub at Ben Gurion Airport. Such a base of operations would allow a carrier to establish Israel as the start and end point for flights - in other words, no longer round-trip flights, but the presence of aircraft and crews in Israel, which allows the company to operate more flights and benefit from valuable slots (popular flight and takeoff times that are awarded to companies according to the airport's capacity), and thus establish a bigger foothold in the domestic Israeli market.\nCurrently, Israeli carriers have a comparative advantage in that their aircraft are based in Israel and can take advantage of the first and last slots of the day, which are preferred by passengers. If Wizz Air were to establish a base in Israel, it would be able to enjoy the same terms, and become a dominant player during peak hours.\nWhile Israeli airlines have an advantage in slot allocation, they are subject to regulations that do not apply to foreign companies, including strict wage agreements and security arrangements and coordinating with El Al, which is also the security services provider. If Wizz Air were to open a hub in Israel and ask to register as an Israeli company, the same regulations will also apply to it. However, industry sources believe there is no obvious reason for Wizz Air to do so. Moreover, during talks with Wizz Air, it became claer that it has no plans to agree to open its hub at Ramon Airport near Eilat, but only at Ben Gurion Airport, and it does not intend setting up an Israeli subsidiary.\nAlternative plan\nAlthough she presents the move as such, this is not Regev's initiative. Wizz Air has been pressing the Ministry of Transport for many years about setting up an Israeli hub, but they have been consistently denied. Civil Aviation Authority head Shmuel Zakay has made it clear in the talks that he opposes the establishment of any such hub. He insists competition would be unfair because a foreign airline would enjoy all the benefits of Israeli aviation without bearing the costs. Zakay says this situation does not produce any incentive to establish additional Israeli airlines, such as TUS, and during a low point for air travel to and from Israel the hub would be set up at the expense of other airlines.\nThe Civil Aviation Authority has proposed an alternative plan, which would require Wizz Air to establish an Israeli subsidiary, just as EasyJet has set up subsidiaries in Austria and Switzerland, and Wizz Air has in Abu Dhabi. In addition, Zakay warns that it is not feasible to allow only one airline to set up a hub in Israel, because after this window is opened, there will be no justification for refusing other airlines, which would create an unbearable burden on Ben Gurion airport's infrastructure.\nThe Israel Airports Authority (IAA) acknowledges the advantages of the move, but also cites major risks. The IAA expresses concern over dependence on a foreign carrier in times of emergency, and recommends setting up an inter-ministerial team supported by an international consultant to examine the implications.\nOn the other hand, the Ministry of Transport economic affairs division has expressed enthusiastic support for the move. They see it as an essential means of increasing competition, cutting fares, and improving service in an industry that has been hit by operational problems in recent years. The division recalled that Israeli airlines claimed that they were close to collapse before the Open Skies reform (an agreement with the EU in 2013), yet the reform made them become more efficient.\nThe economic affairs division says the security expenses of Israeli airlines are already almost fully subsidized by the state, and there will always be a market that will prefer an Israeli company due to the feeling of security and for kosher food and Sabbath reasons. They reject the claim of a lack of capacity at Ben Gurion Airport, and say Israeli companies receive additional capacity from time to time, especially now that slots of Turkish airlines that formed a major part of Ben Gurion Airport's operations before the war have been relinquished. They claim also that the security situation in Israel reflects an extreme situation and that long-term regulatory policy cannot be based on it.\nThe department also rejects comparisons to other subsidiaries, claiming that these are models that were spawned for political reasons such as Brexit or government control in the UAE, and that there is no justification for demanding Wizz Air establish an Israeli subsidiary. The fundamental question, in their opinion, is whether Israeli passengers should continue to subsidize the inefficiency of local airlines in order to protect them.\nIn any case, amid the pressure of elections over the next year, Regev will soon need to decide on the matter. She will be eager to please the voting public, but will come under huge pressure from the Israeli airlines and their workers' committees. In any case, a delegation from Wizz Air is expected to arrive in Israel in the coming weeks as the moment for a decision fast approaches.\nThe Ministry of Transport said, \"The Ministry of Transport is examining the issue while considering all professional and economic aspects, including the impact of the move on consumers, on fares, on competition in the industry and on the activity of Israeli airlines. A decision will be made after a thorough examination of the data, in cooperation with all relevant parties.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 4, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 04:38:38 GMT", "author": "Asaf Zagrizak", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

A trial was scheduled to begin in October.\nIn the lawsuit, filed in the months after the 2020 election, Dominion accused the cable news network of spreading false claims that the company's voting technology had been manipulated to help Joe Biden beat Donald Trump. Like other right-wing news networks, Newsmax featured Trump allies who promoted these conspiracies, including former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell and supporter Mike Lindell of My Pillow.\nNewsmax announced the settlement in an Aug. 15 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the document, the network paid $27 million of the settlement on that day; the rest will be paid by January 2027.\nMultiple court rulings and investigations by election officials have found no widespread fraud was present in the 2020 election; even still, these debunked claims were still being echoed by factions of Trump supporters in 2024. Dominion has said the election lies caused the company and its employees extensive harm, including death threats and lost revenue.\n\"We are pleased to have settled this matter,\" a Dominion spokesperson said Monday morning.\nIn mid-April, Judge Eric M. Davis, who had presided over Dominion's case against Fox News, ruled that all of the at-issue statements that aired on Newsmax were also false and defamatory. His ruling meant that, should the case have gone to trial, the jury would only have had to decide whether Newsmax acted with \"actual malice,\" whether Dominion should receive damages, and how much money it should get.\nIn a statement, Newsmax did not admit any wrongdoing. It maintained that its 2020 election coverage was \"fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards of journalism.\"\n\"Newsmax believed it was critically important for the American people to hear both sides of the election disputes that arose in 2020,\" it said.\nBut the company also accused Davis of ruling in ways that \"strongly favored the plaintiffs and limited Newsmax's ability to defend itself.\" It claims that the court's actions, in this case and against Fox, \"represent a direct attack on free speech and a free press.\"\nNewsmax founder and CEO Chris Ruddy echoed those words in a phone call Monday afternoon. He suggested that it might be risky for companies to be based in Delaware for that reason, a concern other notable corporate officials have shared after Elon Musk received an unfavorable ruling and moved his business incorporations from Delaware to Texas.\nRuddy said the settlement does not include any required retractions, corrections or apologies.\n\"Readers can read into that what they will,\" he said.\nNewsmax last year settled a defamation case brought by another voting systems company, Smartmatic USA, in the wake of the 2020 election. Information filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed Newsmax was due to pay Smartmatic the second half of that $40 million payout by the end of June 2025.\nSmartmatic is still pursuing a $2.7 billion defamation suit against Fox News in New York state court. That case, if it goes to trial, could be heard by a jury in 2026.\nDominion and some of its employees have separately sued Powell and others, including former Trump attorney and New York mayor Rudy Giuliani.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:37:16 -0400", "author": "Maddy Lauria", "source": "https://www.npr.org/rss/rss.php?id=1006"}

I would bring VHS tapes to school … and just, like, show people when there was a substitute teacher in class.\"\nSNL wasn't the only show that left its mark on Yang; he initially studied chemistry and pre-med in college after becoming \"obsessed\" with Sandra Oh's character on Grey's Anatomy, Yang says. \"And then, after graduating ... I was like, 'Wait, I made a mistake. I actually wanted to be someone who was on TV.'\"\nYang says he never thought SNL would hire \"an effeminate Asian man\" for that show, but he was happy to be proven wrong. He's currently nominated for an Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series for his performances on the show. Looking back now, he says being hired as a writer rather than a cast member initially helped pave the way for his on-screen success.\n\"My first season of writing on the show was probably so helpful in terms of understanding all of these non-verbal cues,\" he says. \"Sit[ting] next to [SNL creator and executive producer] Lorne [Michaels] each week and hav[ing] him give notes on your sketch at dress rehearsal, you really develop this internal sense of, 'OK, I understand how the show works in this very underpinned way.'\"\nIn addition to his work on SNL, Yang had a part in Wicked, and is co-host of the popular podcast Las Culturistas with his friend Matt Rogers. The two hosted a satirical awards show — the Las Culturistas Culture Awards — on Bravo/Peacock.\nInterview highlights\nOn growing up as the child of Chinese immigrants, and being obsessed with pop culture\nAs a closeted Canadian kid who then moved to the States ... it was this big shock to move from French Canada — to move from Quebec — to Colorado, where I was speaking primarily French at school and Mandarin in the house, and suddenly I had to fast-track to English.\nPop culture was this expedited way for me to get on board with what people were talking about at school and what people were talking about at a birthday party or the shows that we would watch when we would have playdates or something like that. SNL was this crash course in pop culture for me every week. The thing that made me love culture was the way that it gets digested, which happens to be what SNL kind of is.\nOn his SNL auditions\nI shudder to watch them now. ... They were making documentaries in the lead-up to the 50th anniversary and they played my auditions to me and filmed my reactions. … I had this visceral response to not wanting to watch that version of myself, like the person who, before he went down the chute of working at SNL, had no idea what the show was looking for. And I think I sort of have to re-evaluate that, because that person is special. He has something. He has gumption to just throw whatever at the wall and see what sticks. Whereas now I feel so much more prudent in my ideas.\nOn portraying JD Vance on SNL\nThis was about a year ago in August, right when the season was starting up. Lorne had reached out and sort of had his plan for how he wanted to cast the main players in the general election, and I was pretty resistant at first, and after a few more conversations, I think I dutifully acquiesced, and then I kind of went about it in the most child-of-immigrants way, where I hired a dialect coach, and I requested a screen test where I tried out different contact lenses, because I felt like so much of JD Vance's sort of visual eeriness was in his eyes. And I was like, \"We have to get that down.\" And then we tried facial hair options. And I took it as a serious charge, which may or may not have been the right way to go about it, but it's been an interesting journey.\nOn creating the Las Culturistas podcast and awards with his friend Matt Rogers\nWe never thought that the podcast would get any listenership. This kind of summarizes the whole premise of the podcast. It's nothing mold breaking. It's two friends talking to each other. It was just an excuse for Matt and I to have a playdate every week, but we had done a lot of comedy together in the years leading up to it. …\nThe awards kind of budded out of this one summer, I think in 2021, when we didn't have a guest booked that week … and that was not a common thing at the time. And so we just kind of made a stream of consciousness list of nominees and categories for theoretical Las Culturistas culture awards. And this awards things from all over the tapestry of human experience, from theme park attractions, to breakfast foods, to scenes from '90s television, to clothing. It was just completely maximalist and global and overwhelming. It's meant to be nonsensical, almost, and it's meant sort of be atemporal, like \"Song of the Summer\" nominees are songs from four years ago. There are no rules. ...\nThen one year in 2022, we threw an outdoor show and it was free. We were overwhelmed by the crowds. We had to turn people away. And so, then from that first year, we were like, \"OK, so the goal is to get this televised so that everyone can opt into this.\"\nOn lying as a kid that he'd seen Wicked\nGrowing up it was this thing of like, well, if you didn't see Wicked then you have no business being a theater kid. When it came out, it was such a phenomenon. Around 2003, I was in high school and I remember going to the library, getting the original Broadway cast recording, and it was life-changing even [with] that entry point. And the thing that I would embellish, especially around late high school, I was just like, \"Yeah, I saw like the national tour of it!\" I never did, Terry. I think I just made up this lie. Because it felt like the right thing to say in order to justify this passion that I had for musical theater.\nI saw it finally for the first time on the West End in London in 2022, I would say, or 2021. It was really crazy how I was like, wow, this is all culminating into this moment where I'm finally seeing the show that has still meant so much to me. And I knew it front to back. …\nI don't want it to make it seem like I was, or still am like someone who doesn't tell the truth. It was just this thing that I felt the pressure to have some sort of social proof. … We were just not a theater-going family. We just didn't have that access. Like thank goodness for public libraries. I went to the library and I sought it out and I kept that CD in my Walkman for weeks. Like, I really ran the overdue charge on it!\nOn a piece of \"cultural contraband\" from his youth\nThe only thing that I ever had to hide was a hardcover copy of The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, because it was my sister's book. And obviously she was allowed to like that, but it was cultural contraband for a teenage boy like me to have any interest in that. So I just remember loving reading those books and then hiding it under my bed ... as if it was pornography. And by the way, I mean, wow, pre-smartphone days! I was having a sexual awakening to classical art books and I highly recommend today's youth go about it the same way, because you were learning about art and you were figuring yourself out. And I don't think the kids have that anymore.\nOn his father's life in the region of China known as Inner Mongolia\nMy dad has all of these stories of him moving out of Inner Mongolia to the city to go to school, like he had $11 in his pocket at the train station, tried fish for the first time at 22, like, he was just eating potatoes and lamb for the first 22 years of his life. Like, he just had no concept of how the world was so expansive. Like, to him, his world was just however many miles within the radius of his town. ... It is this really overwhelming thing that I feel anytime I think about how charmed my own life is, I'm just like: none of this was for granted.\nAnn Marie Baldonado and Susan Nyakundi produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

After the drilling is complete it will move onto the bigger well. If both explorations are successful, this will have a dramatic impact on Bulgaria, and a certain impact on the entire EU. This is sufficient gas to supply all of Bulgaria's energy needs, with a surplus for export to the rest of Europe. There is already a gas pipeline connecting Bulgaria to Greece, Greece to Italy, and from there gas can be pumped into the entire EU.\nFrom NewMed's perspective, the wells have significant potential on an economic level, since the price of gas in Europe is currently extremely high (about $11.5 per thermal unit, more than double that in Israel).

The hotels will add more than 1,000 rooms to the chain in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan and Herzliya. At the same time the chain is moving forward with three more hotels in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Eilat with 540 rooms. Fattal also has plans to build new resort hotels at Zion Square in Jerusalem, along the railway park in Tel Aviv and by the Dead Sea and Sea of Galilee.\nFattal has 66 hotels in Israel (of which 45 are currently operating) and over 240 hotels in Europe with 53,000 rooms in 20 countries.\nIn addition to refurbishing, opening and building hotels, Fattal has acquired the exclusive hotel The Jaffa in Jaffa for an estimated NIS 450 million. The hotel, until now owned by Aby Rosen and Michael Fuchs, has 120 rooms, a spa, swimming pool and chef restaurant, and is considered one of Israel's most luxurious hotels.\nThe hotels just opened by Fattal are Bazaar Hotel in Jaffa with 104 rooms, which opened in April, with an investment of NIS 90 million and the Nucha Hotel in downtown Jerusalem with 86 rooms, which opened last month, with an investment of NIS 150 million.\nHotels set to open are the Reception Hotel in Tel Aviv, at Dizengoff Square, with 75 rooms, which will open in September, with an investment of NIS 100 million. The Nordau Hotel in Tel Aviv, will also open in September. The 22-room veteran hotel has been renovated at a cost of NIS 65 million. The Yacht Hotel in Herzliya Marina, with 327 rooms, will open in March 2026, after an investment of NIS 500 million. The Palatin Hotel in Tel Aviv will open in April 2026 , after an investment of NIS 200 million, and the Leonardo Plaza City Tower in Ramat Gan will reopen in November 2025, after an investment of NIS 80 million.\nNot only Fattal is expanding\nDespite the security situation and the impact on incoming tourism, the hotel industry in Israel continues to grow. More than 1,000 new hotel rooms will be added in the near future, and developers are not hesitating to invest. The Israel Hotels Association says there are 55,000 hotel rooms in Israel, of which 3,000 are inactive due to the security situation, which has led to a major reduction in incoming tourism. However, over the past year, and contrary to all expectations, many developers have seen the potential. According to the Ministry of Tourism, since the start of 2025, more than 700 rooms have been opened, some in new hotels and some as additions to existing hotels.\nSince the Covid pandemic and then since the outbreak of the war, the hotel industry has reported a clear trend: the large chains that have hotel operations abroad continue to build and expand, while small hotels are struggling to survive.\nThe Isrotel chain has also announced major expansion in Israel and abroad in the past year. In 2025, the Isrotel chain planned to open five new hotels in Israel and one hotel in Athens through its international sister chain ALUMA. It also plans to build seven hotels in Israel within five years. The chain currently operates 23 hotels in Israel and three hotels in Athens, and is expected to operate 28 hotels nationwide and over 5,175 rooms by the end of the year.\nIn contrast, Dan Hotels, which benefits from foreign tourism revenue, has been damaged during the war. For example, in a report to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) following the Iram operation, Dan reported a sharp decline in occupancy, cancellations, and lack of new bookings.

The strike was already affecting about 130,000 travelers around the world per day during the peak summer travel season.\nThe Canada Industrial Relations Board ordered airline staff back to work by 2 p.m. Sunday after the government intervened and Air Canada said it planned to resume flights Sunday evening.\nCanada's largest airline now says it will resume flights Monday evening. Air Canada said in a statement that the union \"illegally directed its flight attendant members to defy a direction from the Canadian Industrial Relations Board.\"\n\"Our members are not going back to work,\" Canadian Union of Public Employees national president Mark Hancock said outside Toronto's Pearson International Airport. \"We are saying no.\"\nThe federal government didn't immediately provide comment on the union refusing to return to work.\nHancock said the \"whole process has been unfair\" and said the union will challenge what it called an unconstitutional order.\n\"Air Canada has really refused to bargain with us and they refused to bargain with us because they knew this government would come in on their white horse and try and save the day,\" he said.\nThe country's largest airline had said early Sunday in a release that the first flights would resume later in the day but that it will take several days before its operations return to normal. It said some flights will be canceled over the next seven to 10 days until the schedule is stabilized.\nLess than 12 hours after workers walked off the job, Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered the 10,000 flight attendants back to work, saying now is not the time to take risks with the economy and noting the unprecedented tariffs the U.S. has imposed on Canada. Hajdu referred the work stoppage to the Canada Industrial Relations Board.\nThe airline said the CIRB has extended the term of the existing collective agreement until a new one is determined by the arbitrator.\nThe shutdown of Canada's largest airline early Saturday was impacting about 130,000 people a day.

It seeks to represent others in California who have had chats unknowingly shared with Otter, which the lawyers contend Otter does to \"derive financial gain.\"\nNeither Brewer's legal team nor a spokesperson for Otter returned requests for comment.\nOtter's privacy policy does not hide the AI training. It says it receives \"explicit permission\" from users to train its systems on meeting transcripts when users check a box granting Otter and third parties to ingest the private conversations \"for training and product improvement purposes,\" but the lawsuit maintains many are still being duped.\nIn recent months, new privacy questions have dogged Otter as it has become increasingly deployed in workplaces around the world.\nSome 25 million people now use its AI transcription tools, which have recorded and processed more than 1 billion meetings since the company was founded in 2016, the company says.\nUsers have shared horror stories on platforms such as X and Reddit about Otter's automated recording tools backfiring.\nLast year, an AI researcher and engineer said Otter had recorded a Zoom meeting with investors, then shared with him a transcription of the chat including \"intimate, confidential details\" about a business discussed after he had left the meeting. Those portions of the conversation ended up killing a deal, The Washington Post reported.\nPolitico's China correspondent has written about interviewing a Uyghur human rights activist using Otter and realizing that the company shares user data with third parties, raising fears over the possibility that the Chinese government could attempt to access raw transcriptions of conversations with dissidents. Otter has said it does not share any data with foreign governments or law enforcement agencies.\nOn Reddit, users have complained about Otter joining meetings automatically when the service is linked to workplace calendars and recording chats without consent.\nIt's a phenomenon also highlighted by the lawsuit. If someone has an Otter account and joins a virtual meeting, the software will typically ask the meeting's host for permission to record, but it does not by default ask all the other participants.\n\"In fact, if the meeting host is an Otter accountholder who has integrated their relevant Google Meet, Zoom, or Microsoft Teams accounts with Otter, an Otter Notetaker may join the meeting without obtaining the affirmative consent from any meeting participant, including the host,\" the lawsuit alleges. \"What Otter has done is use its Otter Notetaker meeting assistant to record, transcribe, and utilize the contents of conversations without the Class members' informed consent.\"\nOtter claims that before the audio of meetings is fed into its machine learning systems to help improve an AI speech recognition feature, it is \"de-identified,\" a method by which data can be anonymized.\nYet the suit filed on Friday raises concerns about Otter's ability to do this effectively, saying the company provides no public explanation of its \"de-identifying\" process.\n\"Upon information and belief, Otter's deidentification process does not remove confidential information or guarantee speaker anonymity,\" the lawsuit argues.", "published": "Fri, 15 Aug 2025 20:44:21 -0400", "author": "Bobby Allyn", "source": "https://www.npr.org/rss/rss.php?id=1006"}

{"title": "AI experts return from China stunned: The U.S. grid is so weak, the race may already be over", "url": "https://fortune.com/2025/08/14/data-centers-china-grid-us-infrastructure/", "text": "“Everywhere we went, people treated energy availability as a given,” Rui Ma wrote on X after returning from a recent tour of China’s AI hubs.\nFor American AI researchers, that’s almost unimaginable. In the U.S., surging AI demand is colliding with a fragile power grid, the kind of extreme bottleneck that Goldman Sachs warns could severely choke the industry’s growth.\nIn China, Ma continued, it’s considered a “solved problem.”\nMa, a renowned expert in Chinese technology and founder of the media company Tech Buzz China, took her team on the road to get a firsthand look at the country’s AI advancements. She told Fortune that while she isn’t an energy expert, she attended enough meetings and talked to enough insiders to come away with a conclusion that should send chills down the spine of Silicon Valley: In China, building enough power for data centers is no longer up for debate.\n“This is a stark contrast to the U.S., where AI growth is increasingly tied to debates over data center power consumption and grid limitations,” she wrote on X.\nThe stakes are difficult to overstate. Data center building is the foundation of AI advancement, and spending on new centers now displaces consumer spending in terms of impact to U.S. GDP. That’s concerning since consumer spending is generally two-thirds of the pie. McKinsey projects that between 2025 and 2030, companies worldwide will need to invest $6.7 trillion into new data center capacity to keep up with AI’s strain.\nIn a recent research note, Stifel Nicolaus warned of a looming correction to the S&P 500, since it forecasts this data center capital expenditures boom to be a one-off build-out of infrastructure, while consumer spending is clearly on the wane.\nHowever, the clear limiting factor to the U.S.’s data center infrastructure development, according to a Deloitte industry survey, is stress on the power grid. Cities’ power grids are so weak that some companies are just building their own power plants rather than relying on existing grids. The public is growing increasingly frustrated over increasing energy bills. In Ohio, the electricity bill for a typical household has increased at least $15 a month this summer from the data centers, while energy companies prepare for a sea change of surging demand.\nGoldman Sachs frames the crisis simply: “AI’s insatiable power demand is outpacing the grid’s decade-long development cycles, creating a critical bottleneck.”\nMeanwhile, David Fishman, a Chinese electricity expert who has spent years tracking the country’s energy development, told Fortune that in China, electricity isn’t even a question. On average, China adds more electricity demand than the entire annual consumption of Germany, every single year. Whole rural provinces are blanketed in rooftop solar, with one province matching the entirety of India’s electricity supply.\n“U.S. policymakers should be hoping China stays a competitor and not an aggressor,” Fishman said. “Because right now they can’t compete effectively on the energy infrastructure front.”\nChina has an oversupply of electricty\nChina’s quiet electricity dominance, Fishman explained, is the result of decades of deliberate overbuilding and investment in every layer of the power sector, from generation to transmission to next-generation nuclear.\nThe country’s reserve margin has never dipped below 80%–100% nationwide, meaning it has consistently maintained at least twice the capacity it needs, Fishman said. They have so much available space that instead of seeing AI data centers as a threat to grid stability, China treats them as a convenient way to “soak up oversupply,” he added.\nThat level of cushion is unthinkable in the United States, where regional grids typically operate with a 15% reserve margin and sometimes less, particularly during extreme weather, Fishman said. In places like California or Texas, officials often issue warnings about red-flag conditions when demand is projected to strain the system. This leaves little room to absorb the rapid load increases AI infrastructure requires, Fishman noted.\nThe gap in readiness is stark: While the U.S. is already experiencing political and economic fights over whether the grid can keep up, China is operating from a position of abundance.\nEven if AI demand in China grows so quickly renewable projects can’t keep pace, Fishman said, the country can tap idle coal plants to bridge the gap while building more sustainable sources. “It’s not preferable,” he admitted, “but it’s doable.”\nBy contrast, the U.S. would have to scramble to bring on new generation capacity, often facing yearslong permitting delays, local opposition, and fragmented market rules, he said.\nStructural governance differences\nUnderpinning the hardware advantage is a difference in governance. In China, energy planning is coordinated by long-term, technocratic policy that defines the market’s rules before investments are made, Fishman said. This model ensures infrastructure build-out happens in anticipation of demand, not in reaction to it.\n“They’re set up to hit grand slams,” Fishman noted. “The U.S., at best, can get on base.”\nIn the U.S., large-scale infrastructure projects depend heavily on private investment, but most investors expect a return within three to five years: far too short for power projects that can take a decade to build and pay off.\n“Capital is really biased toward shorter-term returns,” he said, noting Silicon Valley has funneled billions into “the nth iteration of software as a service” while energy projects fight for funding.\nIn China, by contrast, the state directs money toward strategic sectors in advance of demand, accepting not every project will succeed but ensuring the capacity is in place when it’s needed. Without public financing to de-risk long-term bets, he argued, the U.S. political and economic system is simply not set up to build the grid of the future.\nCultural attitudes reinforce this approach. In China, renewables are framed as a cornerstone of the economy because they make sense economically and strategically, not because they carry moral weight. Coal use isn’t cast as a sign of villainy, as it would be among some circles in the U.S. It’s simply seen as outdated. This pragmatic framing, Fishman argued, allows policymakers to focus on efficiency and results rather than political battles.\nFor Fishman, the takeaway is blunt. Without a dramatic shift in how the U.S. builds and funds its energy infrastructure, China’s lead will only widen.\n“The gap in capability is only going to continue to become more obvious—and grow in the coming years,” he said.", "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 19:55:49 +0000", "author": "Eva Roytburg", "source": "https://fortune.com/feed/fortune-feeds/?id=3230629"}
{"title": "Workers are ‘job hugging’ in a stagnant labor market, but growing resentment means they could bail as soon as the next Great Resignation comes", "url": "https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/what-is-job-hugging-next-great-resignation/", "text": "- More employees are planning to stay at their current jobs as a stagnant labor market shakes workers’ confidence they’ll be able to find work elsewhere. This act of “job hugging,” however, can exacerbate employees feeling stuck, stoking resentment toward their employers. One workplace expert said this growing discontent will lead to another Great Resignation once market conditions improve.\nA stagnating labor market is leading workers to hold tightly on to their jobs, even as growing workplace uncertainty stokes resentment and concern among employees, consultants warn. But while employees are staying put to weather the storm, this act of “job hugging” may only be temporary as they prepare to flee as soon as market conditions improve.\nThe pandemic-era “Great Resignation” saw 47 million people quit their jobs in 2021 and 50 million more in 2022 as they looked for flexible working conditions and higher pay. As job openings and turnover returned to pre-COVID levels in 2023, the mass exodus of workers transitioned to the “Great Stay.”\nToday, as tariff uncertainty threatens companies’ growth plans and private equity funding slows—not to mention advancements in AI stoking employees’ fears about being displaced—workers are staying put with extra anxiety. They’re concerned that should they quit, they wouldn’t be able to find options elsewhere, according to consulting firm Korn Ferry. This act of “job hugging” has workers hanging on to their positions “for dear life.”\n“Given just all the activity that happened post-COVID and then some of these constant layoffs, people are waiting and sitting in seats and hoping that they have more stability,” Korn Ferry managing consultant Stacy DeCesaro told Fortune.\nSince 2024’s fourth quarter, the Eagle Hill Consulting Employee Retention Index has indicated growing employee intent to stay at their current jobs in the next six months. The consultancy also saw a 4.4-point drop in its Market Opportunity Indicator last quarter, indicating a steep decline in employee perceptions of the job market. U.S. payrolls grew by just 73,000 in July, and have expanded by an average of only 35,000 in the past three months.\n“No one is wanting to leave unless they’re very unhappy or miserable in their job or just feel so unsettled by the company,” DeCesaro said.\nGrowing employee frustration\nJust because more employees are sticking around doesn’t mean they are happy about it. A November 2024 report from Glassdoor found that 65% of employees reported feeling “stuck” in their current positions, including 73% of those in tech roles. With fewer alternatives, sitting tight at one’s job has, for many, resulted in cabin fever.\n“It’s no accident that trends like ‘quiet quitting’ are resonating now,” Daniel Zhao, lead economist at Glassdoor, wrote in the report. “As workers feel stuck, pent-up resentment boils under the surface and employee disengagement rises.”\nOn top of bleak job prospects elsewhere, employees are also grappling with a rotating door of company management, which has exacerbated feelings of discomfort and disconnect from a firm’s vision, DeCesaro said. Some of her clients said they’ve worked under three different company presidents in the past 18 months.\nCEO turnover rates have reached their highest in decades, with departures jumping 12% from June 2024 to June 2025, according to data from executive placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, reaching the highest levels since the company began tracking turnover in 2002.\nIn other cases, DeCesaro said, new management has provided hope for employees, incentivizing them to stick around that much longer, even if their workplace culture ultimately doesn’t end up changing for the better.\nTaken together, these factors have led to the rise of “quiet cracking,” employees reaching a breaking point and mentally checking out. The productivity dip as a result of employee disengagement cost the world economy $438 billion in 2024, according to Gallup’s 2025 State of the Global Workplace report.\n‘Great Resignation’ redux\nEmployees may have few other career options now, but once market conditions improve, this quiet discontent will no doubt mean déjà vu for employers, DeCesaro said: Another Great Resignation is coming.\n“Once the market improves, I think it’s going to be super active because there’s a lot of pent-up demand of like, ‘I’ve been miserable here for a while, but I’ve just been waiting for a better opportunity or a better market to move,’” DeCesaro said.\nIf employers want to ensure their workers don’t leave as soon as they see other career options, they should focus on looking for opportunities to open doors of communication between management and rank-and-file workers, as well as take the time to gather and listen to workers’ feedback, according to DeCesaro.\nWith some jobs remaining entirely remote, there should be a continued effort to gather once a year or quarter to create a cohesive company culture.\n“It’s going to be a fruit basket turnover of talent,” DeCesaro said. “But if you’ve invested in your people between now and when that happens, people are going to be reticent to leave.”", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 17:59:45 +0000", "author": "Sasha Rogelberg", "source": "https://fortune.com/feed/fortune-feeds/?id=3230629"}

Again, this was a very good, early step for a War that has been going on for almost four years.”\nEarlier on Monday, Trump said during talks with Zelenskyy and European leaders that a potential ceasefire and who gets Ukrainian territory seized by Russia should be hashed out during a face-to-face meeting between the warring countries’ two leaders.\nThe talks at the White House came days after Trump hosted Putin for a summit at a U.S. military base in Alaska in which he tilted toward Putin’s demands that Ukraine make concessions over land seized by Russia, which now controls roughly one-fifth of Ukrainian territory.\n“We’re going to let the president go over and talk to the president and we’ll see how that works out,” Trump said during his meeting with Zelenskyy and the European leaders. Trump and Zelenskyy also expressed hope of soon holding three-way talks among the U.S., Russian and Ukrainian leaders.\nTrump also said he would back European security guarantees for Ukraine as he met with Zelenskyy and the leaders of France, Britain, Germany, Italy and Finland, as well as the president of the European Commission and the head of NATO.\nTrump stopped short of committing U.S. troops to a collective effort to bolster Ukraine’s security. He said instead that there would be a “NATO-like” security presence and that all those details would be hashed out with EU leaders.\n“They want to give protection and they feel very strongly about it and we’ll help them out with that,” Trump said. “I think its very important to get the deal done.”\nSpeaking Monday before the White House meetings took place, Russia’s Foreign Ministry rejected the idea of a possible NATO peacekeeping force in Ukraine. Such a scenario could see further escalation and “unpredictable consequences,” ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova warned.\nTrump’s engagement with Zelenskyy had a strikingly different feel to their last Oval Office meeting in February. It was a disastrous moment that led to Trump abruptly ending talks with the Ukrainian delegation, and temporarily pausing some aid for Kyiv, after he and Vice President JD Vance complained that Zelenskyy had shown insufficient gratitude for U.S. military assistance.\nZelenskyy at the start of the meeting presented a letter from his wife, Olena Zelenska, for Trump’s wife, Melania. Trump hand-delivered a letter to Putin from the U.S. first lady urging him to consider the children impacted by the conflict and bring an end to the brutal 3 1/2 year war.\nTrump at one point needled Zelenskyy over Ukraine delaying elections. They had been scheduled for last year but were delayed because of the ongoing Russian invasion. Ukrainian law does not allow presidential elections to be held when martial lawis in effect.\nTrump joked that a similar circumstance wouldn’t play well in the U.S.\nZelenskyy faced criticism during his February meeting from a conservative journalist for appearing in the Oval Office in a long sleeve T-shirt. This time he appeared in a dark jacket and buttoned shirt.\nZelenskyy has said his typically less formal attire since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022 is to show solidarity with Ukrainian soldiers.\nMonday’s hastily assembled meeting came after Trump met in Alaska on Friday with Putin. After that meeting, Trump said the onus is now on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions of land that he said could end the war.\nTrump said he plans to talk to Putin after his meetings with Zelenskyy and European leaders.\n“We’ll see in a certain period of time, not very far from now, a week or two weeks, we’re going to know whether or not we’re going to solve this or is this horrible fighting going to continue,” Trump said.\nThe European leaders were left out of Trump’s summit with Putin. They want to safeguard Ukraine and the continent from any widening aggression from Moscow. Many arrived at the White House with the explicit goal of protecting Ukraine’s interests — a rare show of diplomatic force.\nAhead of Monday’s meeting, Trump suggested that Ukraine could not regain Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, setting off an armed conflict that led to its broader 2022 invasion.\n“President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,” Trump wrote Sunday night on social media. “Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!”\nZelenskyy responded with his own post late Sunday, saying, “We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.” He said that “peace must be lasting,” not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago, and “Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack.”\nEuropean heavyweights in Washington\nPutin opposes Ukraine joining NATO outright, yet Trump’s team claims the Russian leader is open to Western allies agreeing to defend Ukraine if it comes under attack.\nEuropean leaders suggested forging a temporary ceasefire is not off the table. Following his meeting with Putin on Friday, Trump dropped his demand for an immediate ceasefire and said that he would look to secure a final peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine — a sudden shift to a position favored by Putin.\nAt the start of Monday’s meeting with European leaders, the German and French leaders praised Trump for opening a path to peace, but they urged the U.S. president to push Russia for a ceasefire.\n“I would like to see a ceasefire from the next meeting, which should be a trilateral meeting,” said German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.\nTrump, for his part, on Monday reiterated that a broader, war-ending peace agreement between the two countries is “very attainable,” but that “all of us would obviously prefer the immediate ceasefire while we work on a lasting peace.”\nThe other European leaders in attendance were: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.\n‘A big step’\nEuropean leaders are still looking for a concrete details about what U.S. involvement would be toward building a security guarantee for Ukraine.\nStill, Rutte, the NATO Secretary-General, called Trump’s commitment to security guarantees “a big step, a breakthrough.”\nZelenskyy outlined what he said his country needed to feel secure, which included a “strong Ukrainian army” through weapons sales and training. The second part, he said, would depend on the outcome of Monday’s talks and what EU countries, NATO and the U.S. would be able to guarantee to the war-torn country.\nTrump briefed Zelenskyy and European allies shortly after the Putin meeting. Details from the discussions emerged in a scattershot way that seemed to rankle the U.S. president, who had chosen not to outline any terms when appearing afterward with Putin.\nEuropean officials confirmed that Trump told them Putin is still seeking control of the entire Donbas region, even though Ukraine still controls a meaningful share of it.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 22:51:23 +0000", "author": "Sylvie Corbet, Samya Kullab, Aamer Madhani, The Associated Press", "source": "https://fortune.com/feed/fortune-feeds/?id=3230629"}

After receiving backlash this April for a staff memo posted on LinkedIn detailing the company’s “AI-first” strategy, the tech leader clarified that the $16.8 billion language app doesn’t plan to fire full-time staffers. Instead, its contractors will fluctuate based on the company’s needs, while its salaried staffers get more done, thanks to AI.\nAfter Duolingo received backlash for its “AI-first” staff memo posted on LinkedIn this April—conjuring worries of mass layoffs—the company’s CEO, Luis von Ahn, is setting the record straight. Now, the executive has doubled down that he doesn’t intend to “lay off humans.”\n“This was on me. I did not give enough context,” von Ahn told the New York Times in a recent interview when asked about the controversial memo. “We’ve never laid off any full-time employees. We don’t plan to.”\nJust three months ago, the language learning platform with over 100 million users emphasized having to “move with urgency,” outlining a grand plan to achieve the goal of being an “AI-first” company.\nThe strategy included a gradual reduction in contractors to “do work that AI can handle,” and increasing headcount only if “a team cannot automate more of their work.” Von Ahn insisted that the AI-first memo did not draw scrutiny from Duolingo staffers—but that onlookers were quick to take up arms online.\nThe tech CEO also added that this change is nothing new: “From the beginning, we’ve had contractors that we use for temporary tasks, and our contractor force has gone up and down depending on needs.”\nVon Ahn added that said work will likely change in the next five years because of AI—but again that that doesn’t mean staff cuts at Duolingo.\n“What will probably happen is that one person will be able to accomplish more, rather than having fewer people,” he said.\nDuolingo has even started encouraging staff to use AI weekly on Fridays—an activity he called “F-r-A-I-days.” During that time, Duolingo teams are allowed to “experiment on how to get more efficient in using AI,” von Ahn added.\nAI displacement in the workplace\nDuolingo isn’t the only company trimming its outsourced and contractor roles as AI takes over routine work. In mid-July, ScaleAI laid off approximately 500 contractors—more than double the 200 full-time staffers who were let go.\nAccording to MIT’s State of AI in Business 2025 report, AI is primarily displacing offshore roles, not domestic full-time jobs. According to the report, automating outsourcing has a $2 million to $10 million return on investment.\nAnd while 3% of jobs could currently be replaced by AI, MIT told Axios that that figure could rise to nearly a third of all jobs in the longer term.\nThough Duolingo insists it won’t cut full-timers, not every tech company has taken that approach. Enterprise software powerhouse IgniteTech laid off 80% of its staff because they weren’t adapting to AI fast enough—and its CEO says he’d do it again today.\n“In early 2023, we saw the light,” IgniteTech CEO Eric Vaughan told Fortune, adding that he believed every tech company was facing a crucial inflection point around adoption of artificial intelligence. “Now, I’ve certainly morphed to believe that this is every company, and I mean that literally every company, is facing an existential threat by this transformation.”", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 17:22:47 +0000", "author": "Jessica Coacci", "source": "https://fortune.com/feed/fortune-feeds/?id=3230629"}
{"title": "Wayfair CFO says sellers on the company’s $12 billion marketplace are trying to ‘insulate’ customers from tariffs", "url": "https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/wayfair-cfo-interview-tariffs-consumer-spending/", "text": "The home goods category has seen its share of twists and turns over the past five years: a pandemic-era boom and then a slump when consumers pivoted toward travel and experiences rather than physical items. Now, it’s facing headwinds in the form of tariffs and an uncertain economy, and generative AI could be changing how people shop.\nKate Gulliver, CFO and chief administrative officer at Wayfair, spoke with CFO Brew about her career, and about her company’s plan to roll with the punches.\nFrom startup to category leader: In some ways, Gulliver has grown along with Wayfair. After working in private equity, she joined the company as head of investor relations in 2014, and helped to run its IPO. At that time, it had about $1 billion in sales and 2,000 employees, Gulliver said. She describes it as “a super high-growth but relatively immature company from a systems and process perspective.” Today, Wayfair employs around 12,000 people and brought in $12 billion in revenue from June 2024 through June 2025.\nFrom investor relations, Gulliver became global head of talent, and was named CFO and CAO in 2022. Her career at Wayfair has evolved in an organic fashion.\n“I largely let my career be guided by the opportunity most immediately in front of me,” she said. “I’ve never tried to guide toward ‘10 years from now, here’s where that role is getting me.’ It’s been more ‘Is this the next right move?’”\nAs a combined CFO and chief administrative officer, Gulliver has plenty on her plate: HR, finance, real estate, legal and compliance, corporate affairs, and communications all report to her. She enjoys the breadth of the dual role, which she says gives her insight into the “backbone” of the company. “Intellectually,” the many departments she oversees “can feel quite different day to day, which is fun,” she said.\nA turbulent five years for retail: As a seller of discretionary goods, Wayfair has been on a rocky ride over the past five years. It was able to capitalize on the home goods boom of the pandemic, when shoppers stuck in lockdown were buying items for their spaces. But as restrictions lifted and consumers pivoted toward spending on experiences, it saw net losses for three consecutive years. Wayfair had to restructure and underwent several rounds of layoffs, cutting around 13% of its workforce, or 1,650 jobs, in 2024.\nNow, though, the category is “starting to stabilize,” Gulliver said. Wayfair had a bumper second quarter this year, with revenues rising 5% year over year.\n“We’re feeling good about the momentum currently,” she said.\nWayfair isn’t seeing consumer softness yet due to tariffs and economic uncertainty, Gulliver said, though it’s seeing more strength in its high-end lines, such as Perigold, AllModern, and Joss & Main, than in its “core mass” lines. (“There’s no question the higher-end market is stronger than mass,” CEO Niraj Shah said during a recent earnings call.) The company is keeping its eye on the macroeconomic picture, though. It’s doing a lot of forecasting, incorporating both its internal data and third-party inputs such as credit card data and housing market trends, Gulliver said.\nSo far tariffs haven’t had that much of an impact, Gulliver said. That’s partly because Wayfair is a marketplace. Sellers post many unbranded items that look similar to one another, so they’re largely competing on price, she said. Lower prices also allow for better placement on Wayfair’s search results, boosting sales. Sellers, Gulliver said, are finding ways to absorb or offset tariffs at different points along the supply chain, which is “helping to insulate consumers” from higher prices. “Consumers are still seeing like-for-like pricing,” she said.\nAI, how about midcentury modern? Wayfair is also anticipating changes generative AI might make to shopping habits. It’s partnering with some major AI providers on developing agentic shopping tools, Gulliver said. And it’s added GenAI features to its website and app that show customers how furniture might look in different spaces within a home, alongside recommendations for similar Wayfair products. “It’s a fun way to capitalize on how consumers might be changing how they shop,” Gulliver said.\nAt the same time, the retailer’s made a surprisingly analog move: opening brick-and-mortar stores. Its Chicago store has resulted in a “halo” effect, boosting sales and brand recognition in the Chicago area, Shah said on an earnings call. Three more physical stores are planned in the coming years.\nAs a Wayfair shopper and home design fan herself (“That is the thing I read about in my spare time”), Gulliver understands what consumers are looking for. But even her broad remit, she acknowledges, only goes so far. “I’m always going to the brand team or the merchant team” and asking, ‘Have we thought about getting this product?’,” she said. “And they’re like, ‘Kate, stay in your lane.’”\nThis report was originally published by CFO Brew.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 21:04:32 +0000", "author": "Courtney Vien, CFO Brew", "source": "https://fortune.com/feed/fortune-feeds/?id=3230629"}
{"title": "How big data and an A-list board turned struggling NYU Langone into a $14 billion hospital powerhouse", "url": "https://fortune.com/article/nyu-langone-hospital-robert-grossman-ken-langone-health-data/", "text": "On a rainy afternoon in May, the 96 members of New York University Grossman School of Medicine, Class of 2025, gathered with their families in Carnegie Hall. They crossed the stage, collected their degrees, and all together recited the Hippocratic oath. But while their graduation into the ranks of medical doctors was the point of the ceremony, in some ways it did not feel like the day’s main event.\nThat belonged to another pair on stage, Dr. Robert Grossman and Ken Langone—graduates of a different sort, who as dean and board chairman respectively were presiding for the 18th and last time over the graduation ceremony. This was their swan song, or maybe something more of a victory lap.\nGrossman spoke of his hard-fought path to the top of NYU Langone—“I had no sponsors, no mentors, no coaches. No one was there to introduce me to any ‘important’ people or direct my career”—before imparting 15 nuggets of wisdom he had collected. (No. 1: “It doesn’t matter where you come from, it does matter how high you aim.” No. 5: “Depth of knowledge is very important.” No. 14: “Find the right partner.”)\nHis business partner, Langone, gave him a warm embrace and in his own speech, remarked that his association with Grossman was “one of the most rewarding of his life.”\nThe audience was well-disposed to share the spotlight: Thanks to Langone and Grossman, their medical educations had all come tuition-free. And Grossman’s lessons were on point—since they encapsulated the ambition and tenacity that made NYU Langone an enviable success story in American health care.\nTwo decades ago, NYU’s academic medical center was a troubled institution, treading water; today, it’s one of the country’s most efficient providers of high-quality care, with 53,000 employees, roughly $14 billion in revenue—up from $2 billion in 2007—and more than 320 locations. Its innovations in medical-school education—introducing an accelerated three-year curriculum, and that free tuition—have made its programs models for others around the country. NYU Langone has wooed world-leading talent while scaling the ranks of federally funded research hospitals. And while it has taken place in a health care setting, the NYU Langone recovery has been driven by two interlinked factors—a disciplined reliance on data and a relentless culture of accountability—that wouldn’t feel out of place on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley.\nThe turnaround is a source of much pride for the somewhat unlikely pair that presided over it: Grossman, a neuroradiologist who had no formal business training when he became CEO and dean of the medical center in 2007; and Ken Langone, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot who has chaired its board—and given so much time and money to the institution that it now bears his name—since 1999. (Langone, who is also a major Republican donor, later honored Grossman by naming NYU Langone’s two medical schools after him.)\nIt’s a story the two men, 78 and 89 respectively, are eager to tell as they prepare to hand over their roles to carefully selected successors come September 1. NYU Langone granted Fortune access to its executives and inner workings to better understand the organization and its transformation. For a reporter who has written extensively about the nation’s often dysfunctional health system, it was an opportunity to learn what it took for one American health system to succeed—and what others can learn from it.\nIt’s also a time when many hospitals need help—stat. In 2023, 48% of the nation’s rural hospitals operated at a financial loss. More than one-third of them—some 700—were at risk of closure, according to a 2024 report by the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. And this year’s cuts to Medicaid and National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding have imposed serious turbulence on hospitals of all kinds.\nNYU Langone has been blessed by geography—headquartered amid the concentrated wealth of midtown Manhattan—and supported, in time and generous donations, by a board that reads like the guest list of a Davos cocktail party. Beyond Langone, and to name just a few, trustees include board co-Chair and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Ken Chenault (former CEO of American Express), and former Goldman Sachs exec and Trump advisor Gary Cohn. Overseers include JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon, billionaire hedge funder Paul Tudor Jones, and David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Brothers.\nNYU Langone is a non-profit health system, but make no mistake, it’s run like the big business that it is. (By 2024 revenues, it would rank No. 308 on this year’s Fortune 500.) Grossman earned $22.8 million in total compensation in 2023, and its doctors rank among New York’s highest paid—as Tom Murphy, founder and partner at private-equity fund Crestview Partners and another trustee, proudly pointed out to me, “We pay our people well to do a good job.”\nMany are uncomfortable with the notion of non-profit hospitals operating more like Fortune 500 companies than charity wards. But Ge Bai, a professor of accounting and health policy at Johns Hopkins, says, “That’s the reality nowadays.” She notes that NYU Langone has been uniquely successful in the industry because of its strengths generating patient revenue and controlling expenses. “Their operations are amazing,” Bai adds.\nYou may wonder if NYU Langone is successful simply because it is charging more. But an analysis of Turquoise Health data, showing rates charged by New York’s five large hospital systems for eight frequently performed procedures found that NYU’s prices, on average, ranked second-lowest, behind Mount Sinai.\nIndeed, the operations are where the learnings are. And while it’s tempting to ask how transferrable lessons from a wealthy, well-connected hospital system can be in other parts of the country, NYU Langone in recent years has expanded into more difficult markets—that is, ones with poorer and sicker patients—generating evidence that its turnaround playbook can work outside of the rarified confines of Manhattan.\nWhat then is NYU’s secret sauce, and how can others replicate the formula?\nInheriting a medical mess\nThings were not good when Grossman arrived at New York University Medical Center to run the radiology department in 2001. He was days into the role when a pipe burst in his office, leaving a pile of plaster and unsightly debris. It took eight weeks to get someone from the organization to fix it, because no one would take ownership: Was the medical school responsible for the wall, or the hospital?\nTo Grossman, who had come from Penn, the absurd situation symbolized the inefficiency and dysfunction that ailed NYUMC and academic medicine more broadly. When he became dean and CEO in 2007, Grossman vowed to run the school and hospital as a single integrated entity. He also boldly committed to make the institution “world-class”—“an academic medical center competing successfully with the Hopkins, the Harvards and Penns,” he wrote in his investiture speech.\nLangone, a self-made business titan who, before co-founding Home Depot, had taken Electronic Data Systems public with Ross Perot, shared Grossman’s lofty goals. He had joined the board in 1999 when his friend, Martin Lipton, an M&A attorney and NYU trustee, told Langone he needed help with a mess at the medical center. (A graduate of NYU’s business school, Langone says he didn’t even realize NYU had a medical center.)\nThat mess: a 1998 merger with Mount Sinai that had gone so badly that the hospitals broke up a few years later. By 2003, the combined entity had racked up three straight years of losses, $670 million in debt, and a junk-bond rating. The institution was independent again, but not profitable, when Grossman got promoted in 2007.\nLangone and Grossman had bonded several years earlier when Grossman, wanting to replace his department’s radiology equipment, had put out a request for proposals. Showing some raw business talent, he negotiated an unthinkably good deal with Siemens: The medtech company agreed to give NYU the technology, plus $100 million for NYU to serve as a showroom. Those terms impressed Langone, who happened to be on the board of General Electric, a losing bidder. That Langone didn’t let that conflict—or his friendship with GE’s then-CEO Jack Welch—interfere with the Siemens deal, meanwhile, impressed Grossman.\nOver the years, the two have become incredibly close, trading regular phone calls and referring to each other as “brothers from different mothers.” Grossman attributes their kinship to their hardscrabble childhoods and the resilience it fostered. He was a scholarship kid who described his mom to me as “an illegal immigrant.” Langone’s parents, also immigrants, worked as a plumber and a cafeteria worker, and didn’t get schooling beyond junior high.\nLangone, 11 years Grossman’s senior, plays the gregarious and protective older sibling in the relationship. When I met him at his Park Avenue office, he heaped praise on Grossman—“He’s brilliant…values beyond reproach…this guy could take my job doing deals!” (When it comes to himself, Langone’s prone to absurd self-effacement: “I’m not the brightest bulb,” he tends to say, emphasizing his science education ended in 8th grade.) The big-brother vibe plays out practically too: Grossman, who described Langone as “the best guy in the world,” says he’s a keenly intelligent sounding board, and some extra muscle. “We deal with politicians, and he’s connected, and that’s very important as well.”\nThe board sees the duo’s dynamic as a key to NYU Langone’s success. Murphy describes Grossman as the transformation’s visionary, and Langone as its enabling force. Fink, who points out his firm owns 5%-10% of virtually every major company in the world, says, “I see some really good leadership and some really crappy leadership, but it was very clear, very early on that the chemistry between Bob and Ken was something very unique.” He adds, “Bob grew into the CEO role—a lot of it was the trust he had with Ken, and maybe a little bit with me.”\nGrossman’s leadership was a shock to the broader system, however. He fired most of the executive team before his first day. Not long after, he ripped out a relatively new $35 million electronic health-record system, telling the board he needed to install the more expensive Epic system instead.\nRather than acquiring hospitals—the go-to strategy for health systems at the time—Grossman committed to building a network of outpatient facilities, correctly anticipating that technology would allow an increasing share of procedures to be performed outside of hospitals. (That strategy has paid off: Ambulatory facilities don’t require 24/7 staffing and are more profitable.)\nRelaying the events to me 18 years later, Grossman still seemed tickled by his own audacity, and the fact that he has shown up naysayers, like a McKinsey consultant who told him he was doing too many things too fast.\nSatisfying too, was his experience watching a class at Harvard Business School discuss NYU Langone, the case study. The students struck Grossman as timid: They’d all viewed his early management purge—“Black Wednesday,” as it became known—as cataclysmic. “I didn’t think it was any big deal,” he told me. “I just didn’t think the institution was functioning.”\nDr. Andrew Brotman, NYU Langone’s outgoing chief clinical officer, recalls that Grossman fired people he was friendly with that day, with no apparent anguish. That sort of compartmentalization is “characteristic of Bob,” he told me. “He does what’s best for the organization.”\nFiona Druckenmiller, a former portfolio manager who joined NYU Langone’s board in 2006—and who will succeed Langone as chair on Sept. 1— describes Bob “as one of the most decisive people I’ve ever met.”\nAn all-seeing data ‘dashboard’\nThe key to decision-making at NYU Langone is the “dashboard,” a data-rich tool that tracks more than 800 metrics across the system in real time. Grossman created the platform, which he refers to as the organization’s “sole source of truth,” with the help of a small, select team early in his tenure; he felt the input of other managers would muddy his vision.\nThe dashboard captures everything from teacher evaluations and high-impact publications to ICU bed space and operating-room turnover time. It’s how Grossman obsessively manages the place, and how the contribution of every department, physician, nursing unit, and administrator is measured.\nBig data is hardly novel in the corporate world, but the analytics that has already revolutionized most industries has been slower to transform health care, due to clumsy IT systems, fragmented providers, and heightened privacy concerns. Perhaps what sets NYU Langone’s dashboard apart is its thoroughness and its centrality to the organization.\nI was eager to see the dashboard data through Grossman’s eyes, and he agreed to give me a demonstration one morning. He clicked through his go-to pages—one flagging trending data across the system, another showing emergency department stats. (Average “door to doc time” that morning: 13 minutes; average time in ER: 4.5 hours, which Grossman described as “damn good.”) We looked up his own dashboard usage (269 log-ins in the past year; enough to put him in the top 2.5% of the system’s users, but well short of his Chief of Hospital Operations, Dr. Fritz François, whose count topped 4,000.)\nThe granularity of data has been key to identifying issues and fixing them. Even before the dashboard came online, for example, Grossman noticed a quirk with the NYU Langone’s “case mix index,” a measure that reflects the complexity of patient cases and care provided. Grossman realized that physicians weren’t fully documenting cases, and as a result, weren’t being fully reimbursed for care. A major documentation effort followed, an exercise which helped turn around the organization’s finances.\nIf Grossman has a north star metric, it’s “length of stay.” Hospital operations are more profitable, in essence, when in-patient stays are short, and so length-of-stay has become an NYU Langone benchmark of focus. To some, that may sound sinister, like an incentive for kicking patients out before they’re ready to go home. But there’s considerable evidence that unnecessary time in the hospital can do patients more harm than good, increasing their risk of infection or other complications, which are also costly for the system.\nNYU Langone now has one of the nation’s lowest average lengths of stay—something Grossman could show me thanks to third-party data that populates the dashboard and allows comparing NYU Langone to 115 other large health systems. He navigated over to a screen ranking hospitals by observed-to-expected mortality. The dashboard, using data compiled by the healthcare company Vizient, showed NYU Langone with the lowest mortality index, which Grossman pointed out before somewhat gleefully namechecking his lagging rivals. “New York-Presbyterian, probably twice the mortality,” he noted, scanning the list. “University of Pennsylvania…Duke… Here’s North Shore—four times the mortality!” he exclaimed, breaking into a hearty chuckle. (It should be noted that because NYU Langone’s rate was very low—32 patients dying when 100 would have been expected to die in similar circumstances—those competitors had death rates that were roughly in line with or better than industry standards. Some hospitals, including New York-Presbyterian, take issue with Vizient’s methodology, which they say creates apples-to-oranges comparisons.)\n“Bob is very competitive,” Druckenmiller later told me, “He does keep track of how everyone else is doing.”\nThe dashboard is key to keeping operations on track, but Grossman says it’s more important impact has been on culture. To make his point, he showed me the page of a faculty member: Dr. Robert Montgomery, an award-winning transplant surgeon with a prodigious handlebar moustache. He pointed out the range of available stats (on-time OR starts, patient infection rates, grant funding) and double-clicked on a few to show how Montgomery ranked among colleagues. I asked if this feature led some doctors to obsessively check their own performance. “Well, that’s the behavior,” Grossman said matter-of-factly. “That’s how you become number one.”\nAre there any limitations to the metrics or cases where they aren’t fair? Plenty of faculty members have challenged assessments that they’re underproductive, Grossman says, but when that happens, he can simply point them to the dashboard: Why do they have zero grants or zero high-impact publications when others in the same department have several? The measures are objective, he says, and the system fully transparent.\nEven as I marveled at the data available, I wondered if the dashboard-driven culture—part Moneyball, part panopticon— might feel oppressive to some. “It’s not for everyone,” Brotman later told me. “You’re on the hook 24/7, 365, and you’ve got this vulnerability and this expectation of accountability. If you don’t have the right disposition, it’s hard to deal with.”\nI felt awkward simply being in the room for moments of the “Snapshot Review,” a meeting where the chairs of clinical departments filed onstage for dashboard-informed questioning from administrators. The review sessions, in an airy conference room overlooking the East River, varied considerably in tone and substance. Some involved praise and practical problem-solving; others, discussions of “low-performing faculty members”; and another—featuring a relatively new leader who clearly hadn’t found his footing—the feel of a man pleading for mercy.\nOver time, NYU Langone leaders have gotten better at identifying the people who buy into the culture and thrive, and those who don’t. (The health system claims an approximate 10% annual employee turnover rate.) Who does thrive? People who like data, who accept that medicine is a science and not an art (NYU standardizes processes, right down to the surgical tools used).\nA theme that came up in my interviews—somewhat surprisingly, at a high-performing health system—was how little people sleep. “Bob doesn’t turn off,” Druckenmiller said of Grossman. She explained that a lot of the hospital’s most important business gets done over phone calls at 4:30 in the morning, because that’s an hour when Langone, Grossman, and she (and others) are all awake and not commuting yet. She said that Grossman’s successor, Dr. Alec Kimmelman, is that way too. (When Druckenmiller asked Kimmelman’s wife if she was ready for him to take on the role, she answered she didn’t expect anything would change—he was gone before she woke up and home after she went to bed.) When I asked Langone how he managed it all, he told me, “I don’t sleep. The other guy’s sleeping while I’m doing other stuff.”\nThe culture of self-care has not yet come for NYU Langone leadership, but work-life balance is on its radar. At a Snapshot review meeting I attended, there was discussion of the outgoing infectious disease chief, and how his “Iron Man Model” was not as in-fashion with the younger generation of doctors. Kimmelman, who comes across as thoughtful and laid-back, assured me NYU Langone’s culture welcomes non-workaholics. What matters, he says, is that “even if their attitudes towards work-life balance are different than mine, they’re still devoted to excellence and quality and taking great care of patients.”\nAt the time of my visit, I had just finished watching The Pitt, the HBO medical drama focused on one chaotic, 15-hour shift in a Pittsburgh emergency room. Throughout the series, a suit-wearing, metrics-obsessed administrator drops by to scold the staff on the measures in which they’re falling short— wait times, patient satisfaction scores, documentation—ratcheting up the pressure on overstretched doctors and nurses trying to save lives. One naturally sympathizes with the staff, but it can be easy to overlook that the administrator’s goals—however warped by the economics of the health system—are actually in the interest of patient care, or at least of keeping the hospital’s doors open. (Grossman hadn’t watched the show. “I don’t think it’s my cup of tea,” he told me.)\nIt can be easy to vilify micromanagement, but Dr. Oren Cahlon, a radiation oncologist who will take Brotman’s job in September—says it has been effective at NYU Langone.\nRecently Cahlon had been digging into patient access issues—the long wait times new patients face to make appointments at NYU. He’d been plumbing physicians’ schedules, drawing up new policies—How often did patients really need follow-up appointments? Could some of those existing patients see a nurse practitioner or physician assistant instead? —and even changing compensation models to incentivize providers to see new patients. Brotman approvingly compared Cahlon’s work to “guerilla warfare,” noting that he’d managed to increase new-patient appointments by 10% to 40%. It hadn’t immediately gone over well, but Brotman and Cahlon had engaged staff and patients about the reasons for the changes. Contrary to the concerns that adding more patients would cause burnout and tank satisfaction scores, Brotman says they’ve seen the opposite.\nTaking the business model outside Manhattan\nA 30-minute ferry ride from NYU’s gleaming Manhattan campus delivers you to the health system’s Brooklyn hospital, on the industrial fringes of Sunset Park. The facility, wrapped in scaffolding due to ongoing renovation, is shabbier than the midtown mothership. It serves a diverse population, many of whom are not native English speakers, and 82% of whom depend on government insurance.\nBut the care and increasingly the range of services match those back at headquarters. Since NYU Langone completed its merger with Lutheran, a struggling community hospital, in 2016, its patient safety and health outcome measures have vastly improved. (Observed-to-expected mortality has fallen 60% since 2017; complications have come down 58%.) And it’s profitable this year, because it’s seeing more patients, and seeing them more efficiently.\nGetting there involved many years of taking the same fine-tooth-comb data-driven approach to hospital operations. When NYU took over, most of the doctors there were contractors, and the under-resourced facility was working with outdated infrastructure and technology: Cardiologists, for example, would view electrocardiograms on VHS tapes.\nThere’s often suspicion and fear when a large health system acquires a smaller community hospital, and it’s well-founded; big systems often strip their acquisitions of services and send patients to their larger facilities for sophisticated care. NYU Langone met with similar skepticism, but the result has been the opposite: it invested in the Brooklyn hospital, hired a full-time staff, and added a range of higher-end services—cardiac catheterization labs, neurosurgery, cancer care—bringing care into the community.\nThe day I visited, I found Dr. Bret Rudy, chief of hospital operations, in his office, studying dashboard data on a large monitor. It was 9:45 a.m., and so far, 41 patients had arrived in the emergency department; seven were waiting for beds, including one whose digital profile he clicked on for my benefit, who was being admitted for a possible case of tuberculosis. Rudy navigated to operating stats—where 92% of the day’s first procedures that month had started on time. “That should be higher,” he said, explaining that turnaround time between procedures should be 30 minutes or less. The dashboard had allowed him and a pair of surgeons he’d deputized to optimize workflow, investigating late starts and rooting out inefficiencies. Since 2017, they’ve increased the number of surgeries by more than 20% (a total of 2,000 more surgeries per year), through disciplined scheduling and 6 a.m. start-times.\nNine years in, NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn is practically a well-oiled machine. The front lines of NYU’s transformation effort have shifted to Patchogue, a town on 12,000 on Long Island, where it recently completed a merger with a community hospital, now known as NYU Langone Hospital-Suffolk. Suffolk County is famed for the glitzy Hamptons, but closer to Patchogue it’s home to working-class towns troubled by the opioid epidemic and MS-13 gang activity.\nThe Suffolk County hospital was in rough shape when NYU Langone entered the picture a few years ago; after years of underinvestment, its reputation had suffered, and patients that ended up there tended to be either very sick or accident victims brought in from the Long Island Expressway. Other health systems had considered purchasing the hospital but always walked away; Dr. Marc Adler, chief of hospital operations, recalls that when he first introduced himself, a staff member said, “You’ll be gone in three months.”\nAdler is now several years into the job, implementing the NYU Langone playbook. The patient population is largely covered by Medicare and Medicaid, and it suffers from greater levels of substance abuse and mental health issues than NYU Langone-Brooklyn’s does. Among NYU’s first investments were a larger security staff and a new behavioral health facility; surgical robots and new operating rooms have been added too. They’ve hired a new full-time staff, some poached from NYU’s hospital in neighboring Nassau County.\nThere had been plenty of room for efficiency improvements at the hospital. “If everyone’s coming in at 9 a.m., you’re never going to start your cases at 7 a.m.,” says Adler. Only 30% of the day’s first surgeries started on time in 2021. The doctors, who were on contract and would stop by only a few days per week, erred on the side of longer stays—keeping patients in the hospital over the weekend or for another day if they hadn’t seen them.\nAdler of course, showed me his dashboard. The quality of care and patient outcomes are much improved over the past few years, and over 90% of the day’s first cases now start on time. NYU Langone Hospital-Suffolk has a “C” safety grade by the standards of Leapfrog Group, a hospital ranking group—all other NYU hospitals have an “A”—but Adler explains it’s due to Leapfrog’s methodology, which relies on data from up to three years prior. NYU Langone executives say the level of care is now equivalent to the system’s other hospitals.\nFederal cuts, personal triumphs\nLike other nonprofit health systems, NYU Langone is facing cuts to Medicaid and NIH funding. Last year, the NYU Grossman School of Medicine ranked 11th in terms of NIH awards, with $490 million in funding according to the Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research, which tracks the field. According to BRIMR’s analysis, NYU’s medical school has so far had a handful of grants worth $12 million terminated; 56 schools had greater losses in funding.\n“Obviously we think a lot about that,” Kimmelman, Grossman’s successor, tells me. Like a lot of institutions, NYU Langone is looking at ways to diversify research funding from other sources, and some affected researchers have had to pivot.\nAt the same time, Kimmelman says his team is trying to not let the uncertainty distract them from their mission or the various expansion projects already in motion. He takes inspiration from Grossman, who in the depths of COVID, a financially perilous period, didn’t hesitate to invest in important but extremely expensive technology. The decision came down to impact on patient care. “I think our fundamentals are incredibly solid,” Kimmelman says. “If we can’t thrive or survive in whatever happens to NIH, I don’t think there’s going to be any health care system that can.”\nIt’s not the first time a dire situation has largely been out of NYU Langone’s control. Many vividly remember the night in 2012 when Hurricane Sandy plunged lower Manhattan and NYU Langone (its generators failed) into darkness, flooding the Manhattan campus and shuttering the hospital and medical school for several weeks. “I thought it was all over,” says Brotman.\nLangone happened to be a patient that night, recovering from pneumonia. He was evacuated from the 17th floor at 3 a.m., along with 23 infants staying in the neo-natal intensive care unit. Langone vividly remembers following the procession—the babies still attached to tubes, each one cradled by a nurse lying on a sled, while others carefully carried the sled and medical equipment down the pitch-dark stairway—and the sound of nurses, in perfect unison, saying “Step, step, step,” until they made it to the ground floor.\nIt’s still one of his proudest moments. And as instrumental as he has been to NYU Langone’s recovery and its broader accomplishments, the day I visited him Langone kept steering me back to the system’s smaller, anecdotal triumphs—like the too-scared-to-sleep heart transplant patient who was comforted in the middle of the night by a kind building services worker.\nWhile Grossman’s laser focus on industry-leading care is filtered through an obsessive, data-driven wonkiness, Langone relishes the human stories, the living, breathing proof their work has made a difference. On his desk, behind boxes of Dots Christmas candy, framed photos, and a sign that reads “The Buck Stops Here,” were cards that he’d occasionally pick up mid-conversation and read to me—from grateful patients, or family members, or former employees, thanking him for their experience at NYU Langone. “I’ve got a bunch of them,” he told me, as if the testimonies answered all remaining questions. He always writes a note back.\nCLARIFICATION: This article has been updated to add details to a reference to hospital mortality data.", "published": "Fri, 15 Aug 2025 09:30:00 +0000", "author": "Erika Fry", "source": "https://fortune.com/feed/fortune-feeds/?id=3230629"}

The acquisition—led by New York–based MCR Hotels, one of America’s largest independent hotel owner-operators—will end Soho House’s four-year stint as a publicly traded company, and mark the start of a new chapter for the not-once-profitable members’ club.\nUnder the deal, announced Aug. 18, MCR will acquire all outstanding Soho House shares at $9 per share in cash, an 83% premium to the unaffected stock price at the time of bid. The transaction is supported by financial heavyweights Apollo Global Management and Goldman Sachs Alternatives, alongside a consortium of existing and new investors. Among the notable names joining the board post-acquisition are Ashton Kutcher, the prominent actor and tech investor; and MCR CEO Tyler Morse, who is set to become vice chairman.\nLong-standing shareholders including Yucaipa Cos. executive chairman Ron Burkle; Soho House founder Nick Jones; and investor Richard Caring will retain their controlling equity interests, signaling continuity at the club’s leadership level. Goldman Sachs Alternatives, a backer since Soho House’s IPO, is also committing further capital to the venture.\nPending shareholder and regulatory approval, the deal is expected to be completed by year-end. Upon closure, Soho House shares will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, turning the business into a privately held enterprise.\nSoho House: From cool London origins to global influence\nFounded on London’s Greek Street in 1995, Soho House rapidly became a byword for luxury, exclusivity, and a vibrant creative scene. The clubs, which combine restaurants, hotels, gyms, spas, and workspaces, now span 46 locations in 18 countries, alongside brands like The Ned and Scorpios Beach Club. Membership is coveted, with club fees running into the thousands per year and a curated application process. As of June, Soho House had more than 270,000 members and reported $329.8 million in total revenue for the second quarter—an 8.9% increase year over year.\nStill, Soho House’s journey on the public markets has faced consistent headwinds. Its July 2021 IPO priced shares at $14, but by mid-2025, shares had sagged to below $9, reflecting more than a 30% drop as profitability concerns and market volatility dogged the brand. Investors and analysts cited business model pressures, high operational costs, and slower-than-hoped expansion as reasons for the lackluster performance.\nFortune reported in May 2024 the company had lost money for every year since its founding, and its rapid global expansion had left it with a substantial debt load. Short-sellers, notably GlassHouse Research, had called out long-standing problems and compared it to WeWork. More recently, Soho House came under pressure from activist investor Dan Loeb and his fund, Third Point, which were pushing for a sale process for the chain.\nCEO Andrew Carnie told Fortune at the time that he saw a three- to five-year plan ahead, although a company spokesperson later clarified Carnie wasn’t putting a time frame on Soho House’s path to profitability, but rather on “holistically reorientating the business against our strategic priorities of growing and enhancing membership and operating efficiently to grow profitably.”\nCarnie described the transaction as a vote of confidence: “This reflects the strong belief our existing and incoming shareholders have in the future of Soho House & Co., and the transformation we’ve led since becoming a public company.”\nIn addition to retaining existing leadership, the acquisition is expected to bring fresh capital, hospitality know-how, and tech acumen into the fold. MCR, which owns more than 150 hotels globally—including the TWA Hotel at JFK Airport and the High Line Hotel in New York—brings operational expertise and a track record of innovation. Investors hope this backing will support Soho House’s plans to open four new clubs and improve its tech platforms for members.\nFor this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

But pursuing a doctoral degree to stand out is not the answer, warns Jad Tarifi, the founder of Google’s first generative-AI team. Students could end up “throwing away” years of their lives, as technology is moving so quickly. This comes as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says ChatGPT can already perform on par with PhD-level experts, and Bill Gates admits that AI is accelerating at a pace that surprises even him.\nAs undergraduate degrees have lost their payoffs thanks to AI, young people have turned to advanced schooling to unlock jobs with salaries exceeding $200,000 (or in some cases, a $100 million signing bonus). However, one former Google leader says Gen Z should not be so fast to jump on the PhD train, as even doctoral degrees may have lost their edge.\n“AI itself is going to be gone by the time you finish a PhD. Even things like applying AI to robotics will be solved by then,” Jad Tarifi, the founder of Google’s first generative-AI team, told Business Insider.\nTarifi himself graduated with a PhD in AI in 2012, when the subject was far less mainstream. But today, the 42-year-old says, time would be better spent studying a more niche topic intertwined with AI, like AI for biology—or maybe not a degree at all.\n“Higher education as we know it is on the verge of becoming obsolete,” Tarifi said to Fortune. “Thriving in the future will come not from collecting credentials but from cultivating unique perspectives, agency, emotional awareness, and strong human bonds.\n“I encourage young people to focus on two things: the art of connecting deeply with others, and the inner work of connecting with themselves.”\nTech’s warning for education on the changing AI tide\nEven studying to become a medical doctor or lawyer may not be worth ambitious Gen Z’s time anymore. Those degrees take so long to complete in comparison with how quickly AI is evolving that they may result in students just “throwing away” years of their lives, Tarifi added to BI.\n“In the current medical system, what you learn in medical school is so outdated and based on memorization,” he said.\nTarifi is not alone in his feeling that higher education is not keeping up with the shifting AI tides. In fact, many tech leaders have recently expressed concerns that the rising cost of school paired with an outdated curriculum is creating a perfect storm for an unprepared workforce.\n“I’m not sure that college is preparing people for the jobs that they need to have today,” said Mark Zuckerberg on Theo Von’s This Past Weekend podcast in April. “I think that there’s a big issue on that, and all the student debt issues are…really big.\n“It’s sort of been this taboo thing to say, ‘Maybe not everyone needs to go to college,’ and because there’s a lot of jobs that don’t require that…people are probably coming around to that opinion a little more now than maybe like 10 years ago,” Zuckerberg added.\nMoreover, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that his company’s latest AI model can already perform in ways equivalent to those with a PhD.\n“GPT-5 really feels like talking to a PhD-level expert in any topic,” Altman said earlier this month. “Something like GPT-5 would be pretty much unimaginable in any other time in history.”\nThe pipeline from PhD to six-figure job offer remains strong—for now\nFor existing AI-focused PhD students, the private sector jobs pipeline remains strong. In fact, in 2023, some 70% of all AI doctoral students took private sector jobs postgrad, a jump from just 20% two decades ago, according to MIT.\nHowever, this increase has some academic leaders worried about a “brain drain” that could result from too many experts electing to work at tech companies—versus staying back and teaching the next generation as professors.\nHenry Hoffmann, the chair of the University of Chicago’s department of computer science, recently told Fortune that he’s seen his PhD students get courted for decades—but the salary lures have only grown. One student with zero professional experience recently dropped out to accept a “high six-figure” offer from ByteDance.\n“When students can get the kind of job they want [as students], there’s no reason to force them to keep going,” Hoffmann said.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 16:16:25 +0000", "author": "Preston Fore", "source": "https://fortune.com/feed/fortune-feeds/?id=3230629"}

A text message from his utility said a piece of equipment had failed at 2 a.m. By the time a repair crew showed up eight hours later, the hot, sticky Florida summer was already taking a toll.\n\"You just don't realize how important your power is until you don't have it,\" says Thomas, a retired air traffic controller. \"In Florida's heat, you just can't live without air conditioning. And this time of year particularly.\"\nThomas has invested in energy-saving windows and insulation to keep his house comfortable. But in the heat of the summer, his power bills still top $400 a month.\n\"It's painful to see that bill when it comes in,\" he says.\nAcross the country, electricity prices have jumped more than twice as fast as the overall cost of living in the last year. That's especially painful during the dog days of summer, when air conditioners are working overtime.\nIn Pembroke Pines, Fla., Al Salvi's power bill can reach $500 a month.\n\"There's a lot of seniors down here that are living check to check. They can barely afford prescriptions such as myself,\" says Salvi, who's 63 and uses a wheelchair. \"Now we got to decide whether we're going to pay the electric bill or are we going to buy medication. And it's not fair to us. You're squeezing us between a rock and a hard place.\"\nEarlier this year, the utility that serves both Thomas and Salvi, Florida Power & Light, applied for a rate increase that would have boosted bills for a typical South Florida resident by about 13% over the next four years.\nThe AARP launched a petition drive to oppose the rate hike, and quickly gathered tens of thousands of signatures.\n\"Our members are pretty upset,\" says Zayne Smith, AARP Florida's director of advocacy. \"That's just another way people are getting nickel and dimed out of being able to afford to live here in Florida.\"\nLast week, Florida Power & Light announced a tentative agreement on rates with commercial and industrial customers. CEO Armando Pimentel said the deal would ensure, \"we can continue to provide reliable electricity to power our fast-growing state while keeping customer bills low.\"\nDetails of the new rate proposal have not been made public.\nIt's not just Florida that's wrestling with high-priced power. Electricity prices have been rising rapidly across the country — thanks to a combination of factors tied to both demand and supply.\nPower-hungry AI data centers are one factor driving high prices\nPower-hungry data centers have been popping up all over, to serve the boom in artificial intelligence. The Energy Department projects data centers and other commercial customers will use more electricity than households for the first time ever next year. That's a challenge for policymakers, who have to decide how to accommodate that extra demand and who should foot the bill.\n\"Regulators always play catchup,\" says John Quigley, senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. \"The growth of data centers is far outpacing the response by grid managers, public utility commissions across the country, and they're racing to catch up.\"\nNatural gas exports also push prices higher\nThe soaring price of natural gas is also pushing power prices higher. More than 40% of electricity is generated using natural gas. As more gas is exported as liquid natural gas, the competition from foreign customers is driving up the price utilities have to pay here at home.\nThe Energy Department says the cost of gas used to generate power jumped more than 40% in the first half of this year compared to 2024. Another 17% increase is expected next year.\n\"Any way you look at it, gas-fired power is expensive,\" Quigley says. \"It's going to be increasingly expensive as natural gas exports increase. The future is to make electricity cheaper and the way to do it is clean energy.\"\nOne in six households already struggles to pay for power\nSolar and wind power can be cheaper than gas-fired plants, even without government subsidies. But building new power supplies and the wires to carry it will cost money. And one out of six households already have trouble paying their current electric bills.\n\"We're not questioning whether the grid needs to be rebuilt,\" says Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which advocates for low-income energy customers. \"We're not questioning whether there needs to be new data centers built. But the problem is, for low income families and people living in poverty, they don't have the ability to pay any more than they're currently paying, without falling even further behind and getting into shut-off situations.\"\nThe federal government currently spends about $4 billion a year to help low-income families with energy bills. But Wolfe says that's not enough to cover rising cooling costs in the summer. And President Trump's proposed budget would end the assistance altogether.\nIn Boca Raton, Ken Thomas was grateful to have his power restored this week, after about ten hours with no air conditioning. At the same time, he's bracing for his August electric bill.\n\"I value my utility that I need to stay cool in the summer and warm in the winter,\" he says. \"But I also know that there is a limit to what we can afford to pay.\"", "published": "Sat, 16 Aug 2025 05:00:00 -0400", "author": "Scott Horsley", "source": "https://www.npr.org/rss/rss.php?id=1006"}

Here's what to know\nThe funds in most retirement accounts are pretty basic: stocks and bonds.\nNow, an executive order signed by President Trump aims to lay the groundwork for an array of \"alternative assets,\" including cryptocurrency, real estate and private equity, to be included in 401(k) and similar accounts.\nThese accounts are retirement plans offered by employers that workers can contribute to. Workers choose among several investment options, typically funds of publicly traded stocks and bonds.\nThe order directs the Department of Labor, the Treasury, and the Securities and Exchange Commission to clear the path for such assets to find a place alongside stocks and bonds.\nPrivate equity in your 401(k)?\nPrivate equity firms are investment companies that buy up companies or assets — often distressed businesses. Sometimes the private equity firm succeeds in turning a company around — and sometimes, like with Toys R Us, the company gets loaded with debt and goes bankrupt.\nHistorically, the investors in private equity have been large institutions, like universities and state pension plans, as well as very wealthy people. But for most other people, private equity has not been an option.\nMaking it available as an investment option within 401ks would be a big change.\n\"There's a bit of democratization here, of making what were private exclusive investments to the wealthy available to everybody. But, you know, that doesn't mean you're getting the kind of stuff that has made other people wealthy,\" says Lisa Kirchenbauer, founding partner and senior advisor at Omega Wealth Management in Arlington, Virginia.\nThat's because it will depend on which companies or investments are put into these new funds, she says. And Kirchenbauer isn't convinced they will be the \"best\" opportunities, which might still be reserved for wealthier investors.\nNo law forbids including these assets in 401(k)s. But for plan managers, there have been some good reasons to exclude them: higher risk, complexity, lack of transparency — and for private equity, often much higher fees.\nWhich funds are on offer is really up to employers, since they are the administrators of 401k plans. A federal law called ERISA requires the employer to act in employees' best interest as a fiduciary — and it gives workers the right to sue their employers for failing to do so.\nThe Biden administration even warned plan administrators against including cryptocurrency funds in 401(k)s.\nAll of that had given employers ample reason to stick with the vanilla options of stock and bond funds.\nBut the Trump administration has more warmly embraced alternative assets. Trump's Labor Department rescinded the Biden-era guidance in May.\nNew possibilities and new risks\nThe executive order could mean new options will be available within your retirement account, though not right away.\nNew kinds of funds have to be developed for the retail market — a process that's already underway, because 401(k) investors represent a huge new market for private equity firms and cryptocurrency companies.\nBut experts say these assets may not be well suited to everyone's 401k.\nPrivate equity firms charge really high fees: typically 2% as a management fee and 20% of the profit. And investors are locked in for long periods of time, which could be a decade or more. Things could get messy if you're planning to retire or switch jobs soon, and want to move your money around.\nJeff Hooke, senior finance lecturer at Johns Hopkins University, says the fees for private equity are simply too high to make them a good choice for the typical retirement fund. \"And the track record for the last ten or 12 years has been mediocre at best, so I wouldn't recommend it, he says.\nCrypto, meanwhile, has its own risks: it's highly volatile and loosely regulated.\nKirchenbauer says if you're really keen on alternative investments, and far from retirement, you might consider making these new assets up to 5 or 10% of your portfolio.\nMeanwhile, Hooke suggests sticking with the basics: stock and bond index funds. \"You're protected from high fees and you're principally guaranteed to return what the market does, since the fees are going to be extremely low,\" he says.\nWith the S&P 500 repeatedly setting records this year, some investors might find that tracking the market is enough.", "published": "Sat, 16 Aug 2025 05:00:00 -0400", "author": "Laurel Wamsley", "source": "https://www.npr.org/rss/rss.php?id=1006"}

After Gates’ net worth plummeted $51 billion to reflect his philanthropic spending, Ballmer took his spot as the fifth-richest man in the world, as Gates slipped down to 12th place. And the Microsoft cofounder will only continue to slide down the ranking, as he’s determined to not die rich.\nBill Gates was once the richest man in the world for 18 years, and currently boasts a jealousy-inducing net worth of $124 billion from cofounding the software titan Microsoft. But now his former right-hand man has more money in his bank account than he does, thanks to Gates’ billion-dollar philanthropic spending.\nOn July 3 last week, Gates was standing on a fortune of $175 billion, ranked as the fifth-wealthiest person alive on the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. But his wealth plummeted over the span of the next couple of days as $51 billion was drained from his net worth, shooting him down the list to 12th place right below fellow tech pioneer Michael Dell.\nGates’ wealth disappeared so rapidly as the index readjusted for the 69-year-old technology mogul’s philanthropic efforts. Bloomberg noted that the appreciation rates were lowered last week to “better reflect Gates’ outside charitable giving and the wealth estimate,” based on a May 8 blog post from the former Microsoft CEO. The note disclosed that Gates would be donating his vast fortune to charity much faster than previously planned; Over the next 20 years, he would donate almost all of his wealth to the Gates Foundation that he spearheaded with ex-wife Melinda French Gates, which will close by the end of 2045.\n“People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that ‘he died rich’ will not be one of them,” Gates wrote. “There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people.”\nGates has been determined to whittle down his wealth for the greater good for years, even saying that his children would inherit “less than 1%” of his fortune. And now, his goal is being reflected in his net worth. His charitable giving even cleared the way for his former No. 2 from the Microsoft days, Steve Ballmer, to take his spot in fifth with $172 billion to his name—and it’s not the first time it’s happened.\nFortune reached out to Gates for comment.\nWho is Steve Ballmer—and why is he richer than Gates?\nMost employees never expect to earn more than their bosses. But Ballmer got his foot in the door at a lucky time, and for decades since, money has been percolating into his bank account.\nMicrosoft was in its early days when Ballmer joined as an assistant to the president in 1980—he was the 30th employee to join the growing technology company and effectively functioned as a business manager. He had dropped out of Stanford’s MBA program to take the job, and was offered a $50,000 base salary alongside 10% of any profit growth he generated at the business. Ballmer didn’t get a single share at the time, but the 10% cut proved to be extremely lucrative.\nBut soon the business was growing so quickly that the portion wasn’t financially feasible, so in renegotiations, Ballmer traded his profit-sharing deal for an 8% stake in the company. The company’s cofounder Paul Allen wasn’t thrilled with the trade-off, arguing it was still too large of a share for Ballmer. But Gates put his own money on the line to fulfil Ballmer’s request—and the rest is history.\nThe former assistant to Gates eventually rose up the ranks and took his boss’s role, serving as CEO of the company from 2000 to 2014. He held 333 million shares in Microsoft, or around a 4% stake worth $22.5 billion, when he stepped down as chief executive. Today, most of the 69-year-old’s investment portfolio is still wrapped up in the business’s stock—but he attributes his vast wealth to being in the right place, at the right time and not cashing in too early.\n“If there’s anybody that will tell you all their success is because they were a genius, I’d say they should go look for the luck,” he told the Wall Street Journal last year. “Forget the stock price. I had luck, essentially, in getting to listen to the right people. But I also had luck in terms of my loyalty to the company and not wanting to be a seller as a leader of the business.”\nBallmer has since ventured into other arenas outside of tech. The baby boomer bought the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion the same year he retired from Microsoft, and the team is now valued at $5.5 billion.\nFollowing in Gates’ footsteps, he also has a soft spot for charity; he’s donated more than $4 billion of his fortune so far, and founded philanthropic organization Ballmer Group focused on improving economic mobility for families in the United States.", "published": "Tue, 08 Jul 2025 15:32:48 +0000", "author": "Emma Burleigh", "source": "https://fortune.com/feed/fortune-feeds/?id=3230629"}

The appetite for ever more internet-connected things and AI applications is leading to a boom in data center building across the country. Fueled by hundreds of billions in capital expenditures and enthusiasm from the Trump administration, the data center bonanza offers a tempting promise: that small towns could find a new industrial anchor, bringing good jobs, tax revenue, and prosperity to swaths of the country that have been left behind by the digital revolution.\nBut there's a cost. Data centers have significant power and water demands that can stress small towns, and they employ fewer people than the factories of the past. As they race toward a future that's difficult to predict, communities across the country are weighing the costs and benefits of becoming a data center town, which can vary depending on the resources and character of each place.\nIn many ways, the Columbia River has lightened the impact on Quincy, but even there, critics say that the long-term strain on resources isn't worth the economic gain.\nIt's been 18 years since the first data centers went up in this place – and they're still being built. The town provides a window into what can happen when the data center industry sets up shop in a small community – and what local residents stand to gain or lose.\nData center boomtown\nQuincy proper is a majority hispanic agricultural community of about 7,500 people, three hours east of Seattle. In the years since the first data centers went up, the share of Quincy residents living below the poverty line has gone from 29.4% in 2012 to 13.1% in 2023, according to census data.\nAs a lifelong central Washington resident, Lisa Karstetter described Quincy as the kind of town young people moved out of in search of opportunity. She said she's seen that change in the years since Microsoft and Yahoo opened their first data centers in 2007.\nYahoo hired Karstetter to manage community relations in Quincy the following year. After that, she went on to do the same job for Microsoft. Karstetter said the data center industry and agriculture had \"a beautiful marriage,\" bringing needed tax revenue to the small farming community. (It's also the story of her own marriage. Her husband farms cherries, apples and pears.)\n\" First time ever in my history of living in Quincy, we had a full police force because they could afford it,\" she said. \"New fire station, new library, you had all of these things come in that could support the agriculture.\"\nData centers pay about 75% of Quincy's property tax revenue, according to Alex Ybarra, a Republican state legislator who grew up in the town. That's helped fund a range of new public amenities.\nThe most recent addition is the Quincy Valley Medical Center, which opened its doors in May. The hospital offers emergency services, wound care, imaging and a new physical therapy center complete with a pool.\nIn the waiting room, Julie Pickering reflected on the benefits of having a state of the art wound care clinic closer to home. For the past four years, she and her husband have commuted more than an hour to care for his partially amputated foot, which refused to heal.\n\" This new hospital's been a blessing to everyone in the community and surroundings,\" she said.\nQuincy High School was also recently renovated thanks to a $108 million bond, the majority of which was funded by property taxes on data centers. It serves about 850 students, most of whom qualify for free or reduced lunch.\n\" It wouldn't have been possible without the data center presence here in our community and the support of voters that helped us pass it,\" said Superintendent Nik Bergman.\nThe home of the Jackrabbits has a gleaming new auditorium and athletic facilities, including a weight room with panoramic windows. The school also has a comprehensive career and technical training department, offering courses in everything from wildfire science to computer programming. Students planning to go into one of the two big industries in town can graduate with a data center technician certificate or raise their own pigs and goats to sell at the fair.\n\"It's exposing kids to different pathways,\" said Bergman. \"When they leave Quincy, they have an idea of what pathway they want to go on.\"\nShort-term versus long-terms jobs\nWhile there's no shortage of farming jobs in Quincy, it's unclear how many data center jobs will be available to these students.\nThe construction of data centers creates thousands of jobs, but they're mostly temporary. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates the average large data center employs about 150 people long-term.\nMicrosoft would not disclose how many people it employs in Quincy, but said it has 21 data center buildings in town and each of those buildings can employ 40-50 people.\nSome of those are leased from third parties like Sabey Data Centers. Sabey's sprawling Quincy campus employs 250 people according to Ryan Beebout, vice president of the western region. He says that in a small town, hundreds of jobs aren't negligible.\nBeebout also noted that an entry-level data center technician earns about $60,000 per year and doesn't need a college degree. That's nearly double the individual median income for Quincy.\nWater and hydropower are plentiful … but not limitless\nThere are some who say that the economic gains don't outweigh the downsides these data centers bring to central Washington.\nPatty Martin is an environmental activist who served as mayor of Quincy before the first data center went up. At six feet tall, the former student athlete cuts a no-nonsense figure. Her advocacy partner, Danna Dal Porto, is petite and convivial, though the retired schoolteacher has no problem looking up at public officials to give them a piece of her mind.\n\" It's fairly well known that corporations like this choose low income rural areas for a couple of reasons,\" Dal Porto said. \"One, they assume that the population is uneducated. They assume that the population won't be involved in resisting them, and usually, rural property is less expensive. Usually, rural governments are looking for investment. And so it's a perfect storm.\"\nInitially Martin and Dal Porto worried about air pollution from diesel back up generators power centers use and fought for rules requiring pollution controls on the generator smoke.\nData center companies say the generators are rarely used in Quincy because hydropower from the Columbia is so reliable. Sabey Data Centers runs its generators about eight hours a year, according to Beebout.\nToday Martin and Dal Porto are most concerned about the water and energy data centers use, and they fear the building boom could undermine Washington state's climate goals.\n\" It's great to look at the economic benefits,\" Martin said. \"That's a snapshot in time. That's something you benefit from right now. The question is, what's the long-term effect?\"\nSo far, the Columbia River has sustained the growth of these data centers. Its dams supply cheap, abundant hydropower energy and water for cooling them. But Martin worries about increasingly less snowpack to feed the river as the climate gets warmer.\n\" I just think that sometimes we're a little bit too shortsighted,\" Martin said.\nIn Grant County, home to Quincy, hydropower and water are maxed out, according to City Administrator Pat Haley.\nBut these resource constraints have done little to quell demand. The Grant County Public Utility District says they have 79 pending applications in their queue, most of which are for data center projects. The utility says the combined power for all of those applicants would be roughly double the demand for the entire city of Seattle.\nMartin worries that if push comes to shove, residents will experience blackouts or limited water before data centers do, \"because they have sensitive information.\"\n\"You don't cool it, it's gonna overheat … You turn off the power … it's gonna go away. So, it's all about the data centers.\"\nThe Grant County Public Utility District says residents shouldn't be concerned about losing power, because it has the ability to buy more on the open market at peak usage times. But some of that power comes from fossil fuels and may soon be off the table. A state law requires utilities to be carbon neutral in five years, and run exclusively on renewables by 2045.\nTo feed growing demand, Haley said the Port of Quincy is considering becoming its own utility, and building new natural gas facilities to supply the growing appetite for power. Ybarra, the state legislator, is lobbying the governor to create a carve out to the clean energy law for natural gas if the carbon is sequestered.\nMartin says that would undermine the state's goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions 95% by 2050.\n\"I'm concerned that as that electrical energy need expands, that there is no type of electrical production that would be off the table,\" Martin said.\nAcross the country, other data center clusters are going up that don't have the abundant power and water supplied by the Columbia River. In Northern Virginia, home to the world's largest cluster, power demand is expected to double in the next 15 years. Like in Washington, the local utility is considering building new gas plants to meet demand despite a state law requiring carbon-free power generation by 2045. In Georgia, the story of a couple whose taps ran dry when a Meta data center moved in next door went viral. Water use is an acute concern for clusters popping up in drought-stricken southwest cities.\nMicrosoft says it is investing in closed-loop water recycling so that facilities using the technology will not require additional groundwater once they're up and running.\nAnd data center companies are also betting big on new sources of energy to feed their data centers' growing power demands, like nuclear fusion, which promises to be emissionless, cheap, and abundant – though skeptics doubt it's close to becoming commercially viable.\nMicrosoft also says that there are more mature renewable power sources coming online that will lighten the load on the region's hydropower supply, like wind and solar. The cost of building those facilities is expected to rise, however, since Congress axed tax credits for them earlier this month.\nWhen the gold rush ends\nTax revenue isn't the only economic boost the data center boom has brought to Quincy. New businesses are cropping up to serve the growing population and traveling construction workers drawn to the region by consistent union work.\nSharyl Smith opened Monkey 'N' Around Pizza three years ago in honor of her late grandson. The menu includes pizzas named after his favorite things, like the T-Rex and the Batman. Smith also serves a daily barbeque special catering to the builders.\n\" The town that I'm from has a lot of traveling construction workers, and I've made really good friends with them,\" Smith said as a steady stream of electricians rolled in for the union's weekly brotherhood night.\nAs Smith worked the bar, Steve Cecil and Pat Gallatin settled into a hightop. They'd both just clocked out from a Microsoft job site in the nearby town of Malaga, where they've been working as electricians. Originally from Tennessee, Cecil has been in central Washington for two years \"chasing data centers.\" He and Gallatin often travel to job sites together.\n\" The first data center I worked on here was in 2006 or 2005, and it was a sleepy little farming community,\" Gallatin said. \"And since then, I bet you there's 20 data centers or better in the area. So that's put thousands of construction workers to work pretty much every year since 2005.\"\nBut for the pick and shovel businesses that have cropped up to supply the prospectors, there's a fear that all gold rushes end eventually.\n\"It's a little scary,\" Smith said. \"I'm not from here … so I don't have the community support of being raised here and having all those connections … my connections are the construction workers.\"", "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 05:00:59 -0400", "author": "Monica Nickelsburg", "source": "https://www.npr.org/rss/rss.php?id=1006"}

Chief among those people, he said, was Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and world’s richest man.\nSpeaking on Mike Birbiglia’s podcast, Nanjiani was asked if he ever met the tech billionaires his show would lampoon, and Nanjiani said yes, he had met Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, among others. But when Birbiglia asked if Musk liked the show or gave any feedback, Nanjiani replied, “He didn’t like the show.\n“He was like, all the parties I go to are much cooler than these parties. I was like, yeah man, you’re one of the richest people in the world. We’re, like, losers on the show,” he said. “Of course your parties are better than my parties.”\nCreated by Mike Judge of Beavis and Butt-Head and King of the Hill fame, HBO’s Silicon Valley ran for 53 episodes spanning six seasons. The series followed Richard Hendricks, a brilliant but awkward programmer who builds a startup with his friends called Pied Piper. While its accuracy was often debated, the show satirized Big Tech and corporate culture, and critics commended its sharp, pointed writing that made fun of “brogrammer culture” and eccentric billionaires. Silicon Valley received five consecutive Emmy nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series.\nTo Musk’s point, parties in the real Silicon Valley are probably “cooler” than the ones on the HBO show, but, like Big Tech itself, many have reported on their tendency to push boundaries. Emily Chang’s 2018 book, Brotopia, described secretive gatherings featuring drug use and open sexual behavior among tech elites. Chang said these events, attended by venture capitalists and founders, often involved drugs like MDMA and “cuddle puddles” that encouraged intimacy, with women reporting stigma and exclusion depending on whether they participated or abstained.\nChang’s book claimed Musk attended at least one such party in 2017, held at investor Steve Jurvetson’s house, but Musk has since vigorously disputed the characterization of the event as a “sex party.” Musk said he believed the gathering was a costume party, saw no signs of inappropriate behavior, and left early. He provided the following statement to Wired in 2018: “Nerds on a couch are not a ‘cuddle puddle.’ I was hounded all night by DFJ-funded entrepreneurs, so went to sleep around 1am. Nothing remotely worth writing about happened,” he said. (DFJ refers to venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson.)\nYou can stream all six seasons of Silicon Valley on HBO Max.\nFor this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

{"title": "Rocket Stock Just Broke Out, But EPS Growth Still Isn't Priced In", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/rocket-stock-just-broke-out-but-eps-growth-still-isnt-priced-in/", "text": "Rocket Companies Today\nRKTRocket Companies\n$17.83 -0.70 (-3.78%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $10.06\n▼\n$21.38 - Price Target\n- $15.04\nMost investors see a stock chart trading near highs and think they’ve missed the boat on the underlying opportunity. While that is sometimes true, there are times when the initial breakout is only the beginning of a much broader move in the future. As it turns out, there is one key financial ratio that investors need to always keep in mind to figure out whether the move is in its early stages or already done.\nThis ratio is the price-to-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio, and its purpose is solely to account for today’s valuation multiples about tomorrow’s expected earnings per share (EPS) growth. It makes absolute sense since investors are often willing to pay for a stock based on what they think it will generate in earnings in the future, making it highly reliable.\nOne stock that has recently broken out, but has yet to price in all of its future growth potential, is Rocket Companies Inc. NYSE: RKT. Investors will soon discover why the stock's PEG ratio indicates significant upside potential for the coming quarters, and how this relates to the broader mortgage industry and the real estate sector.\nWhy Rocket Companies Could Take Off Soon\nStarting from the top, the current housing market has roughly 50% more listings available compared to the same season last year. This means, along with high interest rates on mortgages, that there isn’t a lot of buying demand for properties today (which should hurt Rocket’s business).\nHowever, markets are forward-looking, so they don’t necessarily take today’s level of business activity at face value but rather focus on where this could be tomorrow. By doing so, investors can better understand where the current property supply and mortgage interest rates will need to revert.\nIf this outlook on housing supply and mortgage rates proves correct, Rocket Companies is positioned for EPS growth that could both justify its rally and sustain momentum moving forward. Even though it now trades at 92% of its 52-week high, driven by a one-month rally of 36.5%, Rocket Companies' stock still has a lot of room to move higher, and here is why.\nEarnings Haven’t Been Priced In Yet\nDespite the challenges posed by housing and mortgages, Rocket Companies reported 4 cents in earnings per share (EPS) for the latest quarter, exceeding the market’s expectations of only 3 cents.\nThis resilience was only the foundation for this double-digit rally. Still, investors need to remember that the future matters most. Wall Street analysts now expect Rocket Companies to report 12 cents in EPS for the fourth quarter of 2025, implying a tripling from today’s reported earnings.\nHere is where the PEG ratio comes into play. This threefold EPS growth expectation for the future would need to command a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just over 100.0x for this sort of growth to be priced in correctly, and today’s 24.1x multiple falls significantly below this benchmark.\nThat translates into a 0.1x PEG ratio, where a 1.0x figure means all growth has been priced in. Essentially, 90% of Rocket Companies’ future EPS growth has not been priced in yet, giving investors a massive upside opportunity before the rest of the market catches this view.\nRocket Companies, Inc. (RKT) Price Chart for Tuesday, August, 19, 2025\nIf anything, investors can look to the $416 million worth of institutional buying that has taken place over the most recent quarter, and take this signal as a vote of confidence coming from the “smart money” corners of the market, believing that this narrative is very much in place for Rocket Companies and its future potential.\nLeading the pack are those from Boston Partners, who just boosted their holdings in Rocket Companies stock by 6.2% as of early August 2025. This new allocation brought their net position to a high of $206 million today, a significant amount for a company that has been relatively left behind in the other aggressive rallies seen in the broader economy.\nNow investors have a fundamental reason rooted in the cyclical nature of real estate and interest rates and a quantitative driver behind the fact that this company is a growth engine in the making. Yet, today’s prices do not reflect even a fraction of that future growth, creating a massive gap to be filled on the upside with minimal inherent downside at the same time.\nBefore you consider Rocket Companies, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Rocket Companies wasn't on the list.\nWhile Rocket Companies currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nExplore Elon Musk’s boldest ventures yet—from AI and autonomy to space colonization—and find out how investors can ride the next wave of innovation.\nGet This Free Report\nLike this article?

{"title": "Insiders Trade Millions in NVIDIA-Linked Navitas, Hims, & Shift4", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/insiders-trade-millions-in-nvidia-linked-navitas-hims-and-shift4/", "text": "Insider trading activity often serves as a window into how company executives view their own businesses. When insiders buy, it can signal confidence in future growth; when they sell, it may raise questions about valuation or near-term headwinds.\nRecently, a handful of notable insider transactions have caught investors’ attention—some tied to companies that have already seen massive share price appreciation in 2025. These moves provide important context for understanding whether insiders are signaling continued momentum or hinting at caution.\nBelow, we’ll break down the latest insider buying and selling trends and explore what they could mean for investors deciding whether to follow the trade or stay on the sidelines.\nNVIDIA-Partnered Navitas Sees Insider Invest +$160 Million\nNavitas Semiconductor Today\nNVTSNavitas Semiconductor\n$6.77 -0.15 (-2.17%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- Price Target\n- $5.65\nFirst up is Navitas Semiconductor NASDAQ: NVTS. Investors might recognize the company for the 165% single-day spike shares saw in mid-May. This came as chip-giant NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA revealed that it was in partnership with the company.\nNavitas makes power chips, semiconductors that regulate the use of energy in a system. Navitas is one of the power chip players that NVIDIA is partnering with to rework how artificial intelligence data centers use energy.\nNotably, one of Navitas’s directors, Ranbir Singh, just made a massive purchase of the company’s shares. On July 28, Singh bought approximately 18.6 million shares, valued at around $164 million. That’s equal to approximately 8.7% of Navitas’s outstanding shares, a huge ownership percentage for just one individual.\nThis comes after Navitas experienced around $100 million in insider selling in Q2. Clearly, many of those individuals wanted to cash in after the NVIDIA-driven spike. Now, Singh appears to be the first insider to buy back in and is doing so in a big way.\nSingh holds a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering – Power Semiconductors. This indicates that he almost certainly has an extensive technological understanding of the data center innovation Navitas and NVIDIA are working to build.\nHe also founded his own power chip company, which Navitas bought, indicating his business prowess. Overall, this purchase is clearly a bullish signal for Navitas. Adding to this signal is the fact that Navitas shares are down around 21% from the average price Singh paid.\nHowever, Navitas has yet to post sales or provide guidance showing its NVIDIA-related business is ramping up. Sales dropped 29% in Q2, and Q3 guidance indicates 54% growth. Still, shares remain up 231% over the last three months, indicating that markets believe the NVIDIA revenue will materialize.\nHIMS CEO Cashes in After Q2 Earnings Slide\nHims & Hers Health Today\nHIMSHims & Hers Health\n$45.15 -0.87 (-1.89%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $13.47\n▼\n$72.98 - P/E Ratio\n- 56.44\n- Price Target\n- $38.92\nOn the opposite side of the equation, an insider at Hims & Hers Health NYSE: HIMS is selling millions of shares. And it’s not just anyone, it's Hims' Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Andrew Dudum. On August 7, Dudum sold 660,000 shares for a value of approximately $33.4 million.\nIn Q2 and the first half of Q3, Hims insiders sold approximately $83 million worth of shares. This comes as the stock has risen by around 90% in 2025. This isn’t necessarily an awful sign for the stock. Insiders routinely sell shares to gain liquidity for a variety of reasons, often personal ones.\nStill, the timing of Dudum’s sale is somewhat worrying. It comes just days after Him’s Q2 earnings release, which caused shares to take a huge hit. Shares are down more than 27% since the Aug. 4 report. Additionally, worries that Novo Nordisk A/S NYSE: NVO will take legal action against Hims remain. Novo recently filed lawsuits against 14 small healthcare providers who sold compounded versions of its weight loss drug Wegovy.\nHims sells these copycat drugs as well, but Novo hasn’t sued them.\nSome believe that Novo is seeking to win cases against these smaller firms first to set a precedent. This could make their path to legal victory against Hims easier. Still, Hims's past collaboration with Novo and its “personalized dosage” argument are complicating factors that could significantly aid its legal defense.\nFOUR: Founder and Past CEO Buys Big on Earnings Fall\nShift4 Payments Today\n$90.21 -0.64 (-0.71%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $68.09\n▼\n$127.50 - P/E Ratio\n- 33.41\n- Price Target\n- $114.40\nFinally, another notable purchase comes from an insider at Shift4 Payments NYSE: FOUR. Instead of selling on an earnings dip, Jared Isaacman bought it.\nIsaacman is the founder and former CEO of Shift4 and currently serves as its executive chairman. From Aug. 8 to Aug. 11, Isaacman spent over $16 million on Shift4 stock.\nThis comes after Shift4 reported Q2 earnings on Aug. 5, which caused shares to drop nearly 20% in two days. Clearly, this dip compelled Isaacman to buy, serving as a bullish indicator for Shift4 stock.\nInsider Trades: Important, But Not Definitive Signals\nUltimately, these insider moves are certainly something investors should consider. They come from those who know these firms inside and out, signaling where they think shares might go next.\nStill, it is important to remember that they are just one of many data points to consider when making an investment decision.\nBefore you consider Navitas Semiconductor, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Navitas Semiconductor wasn't on the list.\nWhile Navitas Semiconductor currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nEnter your email address and we'll send you MarketBeat's list of seven best retirement stocks and why they should be in your portfolio.\nGet This Free Report", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 18:04:00 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.marketbeat.com/feed/"}

NASDAQ: MSFT just reminded investors why it’s worth its premium. However, the stock’s post-earnings drift could be setting up a bullish September rebound.\nThe company’s second-quarter earnings report reminded investors that Microsoft continues to be one of the market's most sought-after artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\nBut even great stocks take a breather now and then. After gapping up after earnings, MSFT stock has drifted lower. It's hardly a sell-off, but it’s a reminder that even blue-chip technology stocks need market volume.\nThat volume is about to return. In September, institutional investors can jump back into the market and fine-tune their positions for the end of the year. A look at the August 29 options chain for Microsoft shows a bullish bias that supports a belief that the stock may be getting ready to retest and push past post-earnings highs.\nCall-Heavy Positioning Leans Bullish\nThe Microsoft options chain for August 29 shows several near-term strike prices (e.g., $550, $535, $530, and $540) where call volumes are significantly higher than put volumes. Notably, several of those strikes show net increases in open interest. This is a sign that traders are adding new positions, even at strike prices (e.g., $550) that are out-of-the-money.\nThose key calls show that implied volatility is rising, suggesting that traders are willing to pay for more upside exposure. High volume supports this, adding to the bullish sentiment.\nIn fairness, some of the put options have solid volumes. However, the negative deltas are not aggressively bearish, which suggests protective hedging that can still be interpreted as bullish.\nAnalysts Are All in on MSFT Stock\nMicrosoft Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$612.5418.46% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 32 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $517.10 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $675.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $612.54 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $475.00 |\n|---|\nMicrosoft Stock Forecast Details\nLooking at the call options for Microsoft compared to analysts’ price targets, you could argue that investors are being too conservative. Since Microsoft reported earnings on July 30, approximately 18 analysts have raised their price targets and/or upgraded MSFT stock.\nThe highest of those price targets is from Jefferies, which gives the stock a $675 price target, up from $600. That’s a 30% upside from the stock’s price as of this writing.\nAnalysts love Microsoft’s fundamentals, which include strong operating cash flow (OCF) and revenue. In the company's fiscal year fourth quarter, the company reported year-over-year OCF growth of over 14%. The 55.79% OCF margin was 75 basis points higher than the 32% mark it reported in FYQ2.\nMicrosoft reiterated its capital expenditure (CapEx) spending for data centers. However, analysts note that the rate of CapEx growth is slowing and will continue to do so in FY2026. That should boost the company’s free cash flow, which was already up 10% year-over-year in the company’s last quarter.\nWhy September May Be Volatile for MSFT Stock\nSeptember is historically the worst month for stocks. The economy is starting to show more clarity, but the same themes of tariffs, inflation, and interest rates continue to be reasons to expect volatility in September.\nThat’s why investors may want to pay attention to a potential death cross forming for MSFT stock. In the one-month chart, the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is close to crossing below the 200-day SMA. That could mean that buy-and-hold investors may get to buy Microsoft stock at a (slight) discount.\nAreas to watch include:\n- $515 – This aligns with a prior consolidation zone in late July\n- $505 – This aligns with the stock’s low in early July pivot that aligns with a mid-summer breakout zone.\n- $495 – This aligns with a high-volume support level and the strike with heavy put interest from the options chain.\nHowever, investors may not have much time to react. Death crosses often mark the middle of a down move rather than the start, especially for large-cap companies with strong fundamentals like Microsoft.\nBefore you consider Microsoft, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

NASDAQ: SKYT provides semiconductor manufacturing services. The company had what was in many ways a lackluster period for the second quarter of 2025. Reporting in early August, SkyWater revealed that losses per share widened considerably as revenue dropped by 37% year-over-year (YOY). One bright spot in SkyWater's financials was gross margin, which improved by 20 basis points YOY to 18.5%. Nonetheless, SkyWater said its results were at the upper end of its expectations.\nInvestors responded to the earnings news by sending SKYT shares skyrocketing by about 30% in the last month. So why the bullish response? It could be that SkyWater also announced in its report that it had completed the acquisition of a flagship manufacturing facility, Fab 25, from German semiconductor maker Infineon Technologies AG OTCMKTS: IFNNY. Fab 25 is expected to contribute at least $300 million in annual revenue and to give a big boost to EBITDA, with the impact likely emerging as early as the current quarter.\nSkyWater's Fab 25 purchase will help to facilitate its multi-year supply agreement of over $1 billion and, perhaps even more importantly, positions the firm exceptionally well to deliver as changing U.S. regulations push firms toward onshore manufacturing of semiconductors and related components. Given that, it's no surprise that all three analysts reviewing SKYT shares have assigned them a Buy rating, and the rally over the last several weeks, which is already massive, could have reason to continue.\nGrowing International Business and Successful Expense Trimming\nEmergent Biosolutions Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$14.3358.20% UpsideBuyBased on 3 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $9.06 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $16.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $14.33 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $12.00 |\n|---|\nEmergent Biosolutions Stock Forecast Details\nLife sciences firm Emergent BioSolutions Inc. NYSE: EBS is known for public health products, including NARCAN nasal spray for treatment of opioid overdose and vaccines and treatments for cholera, typhoid fever, and a range of other diseases. Emergent is coming off of a second quarter that, while yielding mixed results, nonetheless shows important advancements that could yield benefits into the future.\nThe company missed on revenue in the last quarter, but made notable improvements in EPS, reporting a positive figure when analysts expected a loss and beating predictions by 42 cents per share. The improvement was driven by strong NARCAN sales and, notably, cost optimization strategies and divestments, which substantially reduced expenses and allowed Emergent to launch a $50-million share repurchase program. Liquidity and net leverage are also improving.\nEmergent's international medical countermeasures business is rapidly growing. The company recently secured a $65-million contract with the Ontario Ministry of Health for NARCAN and additional revenue-generating contract modifications.

On the other hand, GAAP losses per share came in wider than expected.\nStill, profitability metrics like adjusted EBITDA margin are improving overall, and the company's B2 OverDrive platform has launched successfully, including an early six-figure customer in the first weeks of launch. This is a positive sign that Backblaze will be able to continue to build out its infrastructure and scale its offerings. Investors will certainly keep an eye on the company's free cash flow in this process, however, as that has so far remained frustratingly negative.\nWith one-month gains of more than 48%, Backblaze shares seem to have lit a fire. The company has a unanimous Buy rating from all seven analysts, and a consensus price target above $10 per share would suggest an additional 31% in upside is possible.\nBefore you consider SkyWater Technology, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Kratos Keeps Climbing After Q2, But Valuation Risk Looms", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/kratos-keeps-climbing-price-targets-downside-risk-rise-after-q2/", "text": "Kratos Defense & Security Solutions Today\nKTOSKratos Defense & Security Solutions\n$68.74 +0.24 (+0.35%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $20.58\n▼\n$72.70 - P/E Ratio\n- 687.47\n- Price Target\n- $57.64\nSince reporting Q2 2025 earnings, Kratos Defense & Security Solutions NASDAQ: KTOS has continued to be one of the most impressive defense stocks of the year.\nKratos shares are up approximately 17% after the firm released financials on Aug. 7, pushing the stock’s cumulative return to nearly 161% in 2025.\nHowever, a key valuation metric has also ballooned over the past several weeks, raising concerns about whether shares are becoming overextended. Below, we’ll break down Kratos’s latest quarter and gain an updated outlook on the stock.\nKratos Beats Big in Q2, Wins $750 Million Deal\nIn Q2, Kratos saw its revenues rise to nearly $352 million, a growth rate of 17%. This was particularly notable for multiple reasons. First, the figure marked a continued acceleration in growth over the past several quarters.\nThe company’s revenue growth was just barely above 0% in Q3 2024, 3% in Q4 2024, and Kratos’s revenue was 9% in Q1 2025. Clearly, the firm’s ability to bring in higher sales has improved dramatically recently.\nKratos’s Q2 growth also blasted past Wall Street expectations of less than 2% growth. This sales beat also contributed to the company exceeding forecasts on adjusted earnings per share. The figure came in at 11 cents, compared to estimates of 9 cents.\nThe sales beat also helped the company increase its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to a midpoint of $1.30 billion, up from $1.275 billion previously.\nKratos also made several other announcements that bode well for its future sales. The firm won a government award for an opportunity called Poseidon. Poseidon has a total potential value of $750 million, and Kratos expects to be the only prime contractor on the deal.\nThe deal will likely take years to pay out, and production won’t ramp up until 2027. Still, its size shows Kratos's big growth opportunity. The $750 million figure is more than double the total revenue Kratos generated in Q2.\nThe company’s bid and proposal pipeline also increased to a record $13 billion; the value of deals that the company is going after has never been higher. Poseidon is just one example of the company’s ability to turn this potential into reality, providing further confidence that Kratos can execute on its massive pipeline.\nAnalysts See Limited Upside on Kratos’s Soaring Valuation\nOverall, the MarketBeat consensus price target on Kratos is approximately $56 per share. Compared to the stock’s August 13 closing price, this figure implies significant downside potential of nearly 19%. However, analysts who updated their price targets on the stock after Kratos’s earnings are decidedly more bullish.\nAmong those analysts tracked by MarketBeat, the average price target is just over $70.\nThis target still only suggests a 2.3% upside in shares, but that is still significantly more encouraging than the deep downside implied by the consensus. Part of the valuation worries around Kratos stem from the stock’s soaring forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\nSince June 30, Kratos’s forward P/E has moved from 86x to 109x, a nearly 27% increase. This signals that investors are willing to pay substantially more for each dollar of expected future earnings than they were before. However, there is one event in particular that helps justify this.\nHegseth’s Drone Push Boosts Investor Confidence\nOn July 10, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth released his \"Unleashing U.S. Military Drone Dominance\" memo. Hegseth wants to accelerate the U.S. military’s use of low-cost drones, a key area of focus for Kratos. This increases the likelihood that Kratos’s solutions will see significant adoption from the U.S. government, making the company’s expected future earnings more likely to materialize.\nAs this likelihood rises, investors feel increasingly comfortable with paying more for future earnings. Benchmark analyst Josh Sullivan referenced Hegseth's memo on Kratos’s earnings call. He said the memo's emphasis on low-cost drones “obviously lines up nicely” with Kratos’s business model.\nOverall, Kratos’s more than 100x forward P/E is certainly nothing to dismiss. The higher this ratio goes, the higher the downside risk becomes when the firm reports earnings in the future. If Kratos faces a big setback, shares could get hit hard.\nHowever, the company has an incredible earnings track record. It has beaten adjusted EPS estimates in 12 out of the last 12 quarters and only missed sales estimates twice. In the long term, the company’s ability to win huge deals compared to its current revenues bodes well for the future of shares.\nBefore you consider Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Why Datadog Is the AI Infrastructure Firm to Watch Out For", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-datadog-is-the-ai-infrastructure-firm-to-watch-out-for/", "text": "Datadog Today\n$129.07 +1.82 (+1.43%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $81.63\n▼\n$170.08 - P/E Ratio\n- 368.78\n- Price Target\n- $153.10\nShares of cloud monitoring and security services firm Datadog Inc. NASDAQ: DDOG have been on a rollercoaster ride this year. They declined sharply between February and April before rising again through late July. In August, the stock once again fell, bringing DDOG's full year-to-date (YTD) performance to -11.4%.\nInvestors may understandably be reluctant to enter a position in Datadog now, given its earlier decline just months ago. However, as one of the most widely touted stocks on the market, 24 out of 30 analysts view it as a Buy, there's also a case to be made that this latest dip presents an opportunity for interested investors.\nShares of DDOG are down even amid a fairly strong earnings report. The company has a flood of new products in the works that should further cement its niche position in the fast-growing cloud and AI spaces.\nGrowth in these spaces also means demand for security is increasing, and Datadog's security business is booming. All together, these reasons make a compelling case for the firm's consensus price target of $152.93, which is about 20% above current levels.\nEarnings Breakdown: Good News Despite \"Soft\" Figures\nDatadog’s early-August slump may partly reflect investor concerns over its second-quarter 2025 earnings report, which some analysts characterized as “soft” on profits. Even so, the company outperformed Wall Street's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) expectations. Revenue rose 28% year-over-year (YOY) to nearly $827 million, exceeding forecasts by $35 million, while EPS came in at $0.46, five cents above estimates.\nA major driver of this growth is the company’s AI-native customer base, which now accounts for about 11% of total revenue and roughly 10% of YOY growth, up sharply from just 4% of revenue a year earlier.\nDatadog Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$153.1018.62% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 30 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $129.07 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $200.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $153.10 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $105.00 |\n|---|\nDatadog Stock Forecast Details\nDatadog's early-August slump may be partly due to its second-quarter 2025 earnings report, which analysts have criticized as being \"soft\" on profits. However, the firm beat analyst predictions for revenue and earnings per share (EPS). Revenue climbed by 28% year-over-year (YOY) to reach nearly $827 million, $35 million ahead of predictions, while EPS of 46 cents per share was 5 cents up from expectations.\nAI-native customers are driving this growth, with that segment representing about 11% of total revenue and about 10% of YOY revenue growth. This category of customers contributed only 4% of the revenue a year ago.\nThe firm also sees an increasing share of big customers with annual recurring revenue (ARR) of at least $100,000. As of the end of the quarter, there were some 3,850 Datadog customers in this group, up 14% YOY. Though renewals among these large customers could occasionally lead to some revenue volatility, they give the firm a strong foundation of solid, recurring revenue on which to rely.\nThis also helped to boost operating and free cash flow considerably. Operating cash flow of $200 million was up nearly 22% year over year, while free cash flow of $165 million was up about 15% over the same period.\nPerhaps even more importantly, Datadog raised its guidance at the time of the release. It now expects full-year 2025 revenue to reach a range of $3.312 billion and $3.322 billion. Investors might take this as reassurance that the firm's AI tools continue to drive interest among potential customers.\nWave of New Products, Particularly in AI, Leads to Security Boost\nSpeaking of AI tools, at its annual DASH conference in June, Datadog announced a lineup of new and soon-to-come products 125, focusing on AI-centered tools to meet increasing demand. These include autonomous AI agents to monitor security, AI-based cloud coding assistants, enhanced data observability tools, and more.\nThe firm's Bits AI SRE, Dev Agent, and Security Analyst are the ones to watch for in particular. These tools are helping to drive overall customer growth and increase revenue from existing customers.\nThe firm explained that, as of the end of the quarter, AI tool adoption had reached approximately 4,500 of its approximately 31,400 customers.\nAs it becomes increasingly common for companies across sectors to utilize cloud AI infrastructure, these firms will also require more in-depth monitoring and security solutions. Security-related ARR topped $100 million in the second quarter, representing YOY growth in the mid-40% range.\nDatadog's new AI tools should help it solidify its position as the go-to AI security tool provider.\nDDOG shares are not cheap: the company's P/E ratio is a sky-high 363.6. However, if it can realize the growth that analysts predict, a 67.8% increase in earnings in the coming year, for instance, this valuation will be much easier to justify. Fresh off its inclusion in the S&P 500 last quarter, DDOG has officially joined the big dogs. Buying the current dip may be warranted.\nBefore you consider Datadog, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Grab Holdings: Get a Grip Now—Explosive Upside Brewing", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/grab-holdings-get-a-grip-now-explosive-upside-brewing/", "text": "Grab Today\n$5.10 -0.03 (-0.58%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- P/E Ratio\n- 127.53\n- Price Target\n- $5.82\nGrab Holdings' NASDAQ: GRAB stock price is setting up an explosive upside due to numerous factors, including its business model, position, growth, profitability, and market dynamics. The market dynamics include bullish analysts, institutional buying, and rising short interest that set the market up for a short-covering rally, provided a catalyst emerges.\nThe catalyst is likely the upcoming Q3 earnings report, in which another 20% growth pace is expected. The critical factors will be performance relative to the consensus, which is likely to be strong, and the profitability, which has been improving steadily.\nGrab Holding's stock price action is promising. The market made a solid move to higher levels in late 2024 and has sustained them since. The price action in 2025 shows support at the critical level, followed by a robust rebound and Golden Crossover in the moving averages.\nThe Golden Crossover is when the 30-day EMA moves above the longer-term 150-day EMA and reflects a shift in market dynamics.\nGrab Holdings Is a Super Buy for EM and High-Growth Exposure\nWhat is Grab Holdings? It calls itself a super APP with technology servicing Southeast Asia. Its business revolves around ride-sharing/ride-hailing but extends to delivery, grocery, and financial services. The critical takeaways are that it is the leading app for regions outpacing global GDP growth in 2025 and is expected to remain strong in the upcoming years.\nSoutheast Asia is expected to grow at roughly 4.7% this year, with variance by country as macroeconomic headwinds are offset by domestic demand and tourism.\nGrab Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$5.8214.05% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 11 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $5.10 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $8.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $5.82 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $4.60 |\n|---|\nGrab Stock Forecast Details\nThe long-term outlook is for the region to sustain a mid-single-digit pace for the next few years, driven by supply-chain shifts, industrialization, and a growing middle class. Southeast Asia’s middle class, the driving force for consumption, is expected to triple by the decade's end.\nThat outlook is affirmed by the institutional activity, which has been buying this stock robustly since last year. The institutional activity conspicuously spiked in Q4 2024 following a better-than-expected release and guidance increase and has remained robust.\nThe activity in 2025 has been bullish on balance each quarter, bringing the total institutional exposure to over 55%.\nAnalysts and short-selling trends also align with an explosive upside. This year’s analyst activity includes steady coverage with eleven ratings tracked by MarketBeat, sufficient to assume broad-based support, a Moderate Buy rating, and price target increases.\nThe consensus assumes only a low-double-digit upside as of mid-August, but the high-end range adds 40% to it and will likely be increased later this year. Regarding the short-sellers, they’ve been selling into strength in 2025, lifting their interest to a historically high 7.5%, capping action while laying the foundation for a short-covering rally likely to be catalyzed in Q4.\nGRAB’s Dilution Threat Passes: Balance Sheet Is Healthy\nGRAB’s market action has been impacted by dilutive activity, including share sales and debt offerings. However, the 2025 activity has put the balance sheet in a healthy position, capable of sustaining operations and growth.\nHighlights include increased cash, current, and total assets offset by increased debt and liabilities. The net result is $3.9 billion in cash, equity was flat at the quarter’s end, and leverage was very low.\nThe company’s total liability is less than 1.25x its cash position and about 0.65x its equity, allowing it ample flexibility for future needs.\nResults will drive future balance sheet health. The latest report shows revenue growing by 24%, accelerating sequentially and compared to the same quarter last year, driven by a 13% increase in user count and 5% increase in revenue per user.\nStrength was seen in all segments, with delivery up 22%, mobility up 16%, and financial services up 41%. The guidance was also strong, forecasting another year-over-year acceleration to sustain the mid-20% pace and produce profitability growth. The analysts estimate a mid-teens revenue CAGR for the next seven to ten years, compounded by improving profitability and accelerated earnings growth at the consensus.\nBefore you consider Grab, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

Certainly, one straightforward way to try to achieve this goal is through AI-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nFunds like the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF NASDAQ: AIQ and the Invesco AI and Next Gen Software ETF NYSEARCA: IGPT give investors a ready-made portfolio of AI-related companies with a single trade.\nSome investors may want to take a more granular approach, however. Rather than turn over control of the specific holdings and allocations to a fund manager, this strategy may involve targeting specific companies for individual investment.\nTo manage an AI-focused portfolio, investors might use ETFs as a guide, following the stocks that appear frequently in lists of these funds. Below, we look at the top holdings of four companies that appear often in the baskets of AI ETFs.\nCloud Data Platform Using AI Wins Analyst Support\nSnowflake Today\n$198.04 -1.04 (-0.52%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $107.13\n▼\n$229.27 - Price Target\n- $226.32\nSnowflake Inc. NYSE: SNOW operates a cloud-based data platform that consolidates and organizes customer data across multiple industries and sectors. The platform relies on AI to generate actionable business insights for clients.\nSNOW shares appear among the top 15 holdings of 25 different ETFs, including many focused on AI and technology and others with a more general approach to large-cap growth stocks.\nAs Snowflake's customer base continues to grow, the company demonstrates the resilience of momentum in the cloud data AI space. The firm has solidly outperformed the market this year, returning more than 25% year-to-date (YTD).\nIt also enjoys widespread support from analysts, with 36 out of 43 calling SNOW a Buy. Despite the significant rally over recent months, analysts see SNOW shares continuing to rise by nearly 15% based on consensus estimates.\nMajor Earnings Win May Help Astera's Popularity\nAstera Labs Today\n$186.43 +0.58 (+0.31%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $36.85\n▼\n$199.47 - P/E Ratio\n- 332.91\n- Price Target\n- $129.13\nAstera Labs Inc. NASDAQ: ALAB has emerged as a major player in AI hardware. The company's retimers, memory controllers, and other equipment are increasingly in demand among customers looking to build up AI infrastructure.\nALAB shares are among the top holdings of 27 different ETFs, including AI—and semiconductor-focused funds and several growth stock funds.\nAstera is fresh from an impressive earnings report for the second quarter, in which EPS more than tripled and revenue climbed by 150% thanks to massive sales of the company's Scorpio P CD switches, among other things.\nThe company's major partnerships should continue to drive significant growth in these areas: analysts see earnings climbing by 118% in the following year.\nStrong Bullish Sentiment for Legacy Giant Oracle\nOracle Today\n$248.86 +0.58 (+0.23%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $118.86\n▼\n$260.87 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.80%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 57.34\n- Price Target\n- $227.04\nLegacy tech giant Oracle Corp. NYSE: ORCL is known for its database, cloud computing, and enterprise software solutions, but it has an expanding footprint in AI as well. The company is increasingly integrating AI into its cloud offerings, including its popular Fusion suite. Unsurprisingly, among the 145 ETFs including ORCL shares as a top-15 holding, there are several prominent AI-focused funds.\nA strong pipeline, double-digit revenue growth, and major new deals fuel a significant rally for Oracle, which has surged by 49% year-to-date. Thomas Hughes makes a compelling case for why the firm may still have another $75 per share in upside potential as well.\nFor some investors hesitant to take on the risk of smaller AI firms, Oracle can provide stability and solid fundamentals in a major tech firm while offering technology exposure.\nTariffs May Not Hold TSM Down\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Today\nTSMTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n$241.29 +2.41 (+1.01%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $134.25\n▼\n$248.28 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.02%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 27.51\n- Price Target\n- $258.33\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. NYSE: TSM is among the largest companies in the world. Still, investors may be cautious given the Trump administration's latest approach to tariffs in the semiconductor industry. Nonetheless, it remains a popular choice among fund managers, and 117 ETFs include TSM shares among their top positions.\nThis may be partly because TSM shares have recently reached new highs after climbing by more than 18% YTD. These gains may be driven by optimism that TSM can move enough of its production into the United States before the damage from tariffs becomes too significant.\nThis seems to be a popular view among analysts; all four TSM ratings are Buys, and analysts believe it still has room to grow.\nBefore you consider Snowflake, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Why Arista's Blowout Q2 Is Good News for Chip-Giant Broadcom", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-aristas-blowout-q2-is-good-news-for-chip-giant-broadcom/", "text": "Arista Networks Today\n$137.99 +0.69 (+0.50%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $59.43\n▼\n$141.99 - P/E Ratio\n- 54.27\n- Price Target\n- $138.07\nWithin the data center and artificial intelligence (AI) trade, one of the most impressive earnings reports of Q2 came from Arista Networks NYSE: ANET. The company showed a substantial surprise, exceeding expectations on sales and earnings per share (EPS).\nHowever, when it comes to data centers, everything is connected. Arista Networks' latest results are a positive sign for Broadcom NASDAQ: AVGO, a company it works closely with.\nBelow, we’ll dive into why Arista’s strong Q2 should be a welcome development for AVGO.\nThe Broadcom and Arista Connection: Understanding the Data Center Supply Chain\nArista primarily makes Ethernet-based routers and switches for data centers. Known as networking equipment, routers and switches direct the flow of information between different data center components. They allow computing chips, those that actually perform calculations and execute tasks, to communicate with each other.\nAs data centers must buy more advanced computing chips to increase their capabilities, they must also upgrade their networking equipment. However, routers and switches consist of various components, and Arista doesn’t design all of these.\nOne key component in Arista’s routers and switches is networking chips. Who do they primarily buy those chips from? You guessed it: Broadcom. As Arista's switch and router sales see strong demand, Arista needs to buy Broadcom’s networking chips to meet it.\nLet’s add some numbers around this to understand further why Arista’s Q2 is a particularly good sign for Broadcom.\nArista’s Product Revenue Leads the Way, Helping Broadcom Shares Spike\nIn Q2, Arista's sales increased by over 30%, significantly outpacing expectations for around 25% growth. In Q3, Arista forecasts $2.25 billion in sales, setting growth expectations at a solid 24%.\nHowever, Arista has two key segments of its business: product revenue and service revenue. Product revenue comprises sales of new switches and routers, while services include technical support, software updates, and hardware maintenance.\nBroadcom Today\n$305.76 -0.58 (-0.19%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $134.90\n▼\n$317.35 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.77%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 114.52\n- Price Target\n- $295.96\nFor Broadcom, Arista’s product segment is the key focus, as its networking chips go into Arista switches and routers. That is why it was a great sign to see Arista’s product segment growth significantly outpace its service segment growth.\nThis faster growth wasn’t by a small margin either; Arista’s product segment grew at 31.9%, nearly 1,000 basis points higher than its 22.7% services growth. This emphasizes that Arista’s strong Q2 was disproportionately driven by hardware sales, which directly fuels Broadcom’s networking chip business demand.\nThe price action on August 6, the day after Arista’s earnings release, provides further evidence of the significant relationship between Arista and Broadcom. In reaction to its strong Q2 results, Arista shares jumped more than 17%.\nFollowing along, Broadcom also saw significant gains, with shares rising 3%. Meanwhile, the iShares Semiconductor ETF NASDAQ: SOXX, a key indicator of sentiment for the semiconductor industry, fell by 0.8%.\nThese numbers illustrate that the gain in Broadcom wasn’t due to news that benefited the semiconductor industry as a whole. Instead, Arista’s strong results were likely the main driver of Broadcom shares moving higher, due to the specific relationship between the two.\nFor Broadcom investors, this shows that upside in Arista translates considerably to upside in Broadcom.\nLooking Ahead: Arista and Broadcom’s Next-Gen Networking Chip, Tomahawk 6\nIn June, Broadcom announced that it had started shipping its new Tomahawk 6 networking chip. Broadcom’s Tomahawk line is one of the several families of networking chips that Arista uses in its products.\nHowever, even though Tomahawk 6 has begun shipping, Broadcom doesn’t expect sales to ramp up immediately. In its Q2 earnings call, Broadcom said the Tomahawk 6 chips it had shipped at that point were “basic proof of concepts.\"\nImportantly, Arista confirmed they have their hands on Tomahawk 6 in their earnings call. They said, “Tomahawk 6 is in our labs. Stay tuned for a new product next year.”\nThis shows that Arista is actively working to develop a product that contains Tomahawk 6.\nThe release of such a product will be key to Broadcom generating meaningful Tomahawk 6 revenues. Overall, Arista’s statements provide added confidence that Tomahawk 6 can contribute upside to Broadcom’s business over the coming years as data centers upgrade to next-generation networking infrastructure.\nThis could be a key component that drives upside in Broadcom shares.\nBefore you consider Broadcom, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Silver Prices Up, But Endeavour’s Profit Still Elusive", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/silver-prices-up-but-endeavours-profit-still-elusive/", "text": "Endeavour Silver Today\nEXKEndeavour Silver\n$5.58 +0.03 (+0.54%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- Price Target\n- $8.33\nEndeavour Silver Corp. NYSE: EXK is a good example of the importance of hitting expectations during earnings season. Although the mining company delivered a solid earnings report, shares were down over 4.78%, erasing almost all of EXK stock's gains the week before earnings.\nThe company delivered stronger-than-expected revenue of $85.30 million, beating expectations of $81.48 million. That number was also up an impressive 46% year over year (YOY). However, the bottom line was the source of distress for investors.\nThe company reported negative earnings per share (EPS) of three cents, despite analysts expecting positive EPS of one cent. This was the second consecutive quarter that investors had expected positive earnings, only to be disappointed.\nFor some investors, this raises a concern about the company’s management. If Endeavour can’t be profitable at a time when the price of silver is rising sharply, when will it be profitable? With the company’s Terronera mine still under construction and higher-grade ore access delayed, consistent profitability may not arrive until late 2025 or beyond.\nWhy Spot Price Doesn’t Tell the Whole Story\nEndeavour cited three key reasons for its negative earnings:\n- Sharp drop in silver production—Lower ore grades, mine sequencing issues at Guanaceví, and delays in accessing higher-grade stopes cut output.\n- Lower realized silver prices—Despite higher spot prices, provisional pricing and the timing of sales meant the company received less per ounce on average.\n- Higher costs and project spending—All-in sustaining costs (AISC) rose due to inflationary pressures, higher labor and energy costs, and continued capital spending on the Terronera project, which hasn’t yet contributed revenue.\nThis is a reminder that investing in mining stocks can be tricky for investors unfamiliar with mining contracts. In this case, the assumption is that if the price of an underlying metal. Silver is rising, then the company’s silver will automatically become more profitable.\nHowever, many silver miners, including Endeavour, sell part of their output as concentrate under provisional pricing contracts.\nAt shipment, the buyer pays a provisional price based on the market. Weeks or months later, when the sale is finalized, the price is adjusted to reflect the market. If silver prices drop between shipment and final settlement, the miner takes a negative adjustment, reducing the average realized price.\nFor example, if Endeavour shipped silver concentrate when the market price was $27 per ounce. Still, the final settlement occurred when silver was $26 per ounce, the company would receive $1 less per ounce on that shipment, even if silver later rallied to $29.\nDepending on price volatility, this common industry factor can work for or against miners.\nThe result is that strong spot prices don’t always translate into strong realized prices, especially in volatile markets. For investors, it’s a reminder that timing and contract terms can significantly impact mining revenue.\nGrowth on the Horizon\nGrowth on the Horizon was the title of the investor presentation that accompanies Endeavour’s earnings report. Endeavour provided reasons to believe it could turn around its earnings.\nEndeavour Silver Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$8.3349.34% UpsideBuyBased on 8 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $5.58 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $10.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $8.33 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $6.25 |\n|---|\nEndeavour Silver Stock Forecast Details\n- The Terronera mine is on track for 2025/2026 production—Management reaffirmed that construction is progressing well, with first production expected in late 2025 or early 2026. This mine is projected to more than double the company’s silver-equivalent output and lower its overall cost profile.\n- Higher-grade zones are coming online—At Guanaceví and Bolañitos, mine plans call for accessing better ore grades in the coming quarters, which should lift production and margins.\n- Leverage to silver price upside—Endeavour remains highly sensitive to silver price movements. If silver strengthens (management suggested they expect tighter supply-demand dynamics), cash flow could rebound quickly.\nStill, these catalysts may not meaningfully impact earnings until late 2025 or early 2026. Investors must decide whether to endure another year of uneven results or diversify exposure.\nTo be fair, analysts remain bullish on EXK stock. The consensus price target of the analysts on MarketBeat is $8.33. That’s a gain of more than 51%.\nFor investors wanting to exit EXK stock but who still want exposure to mining stocks, the VanEck Gold Miners ETF NYSEARCA: GDX could be an attractive alternative. It’s up about 79% for the year. That’s slightly below the return of Endeavour’s stock.\nHowever, it does smooth out the risk from owning one miner and exposes you to gold and silver miners.\nBefore you consider Endeavour Silver, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Endeavour Silver wasn't on the list.\nWhile Endeavour Silver currently has a Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nEnter your email address and we'll send you MarketBeat's list of ten stocks that are set to soar in Fall 2025, despite the threat of tariffs and other economic uncertainty.

Understandably, all the focus is on the Oracle of Omaha’s purchase of more than 5 million shares in UnitedHealth Group NYSE: UNH. The world’s most valuable healthcare provider and services stock was down as much as 48% from Mar. 31 to June 30, and Buffett took advantage.\nHowever, UNH was far from the only interesting move Berkshire made in Q2. Below, we will dive into the plethora of other new positions, sellouts, trims, and additions that took place.\nNotable New Positions: Berkshire Moves Into Steel and Home Builders\nLennar Today\n$131.43 -0.52 (-0.39%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $98.42\n▼\n$193.80 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.52%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 10.87\n- Price Target\n- $128.85\nIn Q2, Berkshire revealed that it initiated positions in two of America’s biggest homebuilders, Lennar NYSE: LEN and D.R. Horton NYSE: DHI.\nIt also bought the United States' largest steel producer, Nucor NYSE: NUE. All of these positions were technically initiated in Q1.\nHowever, Berkshire requested to receive “confidential treatment” from the SEC in Q1 and did not reveal these holdings at the time.\nOverall, as of June 30, the firm’s positions in these stocks were as follows:\n- LEN: Approximately 7 million Class A shares, worth $780 million. Berkshire also holds around $19 million in Class B shares.\n- DHI: Approximately 1.5 million shares, worth $191 million\n- NUE: Approximately 6.6 million shares, worth $857 million\nAll of these names have provided positive total returns in 2025. D.R. Horton’s big earnings beat in July has helped kick off a significant rally in homebuilding stocks over the past month or so. Nucor has also benefited big-time from steel tariffs. The stock has recovered from being down 11% in early April to up 25% as of the Aug. 15 close.\nBerkshire Takes Gains on T-Mobile, Its Telecom Market-Beater\nT-Mobile US Today\n$255.18 +0.55 (+0.22%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $192.61\n▼\n$276.49 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.38%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 24.07\n- Price Target\n- $256.31\nBerkshire made just one full exit in Q2—T-Mobile US NASDAQ: TMUS.\nThe firm closed out its entire $1 billion stake in the wireless carrier, a move that looks more like profit-taking than a lack of confidence.\nBerkshire first invested in T-Mobile in Q3 2020, and the bet paid off handsomely.\nOver the holding period, shares delivered a total return of roughly 114%, handily outpacing the S&P 500's 97% gain and leaving rival telecom stocks in the dust.\nFor Berkshire, the sale likely locks in years of outperformance from one of the strongest names in the sector.\nAAPL and CHTR Get Reduced\nApple Today\n$230.89 -0.70 (-0.30%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $169.21\n▼\n$260.10 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.45%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 35.04\n- Price Target\n- $237.60\nBerkshire reduced its shares of Apple NASDAQ: AAPL by nearly 7%, the first time the firm lowered its stake since Q3 2024.\nThis comes even though Apple shares were down as much as 22% in Q2 and ended the quarter down more than 7%.\nWith Berkshire selling on the dip rather than buying, this certainly isn’t the most encouraging sign for Apple stock.\nStill, Apple remains by far Berkshire's largest position at over $57 billion as of June 30.\nInterestingly, Berkshire’s shares held in Charter Communications NASDAQ: CHTR dropped by over 46%. Since initiating a position in Q2 2016, Charter shares have returned only 79% through Q2 2025. That’s less than one-third of the S&P 500’s 242% return over that period.\nThis shows that even Buffett isn’t immune to making bets that underperform. Still, the firm has consistently reduced its position in Charter over the years. It owns only around 12% of the number of shares today that it owned originally.\nBuffett More Than Doubles Down on POOL\nPool Today\n$316.08 -5.67 (-1.76%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $282.22\n▼\n$395.60 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.58%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 29.16\n- Price Target\n- $342.14\nIn terms of a percentage increase in shares held, Berkshire added most notably to its position in Pool NASDAQ: POOL.\nPool is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies and equipment.\nFrom Q1 to Q2, Berkshire boosted its number of POOL shares from around 1.46 million to 3.46 million.\nThat’s a massive 137% increase. POOL shares fell as much as 10% in Q2, and Buffett was there to snatch up the stock in a big way.\nWhat Buffett sees in this consumer discretionary name is up for debate. However, rising global temperatures and U.S. migration to hotter Southern states are notable tailwinds that could grow the swimming pool market over the coming years and decades.\nBerkshire's Near-Record Cash Position Looms Large\nOverall, Berkshire’s Q2 moves provide interesting insights into where this investing titan has seen value in the market, with Lennar, Nucor, and Pool standing out.\nHowever, Berkshire is still sitting on a near-record $344 billion in cash, showing that the firm isn’t chomping at the bit to invest in the current market.\nBefore you consider Berkshire Hathaway, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Cocoa Futures Send Hershey Stock Lower, Dip Opportunity?", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/cocoa-futures-send-hershey-stock-lower-dip-opportunity/", "text": "There is a significant difference between trading and investing. Trading concentrates on short-term fluctuations that may not last, while investing views these short-term events as opportunities to secure upside potential, with the focus on eventually returning to normal behavior, which is inevitable.\nHershey Today\n$178.51 +0.52 (+0.29%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $140.13\n▼\n$208.03 - Dividend Yield\n- 3.07%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 23.71\n- Price Target\n- $168.83\nToday, traders have had their piece of the pie in a stock within the consumer staples sector; now it’s time for investors.\nShares of Hershey Co. NYSE: HSY declined by 2.2% in a single week as the price of cocoa rose by roughly 20% over the past month, as supply and demand dynamics brought in the effect of good old economic theory. That being said, the higher price of cocoa directly affects costs and margins at Hershey, so traders took this as an opportunity to profit on the stock’s decline.\nHowever, investors can see this as an issue that the entire industry will have to face, Hershey’s peers included. Knowing that this will eventually subside, and that Hershey’s size and market share can allow it to cushion these costs and make it out okay from this turbulence, this recent dip can create an opportunity for those focused on the long-term (and those who have enough patience) to see the appreciation in this name.\n3 Metrics to Watch in Hershey Stock\nDespite the cyclically higher prices in cocoa, Hershey is a business that has been around to see situations like these multiple times in its history, so investors can reasonably expect the company to be able to take this one on the proverbial chin and move on stronger than before.\nAs they say, every story without numbers is a fairytale. Hershey’s financials will show investors the numbers they need to see to justify that the company is not in trouble today. Starting with gross profit margins, the heart of any brand's moat and positioning, a “buy the dip” justification begins.\nHershey has a gross profit margin of 40.1%, which is impressive for a company valued at $35.7 billion. Still, that's just the beginning. Even with higher interest rates and increased costs from rising cocoa prices, Hershey still reports a net income margin of 13.5%.\nKnowing that Hershey's average net income margin is about 17%, investors can now watch the cyclical ranges for future cost recovery, when cocoa prices go back to normal and allow Hershey to grow its earnings.\nThis directly translates into shareholder benefits, like higher earnings per share (EPS) and stock valuations, but here’s what matters for investors. Return on invested capital (ROIC) is the one metric primarily responsible for the compounding value of any company into the future, which is why Wall Street is turning bullish on this stock.\nThe Future Is Bright for Hershey Stock\nWith an ROIC rate of 19.3%, this company outperforms most businesses in the United States, including those with international exposure like Hershey. Moreover, investors must recognize that the long-term annual stock price performance tends to match the ROIC over time, meaning investors are set to compound their capital at these rates.\nJust like net income, however, the average ROIC in Hershey is closer to 25%, meaning today’s stock price reflects the bottom of its fundamental cycle. Taking advantage of this situation and the fact that the stock only trades at 85% of its 52-week high, some Wall Street analysts have shared their opinions on where it could be headed next.\nHershey Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$168.83-5.42% DownsideReduceBased on 18 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $178.51 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $208.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $168.83 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $134.00 |\n|---|\nHershey Stock Forecast Details\nWhile the consensus is set to a Reduce rating, valuing Hershey at $168.8 per share for a 6.3% downside, a few recent upgrades may soon change that consensus. For instance, Barclays analyst Andrew Lazar has assigned an Equal Weight rating and a $190 per share price target, suggesting Hershey can rally by 5.5% from today’s price.\nOr DA Davidson’s Brian Holland, who takes a Neutral view on Hershey and values it at $188 instead for a 4.4% upside. While these views are not the most bullish, they represent a sudden shift in sentiment. This shift could soon encourage other analysts to feel comfortable upgrading Hershey.\nAnother bullish factor is out there, speaking on sentiment just as much. Institutional buyers from the Vanguard Group boosted their holdings in Hershey stock by 1.1% as of early August 2025, bringing their net position to $3.1 billion or 9.3% ownership in the entire company.\nCharles Schwab Investment Management followed suit with a 2.5% boost, building up a stake worth $849.1 million as of early August 2025. The effects of higher cocoa prices have been fully realized on the stock, and now savvy investors are stepping in before the rest of the market realizes how much this stock could compound tomorrow.\nBefore you consider Hershey, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Next-Gen Defense: 3 Stocks Riding the New Global Arms Race", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/next-gen-defense-3-stocks-riding-the-new-global-arms-race/", "text": "Global military expenditure climbed by nearly 10% between 2023 and 2024, reaching $2.7 trillion last year as spending accelerated faster since the Cold War. Ongoing conflicts throughout Eastern Europe and the Middle East threaten to continue driving a worldwide race toward defense growth into the foreseeable future.\nWhile the implications of this increased spending on defense may be catastrophic on a geopolitical level, the increased military budgets of countries around the globe could benefit companies in the defense industry. The firms below are among the top defense names likely to see a boost from continued increases in military spending.\nL3Harris Is Growing and Advancing Technology at a Rapid Pace\nL3Harris Technologies Inc. NYSE: LHX is a defense industry giant, with a market cap above $50 billion. Nonetheless, it has engaged in a rapid-fire expansion of its technological efforts this year. The company's recently announced partnership with electric vertical takeoff and landing firm (eVTOL) Joby Aviation Inc. NYSE: JOBY opens a new avenue in the fast-growing eVTOL space and marks a crucial shift toward militarization for this technology.\nL3Harris Technologies Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$279.472.72% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 18 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $272.07 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $323.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $279.47 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $229.00 |\n|---|\nL3Harris Technologies Stock Forecast Details\nIn mid-August, L3Harris' experimental Navigation Technology Satellite-3—the first defense-focused experimental satellite to launch in almost half a century—was successfully launched.\nThese announcements arrived shortly after L3Harris posted an all-around earnings win in late July for its second quarter of 2025. The firm handily topped analyst predictions for earnings and revenue for the quarter, driven by the company's efforts to develop tools for the Trump administration's \"Golden Dome\" project and other initiatives.\nThe firm's integration with Aerojet Rocketdyne, now complete, has already yielded impressive results; production and deliveries have doubled, leading to record quarterly revenue for this business.\nInvestors have already priced in substantial optimism surrounding LHX shares, which are up more than 30% so far in 2025. Still, analysts remain bullish, as 13 out of 18 continue to rate LHX a Buy, and earnings are expected to rise by more than 12% in the coming year.\nMajor Contracts and Pipeline Help Drive Kratos' Massive Rally\nA maker of equipment and technology for use in manned and unmanned military systems, Kratos Defense & Security Solutions Inc. NASDAQ: KTOS is also coming off a successful mid-year earnings report. Not only did revenue grow by 17% year-over-year (YOY), leading to a top-line beat of more than $45 million, but earnings also came in above analyst expectations.\nThe success of the company's Valkyrie tactical drone in both the United States and international applications, driving quarter performance, has prompted Kratos to increase production.\nKratos is impressing with its contracts, especially with a large pipeline of about $13 billion. The sole-sourced program called Poseidon is a major success, awarding an estimated $750 million contract with production expected to increase in the next two years. This should boost Kratos' performance in the near future and has helped the company raise its full-year guidance.\nThis firm is a compelling buy for many reasons, not the least because 14 out of 16 analysts support it. However, a rally of more than 160% year-to-date (YTD) has sent Kratos' value metrics through the ceiling—the company has a P/E ratio of nearly 688, for example.\nThis makes an investment in KTOS shares somewhat more risky than before the rally began. Investors may still choose to seize an opportunity to buy in based on these strong fundamentals, or might prefer to look for a modest dip in share price to make a move.\nDisappointing Earnings Weigh on TransDigm Shares, But Long-Term Outlook Is Strong\nTransdigm Group Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$1,624.6916.84% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 13 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $1,390.57 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $1,839.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $1,624.69 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $1,348.00 |\n|---|\nTransdigm Group Stock Forecast Details\nTransDigm Group Inc. NYSE: TDG, the largest of these three companies with a market cap of around $80 billion, builds aircraft components for general aerospace and defense applications. The company also stands out for its less-than-stellar earnings in the latest round.\nTransDigm missed earnings and revenue for its fiscal third quarter due to issues with Airbus and Boeing NYSE: BA and lower commercial build rates.\nHowever, defense revenue is the area to watch, thanks to a 13% YOY improvement in the latest quarter. This helped the company to generate an impressive $630 million in cash flow at the same time. TDG shares fell immediately following the earnings report in early August and have so far failed to recover.\nWith strong analyst support and upside potential, this may be a unique opportunity to buy the dip.\nBefore you consider L3Harris Technologies, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

The market has discounted this area due to inflation and tariff uncertainties, blurring the future potential paths that these companies can take since they rely so heavily on consumer confidence and behavior.\nHowever, earnings results show a story that justifies higher prices; the only question is whether growth is priced in.\nThat question will be answered for stocks like Expedia Group Inc. NASDAQ: EXPE, Trip.com Group NASDAQ: TCOM, and even United Airlines Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: UAL as a reasonable basket of travel stocks that are heavily exposed to the current interest for international travel, a boost that comes from specific spending patterns as well as currency exchange fluctuations making overseas destinations more attractive today.\nExpedia Stock Has More Left in The Tank\nExpedia Group Today\n$206.67 -0.77 (-0.37%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $126.46\n▼\n$213.00 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.77%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 25.33\n- Price Target\n- $205.63\nWall Street expected Expedia to report $4.13 in earnings per share (EPS), a reasonable expectation considering the challenging year that travel and consumer names have had. However, the company came in with a beat of $4.24 in EPS, or roughly 9 cents higher than consensus, to justify a 7.4% rally in just one week, and 14.2% over the month.\nThis price action reflects not only what happened in the recent quarter, but also the fact that the future could hold a lot more growth to bring the stock into a new, higher ceiling. Wall Street analysts now expect Expedia to report $5.43 in EPS for the third quarter of 2025, a net growth of 28% from today’s earnings figure.\nAs most investors know, where EPS growth goes, so does the stock price, meaning there is an implied 28% growth potential behind the stock today. This is also where the price-to-growth (PEG) ratio comes into play, as it seeks to gauge whether today’s valuation multiples already reflect the underlying earnings growth.\nAny number below 1.0x means growth is not priced in. Expedia now sports a 0.7x PEG, meaning this stock has an effective 30% upside. Fundamentally, this also matches the implied 28% jump in underlying EPS. Hence, it looks like the rally isn’t over for this name.\nTrip.com Calls for Premium Multiples\nTrip.com Group Today\n$62.95 +0.58 (+0.93%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $41.22\n▼\n$77.18 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.44%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 18.25\n- Price Target\n- $77.25\nAfter rallying by 5% in a single week on earnings, investors now face the dilemma of chasing this stock higher or waiting for a pullback (which may never come). The fact that Trip.com delivered 87 cents in EPS while the market expected only 65 cents should answer that question immediately.\nHowever, this is now in the rearview mirror, and it’s time to look to the road ahead and figure out what this company's true potential is. A good place to start would be to gauge what Wall Street analysts are thinking, especially now that the company has beaten EPS expectations.\nThe consensus view for Trip.com stock is a Buy rating, and a valuation of $77.3 per share to call for roughly 25% upside potential from where it trades today. With double-digit upside accumulating in this industry, it makes sense to see 6.4% of Trip.com’s short interest decline over the past month as an initial sign of bearish capitulation.\nMore than that, Trip.com’s exposure to international bookings earned it a premium valuation multiple in terms of price-to-sales (P/S) of 5.5x compared to the rest of the leisure industry’s average 2.7x valuation. There’s a reason the market is willing to overpay for the future sales of this company, and now investors know what that reason is.\nUnited Airlines Hasn’t Priced in Growth Yet\nUnited Airlines Today\nUALUnited Airlines\n$102.37 +1.44 (+1.43%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $40.96\n▼\n$116.00 - P/E Ratio\n- 10.26\n- Price Target\n- $111.43\nSome may think a one-week rally of 12% in United Airlines stock should be sold and locked in, but that is wrong. Going back to the PEG ratio logic, this stock still has much more upside potential to be filled in the coming months, especially now that its exposure to international flights allows it to ride on this new consumer wave.\nAfter reporting $3.87 in EPS (above the $3.81 consensus), the stock has earned its place in a watchlist, and if already in a portfolio, it has earned its right to stay there. The reason is that a PEG ratio of only 0.4x fundamentally implies 60% upside potential in this stock.\nNow, airlines typically don’t move much in a year. Still, they aren’t known for 12% rallies in a week, like United Airlines just experienced, which might explain why those at the Vanguard Group increased their holdings in United Airlines stock as of early August 2025.\nA 1% boost doesn’t sound like much in percentage terms. Still, in dollar terms, it means these institutional buyers now hold a stake worth $2.9 billion in this airline, or 11.5% ownership in the entire company, to act as a vote of confidence and confirmation that the future upside potential is very much present today.\nBefore you consider United Airlines, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and United Airlines wasn't on the list.\nWhile United Airlines currently has a Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nLearn the basics of options trading and how to use them to boost returns and manage risk with this free report from MarketBeat.

{"title": "Smart Money Piles Into GRID ETF on Trillion-Dollar Power Upgrade", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/smart-money-piles-into-grid-etf-on-trillion-dollar-power-upgrade/", "text": "First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Smart Grid Infrastructure Index Fund Today\nGRIDFirst Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Smart Grid Infrastructure Index Fund\n$143.89 +0.43 (+0.30%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $99.78\n▼\n$145.44 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.04%\n- Assets Under Management\n- $3.08 billion\nWhile market headlines often fixate on the dramatic swings of tech sector giants, a different kind of investment vehicle has been quietly attracting a surge of strategic interest. The First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Smart Grid Infrastructure Index Fund NASDAQ: GRID, a specialized fund focused on a seemingly routine sector, is exhibiting market behavior typically reserved for high-growth stocks.\nIt has been consistently outperforming the broader market and posting impressive gains, signaling a deliberate shift by investors. This unusual focus points to a growing recognition of one of the most undeniable and capital-intensive megatrends of the next decade: the complete overhaul of the world's energy sector infrastructure.\nFollowing the Money Into Grid Modernization\nThe evidence of heightened investor interest in GRID is clearly written in its market data. In 2025, the fund has delivered a year-to-date return of over 20%, recently pushing to a new 52-week high of $145.44. This price action is supported by notable trading activity, with daily volume frequently spiking above its 166,000-share average. This indicates active and broad participation from market players. With a beta of 1.25, the fund exhibits more volatility than the S&P 500, a characteristic that has rewarded investors during its recent uptrend.\nBeyond daily trading, a look at capital flows reveals a deeper, more strategic trend. Over the last 24 months, GRID has attracted significant institutional attention, with net inflows exceeding $1.2 billion. This large-scale movement of capital suggests that sophisticated investors are making long-term allocations, viewing the grid modernization theme as a core holding for the future.\nThe Power Problem: Why the World Needs a New Grid\nInvestor interest in GRID is grounded in a fundamental reality: the world’s electrical grid, a 20th-century marvel, is unprepared for 21st-century demands. This urgent need to modernize has created a multi-decade investment super-cycle, with some market research firms projecting the global smart grid market to grow to over $100 billion annually by the end of the decade. Several powerful and interlocking catalysts drive this spending:\n- Electrification of Everything: The simultaneous rise of electric vehicles (EV), electric heating, and industrial electrification is creating unprecedented demand that aging grids cannot handle.\n- The AI Power Crunch: The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has introduced a massive new variable. Data centers required for training AI models are incredibly energy-intensive, and their power consumption is growing exponentially. A stable, high-capacity grid is no longer just a convenience; it is the essential foundation for the continued growth of the entire technology sector.\n- The Clean Energy Mandate: The global shift to renewable energy sources like wind and solar presents a unique challenge. These sources are often intermittent and located far from population centers, requiring a smarter, digitized grid to manage energy flow, storage, and reliability.\nThis upgrade cycle is not theoretical. It is being actively funded by government policy. In the United States, legislation like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act has allocated tens of billions of dollars toward grid modernization and clean energy projects. These programs act as a financial backstop, de-risking private investment and creating a predictable, long-term stream of revenue for the companies at the heart of this transformation.\nThe Companies Building the New Grid\nThe GRID ETF offers investors a direct and diversified way to invest in this trend. With just over 100 holdings, the fund is concentrated but globally diverse, with about 26% of its assets in the United States and the remainder spread across developed markets in Europe and Asia. The portfolio holds the key companies supplying the essential technology and services for the grid overhaul.\nThe fund’s industrial core consists of global leaders like Eaton NYSE: ETN, which makes up 8.76% of the portfolio, Schneider Electric OTCMKTS: SBGSF, which accounts for 7.82%, and ABB NYSE: ABBNY, which represents 8.34%. These companies provide the core hardware, from advanced circuit breakers and transformers to sophisticated power management systems. Their products are fundamental not only for upgrading public utility networks but also for outfitting the new, power-hungry data centers.\nEngineering and construction firms like Quanta Services NYSE: PWR represent the boots on the ground, responsible for the physical construction and maintenance of this new infrastructure. Finally, the fund's inclusion of technology giants like NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA highlights the “smart” investment in smart grid technology. While a smaller holding, its presence underscores a critical point: NVIDIA’s chips power the AI revolution, which in turn creates the immense energy demand issue that GRID’s other companies are being paid to solve.\nFirst Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Smart Grid Infrastructure Index Fund (GRID) Price Chart for Tuesday, August, 19, 2025\nWhy GRID's Story Is Just Beginning\nThe recent surge in attention for GRID signals the market's recognition of a foundational, non-discretionary requirement. Modernizing the energy grid is not an optional or speculative endeavor. It is the essential backbone required to support nearly every other major technological and economic ambition, from artificial intelligence to a clean energy economy.\nBy blending defensive industrial champions with innovative technology leaders, the fund provides a unique way to invest in the picks and shovels of this global overhaul. For investors seeking targeted exposure to a durable, multi-decade megatrend, the story behind GRID's rise offers a compelling case for the future of energy infrastructure. Its global diversification across dozens of companies further strengthens this position, ensuring the investment is tied not to the cycle of a single country, but to a synchronized, worldwide push for modernization.\nBefore you consider First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Smart Grid Infrastructure Index Fund, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Smart Grid Infrastructure Index Fund wasn't on the list.\nWhile First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Smart Grid Infrastructure Index Fund currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nNuclear energy stocks are roaring.

{"title": "The Real Reason Ford Stock Is Rallying—Can It Keep Going?", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/the-real-reason-ford-stock-is-rallyingcan-it-keep-going/", "text": "The automotive sector has been subject to extra volatility recently, not only due to changing consumer spending and preferences but also from the macro backdrop involving tariffs and other developments in the sourcing of parts and imports. That being said, this is now the best time to find those companies that are actively (and successfully) adjusting.\nFord Motor Today\nFFord Motor\n$11.46 +0.02 (+0.17%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $8.44\n▼\n$11.97 - Dividend Yield\n- 5.24%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 14.69\n- Price Target\n- $10.53\nFord Motor Co. NYSE: F is a flagship American brand that refuses to let these pressures collapse on itself. Management has made the right decision, or so the price action suggests. The reasons behind that market reaction will be key in determining whether the stock has any more upside potential in the coming quarters and years, an opportunity for those who know what they are looking for.\nThese tariffs and changing geopolitics create two scenarios.\nFirst, some companies will have to “eat” these costs and see their margins squeezed for lower earnings per share (EPS) and valuations down the line, and a second scenario where key pivots will come in place to reposition these companies into a much brighter future ahead.\nFord has just fallen into that second category.\nA Reinvention of Ford Motor\nStaying true to its early legacy of commitment to efficiency and state-of-the-art assembly processes, the company has announced a $5 billion investment to revolutionize its factories and product lines, making the future of automobiles accessible to today’s consumer.\nA recent press release from the company says its new line of electric vehicles will have an average MSRP of $30,000—the same as the first “universal car,” the Model T, when adjusted for inflation. This is a huge turnaround in an age when American carmakers had been dismissed, especially in the current tariff environment they operate under.\nThose pressures led Ford to pivot into an unexpected area of new expertise, quoting that their new assembly process will resemble a “tree” structure, creating roughly 4,000 new American jobs and keeping the company's efficiency at its highest. It seems that the market, so far, is bullish on this idea.\nInvestors should note the 2.3% rally the stock earned just days after this announcement. They are willing to overlook that $5 billion will be allocated to this new project, focusing instead on the potential future benefits to Ford’s bottom-line earnings and stock valuations.\nInstitutions Like This New Ford\nAs of early August 2025, institutional buyers from the Vanguard Group justified adding 1% to their sizable holdings in Ford stock. While this may not sound like much in percentage terms, when turned into hard cash, investors can see that Vanguard now holds a stake worth $5 billion in the company.\nOwning 11.6% of Ford is not something investors should take lightly. It is, in fact, a vote of confidence in the company's future financial profile and fundamental setup. Even before this shift starts, the company is already doing better than expected in a tough operating environment.\nFord Motor Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$10.53-8.09% DownsideReduceBased on 17 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $11.46 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $15.50 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $10.53 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $7.00 |\n|---|\nFord Motor Stock Forecast Details\nFord’s recent quarterly earnings say it all, as the company reported 37 cents in EPS, a beat of 12% above the market’s expectations for only 33 cents, justifying the price action seen recently, if not more, in the coming quarters and years. All told, Ford stock trades at 95% of its 52-week high, but there is still a lot of upside.\nNew 52-week highs could be made in the future, considering that the stock’s price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is only 0.2x, effectively an inefficient price dynamic representing Ford’s past selling model. Since markets are forward-looking, it is only a matter of time before this ratio expands toward the automotive industry’s average of 6.6x.\nThat would be a stratospheric rise indeed, and it would be backed entirely by how the rest of the market starts to price in the new assembly and product line effects. Moreover, the fact that these new vehicles will be assembled inside the United States exempts them from the additional tariffs now in place for cars assembled overseas.\nThis means a direct incentive for consumers to prefer a Ford vehicle over some of the international brands, since prices are now going to become a lot more competitive in the future, also a force that is not at all being reflected in today’s valuation multiples, despite the stock’s momentum being the strongest it has been all year.\nBefore you consider Ford Motor, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "3 Stocks Helping Build Tomorrow's Data Centers", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-stocks-helping-build-tomorrows-data-centers/", "text": "A quiet wave is poised to capture the stock market’s attention, having already done so for government officials and select traders who are well-informed about developments before they become headline news. This new wave is centered on the next phase of the technology sector, one that involves creating an entirely new infrastructure out of pure necessity.\nAs the United States prioritizes its onshoring of artificial intelligence capabilities, primarily for commercial and national security reasons, one undeniable truth will face everyone in the space. The reality is that today’s energy infrastructure cannot handle the electricity demand from all the new data centers being built to support tomorrow’s cloud computing and artificial intelligence model training.\nThat’s why today’s list of stocks will be useful, as they are the ones supporting the construction of these data centers. By keeping names like DuPont de Nemours Inc. NYSE: DD, Caterpillar Inc. NYSE: CAT, and Martin Marietta Materials Inc. NYSE: MLM in a watchlist, investors will have greater odds of beating the market in the future.\nDuPont Stock’s Discount Creates New Opportunities\nDuPont de Nemours Today\nDDDuPont de Nemours\n$73.20 +0.12 (+0.16%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $53.77\n▼\n$90.06 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.24%\n- Price Target\n- $88.25\nOut of the names in this list, DuPont stock offers the greatest gap to its relative 52-week high level, as it now trades at only 78% of it. This creates enough room for it to reach back into historically proven valuation levels for investors to start considering it possible under the current narrative.\nDuPont’s role in the data center buildout is straightforward; its many products are used in industrial applications, especially in infrastructure projects in early and expanding stages. This is why some savvy investors have decided that enough is enough for the stock’s decline into discounted levels and have taken action.\nSuch as those from the Vanguard Group, who, as of early August 2025, boosted their holdings of DuPont stock by 1.6%, bringing their entire position to a high of $3.3 billion or 11.4% ownership in the entire company. What this means is that DuPont now has the capital backing and stewardship of an activist investor like Vanguard.\nNot to mention, this new position also acts as a vote of confidence in the stock’s recovery back to previous highs, an opportunity that Wall Street analysts recently took advantage of. With a consensus Moderate Buy rating and valuation for $88.3 per share, a few analysts decided to take that average a step higher beginning in mid-July 2025.\nNow analysts like Arun Viswanathan from the Royal Bank of Canada see DuPont stock as an Outperform with a $94 per share valuation, implying it can rally by about 35% from where it trades today and flirt back with its 52-week high levels.\nCaterpillar Stock: The Heart of New Infrastructure Buildouts\nCaterpillar Today\n$412.74 +4.95 (+1.21%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $267.30\n▼\n$441.15 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.46%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 20.99\n- Price Target\n- $444.00\nAs the second company to receive payment, Caterpillar arguably deserves to trade within 90% of its 52-week high, given the bullish sentiment and momentum that have investors wondering what the market is pricing in for the company through this rewarding price action.\nMore than just wondering, investors can look at what Wall Street is already doing as Caterpillar reported its latest quarterly earnings figures. Like DuPont, Caterpillar’s consensus rating is for a Moderate Buy with $444 as its fair value. However, some analysts decided that wasn’t enough after crunching the latest financial figures.\nSome of them now see Caterpillar valued at over $500 per share, such as Tami Zakaria from J.P. Morgan Chase, in her Buy rating and $520 per share valuation. This outlier call implies that Caterpillar stock can break into a new 52-week high and rally by roughly 27% from where it trades today.\nThis current setup in Caterpillar would explain why the stock’s short interest declined by 8.3% over the past month, an initial sign of bearish capitulation as short sellers have to weigh in the implications of new data center construction demand and Caterpillar’s role in it.\nThe Leader for a Reason: Martin Marietta\nMartin Marietta Materials Today\nMLMMartin Marietta Materials\n$603.16 -6.42 (-1.05%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io.

Before Caterpillar is contracted or DuPont’s products are ordered, a foundation must have the right materials for commercial construction. That’s where this company comes into play first.\nBeing first also means getting paid first, which is why the market’s early reaction to its valuation and price is crucial. At this point, however, Martin Marietta can be either a gauge for investors or a continued momentum play that calls for Wall Street analysts to revise the way they see it today.\nIn terms of consensus, analysts now see Martin Marietta as a Moderate Buy valued at $620.8 per share, which is roughly fair value considering it trades at $600.5 per share now. This makes sense as the data center theme is becoming more adopted, and Martin Marietta is such an obvious play in that world.\nHowever, DA Davidson analyst Brent Thielman now sees it as a Buy valued at $700 per share (as of mid-August 2025) for a net upside potential of 16.6%. Since the company could effectively make a new 52-week high, investors could come to expect new breakout buying, such as Geode Capital’s recent build-up of a position worth $831.3 million as of early August 2025.\nBefore you consider DuPont de Nemours, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "MarketBeat Week in Review – 08/11 - 08/15", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/marketbeat-week-in-review-08-11-08-15/", "text": "Uncertainty returned to the market this week after conflicting news on inflation in July. Consumer prices matched expectations, but producer prices were sharply higher. For now, investors are ignoring those concerns and pushing stocks higher backed by strong earnings, continued progress on tariffs, and retail sales that were in-line with expectations.\nThat optimism is also being fueled by the belief that rate cuts are coming in September. However, that could change after the Federal Reserve chair speaks at the Jackson Hole meeting next week.\nIn the meantime, the trend is in favor of the bulls, but it’s not likely to be a smooth ride higher. September is historically bad for stocks, so investors should expect volatility. But there will always be opportunities, and the MarketBeat analysts will be here to help investors find them. Here are some of our most popular stories from this week.\nArticles by Thomas Hughes\nNuclear energy will have a big impact on portfolios in the coming years, but Thomas Hughes reminded investors that the biggest gains may come from thinking small, meaning small modular reactors (SMRs). NuScale Power Corp. NYSE: SMR is a leader in this sector and is on track to deploy its first commercial reactors by 2027.\nOracle Corp. NYSE: ORCL is up nearly 50% in 2025. But Hughes gives investors five reasons to believe that the rally in ORCL stock may have further to run. Analysts and institutions are front-running the company’s September earnings, which may be the stock’s next catalyst.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks are on the radar of growth investors. This week, Hughes explained why Cisco Systems Inc. NASDAQ: CSCO is a stock that can appeal to both growth and income investors.\nArticles by Sam Quirke\nQualcomm Inc. NASDAQ: QCOM continues to be one of the most unloved stocks in the red-hot chip sector. However, Sam Quirke pointed out several reasons for investors to be optimistic about QCOM stock, including a consensus price target that points to a 50% gain.\nAmazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN is another stock that’s been down sharply. Quirke’s been on top of the tug-of-war since the company’s earnings report and explained why the bears may have waved the white flag.\nBullish momentum is also the story for Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA. Quirke highlighted the technical signal that confirmed a breakout and explained why the stock still presents a compelling risk/reward story for long-term investors.\nArticles by Chris Markoch\nCrowdStrike Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: CRWD is one of the hottest names in the cybersecurity sector, but is down sharply in the last month. This week, Chris Markoch analyzed the factors driving the downturn and why the upcoming earnings report could bring back the bulls.\nCAVA Group Inc. NASDAQ: CAVA stock dropped sharply after the company delivered weak same-store sales and lowered its guidance for the full year. Markoch pointed out that this may simply be a case of a young stock that is feeling the weight of expectations.\nMarkoch also reminded investors that boring can be beautiful in volatile markets. That was the case for these three high-yield dividend stocks that still trade for under $50.\nArticles by Ryan Hasson\nMany investors are flocking to defense and space stocks, and Rocket Lab USA Inc. NASDAQ: RKLB has been one of the most popular names, up more than 70% this year. This week, Ryan Hasson explained why a recent acquisition will give the company additional capabilities that will open up new revenue streams.\nIt’s hard to think of a Magnificent Seven stock as a comeback story, but that’s been the case with Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL. Hasson wrote about the outlook for the tech giant after it reclaimed a $200 price level.\nIf you feel overwhelmed by the fast-paced growth of AI and AI infrastructure stocks (i.e., energy stocks), exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be a solid alternative. Hasson provided five ETFs that provide broad exposure to these fast-moving sectors, yet have distinct profiles to fit different investing styles.\nArticles by Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli\nThe chip sector has been a playground for traders in 2025. Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli pointed to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. NYSE: TSM as a stock for long-term investors to buy and hold. Osorio-Mazilli highlighted future areas of growth for TSM stock that make it worth chasing even near all-time highs.\nBigBear.ai Holdings Inc. NYSE: BBAI delivered disappointing earnings and guidance that sent its stock crashing this week. Osorio-Mazilli did a deep dive into the report and showed why BBAI stock could be oversold and why short sellers could find themselves in a bear trap.\nMonopolies tend to have negative connotations for investors, but Osorio-Mazilli explained that in volatile times like this, investors should look for the stability these companies can provide. He highlighted three stocks that hold nearly monopolistic market share in their respective industries and are going to be targets of institutions very soon.\nArticles by Leo Miller\nScore one for the walled gardens. That was Leo Miller’s takeaway from the disappointing earnings report from The Trade Desk Inc. NASDAQ: TTD. Miller explained why the company’s open-internet business model lost this quarter’s battle but could still allow patient investors to win the long-term ad space war.\nStock buybacks are usually associated with mature, blue-chip stocks. However, this week, Miller pointed investors to three growth stocks that just announced buyback programs, and explained why one of those companies said their $20 billion buyback program is only the beginning.\nThe role of artificial intelligence in biotech and healthcare holds much promise. Tempus AI Inc. NASDAQ: TEM has been one of the leaders in advancing precision medicine through the practical application of artificial intelligence. Despite nearly doubling its stock price since December 2024, Miller explained why TEM stock still has a long runway.\nArticles by Nathan Reiff\nEarnings season brings a firehose of information for investors. That’s why, to start out the week, Nathan Reiff helped investors focus on four stocks that were drawing attention from analysts before they reported earnings this past week.\nD-Wave Quantum Inc. NASDAQ: QBTS is one of the most popular stocks in the quantum computing sector. This week, Reiff provided an overview of how D-Wave stacks up against some of the other leading names in this emerging sector.\nMany dividend stocks are fine for income, but the best ones also give investors the opportunity for future growth. That was the idea behind Reiff’s article on three dividend stocks that are growing earnings as well as dividends.\nArticles by Dan Schmidt\nEven a red-hot sector like AI is producing winners and losers. However, some of the AI stocks that are getting punished may have reached the point of being oversold. That was what Dan Schmidt looked at with his analysis of these three AI stocks in correction mode.\nIt doesn’t exactly feel like 2021, but initial public offerings (IPOs) are making a modest comeback in 2025. This week Schmidt highlighted two stocks that debuted this week and explained why investor interest may be justified.\nThe headline was that ESPN announced major agreements with the National Football League (NFL) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). However, savvy investors will connect those dots to ESPN’s parent company, The Walt Disney Company NYSE: DIS. That’s what Schmidt did and explained what these deals could mean for the House of Mouse.\nArticles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson\nArcher Aviation Inc. NYSE: ACHR stock has recovered after dropping sharply following its quarterly earnings. This week, Jeffrey Neal Johnson recapped the earnings report and pointed out how the results showed that the eVTOL company was proving it could turn concepts into reality.\nAI infrastructure stocks are the picks and shovels of this generational revolution. Johnson highlighted why investor dollars continue to flow into Arista Networks Inc. NYSE: ANET and why it means the stock could have further to run.\nThe AI center buildout is making some blue-chip utilities stocks into attractive growth plays. That’s the situation that Johnson pointed out with American Electric Power Company Inc. NYSE: AEP. The company’s stock is surging on increased electric demand from the rapid expansion of data centers in the company’s service areas.\nArticles by Jordan Chussler\nOne of the biggest tariff announcements was the 100% tariff being placed on imported chips. Jordan Chussler reminded investors that the devil will be in the details, but the news is certainly going to benefit these three U.S.-based semiconductor stocks.\nFinally, this week, Chussler analyzed the recent IPO from Bullish NYSE: BLSH, a crypto exchange backed by Peter Thiel.

Meta Is Taking Aim at Apple", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/ai-glasses-to-replace-smartphones-meta-is-taking-aim-at-apple/", "text": "Meta Platforms Today\n$767.37 -17.86 (-2.27%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $479.80\n▼\n$796.25 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.27%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 27.78\n- Price Target\n- $822.41\nIn Q2, Meta Platform’s NASDAQ: META advertising business showed the market everything it wanted to see. However, Meta’s Reality Labs segment continues to be an eyesore. Despite losing more than $18 billion over the last 12 months, Mark Zuckerberg sees unbridled upside in this part of the business.\nBelow, we’ll dive into what the Magnificent Seven company may see as the ultimate goal for Reality Labs: AI glasses replacing smartphones. We’ll examine the potential size of this opportunity and how Apple's NASDAQ: AAPL relative lack of research and development could help Meta in this venture.\nZuckerberg Makes Bold Statements on AI-Glasses-Driven Future\nOn Meta’s Q2 earnings call, analyst Youssef Squali of Truist Securities issued a point-blank question to Zuckerberg, saying, \"Do you believe [AI] glasses ultimately replace smartphones?”\nZuckerberg didn’t outright say \"yes\" but strongly implied that this is a significant part of Reality Labs’ goal. Zuckerberg said, “I continue to think that glasses are basically going to be the ideal form factor for AI.”\nHe went on to draw an analogy between future AI glasses and contact lenses. Zuckerberg said that he would be “at a cognitive disadvantage going through the world if he didn't have his vision corrected using contact lenses.\" He said in the future, if someone doesn’t have AI glasses, they would also “probably be at a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people.\"\nIn summary, Zuckerberg believes that glasses will be the best way to interact with AI, implying that smartphones will not. Additionally, he believes that someone who foregoes using AI glasses and uses a smartphone instead will be at a cognitive disadvantage.\nOverall, these comments point to Zuckerberg's belief that AI glasses will be essential in the future. Smartphones could still have their place, but they would be an optional tool, while AI glasses would be a required one.\nAI Glasses Could Target a $400 Billion Market\nWhile the notion that smartphones are a “required” tool today may be debatable, their massive adoption is undeniable. Pew Research estimated in 2019 that 76% of people in advanced economies owned a smartphone.\nThis large penetration makes the global smartphone market a useful reference point when assessing the potential opportunity for AI glasses.\nGlobal smartphone sales at over $100 billion in Q2 2025 imply an annual run-rate of $400 billion. That’s around 2.2x more than the amount of revenue that Meta generated over the last 12 months. Overall, it’s extremely difficult to say that Meta could capture all or most of that revenue.\nHowever, it highlights how the company could massively expand its sales in the long term if AI glasses become as necessary as Zuckerberg believes. This could create game-changing upside in shares. Still, that is a highly theoretical scenario at this point.\nLagging iPhone Innovation Creates an Opening for Meta\nIn some ways, it’s not entirely unrealistic to think that AI glasses could replace smartphones. Apple has been routinely criticized over the past years for releasing new iPhones that offer minimal improvements over their predecessors.\nMeta Platforms Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$822.417.17% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 46 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $767.37 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $980.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $822.41 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $600.00 |\n|---|\nMeta Platforms Stock Forecast Details\nIt's part of the reason the firm’s iPhone revenue growth has slowed to a snail's pace. Growth was -2.4% in 2023 and was just barely positive in 2024. Still, to give Apple its flowers, it saw record iPhone upgrades last quarter, helping iPhone sales rise more than 13%.\nNevertheless, the general trend holds; iPhone revenues increased at a compound annual growth (CAGR) rate of just under 3% from 2015 to 2024.\nThis starkly contrasts with the 51% CAGR achieved from 2009 to 2014, when the iPhone was revolutionary for its time. This demonstrates the iPhone’s relative lack of innovation over the recent past, making consumers feel less of a need to upgrade.\nMeanwhile, Meta is investing tens of billions of dollars a year to create innovative technologies like AI glasses that could offer benefits smartphones simply cannot. Over the last three years, Meta’s average research and development spending has been equal to more than 27% of its revenue.\nFor Apple, that figure is just 7.7%. This shows how Meta is prioritizing innovation to a much greater extent. Although this relative lack of R&D spending may not soon impact the company, it could one day catch up to Apple.\nOverall, whether AI glasses will reach mass adoption remains a point of intense speculation. However, if they do, Meta could continue delivering significant returns for years. With the company’s advertising business chugging along, Reality Labs could one day serve as a powerful added growth driver.\nBefore you consider Meta Platforms, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Meta Platforms wasn't on the list.\nWhile Meta Platforms currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nMarketBeat's analysts have just released their top five short plays for August 2025.

{"title": "3 Restaurant Stocks That Will Outperform in Q3 and Q4", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/3-restaurant-stocks-that-will-outperform-in-q3-and-q4/", "text": "There are headwinds for restaurant stocks, and they may increase as the year progresses, but companies like Chipotle Mexican Grill NYSE: CMG, Wingstop NASDAQ: WING, and Starbucks NASDAQ: SBUX are on track to outperform and increase their stock prices. Each has a unique catalyst to support shareholder value and is in a position to outperform its peers and the broader market.\nAnalyst trends forecast a substantial upside for each, and the moves will likely be catalyzed by the calendar Q3 earnings reports.\nChipotle Mexican Grill: The Weakness is Priced In\nChipotle Mexican Grill Today\nCMGChipotle Mexican Grill\n$43.38 -0.66 (-1.50%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $41.18\n▼\n$66.74 - P/E Ratio\n- 38.73\n- Price Target\n- $60.22\nChipotle Mexican Grill’s share price retreated to a multiyear low after weaker-than-expected Q2 results cut into the outlook. However, analysts at Piper Sandler think the sell-off is overdone and have upgraded the stock to Overweight.\nIn their view, the sell-off is pricing in a sluggish comp for next year, and numerous factors in play can individually offset the weakness. Among them are an outlook for accelerated store openings, significantly improved restaurant-level margins, and the CEO's confidence that a mid-single-digit comp CAGR can be regained.\nThe analyst price target trend is tepid but aligns with a robust upside for this stock. The Q2 release catalyzed numerous price target reductions, but they aligned with the consensus $60, which forecasts a 40% upside for the stock.\nAdditionally, MarketBeat’s data reveals increasing coverage and firming sentiment, which provides support for the market. Long-term, Chipotle’s outlook is supported by its international growth strategy. The company has begun to accelerate openings and will generate significant growth via this vector over time.\nWingstop to Reaccelerate Growth\nWingstop Today\n$339.63 +2.79 (+0.83%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $204.00\n▼\n$433.86 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.35%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 56.61\n- Price Target\n- $379.52\nThe hurdle for Wingstop’s share price was its slowing growth and decelerating comp store sales. However, the early-year results were well ahead of expectations and compounded by plans to accelerate store openings.\nThe net result is that revenue growth is expected to be sustained or accelerate from Q2 levels, and the analysts are responding favorably to the news.\nMarketBeat tracks ratings from 29 analysts covering WING stock, and 10 issued an update immediately following the report. The data reveals increased coverage compared to last year and Q2, firming sentiment, a bullish bias to the Moderate Buy rating, and a 10% upside at the consensus.\nBased on the trends, a move to the high-end range is likely, which puts the stock in the range of $400 to $440, a new all-time high when reached.\nInstitutional activity is also noteworthy. The institutions have been buying Wingstop, Chipotle Mexican Grill, and Starbucks all year. The balance of activity is about 2:1 buyers to sellers across the group, and activity was strong in the first half of Q3.\nStarbucks Turnaround Will Bear Visible Results Soon\nStarbucks Today\n$92.54 +1.94 (+2.14%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $75.50\n▼\n$117.46 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.64%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 39.89\n- Price Target\n- $103.65\nBaird’s note to clients is that the Starbucks CEO-led transition will soon start showing visible results. The note included an upgrade to Outperform from Hold and a $115 price target, which puts the stock in the high-end range. Baird says that labor-cost increases are becoming more visible while cost-saving opportunities are expected to rise.\nAt the same time, comp store sales are expected to improve, driven by the Green Apron Service initiative, which aims to improve customer satisfaction and business flow-through.\nOther analysts are on board with the transition. The data tracked by MarketBeat reveals steady coverage, a firm Moderate Buy rating, and an increase to the price target since the Q2 release. The increase is noteworthy because it is the first significant increase over a year and puts the target in positive territory versus last year, forecasting a 10% upside in share prices.\nThe critical detail is that the revision trend leads to the high-end range of $165, a 75% increase and a new all-time high when reached.\nBefore you consider Chipotle Mexican Grill, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "3 Energy Stocks to Gain Exposure to the Carbon Capture Boom", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-energy-stocks-for-exposure-to-the-growing-carbon-capture-market/", "text": "As groups seek to combat the significant rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) on Earth, the carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) market is set to become an increasingly large part of the economy. Fortune Business Insights values the global CCS market at approximately $4.5 billion in 2025.\nBy 2032, the research firm expects this figure to move to around $14.5 billion. That would be more than a tripling of the market in just seven years. It also equates to a strong compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 18%.\nDue to this, investors have a significant opportunity to reap the rewards of this expanding market. A key avenue to potentially achieve this is through investments in publicly traded stocks that are building out their CCS capabilities. Below, we’ll dive into three stocks that are doing just that, offering investors a way to gain exposure to the CCS market.\nCalifornia Resources Eyes Hyperscale CCS Deals in Elk Hills\nCalifornia Resources Today\nCRCCalifornia Resources\n$48.26 +0.03 (+0.07%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $30.97\n▼\n$60.41 - Dividend Yield\n- 3.21%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 6.59\n- Price Target\n- $62.82\nFirst up is California Resources NYSE: CRC. The energy company primarily generates revenue by producing and selling oil and natural gas. However, the firm also has a first-of-its-kind project in California underway. Through its subsidiary Carbon TerraVault Holdings (CTV), the firm is pursuing the state’s first CCS project in Elk Hills, CA.\nThe project is also leading the nation. It is the first project in the United States that the Environmental Protection Agency has authorized to construct Class VI wells.\nThis is a significant milestone, as Class VI wells must meet strict requirements that show they can contain CO₂ underground for thousands of years. This demonstrates how California Resources is a CCS leader in the United States. The company expects to have the wells completed near the end of 2025 and to be able to start injecting CO₂ in early 2026.\nThus, this is not a far-flung opportunity for California Resources; CCS could become a revenue source soon. Adding to the intrigue is that California Resources hopes to announce a power generation and CCS deal with an artificial intelligence (AI) hyperscaler in 2025. This could be a significant positive catalyst for shares.\nBuffett-Backed OXY Looks to Get STRATOS Plant Online in 2025\nOccidental Petroleum Today\nOXYOccidental Petroleum\n$44.27 -0.34 (-0.76%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $34.78\n▼\n$58.47 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.17%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 26.20\n- Price Target\n- $53.43\nNext up is Occidental Petroleum NYSE: OXY. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns a significant stake in OXY, valued at approximately $13 billion as of March 31. Occidental is building a direct air capture (DAC) plant through its STRATOS project. The facility will pull CO₂ from the air and then store it underground. Importantly, STRATOS has also received Class VI well permits, and the site is on track to start capturing CO₂ in 2025.\nWhen OXY captures and stores CO₂, it will receive carbon dioxide removal (CDR) credits. Other companies looking to reduce their CO₂ emissions artificially can then buy these credits. Near-term, the revenues STRATOS could bring to Occidental might not be needle-moving.\nOXY generated more than $27 billion in sales over the last 12 months. However, the firm’s DAC strategy could become meaningful in the long term as it looks to build 100 DAC plants by 2035.\nXOM Gets Carbon Capture Operations Underway, Sees $4 Trillion CCS Market\nExxon Mobil Today\n$106.70 +0.21 (+0.20%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $97.80\n▼\n$126.34 - Dividend Yield\n- 3.71%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 15.16\n- Price Target\n- $125.84\nLast up is the most valuable energy stock in the United States, ExxonMobil NYSE: XOM. Notably, Exxon’s CCS business is already operational.\nThe company is capturing and storing carbon for a third party using its CO₂ transport and storage network that Exxon calls \"the world’s only large-scale system.\"\nExxon doesn’t say how much revenue it is generating from the project.\nHowever, the firm previously stated that it sees the CCS market growing to a massive $4 trillion by 2050.\nThis highlights the massive potential opportunity for all three of these firms.\nCRC, OXY, and XOM: Avenues for Carbon Capture Exposure\nThese three companies are making big moves to enter the CCS market. Thus, these names can expose investors to this market, which analysts expect to grow significantly over the coming years.\nStill, it is essential to note that no names represent CCS pure plays. They all have other significant parts of their business that will likely exert extensive influence on the movement in their stock prices for years to come.\nHowever, these businesses could significantly supplement their overall growth through CCS investments. This adds upside potential to these names in the long term, especially if their CCS growth manages to outpace that of the general CCS market.\nBefore you consider Occidental Petroleum, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Occidental Petroleum wasn't on the list.\nWhile Occidental Petroleum currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nWe are about to experience the greatest A.I. boom in stock market history...\nThanks to a pivotal economic catalyst, specific tech stocks will skyrocket just like they did during the \"dot com\" boom in the 1990s.\nThat’s why, we’ve hand-selected 7 tiny tech disruptor stocks positioned to surge.\n- The first pick is a tiny under-the-radar A.I. stock that's trading for just $3.00.

{"title": "The Midstream Energy Play That Keeps Powering Higher", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/the-midstream-energy-play-that-keeps-powering-higher/", "text": "Plains All American Pipeline Today\nPAAPlains All American Pipeline\n$17.49 -0.03 (-0.17%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $15.57\n▼\n$21.00 - Dividend Yield\n- 8.69%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 23.96\n- Price Target\n- $20.67\nEnergy has experienced a 0.85% loss, making it the second-worst performer among the 11 sectors of the S&P 500 this year. Much of that is attributable to the oil majors’ lackluster performances in 2025. ConocoPhillips NYSE: COP is down 6.17% and ExxonMobil NYSE: XOM is down 0.48%, while Phillips 66 NYSE: PSX and Chevron NYSE: CVX have uninspiring gains of 4.13% and 5.66%, respectively.\nThat soured the highly cyclical sector for many investors. But for those who understand the three stages of the petroleum value chain, the midstream segment still offers hope. Specifically, Houston-based Plains All American Pipeline NYSE: PAA, a master limited partnership (MLP) founded in 1981, should be on income investors’ radar.\nProduction Remains High Despite Surplus\nEnergy’s surplus carried into 2025. This year, the global oil supply could exceed demand by roughly 600,000 barrels per day. That’s likely to be compounded by OPEC output increases later this year, which should keep prices under pressure.\nCombined with ongoing geopolitical conflict, this has translated into trouble for upstream and downstream operators. Upstream companies are facing production declines from existing fields, while downstream companies are grappling with competition from renewables and fluctuating prices.\nWest Texas Intermediate crude is trading at $63.35 a barrel—down a steep 45% from its 2022 five-year peak of $116.15. Brent crude isn’t far behind at $66.38, marking a 44% drop from its own 2022 high of $118.67.\nBut for midstream companies, those factors are less impactful. And with production remaining near all-time highs, demand for storage and transportation is intact.\nBig Dividend Offsets Slow Q2\nPlains All American Pipeline Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 8.69%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $1.52\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 5 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 172.73%\n- Recent Dividend Payment\n- Aug. 14\nPAA Dividend History\nOn the surface, there’s been nothing extraordinary about PAA’s 3.12% year-to-date (YTD) gain. But like the energy industry in which it operates, much of its reward is beneath the surface. As an MLP, it must pay shareholders 90% of its income as dividends. For PAA, that dividend currently yields 8.51%, or $1.52 per share per year.\nThrough its subsidiaries, PAA transports, terminals, stores, and gathers crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) through pipelines in the United States and Canada. Those two segments, crude oil and NGL, have seen ups and downs over the past year, which resulted in a mixed bag when the company announced its Q2 earnings last week.\nBut shareholders still enjoyed EPS of 36 cents, which beat the consensus estimate of 33 cents. Quarterly revenue was down 16.6% year-over-year (YOY) and adjusted free cash flow (FCF) fell 16% YOY. But there was plenty of good to glean from the earnings call as well as the stock’s revised P/E ratio. On a trailing 12-month basis, the P/E was 24.47. Currently, it stands at an extremely attractive 12.54.\nFundamentals Remain Strong\nManagement confirmed full-year guidance of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion EBITDA. Drilling down into PAA’s Q2 financials shows plenty of positives:\n- Net cash from operating activities increased 6% YOY from $653 million to $694 million.\n- Diluted adjusted net income increased 16 YOY from 31 cents to 36 cents.\n- Dividend distribution increased 20% YOY from 31 cents to 38 cents.\nDespite FCF slipping from the year-ago quarter, that metric expanded dramatically over the past five years. During that timeframe, FCF increased by 58.50% from $776 million in 2020 to $1.87 billion in 2024.\nAt the same time, Plains All American Pipeline’s net income has ballooned 129.92%, from a loss of $2.58 billion in 2020 to a gain of $772 million in 2024. So while its Q2 results were a hodgepodge, the pipeline and storage operator’s long-term growth trajectory remains unimpaired.\nBolt-on Acquisitions Show PAA’s Growth Focus\nPerhaps the most interesting news from PAA’s Q2 earnings call was that it’s exiting its NGL segment in Canada, divesting its holdings for cash considerations of $3.75 billion, which is expected to close in Q1 2026. Those proceeds will be applied to M&A repurchases, which will build on the back of its July 22 acquisition of an additional 20% interest in BridgeTex Pipeline Company, bringing its total interest to 40%.\nThat M&A news likely played a large role in the company’s Q2 FCF contraction. According to PAA’s earnings presentation, the additional interest in BridgeTex is forecast for a return threshold of 13% to 15%, bringing its total bolt-on acquisitions from 2022 to 2025 to 15.\nAnalysts are looking beyond the mixed Q2 results, assigning an average 12-month price target of $20.75, or 16.18% upside from today’s price without factoring in PAA’s 8.51% yield.\nBefore you consider Plains All American Pipeline, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Plains All American Pipeline wasn't on the list.\nWhile Plains All American Pipeline currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nLearn the basics of options trading and how to use them to boost returns and manage risk with this free report from MarketBeat.

While a couple of companies in the United States are already testing their success in this manner, one Asian giant is ready to start expanding outside of China and into Europe over the next couple of years.\nThat company is Baidu Inc. NASDAQ: BIDU, which can be seen as China’s version of Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL because it controls a large part of the search engine market and is now expanding into robotaxis, much like Google’s Waymo.\nHowever, this expansion means Baidu will partner with ridesharing platforms Uber Technologies Inc. NYSE: UBER and Lyft Inc. NASDAQ: LYFT to make this happen, creating an opportunity for investors today.\n2 Ways to Play This Theme\nMost investors are reluctant to invest their capital in overseas stocks, particularly in China, where trust has declined over the past couple of years due to geopolitical tensions between Asia’s powerhouse and the United States. However, the fact that these American companies are now willing to partner up with Baidu should be a good initial sign.\nThat presents the first angle investors can take in this new robotaxi theme: investing directly into Baidu stock. Baidu stock offers a steep discount in the technology space compared to its American counterparts, especially as it trades at 78% of its 52-week highs, giving investors enough of a gap to be filled on the upside.\nKnowing that this discount is present in Baidu stock, some Wall Street analysts decided to give their own opinion about the stock and its future potential. While the consensus is set for a Hold rating valuing Baidu stock at $105.1 per share, Citigroup analyst Alicia Yap sees Baidu as a Buy with a $140 per share price tag.\nYap’s view implies that Baidu stock could rally 60% from its current price, effectively closing the gap to its 52-week high. However, this view does not at all factor in the robotaxi business expansion into European nations and how the market could seek to value this business in the future.\nThat is where the real upside may be found in this Chinese blue-chip name; however, for those still having a hard time believing in the China story, there are other ways to play this theme through Uber and Lyft.\nFor a Smooth Ride: Uber Delivers\nUber Technologies Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$102.829.51% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 40 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $93.89 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $119.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $102.82 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $78.00 |\n|---|\nUber Technologies Stock Forecast Details\nHaving a presence across Europe will help Uber in this transition. It will facilitate a smoother process for technology implementation and consumer adoption, given that consumers already trust the Uber brand but may not be familiar with Baidu’s robotaxis.\nIn this sense, investors can see Uber as the less volatile way to gain exposure to this theme.\nThe company has already landed a similar partnership within the United States with electric vehicle maker Lucid Group Inc. NASDAQ: LCID in its own rollout of autonomous robotaxis.\nWith this in mind, the real successful case study is found in Uber and its future expansion into the American and European robotaxi markets.\nThis could explain why those from the Vanguard Group decided to buy 1.6% more of the stock for their balance sheets, now holding $17.7 billion worth of Uber stock (or 9% of the entire company).\nLyft: High-Risk, High-Reward Play on Robotaxis and EU Expansion\nLyft Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$16.704.22% UpsideHoldBased on 32 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $16.02 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $28.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $16.70 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $10.50 |\n|---|\nLyft Stock Forecast Details\nNow, investors with a higher risk appetite can look to Lyft’s role in this entire situation. It has yet to land its first robotaxi collaboration in the United States, and its European presence has only just begun.\nAfter acquiring German rideshare platform FreeNow, Lyft’s operational capability is still in the early stages in Europe.\nHowever, that doesn’t mean the company can’t make a splash the way Uber is doing, after all, there must be a reason why Baidu (being such a giant) chose to go with both Uber and Lyft in the first place.\nSuppose investors believe Lyft can deliver on the expansion across Europe and also land an American robotaxi partnership. In that case, this is where the real upside lies.\nThis is also why the entire market is willing to pay a 57.8x price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the stock today, a steep premium compared to the 34.4x average P/E for internet services stocks. Smart investors know that markets always have a good reason to overpay for some stocks, and Lyft is justifying it with this story today.\nBefore you consider Baidu, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Baidu wasn't on the list.\nWhile Baidu currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nEnter your email address and we'll send you MarketBeat's guide to investing in 5G and which 5G stocks show the most promise.\nGet This Free Report\nLike this article?

{"title": "Green Dot's 30% Rally: Turnaround Takes Off on Explosive Earnings", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/green-dots-30-rally-turnaround-takes-off-on-explosive-earnings/", "text": "Green Dot Today\n$14.02 +0.74 (+5.53%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $6.12\n▼\n$14.27 - Price Target\n- $13.00\nA decisive move in the market often signals a fundamental shift in a company’s story. For Green Dot Corporation NYSE: GDOT, that moment arrived on Aug. 12, 2025, when its stock surged over 30% to a new 52-week high of $14.15. After a multi-year period of investor skepticism and stock price decline, this was a clear signal of change.\nThe move was backed by immense trading volume, more than four times its daily average, indicating firm conviction from financial sector investors. This spike was a direct reaction to Green Dot’s second-quarter financial report that decisively beat Wall Street's forecasts. The powerful results suggest that Green Dot’s long-term turnaround plan is no longer just a strategy on paper but one that is now delivering significant, tangible results.\nGreen Dot’s Breakout Quarter\nThe catalyst for the company’s dramatic repricing was a set of financial results that exceeded Green Dot’s analyst community’s expectations across the board. For the quarter, the company reported non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of 40 cents, a figure that was more than double the analyst consensus estimate of just 17 cents. This bottom-line outperformance was fueled by solid top-line growth, with non-GAAP revenues climbing 24% year-over-year to $501.2 million. The sheer scale of the platform’s activity was also on display, with Gross Dollar Volume (the total value of all transactions processed) reaching an impressive $38.5 billion.\nThe source of this strength is the key to understanding the company's future. The growth was not evenly distributed but was instead concentrated in its Business to Business (B2B) services segment, which saw revenues soar by an impressive 38%. This division is the heart of Green Dot’s turnaround strategy, powered by its Banking as a Service (BaaS) platform. In simple terms, Green Dot uses its banking license and technology infrastructure, known as Arc, to enable other major companies to offer their own branded financial products.\nRecent partnerships provide clear proof of this strategy's success:\n- A new collaboration with Samsung OTCMKTS: SSNLF for its Tap to Transfer feature is already generating impressive engagement.\n- A new partnership with Credit Sesame, a sizable consumer finance brand, was described as a competitive takeaway, showing Green Dot can win against rivals for major contracts.\nPerhaps the most potent signal of strength was management’s forward-looking statements. The company raised its full-year 2025 guidance for key profitability metrics, including Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. For investors, this upward revision signals strong internal confidence that the momentum seen in the second quarter is sustainable.\nHow Proactive Strategy Is Fueling the Turnaround\nWhile a single great quarter can excite the market, sustained investor confidence is built on a durable, long-term growth platform. Green Dot's management team appears focused on precisely that, taking clear steps to ensure the current success is repeatable and built on a solid foundation.\nA key part of this is the aggressive expansion of its partner pipeline. While a significant portion of its BaaS revenue comes from a single large partner, the company is actively diversifying. In 2025, Green Dot expects to launch seven new partners, a dramatic acceleration from just one new partner in 2024 and one in 2023. An upcoming launch with the prominent brand Crypto.com adds a modern, high-growth element to its portfolio, demonstrating that Green Dot’s platform can attract a wide array of fintech innovators.\nAt the same time, the company is solidifying its most critical legacy relationships. The second quarter’s GAAP Net Loss of $47 million was driven primarily by a one-time, non-cash equity charge of $70 million related to its partnership with Walmart NYSE: WMT. Rather than a recurring loss, this should be viewed as a strategic investment to secure a cornerstone retail relationship for the next seven years, ensuring a stable revenue base from which to grow.\nFinally, management is not just focused on revenue growth; it is also optimizing for profitability. The company has articulated a clear plan to improve its net interest income by deploying its significant cash holdings into higher-yielding assets expected to return between 5% and 7%. In a higher interest rate environment, this is a particularly timely and intelligent strategy for creating an additional, efficient stream of shareholder value.\nGreen Dot’s Compelling Case for a Second Look\nGreen Dot’s financial results have been met with validating endorsements from Wall Street. Following the earnings release, Northland Securities set a price target on Green Dot’s stock at $16.00, suggesting additional upside even after the recent surge. Overall, the stock maintains a Moderate Buy consensus rating among analysts covering the company, reflecting a generally positive but still watchful sentiment.\nGreen Dot Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$13.00-7.24% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 5 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $14.02 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $16.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $13.00 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $10.00 |\n|---|\nGreen Dot Stock Forecast Details\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Green Dot presents an interesting case. Even after its significant rally, the stock’s price remains below its accounting book value of $16.11 per share.\nA price-to-book ratio of less than one is a metric that often attracts the attention of value-focused investors, as it suggests the market may still be undervaluing the company's assets relative to its financial statements.\nFor investors, Green Dot has delivered its most convincing quarter in years. The results provide tangible proof that its strategic pivot to a B2B-led Banking as a Service model is not only working but accelerating.\nThe combination of impressive growth, a pipeline of new blue-chip partners, and a clear focus on profitability has created a compelling turnaround story that has rightfully captured Wall Street’s attention.\nMoving forward, the key will be the continued execution of this clearly defined and successful strategy.\nBefore you consider Green Dot, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Green Dot wasn't on the list.\nWhile Green Dot currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nWith the proliferation of data centers and electric vehicles, the electric grid will only get more strained.

{"title": "Is Whirlpool A Screamin’ Buy in 2025? Signs Say Yes", "url": "https://www.dividendstocks.com/articles/is-whirlpool-a-screamin-buy-in-2025-signs-say-yes/", "text": "Key Points\n- Whirlpool faces headwinds in 2025 but is well-positioned for a high-tariff environment long-term.\n- The dividend cut was priced into the market; technicals reveal potential for a bottom and eventual price reversal.\n- The short interest is rising quickly in 2025, but the institutions are buying, setting the market up for a squeeze, provided a catalyst emerges.\nWhirlpool (NYSE: WHR) continues to face headwinds in 2025, including the near-term impact of tariffs, but the indications are that it is a screaming buy this year. The near-term effect of tariffs is declining revenue, weakening margins, and reduced guidance tied to competitors' imported merchandise stockpiling.\nWhirlpool is a compelling buying opportunity because the market has already priced in its weaknesses, such as the upcoming dividend cut, and the long-term impact of tariffs is positive for this industrial stock.\nWhirlpool’s manufacturing footprint is more than 80% domestic, which positions it well for the new trade environment, regardless of where tariffs stand when the negotiations are finalized. The long-term outlook also includes eventual recovery in the housing market, a dynamic that can sustain growth, margin, and cash flow for decades once begun.\nThe takeaway for investors is that Whirlpool’s stock price appears to be at or near its bottom, and the long-term outlook is robust, providing an attractive risk-reward scenario. In this scenario, Whirlpool’s stock price could fall to long-term lows in the mid-$60s but will likely rebound into the high-$100 to low-$200 range over time and pay its dividend.\nWhirlpool: Dividend Cut Reflects Strategic Reset, Not Weakness\nWhirlpool’s dividend cut isn’t a factor that investors like to see, but it aligns with the company’s best interests and long-term outlook for price appreciation. The dividend was reduced by more than 50% to an annualized $3.60, which puts the payout ratio at roughly 50% of the earnings forecast and under 100% of free cash flow.\nAmong the critical details is that WHR is still a high-yielding stock, paying about 4% in mid-August, and can sustain this for the foreseeable future. Once business recovery takes hold, the dividend could be increased, providing an incentive to the market.\nMarketBeat’s analysts' sentiment data reveals trends that align with the market bottom. The post-Q2 release activity includes four revisions, many of which involve downgrades to Hold and equivalents and price target reductions.\nHowever, the consensus remains at Hold, with new targets aligning with the 2025 price action, providing a floor for the market. That floor is supported by the institutions that own more than 90% of the stock collectively and have been buying on balance all year.\nThe balance of institutional activity is noteworthy because the group bought in every quarter this year through mid-August, including the post-release period, netting $3.50 in shares for each sold.\nRisks Include Short-Sellers and the Balance Sheet\nWhirlpool’s risks include the short-sellers and the balance sheet. The short-sellers have been piling into this stock and capping gains. The July data shows interest rising by 40% to hit a long-term high of 21% and will likely remain high in 2025.\nThe offsetting factor is the institutions, which are buying robustly and setting the market up for a squeeze/short-covering rally, provided a catalyst emerges.\nWhirlpool’s balance sheet is healthy, but there are risks. The Q2 release highlighted reduced cash, increased inventory and total assets, offset by increased debt, total liability, and reduced equity.\nThe net result is that long-term debt leverage rose to 2.38x equity, a fortress-like quality, but it may continue to increase until the business recovery begins.\nWhirlpool’s Chart Action Indicates a Bottom Is Near\nWhirlpool’s 2022-2025 stock price decline is impressive, shedding nearly $200 or about 75%. The latest action has the market near long-term lows, which is significant because they align with the COVID-19 bottom and the onset of the 20212 housing market recovery, which is the likely bottom.\nThe potential for bottoming is evident in the summer 2025 rebound and volatility, characterized by increased volume and technical indicators that indicate bearish momentum has been played out, with oversold conditions prevailing across various time frames.\nThe price action may continue to move in a volatile fashion within the range, but a lower low is not expected.\nGet Income-Generating Stocks Like Whirlpool in Your Inbox.\nStop riding the roller coaster of the stock market and sign-up to receive DividendStocks.com's daily ex-dividend stocks and dividend investing news for WHR and related companies.\nCompanies Mentioned in This Article:| Company | Current Price | Price Change | Dividend Yield | P/E Ratio | Consensus Rating | Consensus Price Target |\n|---|\n| Whirlpool (WHR) | $88.17 | +0.0% | 7.94% | -33.27 | Hold | $98.83 |\nAbout Thomas Hughes\nExperience\nThomas Hughes has been a contributing writer for DividendStocks.com since 2019.\n- Professional Background: Thomas Hughes is the Managing Partner of Passive Market Intelligence LLC, a market research platform he launched in 2023 with the mission: “We watch the market so you don't have to.” He has worked as a blogger, stock market commentator, and independent analyst since 2010 and has been actively involved in trading and investing since 2005.\n- Credentials: He holds an Associate of Arts in Culinary Technology—training that honed his discipline, attention to detail, and ability to anticipate outcomes, all of which carry over into his work as a market analyst.\n- Finance Experience: Thomas has been writing about finance and investing since 2011, when he discovered it could be more than a personal passion—it could be a profession.

{"title": "Ethereum Near All-Time High: 3 Stocks Stacking ETH in Treasuries", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/ethereum-near-all-time-high-3-stocks-stacking-eth-in-treasuries/", "text": "Crypto is having a moment again, but the charge is being led by an unlikely source this time. Ethereum, not Bitcoin, is the catalyst for the rally this time, and crypto’s perennial bridesmaid is finally getting a ring from Wall Street. Thanks to a wave of enthusiasm from institutional investors, Ethereum has soared nearly 100% in the last month, and prices are creeping up toward new all-time highs.\nWhat’s behind this sudden rally? Ethereum has long been praised for its utility compared to Bitcoin, and public companies are starting to utilize it in pursuit of long-term gains. Firms like Strategy Inc. NASDAQ: MSTR have already demonstrated the potential of crypto treasury strategies, but investors are beginning to seek diversification away from Bitcoin as this space becomes crowded.\nEnter Ethereum, which offers yield in ways Bitcoin can’t, and these three companies are beginning to take notice.\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin: Crypto Strategies for Public Companies\nBearer bonds are a common comparison to BTC since tokens are dispensed to holders who claim all the spoils at a fixed rate.\n“To the owner goes the spoils” is undoubtedly a mantra Wall Street can adopt, and investors are willing to pay a premium for stocks with underlying crypto holdings. But while Bitcoin has been compared to digital gold, Ethereum is more like digital oil—fungible, malleable, and able to power a vast ecosystem.\nEther (ETH), the underlying token powering the Ethereum ecosystem, is a yield-bearing asset that offers companies ways of earning income besides just ‘number go up’.\nAccess to the Ethereum platform allows opportunities for staking, where tokens can be used as collateral for various interest-earning decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. The ability to earn yield through staking is a key difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum, at least in the eyes of Wall Street.\nCompanies filling their treasuries with ETH tokens surely won’t mind the price going up, but deploying these tokens through the ecosystem can deliver income to public companies without needing to sell.\nRegulatory clarity has also paved the way for Ethereum ETFs to begin trading, marking the first time investors have truly embraced a non-Bitcoin cryptocurrency.\n3 Stocks Utilizing Ethereum to Enhance Their Value\nOwning Bitcoin has turned a non-descript tech sector company like Strategy into practically a household name in just a few short years. Now these three companies are attempting to do the same with Ethereum. As excitement for crypto on Wall Street intensifies, it’s worth remembering that these tokens are still volatile assets with no real-world cash flows, and investors must understand the risks.\nCompanies stacking crypto in their treasuries tend to be just as volatile as the tokens themselves, so if you buy the ticket, be prepared to take the ride.\nSharpLink Gaming: New Hire Leads to New Highs\nSharplink Gaming Today\nSBETSharplink Gaming\n$20.12 +0.27 (+1.36%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $2.26\n▼\n$124.12\nJust a few years ago, SharpLink Gaming Inc. NASDAQ: SBET was a microcap sports betting platform with minimal revenue and profitability nowhere in sight. Today, it’s still not a profitable company, but its losses are narrowing (loss of 64 cents per share in its Q2 report), and it recently hired Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin to chair its board.\nSBET has an aggressive Ethereum strategy, planning to purchase more than $3 billion in tokens this year alone. The company’s ETH holdings already top $2.5 billion, and it's also aggressively raised capital, issuing another $400 million direct offering this month to purchase even more Ethereum. Owning a ton of Ethereum isn’t the strategy; Lubin’s decade of expertise on the platform can help SBET efficiently (and safely) deploy its holdings back into the ecosystem to earn yield.\nFundamental Global: Changing Tickers and Strategies\nFundamental Global Today\nFGFFundamental Global\n$18.94 -1.69 (-8.19%) As of 08/15/2025\n- 52-Week Range\n- $14.21\n▼\n$41.25 - P/E Ratio\n- 14.46\nFundamental Global Inc. NASDAQ: FGF is a fintech firm that is getting a facelift with its new directors and new strategy in cryptocurrency markets. It’s also changing tickers from FGF to FGNX and renaming itself FG Nexus. The company has brought on Ethereum experts Kyle Cerminara and Maja Vujinovic to its board and has initiated bold plans to purchase 10% of the existing Ethereum network.\nOwning 10% of the network will require a lot of capital, and FGNX has also been ambitious in its raises. The company recently closed a $200 million private round with crypto investment firms like Kraken and Galaxy Digital. Still, its primary goals are far larger: a $5 billion shelf offering with the proceeds used primarily for Ethereum purchases. Investors seem to approve as the stock has risen 100% in the last month.\nBitMine Immersion: An Original Bitcoin Stacker Changing Teams\nBitMine Immersion Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: BMNR started as a Bitcoin miner, but recently pivoted to Ethereum treasury accumulation with a team of new institutional investors like Cathy Wood and Peter Thiel. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee also chairs the company’s board of directors, giving it a wide range of digital currency expertise.\nBMNR has entered the Ethereum ecosystem as a whirlwind, sapping over one million tokens in just under a month. Its Ethereum holdings are closing in on $5 billion, making the company the third-largest public cryptocurrency treasury behind Strategy and Mara Digital Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: MARA. BitMine recently committed another $250 million to buy Ethereum, and plans to raise an additional $24 billion (!) for crypto purchases through equity offerings.\nBMNR’s stock has been cut in half since its $135 all-time high in July, but is still up over 600% year-to-date.\nBefore you consider BitMine Immersion Technologies, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Buffett’s Mystery Buy Revealed, and It’s a Big Bet on UNH", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/buffetts-mystery-buy-revealed-and-its-a-big-bet-on-unh/", "text": "UnitedHealth Group Today\nUNHUnitedHealth Group\n$308.84 +4.83 (+1.59%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $234.60\n▼\n$630.73 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.86%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 13.38\n- Price Target\n- $367.71\nThe long-running mystery around Warren Buffett’s latest stealth investment is finally over. In Berkshire Hathaway’s NYSE: BRK.B newest 13F filing, the Oracle of Omaha revealed a fresh stake in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated NYSE: UNH. Berkshire ended Q2 holding five million shares, valued at about $1.6 billion, a position it likely began building quietly in the prior quarter after requesting permission from regulators to accumulate shares without triggering a rush of buying.\nThe news sent UnitedHealth shares soaring more than 10% in after-hours trading on Thursday. While the choice might seem unexpected given the company’s battered reputation in 2025, it fits perfectly into Buffett’s playbook.\nSpecifically, the playbook of finding quality businesses that have been beaten down and scooping them up at bargain prices.\nA Contrarian Play in Troubled Waters\nUnitedHealth has been anything but a market darling this year. Shares were already down nearly 50% for 2025 before the filing was made public. The nation’s largest private health insurer has faced a storm of negative headlines, becoming a symbol of public frustration over rising healthcare costs.\nIn addition, the Justice Department is investigating Medicare billing practices, which has weighed heavily on the stock.\nThe troubles didn’t stop there. UnitedHealth pulled its annual earnings outlook in May, and CEO Andrew Witty stepped down shortly after. A new 2025 outlook released last month fell well short of Wall Street expectations, sending the stock tumbling even further. In other words, Buffett didn’t step into calm waters; he walked straight into a storm.\nBut that’s the thing about Buffett’s investing style. He often buys when sentiment is at its worst, knowing that quality businesses tend to survive turmoil and eventually recover.\nFor UnitedHealth, a company valued at roughly $250 billion and still holding its crown as America’s largest health insurer, the case may be that the market has overshot on pessimism.\nBuffett Isn’t Alone\nWhile Berkshire’s purchase is the headline grabber, other big names have also been quietly building positions. Michael Burry disclosed over $100 million in UNH call options, representing more than 18% of his portfolio. David Tepper picked up 2.27 million shares, while Renaissance Technologies added 1.35 million shares.\nWhen heavyweight super investors converge on a name like this, sentiment can shift fast.\nUnitedHealth still carries a Moderate Buy consensus rating from Wall Street analysts, but that could tilt more bullish now that Buffett’s name is attached. The average price target sits at $366.52, almost 30% above Thursday’s close.\nThat kind of upside potential, coupled with the backing of some of the market’s most respected investors, could be enough to flip the narrative from damaged stock to recovery story.\nDividend Strength and a Discounted Valuation\nUnitedHealth Group Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 2.86%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $8.84\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 15 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 38.30%\n- Next Dividend Payment\n- Sep. 23\nUNH Dividend History\nDespite its operational setbacks, UnitedHealth hasn’t wavered on rewarding shareholders. The company currently yields 3.25% and has an impressive 15-year record of dividend growth. With a payout ratio of just over 38%, those dividends look well-protected, a sign of both financial discipline and long-term commitment to shareholders.\nInstitutional investors haven’t abandoned ship. In fact, over the past 12 months, net inflows from institutions totaled $62.5 billion, compared to $43.34 billion in outflows. And that was before the most recent batch of 13F filings. Those figures will likely swell further now that Berkshire’s move is public knowledge.\nPerhaps most telling is the valuation. After this year’s steep sell-off, UnitedHealth trades at just 11.5 times projected 2027 earnings, well below its historical averages. For long-term investors, the market may be pricing in a worst-case scenario that is unlikely to materialize fully.\nWhy Buffett’s Bet Matters\nBuffett’s entry isn’t just a headline. It’s a potential turning point in how the market views UnitedHealth. His track record of identifying value in the middle of market overreactions is well-documented, and his willingness to commit $1.6 billion here speaks volumes. While UnitedHealth’s challenges are real, so is its scale, market share, and ability to adapt.\nIf history is any guide, Buffett’s move could mark the moment sentiment begins to shift, not just for UnitedHealth, but for the broader perception of investing in large-cap healthcare amid uncertainty.\nBefore you consider UnitedHealth Group, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Applied Materials' Knee-Jerk Sell-Off Is Your Signal to Buy", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/applied-materials-knee-jerk-sell-off-is-your-signal-to-buy/", "text": "Applied Materials Today\nAMATApplied Materials\n$163.53 +1.77 (+1.09%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $123.74\n▼\n$215.70 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.13%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 19.49\n- Price Target\n- $194.84\nApplied Materials NASDAQ: AMAT gave its market a reason to sell with its Q3 results. However, the 15% pre-market decline is a knee-jerk reaction to news that opens up a solid buying opportunity. The primary cause for the sell-off is weak guidance and uncertainty.\nThe critical takeaway is that this company’s business tends to be lumpy, ie, results can be iffy on a quarter-to-quarter basis due to timing and market dynamics, and end-market normalization is at hand in China.\nChina’s semiconductor market front-loaded its semiconductor equipment orders because of the tariff threat, but will soon return to steady growth. Until then, the remainder of the business is in healthy condition, the balance sheet is rock-solid, and the robust capital return is reliable.\nThe capital return is significant to investors and the long-term share price outlook because it includes dividends, share repurchases, and annual distribution growth.\nCapital Return and Balance Sheet Make AMAT a Buy\nThe outlook for distribution growth is robust with the company’s very low payout ratio and share repurchases. The repurchases are aggressive in F2025, reducing the count by 3.7% on average in Q3 and 2.8% year-to-date.\nThe distribution CAGR may slow from its current 15% in the upcoming years, but will likely remain strong at a double-digit level for the foreseeable future.\nThe pace of share repurchases in Q3 is also robust. The buyback was nearly double the prior year; the only risk is that it may slow in the upcoming quarters. However, share count reduction is significant at the pace of the prior year and is a benchmark for investors.\nThe critical takeaway is that, despite the tepid guidance, the long-term outlook and balance sheet strength suggest the capital returns will continue to be robust long into the future. Oh, and the dividend yields more than 1.0% annually with the shares trading near long-term lows.\nApplied Materials Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$194.8419.15% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 28 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $163.53 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $225.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $194.84 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $150.00 |\n|---|\nApplied Materials Stock Forecast Details\nThe balance sheet reflects the company’s aggressive share repurchase, with cash and current assets down and total assets flat compared to the prior year. However, the softness is offset by reduced current and total liability, flattish long-term debt, and a 2.6% increase in equity.\nThe net result is that leverage remains remarkably low, with long-term debt running just over one times the cash and total liabilities are less than equity, leaving the company in a fortress-like position.\nAnalysts' sentiment may weigh on the market in Q3, but a significant shift in the ratings is not anticipated. The consensus of 25 analysts tracked by MarketBeat is that this stock is a Moderate Buy, with a bullish bias, as 70% of them rate it at Buy or higher, and the consensus price target is firm near $205.\nWhen reached, the $205 target is a fresh long-term high and technical trigger. A move to new highs would confirm a reversal pattern in the stock and set the market up for a run to $250. The risk is that analysts will lower their price targets in Q3, capping gains until a catalyst emerges.\nApplied Materials Strong Q3 Overshadowed by Doubt\nApplied Materials had a strong Q3 with revenue of $7.3 billion, growing by 7.7% compared to the prior year. The gain was driven by a 10% increase in Semiconductor Systems, which was in turn led by the flash memory market. Services revenue was solid but produced no growth, while the Display market expanded by 5%.\nMargin is another area of strength, developing the gross and operating levels to drive accelerating bottom-line results. The $2.48 in adjusted earnings increased by 17%, outpacing the consensus estimate by 12 cents, but the strength is not expected to carry into Q4.\nThe problem for the market is the guidance. The company forecasted weaker-than-expected results for revenue and earnings but cited significant uncertainties and provided a wide margin of error.\nThe best-case scenario is that results will align or fall slightly short of the early-August consensus; the worst-case scenario is that Q4 results will miss by a high, double-digit figure, which is unlikely given the semiconductor industry dynamics.\nThe long-term outlook is robust, and guidance will likely be favorable. The latest reports reveal that more than 70 semiconductor fabrication facilities are being built globally, and 70% of them are brand new.\nBefore you consider Applied Materials, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

This massive wave of capital is flowing directly to the companies providing the essential equipment, and Arista Networks NYSE: ANET is proving to be a primary beneficiary.\nWith its stock already up over 24% year-to-date, the company's recent second-quarter financial results provided even more fuel, leading management to raise its full-year revenue growth forecast to an impressive 25%.\nThis strong performance reflected the company's deep integration into the AI ecosystem. Arista Networks operates like an indispensable tollbooth on the new AI superhighway. It provides the critical networking infrastructure that all AI traffic must pass through, allowing it to profit from the entire industry's growth, regardless of which AI models ultimately dominate.\nWhy AI Can't Run Without Arista\nTo understand Arista's crucial role, you must look beyond the AI chips capturing headlines. If GPUs are the brains of AI, Arista provides the high-speed nervous system that allows the brain to function. An AI data center is a supercomputer brain, and its performance depends entirely on the speed and reliability of the network connecting its components, much like a nervous system.\nThis is where Arista's technological leadership becomes a key customer economic advantage. The company is a leader in 400G and 800G Ethernet switches, which are the current industry standards required to handle the enormous datasets involved in training and running AI models.\nNetwork speed is a critical economic issue for AI operators; a slow or congested network means extremely expensive GPUs sit idle, wasting capital and energy. Arista’s low-latency hardware is designed to maximize the return on these multi-billion-dollar GPU investments.\nThe company’s most significant advantage, however, may be its software. The Arista Extensible Operating System (EOS®) is a key differentiator, providing a unified software platform across the company's hardware.\nFor customers building data centers at an unprecedented scale, this provides the reliability and automation needed to manage immense complexity, a crucial selling point for the world's largest cloud and AI players.\nTranslating AI Demand to Shareholder Value\nArista’s strategic position as the network provider for the AI era is translating directly into powerful financial results. The company's second-quarter 2025 earnings report provides clear, quantitative evidence of a business with accelerating momentum and a highly efficient operating model.\nThe performance underscores how demand for AI infrastructure is fueling significant growth and profitability.\nKey financial highlights from the quarter include:\n- Exceptional Revenue Growth: Arista reported Q2 revenue of $2.205 billion, a 30.4% increase compared to last year's quarter.\n- Beating Expectations: The company posted non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of 73 cents, comfortably exceeding the analyst consensus estimate of 65 cents.\n- A Confident Outlook: In a strong signal of confidence, management raised its full-year 2025 revenue growth forecast from a solid 17% to a stout 25%.\n- Tangible AI Contribution: CEO Jayshree Ullal provided a specific forecast during the second quarter earnings call, stating that aggregate AI-related networking revenue is expected to exceed $1.5 billion in 2025.\n- Record-Breaking Profitability: The company's non-GAAP operating income surpassed $1 billion for the first time, reaching an impressive operating margin of 48.8%. This demonstrates an elite level of efficiency and an ability to convert revenue into profit at scale.\nAll AI Roads Lead to Arista\nThe recent financial performance confirms that Arista's success is tied to the durable, multi-year trend of AI infrastructure spending. This makes the company a fundamental way to invest in the AI revolution. Yet, the growth story extends beyond the AI data center.\nThe company is actively expanding its toll road to capture more of the enterprise networking market.\nArista Networks Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$138.070.06% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 19 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $137.99 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $155.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $138.07 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $106.00 |\n|---|\nArista Networks Stock Forecast Details\nArista is showing increasing momentum in its enterprise business as large organizations upgrade their campus and office networks. The recent acquisition of VeloCloud from Broadcom NASDAQ: AVGO is a key strategic move to accelerate this push.\nBy integrating VeloCloud's leading SD-WAN technology, Arista can offer a comprehensive solution that securely connects a company's distributed branch offices to its central data centers and cloud applications. This positions Arista to compete for larger, more comprehensive enterprise deals in a market segment worth billions of dollars.\nWall Street has validated this strong execution and clear strategy. In the days following the Q2 earnings report, numerous analyst firms raised their price targets for the stock, signaling a growing belief in the company's long-term trajectory.\nFor investors seeking a data-backed holding that is essential to the entire AI ecosystem, Arista Networks presents a compelling case as a core infrastructure provider with clear avenues for future growth.\nBefore you consider Arista Networks, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Arista Networks wasn't on the list.\nWhile Arista Networks currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nWondering where to start (or end) with AI stocks?

{"title": "Microchip Technologies on Track for Macro Reversal and Rebound", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/microchip-technologies-on-track-for-macro-reversal-and-rebound/", "text": "Microchip Technology Today\nMCHPMicrochip Technology\n$65.56 -0.15 (-0.23%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $34.13\n▼\n$82.87 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.78%\n- Price Target\n- $76.58\nMicrochip Technologies NASDAQ: MCHP continues to face headwinds, including end-market inventory normalization, but the darkest days are behind it. The Q1 results and guidance outlook affirm what the Q4 F2024 results indicated: an industry-wide recovery was underway for semiconductors. The FQ1 2025 report's key takeaway is that recovery is stronger than initially expected and is likely to continue accelerating in the upcoming quarters. The only sticking point is that the FQ2 guidance aligned with the market’s expectations, which provided no catalyst for a rally in August.\nThe longer-term outlook is for sustained growth, driven by strengths in all end markets, and for margin recovery to continue. The margin recovery is critical, aligning with an outlook for sustained capital return. Microchip Technologies' dividend is an attractive payout at roughly a 2.8% annualized yield as of mid-August.\nThe payout comes with some risk, running well above the consensus forecast for adjusted earnings, but is backed up by robust and improving cash flow and balance sheet health.\nMicrochip Technologies' free cash flow was sufficient to cover the dividend payment in Q1. The margin was tight but sustainable given the outlook for growth and balance sheet health. The balance sheet highlights reduced cash, current, and total assets, but the declines are offset by reduced debt and liabilities, which left the equity down only 3%.\nAmong the critical details is that inventory was reduced by nearly $125 million, better aligning the company with industry demand and setting it up for profitable growth.\nAnalysts' Trends Align With Microchip Technologies' Price Reversal\nMicrochip Technology Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 2.78%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $1.82\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 23 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- -535.29%\n- Next Dividend Payment\n- Sep. 5\nMCHP Dividend History\nThe analysts' sentiment trends were a headwind for MCHP’s stock price earlier in 2025 but have shifted favorably following the Q1 release. The four revisions tracked by MarketBeat within the first week of the release include three price target increases and one decrease, with all citing margin improvements, inventory rationalization, and industry tailwinds as supportive for the market.\nThe market-moving detail from the analyst data is that the consensus price target, which had been trending lower, reversed course and increased relative to the prior quarter, providing some support for the market. The consensus forecasts a nearly 20% upside as of mid-August and will likely increase as the year progresses.\nThe Q1 results and guidance were positive despite lacking the oompf to catalyze a rally. The company reported $1.08 billion in net revenue, down 12.9% compared to last year but up nearly 11% sequentially and more than 100 basis points better than expected.\nExecutives are forecasting a 5% quarter-over-quarter increase, reducing the year-over-year decline to the low single digits. This suggests the business is close to returning to growth, which is expected to happen in Q3 and is likely to be strong.\nNot only are results growing sequentially, but the comps will be very easy, setting the business up to grow by double-digits in the second half of its fiscal year.\nMCHP Stock Price Reversal Is Underway\nThe price action in MCHP stock aligns with an outlook for a reversal. The price hit a long-term low earlier this year and then rebounded to exceed the long and short-term moving averages, setting the market up to complete a Head & Shoulders reversal.\nThe latest action shows this market retreating to test support at the 150-day EMA, which was confirmed the week after the release. The market for MCHP stock is forming the second shoulder in this scenario, set up to rebound and retest resistance at the neckline, which is near $75.\nA move to $75 aligns with the consensus price target, while a move above it puts this market back into an uptrend.\nBefore you consider Microchip Technology, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "3 Long-Term Dividend Buys You Can Get for Under $50", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-long-term-dividend-buys-you-can-get-for-under-50/", "text": "Despite ongoing concerns about overvalued stocks, many value investors sleep well at night. That’s because the key to long-term value investing is total return, which includes a healthy, growing dividend.\nIt also means having the discipline to do what doesn’t come naturally to many investors. That is, stepping away from their screens and letting the market do its work. That’s because many of these stocks are mature companies that won’t fog the mirrors of many financial news outlets.\nHowever, boring is beautiful when it counts. That’s what investors get by investing in these three high-yield dividend stocks that can still be purchased for less than $50 per share.\nPfizer’s Turnaround Is Taking Shape\nPfizer Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 6.86%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $1.72\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 16 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 91.49%\n- Next Dividend Payment\n- Sep. 2\nPFE Dividend History\nInvestors may be quick to note that Pfizer Inc. NYSE: PFE hasn’t been a great stock for value investors in the last five years, registering a negative 13% total return in that time. The decline in revenue and earnings from its vaccine-fueled peak in 2021 lent support to the claim that Pfizer was cheap for a reason.\nHowever, like many pharmaceutical stocks, it’s always helpful to look at the stock’s performance over a longer time period. Over a 10, 15, or 20-year period, PFE stock has delivered a strong total return to value investors. The company’s August 5 earnings report lends support to the idea that the company may be ready for the next wave of growth-producing drugs.\nPfizer beat revenue and earnings expectations and raised its full-year earnings per share (EPS) expectations. The gains were due largely to the company’s COVID-19 portfolio. However, the company’s future growth is supported by a diversified portfolio and a strong pipeline of new drugs and vaccines, notably in the emerging area of personalized medicine.\nThat’s pushed PFE stock up 1.4% since the earnings report. However, the consensus price of $28.12 gives investors 13% upside to go along with a high-yield dividend that currently has a 6.99% yield.\nSpending in 5G Is Paying Off For Value Investors\nVerizon Communications Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 6.11%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $2.71\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 20 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 63.17%\n- Recent Dividend Payment\n- Aug. 1\nVZ Dividend History\nVerizon Communications Inc. NYSE: VZ is another stock that’s had choppy performance in the last five years, delivering a total return of just over 1%.\nMuch of that was due to the company’s investment in 5G, which put pressure on earnings.\nThat expense is starting to pay off as 5G adoption becomes widespread. This delivers two things that value investors love to hear: recurring revenue growth and improved margins.\nBoth metrics were on display in the company’s second-quarter earnings report.\nVZ stock is up nearly 10% since the middle of July and is still trading in the middle of its 52-week range.\nAnalysts give Verizon stock approximately 10% more upside, which is in addition to the company’s safe dividend, which has increased for 20 consecutive years and has a 6.26% yield.\nA Cash Flow Machine Independent of Oil Prices\nKinder Morgan Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 4.46%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $1.17\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 1 Year\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 95.90%\n- Recent Dividend Payment\n- Aug. 15\nKMI Dividend History\nEnergy stocks have underperformed the market in the last five years, but Kinder Morgan Inc. NYSE: KMI has been a profitable exception. KMI stock has delivered a total return of approximately 152% in the last five years.\nThis is due to the company’s business model. The midstream oil company owns and operates a vast pipeline network spanning 83,000 miles throughout North America and Canada.\nThis includes both oil and natural gas, the latter of which is critical to meeting the power demands of data centers.\nKinder Morgan collects a fee to reserve capacity, ensuring a steady revenue stream that is independent of underlying oil and natural gas prices. It's that volume that contributes to the company’s earnings growth.\nMany analysts believe that oil and natural gas prices will move higher as the economy grows in the second half of 2025 and into 2026.\nThat growth supports analysts’ estimates for a 17% upside in KMI stock, along with a dividend yielding 4.4%.\nBefore you consider Kinder Morgan, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "How AEP Became a Critical AI Infrastructure Play", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/how-aep-became-a-critical-ai-infrastructure-play/", "text": "The computational power required to train and operate artificial intelligence (AI) models is creating an unprecedented and insatiable demand for electricity.\nAmerican Electric Power Today\nAEPAmerican Electric Power\n$110.70 -1.29 (-1.15%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $89.91\n▼\n$115.36 - Dividend Yield\n- 3.36%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 16.18\n- Price Target\n- $111.29\nAs tech leaders publicly sound the alarm on a potential energy shortfall, a new class of investment opportunities is emerging far from Silicon Valley.\nIt centers on the picks and shovels of the digital age: the foundational infrastructure that every AI company needs to function.\nAmerican Electric Power NASDAQ: AEP, a company historically known for its steady dividends and regulated operations, is positioning itself as an essential energy backbone for this technological revolution.\nIts stock is increasingly reflecting a new reality where the company provides a unique combination of utility sector stability and technology-driven growth.\nWhy Tech Giants Are Flocking to AEP's Backyard\nThe most compelling evidence of AEP's transformation lies in its customer growth. The company recently announced it has secured 24 gigawatts (GW) of new electricity load through firm, signed customer agreements, with the bulk of that power scheduled to come online by 2030. This is a significant increase from the 21 GW reported just a quarter earlier and is driven almost entirely by the data center boom.\nThis surge in demand is the result of a clear geographic shift. As established data center hubs like Northern Virginia’s Data Center Alley become saturated and expensive, tech hyperscalers are expanding into new territories. AEP’s service areas in Ohio, Indiana, and Texas have become a new frontier, offering affordable land and, most importantly, access to a powerful and reliable grid.\nAEP operates the nation's largest 765-kilovolt transmission network, a critical competitive advantage. This ultra-high-voltage system provides the immense capacity and stability required to handle modern data center campuses' heavy, concentrated power draws.\nTop-tier technology companies are validating this stage strategic advantage. AEP subsidiary Indiana Michigan Power recently filed a joint contract with Alphabet NASDAQ: GOOGL to support a new data center with a flexible demand-response structure.\nFurthermore, AEP’s partnership with Bloom Energy NYSE: BE allows it to offer on-site fuel cells as a bridge solution, getting customers online years faster than a traditional grid connection might allow. This flexibility makes AEP's territory a highly attractive destination for tech companies with urgent operational timelines.\nA $70 Billion Growth Engine\nSecuring 24 GW of new load requires a historic investment in infrastructure. In response, AEP has announced its intention to increase its five-year capital plan from $54 billion to approximately $70 billion.\nFor a company with a market capitalization of around $60 billion, this represents a monumental, company-defining investment that underscores the scale of the opportunity. This spending is not speculative; it is a direct and necessary reaction to secured customer demand.\nThe capital is strategically allocated to support this growth, with roughly 50% dedicated to transmission system upgrades and 40% to new power generation. This proactive investment strategy is already translating into strong financial results.\nFor the second quarter of 2025, AEP reported record operating earnings of $1.43 per share, a 14% year-over-year increase that comfortably beat analyst expectations. Citing this performance, the company announced it is now guiding toward the upper half of its full-year earnings forecast, signaling management's confidence in its growth trajectory.\nHow AEP Protects Its Profits\nA capital plan of this magnitude naturally raises investor questions about profitability and risk. AEP has been actively working with state regulators to implement financial frameworks that protect its investments and ensure this growth is profitable.\nA key achievement has been the establishment of hefty load tariffs in states like Ohio and Kentucky. These regulations ensure that new data center customers (not existing ratepayers) fund the significant cost of the new substations, power lines, and other infrastructure required to serve them. This directly de-risks the investment for AEP and its shareholders.\nIn Texas, another key growth market, the passage of a unified tracker mechanism streamlines the process for AEP to recover its capital investments. This new rule streamlines regulation by requiring a single annual filing instead of multiple, lengthy rate cases.\nThis change reduces regulatory delays and helps the company consistently achieve its authorized return on equity. These regulatory victories and proactive balance sheet management have established AEP's strong financial foundation as it commences this significant expansion.\nFrom Hold to Hot: The Market's New View on AEP\nAmerican Electric Power Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$111.290.53% UpsideHoldBased on 14 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $110.70 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $122.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $111.29 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $96.00 |\n|---|\nAmerican Electric Power Stock Forecast Details\nThe market is taking notice of AEP's strategic shift from a stable income play to a growth story.

{"title": "Elbit Systems Jumps on Record Earnings and a $1.6B Contract", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/elbit-systems-jumps-on-record-earnings-and-a-16b-contract/", "text": "A powerful combination of a landmark European contract and a blockbuster earnings report has propelled Elbit Systems NASDAQ: ESLT into the spotlight, validating the company's strategy and signaling robust financial health to the market.\nThe defense sector technology firm is successfully converting heightened global demand into significant financial performance and shareholder value, demonstrating powerful momentum.\nKey highlights from the recent developments include:\nElbit Systems Today\n$473.34 +9.34 (+2.01%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $188.53\n▼\n$494.32 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.42%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 53.73\n- Price Target\n- $500.00\n- Powerful Catalysts: Elbit Systems’ stock price climbed over 5% on August 13, propelled by the dual news of a new $1.635 billion European contract and a second-quarter earnings report that far surpassed analyst forecasts.\n- Exceptional Earnings: The company reported a non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $3.23, soundly beating the $2.57 consensus, as revenue grew an impressive 21% year-over-year to $1.97 billion.\n- Unprecedented Backlog: Elbit's order backlog swelled to a record $23.8 billion, providing multi-year visibility and a stable foundation for future revenue growth.\n- Rewarding Shareholders: In a show of confidence, the board raised the quarterly dividend by 25% to 75 cents per share.\n2 Catalysts, 1 Powerful Message\nTwo major news events ignited the jump in Elbit Systems’ stock. First, the company announced it had secured a substantial $1.635 billion contract with an unspecified European country. This five-year deal is significant not just for its size but also because it elevates Elbit’s role from a supplier of individual products to a prime systems integrator.\nThis means the company is responsible for weaving together a complex web of technologies, including Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), command and control software, and electronic warfare suites, into a cohesive defense network for its client. This is a higher-value, more strategically entrenched position in the defense market.\nThis announcement was immediately followed by the release of the company’s solid second-quarter 2025 financial results. The company posted revenue of $1.97 billion, a 21% increase from last year. Its non-GAAP EPS was up 55% to $3.23, surpassing the analyst consensus estimate of $2.57.\nThis powerful earnings beat provides tangible proof to investors that Elbit is not just winning contracts but is also executing on them with increasing profitability and efficiency.\nFrom Backlog to Balance Sheet\nThe foundation for Elbit’s future is its record order backlog, which now stands at $23.8 billion. An order backlog represents the total value of confirmed contracts awaiting fulfillment. To put this number in perspective, it translates to a backlog-to-revenue ratio of over 3.1x the company's last twelve months of sales.\nThis gives investors exceptional visibility, indicating that several years of revenue are already secured. Critically, 68% of these orders come from international customers, highlighting a successful diversification strategy that reduces dependence on any single country’s defense budget.\nThe company's growth is also broad-based, with strong performance across its key business segments in the second quarter:\n- Land Systems: Revenue increased by an impressive 45% year-over-year, driven by high demand for ammunition and advanced munitions.\n- C4I and Cyber: Revenue grew 21%, fueled by sales of modern command, control, and communications systems.\n- ISTAR and EW: Revenue was up 15%, showcasing the growing importance of advanced intelligence and electronic warfare solutions on the modern battlefield.\nThis operational success is paired with prudent financial management. The company’s Non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 8.9% in the second quarter, up from 8.0% a year ago. Elbit maintains a low debt-to-equity ratio (D/E) of just 0.09, indicating a resilient balance sheet further strengthened by a successful share offering in May that raised capital for production expansion.\nWhile the stock's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of approximately 58 suggests a premium valuation, this is contextualized by its exceptional growth. The company’s commitment to shareholders was reaffirmed with a 25% increase in the quarterly dividend, a clear signal from management of its confidence in sustained profitability and cash flow.\nWhy Elbit's Growth Story Has Room to Run\nElbit Systems Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$500.005.63% UpsideBuyBased on 1 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $473.34 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $500.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $500.00 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $500.00 |\n|---|\nElbit Systems Stock Forecast Details\nElbit Systems appears strategically positioned to capitalize on a favorable global environment. Rising defense budgets worldwide are creating sustained demand for the advanced technologies that form the core of Elbit's portfolio.\nThe company's glocal strategy (operating through a global network of local subsidiaries) is a key competitive advantage. A prime example is its U.S. subsidiary, Elbit Systems of America (ESA), which operates as an American company and is deeply integrated into the U.S. defense industrial base.\nThis model helps mitigate geopolitical risk and builds local trust to win significant contracts in key markets.\nThe potent combination of a massive order book, accelerating profitability, and a clear strategic vision paints a compelling picture for investors.

{"title": "How Did Peter Thiel-Backed Crypto Exchange Bullish's IPO Go?", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/how-did-peter-thiel-backed-crypto-exchange-bullishs-ipo-go/", "text": "It’s been a good year for the financials sector. Between President Trump’s deregulatory platform and the anticipation of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates at its September meeting, financials have put together a strong performance. Its 8.55% year-to-date gain ranks fifth among all 11 sectors of the S&P 500. But that corner of the market is no longer reserved for banks, asset management companies, or payment processors.\nThe Trump administration has been equally bullish for crypto. Since Inauguration Day, Bitcoin (BTC) is up 20.10%, XRP (XRP) is up 44.05%, and Ethereum (ETH) is up 48.33%. And with the crypto industry no longer in its infancy, investors are now afforded opportunities to gain exposure beyond hot and cold wallets.\nFrom spot ETFs like the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF NASDAQ: IBIT to publicly traded centralized exchanges like Coinbase NASDAQ: COIN, crypto-themed investment vehicles are available via the traditional equities market.\nThe latest opportunity came this week as Peter Thiel-backed Bullish NYSE: BLSH had its IPO on Aug. 6. The owner of CoinDesk will also provide a crypto exchange, serving as a competitor to Coinbase and Kraken (slated for its own IPO in 2026). When Bullish debuted at $37 on the NYSE on Wednesday morning, Aug. 13, shares reached $118 in intraday trading before settling with a single-day gain of 88.81% by the close, nearly doubling their IPO price tag.\nFor speculative investors looking to add crypto exposure to their equity portfolios, it might be time to consider being bullish on Bullish.\nWhy Peter Thiel’s Involvement Is a Big Deal\nWhile 2025 has seen other crypto-themed IPOs with mixed success, those companies haven’t had the hype or name recognition Bullish has. eToro NASDAQ: ETOR went public on May 14 to far less fanfare. The stock is down over 25% since. Two days later, Galaxy Digital NASDAQ: GLXY IPO’ed. The stock’s up 52% since, but insiders have vacated shares to the tune of $186.22 million versus $0 in insider buying. Ditto for Circle Internet Group NYSE: CRCL, which went public on June 5. Circle’s up 42.21%, but insiders have offloaded $195.81 million versus $0 of insider buying.\nOf course, when companies have IPOs, early investors routinely cash in to take advantage of momentum and media attention. But what does Bullish bring to the table that those companies did not? The answer: Peter Thiel, cofounder of PayPal NASDAQ: PYPL, who served as its CEO until the fintech startup was sold to eBay NASDAQ: EBAY for $1.5 billion in 2002.\nIn 2003, Thiel co-founded this year’s hottest stock, Palantir NASDAQ: PLTR. He served as its first chairman and continues to serve as a board member. He was also the first person to invest outside money in Facebook, and was an early investor in LinkedIn, Affirm NASDAQ: AFRM, Airbnb NASDAQ: ABNB, Asana NYSE: ASAN, Lyft NASDAQ: LYFT, Reddit NYSE: RDDT, SoFi Technologies NASDAQ: SOFI, SpaceX, Stripe, Yelp NYSE: YELP, and Words with Friends creator Zynga among a dozen other startups.\nAs of late, his attention has shifted to Bullish. After one failed attempt to go public in 2022 via an SPAC merger, Thiel sought to achieve a $4.82 billion valuation through Bullish’s now-successful 2025 IPO.\nHow Bullish Differentiates Itself From Coinbase and Kraken\nSince the crypto platform’s launch in 2021, Bullish has surpassed $1.25 trillion in trading volume, with an average daily volume of $2.6 billion, with trading volume in Q1 increasing by 78% from the year-ago quarter. That daily volume is ahead of both Coinbase and Kraken.\nBullish CEO Tom Farley is the former president of the NYSE, which may have contributed to the company’s focus on a particular breed of investor, as well as its listing on the NYSE rather than the NASDAQ. According to its SEC Form F-1 filing, Bullish is an \"institutionally focused global digital asset platform focused on providing market infrastructure and information services…to provide mission-critical products and services that are designed to help institutions grow their businesses.”\nCoinbase and Kraken, both of which cater to retail investors, have carved their niches in the centralized crypto exchange industry. But with Bullish focusing on large institutional clients, it has emphasized a tailored platform offering derivatives, margin trading, and spot trading, as well as a focus on security and compliance.\nBased on its SEC filing, Bullish recorded adjusted EBITDA of $52 million and $13 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, and for Q1 2025, respectively. Adjusted net income was $10 million and $2 million, respectively. Of course, flush with IPO cash, those numbers should rapidly expand in the years ahead. Speculative investors should take note.\nBefore you consider iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Is Reddit Stock Too Hot, or Just Right?", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/is-reddit-stock-too-hot-or-just-right/", "text": "Reddit Today\n$241.76 -4.74 (-1.92%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $52.39\n▼\n$253.14 - P/E Ratio\n- 219.78\n- Price Target\n- $171.83\nAfter spending much of the spring under significant selling pressure, shares of Reddit Inc. NYSE: RDDT have been roaring back in some style. The stock has climbed more than 50% in just over two weeks, breaking free of its prior trading range and cruising into all-time highs.\nIt's a remarkable reversal for a stock that only went public last year. It then promptly collapsed 65% between February and April, leading to many on Wall Street dismissing it as just another over-hyped IPO.\nThe spark for this resurgence came on the last day of July, when Reddit posted a blistering Q2 earnings report that crushed expectations across the board. Since then, the rally has been one-way traffic, with the stock posting gain after gain and leaving short sellers scrambling for cover.\nFor the bulls, it's vindication; for the bears, it's become a nightmare.\nThe RSI Warning Light\nStill, even the most optimistic traders know that no rally goes straight up forever. One technical reading that's hard to ignore right now is the popular Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI measures the speed and magnitude of recent price moves on a scale of 0 to 100, helping traders gauge whether a stock is overbought or oversold.\nReadings above 70 typically signal overbought conditions. Above 80, they're considered extremely overbought and in the kind of territory that often precedes a pullback.\nAs of Thursday's close, Reddit's RSI was a scorching 87. That number alone doesn't mean the stock is about to reverse, but it does raise the probability that a period of consolidation or profit-taking is near.\nThursday's 3.7% gain pushed the RSI even higher, underscoring just how overheated the stock has become. For seasoned traders, this is a yellow flag, if not one that's starting to show shades of red. It's not exactly a reason to sell and walk away, but at the very least, it's a signal to watch the stock closely for signs of fatigue.\nFundamentals Are on Fire\nThe temptation to look past technical caution flags is understandable given the strength of Reddit's fundamentals. The recent report showed revenue surging 77% year-over-year, coming in well ahead of consensus expectations, while EPS landed 136% higher than analysts had forecast.\nThere were plenty of more bright spots, like gross margin expanding to almost 91% and free cash flow jumping to $111 million from just $28 million in the same quarter last year. For a platform still proving its monetization model to Wall Street, these numbers signal that it's finding multiple levers for growth and profitability.\nIt's the kind of report that forces even skeptics to reassess their stance. And it makes the 65% drawdown from earlier this year look, in hindsight, like one of the more glaring mispricings of 2025.\nAnalysts Take Sides\nAdding fuel to the fire is the fact that the earnings beat prompted a fresh wave of bullish analyst commentary on Reddit's prospects. The teams over at Wolfe Research, Raymond James, and Guggenheim have all issued Buy or equivalent ratings in recent weeks, highlighting Reddit's accelerating revenue growth and rising user engagement.\nBut that being said, not everyone is chasing the stock higher. Both Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase maintained Neutral ratings after the report and urged caution. The stock's ongoing rally has already pushed it above even the most optimistic price targets from the bull camp, supporting the case that Reddit shares have, for now at least, lost the run of themselves.\nThe Profit-Taking Setup\nReddit Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$171.83-28.92% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 25 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $241.76 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $250.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $171.83 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $75.00 |\n|---|\nReddit Stock Forecast Details\nWith shares now well into blue-sky territory and RSI flashing an extreme reading, the setup for profit-taking is pretty clear. Momentum traders who bought in during the July breakout have substantial gains to lock in, and even a minor dip in broader market sentiment could trigger some quick selling.\nBut for long-term investors, such a pullback should be viewed as an opportunity rather than a threat. The combination of a strong balance sheet, robust free cash flow, and double-digit revenue growth gives Reddit plenty of ammunition to keep expanding.\nDon't forget, Reddit shares have been here before. After their earnings report last October, the stock popped more than 50%, sending its RSI up to 88%. This was followed by a swift 10% dip that was mostly profit-taking before shares again turned north.\nThat time, they didn't stop until they'd gained more than 100%, so don't be surprised if something similar happens this time around.\nBefore you consider Reddit, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

The company's stock was up over 25% in a single session after the company reported strong fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2025 results. The rally was ignited by adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 47 cents, which more than doubled the 21-cent analyst consensus and signaled a profound operational shift within the company.\nInvestors' dramatic re-rating demands a closer look at the fundamental improvements driving Mercury Systems and whether it is now positioned to lead a new wave of growth in the critical aerospace and defense industry.\nHow Record Results Forged a New Narrative\nMercury System’s stock price performance was the direct result of tangible achievements in Mercury's core business.\nThe company’s latest financial report provides a clear blueprint for a successful turnaround, built on strengthening demand and newfound operational discipline that flows directly to the bottom line.\nBuilding the Foundation: From Record Demand to Future Revenue\nA key forward-looking indicator for any business is its ability to secure future work, and Mercury delivered decisively on this front. The company reported a book-to-bill ratio of 1.25 for the quarter. For investors, this metric is crucial; a ratio above 1.0 indicates that demand is growing faster than current sales.\nA figure as strong as 1.25 suggests demand is accelerating, building a strong pipeline for future revenue.\nThis surge in new orders culminated in a record-setting backlog of $1.40 billion, up 6% from the prior year. With a significant $807.8 million of this backlog expected to convert into revenue within the next 12 months, Mercury has established a stable and predictable foundation for growth, significantly reducing uncertainty for investors.\nThe Bottom Line: Turning Growth Into Profit and Cash\nPerhaps the most compelling evidence of Mercury's turnaround lies in its profitability. The company reported a full-year adjusted EBITDA of $119.4 million, a monumental increase from just $9.4 million in fiscal 2024.\nThis turnaround demonstrates that management’s strategic focus on efficiency and cost control is unlocking significant value. The fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin hit 18.8%, a substantial improvement that shows the company is becoming more efficient at turning every dollar of revenue into profit.\nJust as important, this profitability is converting into real cash. Mercury generated a record $119.0 million in free cash flow for the year, a dramatic reversal from the $26.1 million generated in fiscal 2024.\nThe company uses this cash to fortify its financial position by paying down debt to its lowest net level since 2022, giving it greater flexibility to fund future innovation and growth from its operations.\nWall Street Follows the Fundamentals\nMercury Systems Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$60.71-9.11% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 8 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $66.80 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $80.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $60.71 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $39.00 |\n|---|\nMercury Systems Stock Forecast Details\nThe market's enthusiastic response was amplified by a wave of endorsements from Mercury’s analyst community, who serve as a key third-party validator for the company's prospects. Following the earnings release, several investment firms swiftly raised their price targets for Mercury's stock.\nRaymond James led the charge, upgrading the stock to Strong Buy and increasing its price target to an ambitious $80 per share. Other key firms followed suit, with Truist Financial raising its target to $71 and Robert W. Baird raising it to $70.\nThis broad-based support from market experts suggests a consensus view that the company's operational improvements are sustainable.\nIn its report, Mercury's management provided initial guidance for low-single-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2026. While this may seem conservative after a strong year, it reflects prudent and strategic planning.\nThis forecast accounts for two key factors: an approximate $30 million in revenue that was accelerated from 2026 into the recently reported quarter, and a deliberate plan to use factory capacity to complete older, lower-margin contracts.\nBy clearing this legacy work, Mercury improves the overall health of its backlog and sets a credible (and likely beatable) performance bar for the year ahead.\nMomentum Built on Fundamentals\nMercury Systems' recent stock performance was a market re-evaluation based on undeniable proof of a successful turnaround. The company has demonstrated an apparent ability to capture rising demand in the defense sector, evidenced by its record backlog.\nMore importantly, its leadership team has proven it can translate that demand into remarkable profitability and cash flow. Mercury Systems has established a robust trajectory with a revitalized balance sheet and a clear strategy.\nFor investors seeking growth backed by solid execution in the high-priority defense technology space, the company now presents a compelling and data-supported opportunity.\nBefore you consider Mercury Systems, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Nuclear Reactors on the Moon? Why BWX Technologies Is Soaring", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/nuclear-reactors-on-the-moon-why-bwx-technologies-is-soaring/", "text": "Nuclear energy stocks have been all the rage recently. Demonstrating this is the return of the VanEck Uranium and Nuclear ETF NYSEARCA: NLR. As of the Aug. 12 close, NLR has provided a total return of 65% over the past 52 weeks and 128% over the past three years.\nBWX Technologies Today\nBWXTBWX Technologies\n$171.11 -2.39 (-1.38%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $84.21\n▼\n$189.25 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.58%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 53.47\n- Price Target\n- $154.51\nRegarding individual nuclear stocks, most of the headlines have revolved around leaders like Constellation Energy NASDAQ: CEG and low-to-no revenue names like NuScale Power NYSE: SMR. However, one stock hasn’t gotten the fanfare it deserves until now. That stock is BWX Technologies NYSE: BWXT, with its 62% return in 2025.\nThe firm’s strong Q2 earnings report helped shares soar over 18% on Aug. 5.\nHowever, this wasn’t the only reason for the stock’s huge gain and certainly wasn’t what got the attention of many market observers. Headlines around BWX came courtesy of Sean Duffy, the United States' Acting NASA Administrator.\nHe wants to put nuclear reactors on the Moon. Below, we’ll discuss the news that helped BWX shares take off and provide an outlook on the stock.\nImpressive Earnings, Duffy’s Lunar Ambitions Ignite BWX Shares\nOn Aug. 4, BWX’s Q2 earnings came in very strong, with the firm significantly beating Wall Street expectations on sales and adjusted earnings per share. The company also increased its full-year 2025 guidance on both figures. Surely, this strong release was a significant reason the company’s stock performed very well the next day.\nHowever, Sean Duffy’s comments added to the rally that he wants to see a nuclear reactor on the Moon’s surface by 2030. Per Space.com, Duffy wants the United States to establish a sustained human presence on the Moon.\nHe said, \"To have a base on the Moon, we need energy.\" He called fission technology, a type of nuclear technology, “critically important” to that goal. Overall, he stated that the administration is going to move beyond studying nuclear energy on the Moon to making it a reality.\nHe also confirmed rumors that the government wants to put a 100-kilowatt reactor on the Moon. However, with many nuclear energy companies in the United States, why is there a particular focus on BWX regarding this news?\nBWX Already Works With NASA; Investors Believe It Will Continue To\nBWX works closely with the U.S. government. Its Government Operations segment, which primarily makes nuclear propulsion systems for naval ships, generated 77% of BWX’s total revenue in Q2.\nHowever, tucked away at the bottom of the company’s description of its government business is likely what is generating significant interest around this name in light of Duffy’s comments. The company says it is “a leader in the development of advanced nuclear reactors for a variety of power and propulsion applications in the space and terrestrial domains.\"\nIt goes on to specifically list NASA as one of its customers in this area. The company also struck an $18.8 million deal with NASA in 2017.\nThese pieces of information indicate an existing relationship between NASA and BWX. Therefore, investors seem to believe that BWX could be a leading candidate to supply NASA with a lunar nuclear reactor.\nBWX’s Outlook: Analysts See Downside, But Moon Reactors Offer Long-Term Potential\nDespite this interesting news surrounding BWX, Wall Street analysts are decidedly bearish on the stock after its recent surge. The MarketBeat consensus price target on BWX is just over $142, implying a nearly 21% downside versus the stock’s Aug. 12 closing price.\nBWX Technologies Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$154.51-9.70% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 9 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $171.11 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $220.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $154.51 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $105.00 |\n|---|\nBWX Technologies Stock Forecast Details\nTruist Financial boosted its price target from $115 to $145 after the company’s latest earnings and Duffy’s statements. However, this figure still implies a significant downside.\nHowever, it is essential to remember that Wall Street only forecasts 12 months out. BWX’s potential opportunity in Moon reactors extends years and decades beyond this. It is possible that the market is considering this to justify the stock’s current valuation.\nDuffy indicated ambitions to extend the human presence to the Moon and Mars. This could require much more than the 100-kilowatt lunar reactor the government is pursuing, potentially offering BWX a big long-term opportunity.\nStill, BWX has not confirmed any Moon reactor deals. At this point, it is hard to say that Duffy’s comments add more than speculative upside to BWX shares.\nHowever, the announcement of a new NASA-BWX deal would change this. Considering Duffy’s comments and the company’s relationship with NASA, it is not unrealistic to think that this could occur.\nBefore you consider BWX Technologies, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Palantir’s Soaring Valuation—Justified or Overhyped?", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/palantirs-soaring-valuationjustified-or-overhyped/", "text": "Any analysis of Palantir Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: PLTR inevitably returns to valuation. Investors are told that fundamentals matter, and then they look at what’s going on with PLTR stock. It’s the top-performing stock in the S&P 500, soaring to a new all-time high since the company reported earnings on August 4.\nPalantir Technologies Today\nPLTRPalantir Technologies\n$174.03 -3.14 (-1.77%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $29.31\n▼\n$190.00 - P/E Ratio\n- 580.12\n- Price Target\n- $136.61\nPalantir had a strong report, with one of the highlights being its Rule of 40 score, which came in at an eye-popping 94%. That went along with revenue and earnings that came in above estimates, higher year-over-year (YOY), and bullish forward guidance.\nThe company is also showing strong growth in its business's commercial and government sides.\nStill, it’s hard to consider getting involved with PLTR stock when it’s trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio around 616x and a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio around 150x. Even for technology stocks that are known for premium valuations, a share price over $184 means investors are paying a lot for the company’s future earnings.\nBut what if conventional metrics don’t tell the whole story? In a digital-first economy, the traditional tools for valuing companies, especially GAAP-based accounting, can systematically understate the long-term earnings power of businesses like Palantir.\nWhy This Time May Be Different\nIt’s always dangerous to contradict years of market history with the phrase “this time it’s different.” However, you can look back to the dot-com era and Amazon, or more recently to NVIDIA, to find examples of companies that traded at lofty valuations until their revenue models matured and earnings caught up.\nAs those examples showed, many classic accounting measures and regulations were designed for an agrarian and/or industrial economy. Those rules don’t correlate easily to the digital economy.\nFor example, Palantir’s most significant assets include its proprietary software, artificial intelligence models (LLMs), and a platform that’s baked into how customers run their operations. But these don’t show up on the company’s balance sheet. Instead, in a digital economy, they get booked as expenses immediately. That comes at the expense of current profits, which inflates the company’s P/E ratio.\nPalantir’s growth is still in the early stages. Despite another quarter with over 100 new contracts signed, the company’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is still early in the adoption phase.\nChief Executive Officer (CEO) Alex Karp quipped that the company may have to turn away business if the demand is so strong.\nThat's not likely, but it does add credibility to the fact that the company has rapid growth potential. For example, Palantir earned 31 cents per share (EPS) in its fiscal year (FY) 2024. Through the first two quarters of FY2025, it’s already delivered 29 cents in EPS. At that pace, EPS will nearly double year-over-year (YOY). That would bring the P/E ratio down sharply even if the stock price doesn’t change.\nThe Bears Have a Case\nPalantir Technologies Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$136.61-21.50% DownsideHoldBased on 23 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $174.03 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $200.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $136.61 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $45.00 |\n|---|\nPalantir Technologies Stock Forecast Details\nEven if you believe that Palantir’s value goes beyond traditional metrics, there are reasons for concern. The company reported 48% YOY revenue growth in the current quarter. However, the company would have to keep up that growth over an extended period to justify the valuation. Statistical probability suggests that some regression is likely.\nAlso, although the company’s commercial business is expanding, Palantir still generates over 50% of its revenue from government contracts. Bulls will say Palantir has become the government's operating system. However, it’s fair to note that government deals can be vulnerable to budget changes.\nAnd then there’s the question of stock-based compensation (SBC). But it’s not for the reason some investors may think. One element of Palantir’s Rule of 40 score is based on its adjusted operating margin, which adds back non-cash expenses such as SBC.\nThe counterargument would be that, as the Palantir stock price continues to climb, SBC may not be as attractive a tool for recruiting talent. Plus, Palantir is actively seeking to cut its workforce.\nChasing PLTR Stock? The Choice is Yours\nPalantir is priced for perfection—or for a future in which perfection is within reach. However, even if you overlook Palantir’s lofty valuation, it may be too expensive for many investors.\nNew investors can consider a starter position. This means making a small allocation and scaling it higher if the company continues to display strong execution.\nHowever, this is only for investors with a long time horizon who can handle volatility. Many retail investors holding PLTR stock are doing so with a long-term focus. The belief is that Palantir’s growth is measured in years, not quarters.\nFinally, no matter the size of your position, investors should continue to expect volatility. PTLR stock dropped 40% between February and April when investor sentiment towards the AI trade soured. Dips like that are likely, with a stock that is priced for perfection.\nBefore you consider Palantir Technologies, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Palantir Technologies wasn't on the list.\nWhile Palantir Technologies currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nJust getting into the stock market?

{"title": "Century Aluminum: A Premier Stock for the Industrial Resurgence", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/century-aluminum-a-premier-stock-for-the-industrial-resurgence/", "text": "Century Aluminum Today\nCENXCentury Aluminum\n$22.31 -0.95 (-4.08%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $11.63\n▼\n$25.39 - P/E Ratio\n- 19.23\n- Price Target\n- $24.67\nA powerful shift in U.S. industrial sector policy is creating a uniquely profitable environment for domestic manufacturers, and few companies are as directly positioned to benefit as Century Aluminum NASDAQ: CENX. The company’s stock has gained over 60% in the last year, signaling that investors are taking note of its unique strategic advantages.\nWhile the global aluminum market remains cyclical, multiple favorable factors in Century Aluminum’s home market have put the company in an enviable position. For investors seeking direct exposure to the American onshoring trend, Century Aluminum presents a compelling set of catalysts that translate directly to its bottom line and growth plans.\nThe One-Two Punch: Soaring Premiums and a Smelter Restart\nThe primary catalyst driving Century’s current success is a fundamental change in its pricing environment, brought on by U.S. trade policy. In June 2025, Section 232 tariffs on aluminum imports were increased to 50%. This move makes foreign metal significantly more expensive, providing a substantial advantage to domestic producers who can sell their products without this levy.\nThis policy has directly and sequentially impacted a key component of Century's revenue: the U.S. Midwest premium. This premium functions as a regional delivery surcharge on top of the global aluminum price, and with foreign supply now more costly, it has surged.\nThe financial impact of this is visible in the company's guidance. For the third quarter of 2025, Century issued an optimistic forecast for Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $115 million to $125 million. Management explicitly linked this strong earnings projection to the benefits of higher domestic premiums, offering clear evidence of the policy's effect on profitability.\nCentury is actively reinvesting to meet the growing demand for domestically sourced aluminum. This is especially critical for national security, as high-purity primary aluminum is an essential, unsubstitutable input for military aircraft and advanced defense systems.\nIn a direct response to the favorable market, the company announced an approximate $50 million investment in August to restart the remaining idled capacity at its Mt. Holly, South Carolina, smelter. This project is set to achieve several key objectives:\n- Bring the plant to full production by mid-2026 for the first time since 2015.\n- Create over 100 new, high-wage manufacturing jobs, with an estimated annual economic impact of over $890 million in the state.\n- Increase total U.S. primary aluminum production by nearly 10%.\nThis strategic move, which increases the company's future revenue-generating capacity, demonstrates how Century is converting a favorable policy environment into tangible, long-term growth.\nHow Century Is De-Risking Growth\nA compelling growth story requires a solid financial foundation, and Century's management has taken decisive steps to strengthen its balance sheet. In July 2025, the company successfully refinanced $400 million of its senior notes.\nFor investors, this move achieves two important goals: it lowers annual interest payments, which directly benefits net income, and it extends the company's debt maturity out to 2032, providing significant financial flexibility and reducing near-term risk.\nCentury Aluminum Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$24.6710.56% UpsideBuyBased on 3 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $22.31 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $27.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $24.67 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $22.00 |\n|---|\nCentury Aluminum Stock Forecast Details\nThis financial stability supports an ambitious long-term vision. Century is advancing a plan to build a new, low-emission U.S. smelter, a project selected for up to $500 million in potential funding from the Department of Energy. If realized, this would be a transformational development.\nIt would not only represent the first new U.S. smelter in nearly 50 years. Still, it would also position Century as a leader in producing modern, low-carbon green aluminum, a product commanding a premium from customers in the automotive and renewable energy sectors.\nFinancial professionals also share this positive outlook. Century Aluminum’s analyst community holds a consensus Buy rating on the company’s stock. Following the recent positive developments, B. Riley raised its price target to $25, while Wolfe Research holds an Outperform rating with a $27 target.\nWith a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of approximately 8.14, the stock appears attractively valued, as this metric suggests its price is low relative to strong projected earnings growth.\nThis contrasts with competitors who have not been as quick to announce domestic restarts, positioning Century as the market's preferred vehicle for this type of investment into the sector.\nA Strategic Position for a New Industrial Era\nCentury Aluminum offers a clear and direct thesis to investors. It is a story of a domestic company benefiting from a powerful policy tailwind, and management is executing a clear strategy to turn that opportunity into real production growth and profitability.\nSurging domestic premiums, a landmark investment in the Mt. Holly smelter, and a fortified balance sheet combine to create powerful catalysts.\nWhile the aluminum market will always have its cycles, Century Aluminum's strategic position as a pure-play U.S. producer is unmatched in the current environment. The company presents a distinct and compelling case for those looking to invest in the tangible resurgence of American industry.\nBefore you consider Century Aluminum, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Amprius Technologies’ Blowout Quarter Fuels Record-Setting Growth", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/amprius-technologies-blowout-quarter-fuels-record-setting-growth/", "text": "Amprius Technologies Today\nAMPXAmprius Technologies\n$7.19 +0.08 (+1.10%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - Price Target\n- $11.71\nA significant operational and financial transformation is underway at Amprius Technologies NYSE: AMPX.\nThe advanced battery firm recently posted second-quarter 2025 results that showcased a dramatic surge in revenue and, more critically, a landmark achievement in profitability.\nThese figures suggest the company has reached an inflection point, successfully transitioning from a phase of pure technological development to one of accelerating commercial execution.\nThe performance raises critical questions for investors: What fundamental changes are driving this success, and what do they indicate about the company's future?\nAmprius Q2: From Red to Black With Record Revenue Growth\nThe most direct evidence of a fundamental shift at Amprius comes from its second-quarter 2025 financial report. The numbers indicate a business that is growing rapidly while also becoming fundamentally more efficient and scalable. This performance is built on several key milestones that have captured the attention of the market.\nThe financial results highlight a clear business transformation:\n- Record-Setting Revenue: The company reported $15.1 million in revenue for the quarter. This represents a 350% increase compared to the same period in the prior year, signaling substantial and growing demand for its products.\n- Accelerated Annual Growth: Underscoring this momentum, revenue for just the first half of 2025, which stands at 26.4 million, has already eclipsed the total revenue generated in all of fiscal year 2024.\n- A Landmark Profitability Milestone: For the first time, Amprius achieved a positive gross margin, which came in at 9%. For any hardware company, moving from negative to positive gross margin is a crucial turning point. It proves that the core product, in this case, the SiCore™ battery platform, can be manufactured and sold for more than it costs to produce, establishing a viable path toward sustainable net income.\n- Rapid Customer Acquisition: The company shipped products to 93 customers during the quarter, 43 of whom were new. This expanding customer base is a strong indicator of successful market penetration and validates that the technology is meeting real-world needs.\nAmprius Silicon Anode Advantage\nThis strong financial performance is rooted in the company's core technological advantage: its silicon anode battery platform. Unlike conventional lithium-ion batteries that rely on graphite as the anode material, Amprius has commercialized a 100% silicon anode. This innovation is the engine behind its industry-leading performance metrics because, at this point in high-performance applications, graphite as an anode has reached its peak power delivery potential.\nThe primary benefit of this technology is a dramatic increase in energy density, which is the amount of energy a battery can store relative to its weight and volume. Amprius’s commercially available cells achieve an energy density of up to 450 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg). Its next-generation SiMaxx™ platform has been validated by third parties at 500 Wh/kg, with sample cells delivered to the U.S. Army demonstrating an average performance of 517 Wh/kg. This is a substantial leap over the 250-300 Wh/kg offered by many conventional batteries.\nThis technical superiority translates directly into tangible value. In the aerospace and defense sectors, this means longer flight times and increased mission capabilities. The most potent example is the AALTO Zephyr, an Airbus Group OTCMKTS: EADSY subsidiary's high-altitude drone, which used Amprius batteries to achieve a continuous flight of 67 days. For customers, this capability unlocks entirely new applications, providing a clear justification for accelerating sales.\nAmprius Strategy Meets Analyst Confidence\nA leading technology can only drive value if it can be produced at scale to meet demand. Amprius is executing a capital-light manufacturing strategy designed to manage cash efficiently and grow production capacity. Rather than spending hundreds of millions on building its factories, the company partners with established, high-volume battery manufacturers to produce its cells, leveraging their existing infrastructure and expertise.\nAmprius Technologies Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$11.7162.97% UpsideBuyBased on 9 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $7.19 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $18.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $11.71 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $6.00 |\n|---|\nAmprius Technologies Stock Forecast Details\nThis strategy is already being put into action. Amprius has secured a manufacturing agreement with a leading battery producer in South Korea, a global hub for battery manufacturing. This partnership provides access to large-scale production and geographically diversifies the company's supply chain, with initial production for Amprius customers expected to begin in September 2025.\nFurther strengthening its strategic position, Amprius was awarded a $10.5 million contract from the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Innovation Unit (DIU). This agreement provides valuable funding that does not require the company to give up equity, and it will be used to expand the company's pilot line in Fremont, California.\nMore importantly, this contract serves as a powerful endorsement, validating Amprius as a trusted partner for sensitive U.S. government programs and opening the door to future defense contracts. Amprius’s analyst community has taken note, with the stock holding a strong consensus Buy rating from nine analysts who have set an average price target of $11.71, which currently provides over 50% upside potential. Some of Amprius’s more recent analyst ratings give over 150% upside potential from current trading levels.\nThe Next Phase of Amprius’s Growth\nAmprius has demonstrated that it is successfully aligning its technological lead with commercial execution and a sound, scalable business strategy. The narrative has shifted from one of future promise to one of present-day performance. For investors, the company's second-quarter results serve as a fundamental proof point, but the focus now shifts to sustainability and continued expansion. Moving forward, several key catalysts will be crucial in determining the next phase of the company’s growth and will likely be watched closely by the market:\n- Continued Gross Margin Expansion: Confirming that the 9% margin was not an anomaly and can be improved upon in subsequent quarters.\n- Manufacturing Milestones: The successful ramp-up of production from the South Korean facility, signaling that the capital-light model is working at scale.\n- Major Customer Contracts: The announcement of large-scale, recurring volume orders that would provide greater long-term revenue visibility.\nThe performance in these areas will be essential in validating the company's current trajectory and its potential to become a leader in the next generation of industrial technology.\nBefore you consider Amprius Technologies, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

AI is a memory-intensive technology, and its needs are expected to grow exponentially with each upcoming generation.\nNot only is Micron’s technology in demand from both leading GPU manufacturers, but the market dynamic is set up for accelerated demand in 2026.\nAdvanced Micro Devices NASDAQ: AMD AI-focused GPUs have significantly more memory than NVIDIA’s NASDAQ: NVDA designs and are expected to begin gaining share in 2026. AMD’s new, rack-scale capability will underpin the share gains and, by extension, demand for Micron HBM4 technology.\nThe estimates regarding the GPU market and outlook vary from source to source, but they generally agree that GPU needs will grow at a solid, double-digit CAGR for the next five to ten years.\nRegarding Micron and its value, assuming the 15 times P/E valuation it is running in mid-August is fair value, the stock presents a deep value to long-term buy-and-hold investors.\nThe consensus forecast reported by MarketBeat puts this stock at only 8x earnings within two years, suggesting the potential for a nearly triple-digit stock price increase. Assuming the long-term forecasts are too low, and they are, the value deepens.\nMicron’s Growth Outlook Underpinned by AI… and Market Normalization\nNot only is AI underpinning Micron’s long-term outlook, but normalization within legacy end markets is also in play. While YOY contraction persisted in some segments in FQ3, all produced sequential strength and are expected to return to growth in Q4 or early in the subsequent fiscal year.\nThis provides a solid foundation for the DRAM business, which includes the data center (more than 50% of the revenue in Q3) and HBM markets. HBM sales grew more than 50% sequentially in Q3 from Q2, driving the data center business to more than double, and the guidance was also strong.\nThe company forecasts another high 30% growth pace and is expected to outpace its target by the analysts.\nMicron Technology Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$147.2419.17% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 27 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $123.55 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $200.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $147.24 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $67.00 |\n|---|\nMicron Technology Stock Forecast Details\nThe analysts' trends are robust, including numerous revenue and earnings forecast adjustments that forecast Micron's strength. MarketBeat reveals that 21 of 23 analysts issuing revenue and earnings forecasts, or more than 90%, have lifted their quarterly forecasts, setting a high expectation bar.\nThe consensus as of mid-August is significantly higher than the company’s guidance, with the revision trend leading to an above-consensus result. A consensus-beating result is a bullish market catalyst and likely to send the stock higher.\nThe stock price outlook is equally robust. MarketBeat tracks 26 analysts with current ratings, most of which were refreshed following the FQ3 release. The trends include upgrades, firming sentiment, and price target revisions that lead to the high-end range.\nThe consensus forecasts a 15% upside that may be achieved before the upcoming FQ4 release, while the high-end range adds 35%. At the same time, commentaries focused on volume and pricing strength, a favorable demand/inventory environment, and an expectation for sustained improvement.\nMicron Stock Is Poised to Move Higher\nMicron’s stock price action in mid-August confirms the rebound and uptrend that began in April and gained momentum with the Q3 release. The August action has the market poised to set a new long-term high, opening the door to another sustained updraft in the stock price.\nThe market could rise by as much as $20 in the near term and over $60 in the longer term, matching the rallies that preceded the breakout.

{"title": "Chinese Lithium Production Halt Means Upside for These 3 Stocks", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/chinese-lithium-production-halt-means-upside-for-these-3-stocks/", "text": "Lithium is poised to become a red-hot commodity in the basic materials sector, driven by a couple of key macro tailwinds. First and foremost, the new data center buildout across the United States will require a decent amount of lithium to be used in the supercomputers that will train tomorrow’s leading artificial intelligence models.\nSecondly, more than three-quarters of the global lithium production and supply chain originates from China. One of the leading Chinese lithium companies has just announced its plan to lower production volumes until it receives further government approval to resume previous production levels.\nAs a result, lithium prices shot up by 24.2% in July 2025 alone.\nFrom this price spike alone, it seems that the future profitability levels and expectations for stocks like Albemarle Corp. NYSE: ALB, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile NYSE: SQM, and even Lithium Americas Corp. NYSE: LAC are now headed higher, creating more bullish scenarios for these companies to make into reality for the coming months and quarters, especially when the true numbers come out from this demand cycle.\nAlbemarle’s Earnings Growth Stands to Push the Stock Higher\nAlbemarle Today\n$83.27 +1.08 (+1.31%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $49.43\n▼\n$113.91 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.95%\n- Price Target\n- $89.17\nThey say a good story without numbers is just a fairytale, and that’s what this entire data center and Chinese production theme would be without the underlying earnings growth to support it. That’s exactly what analysts see for Albemarle and just what investors need to start watching out for.\nFor Albemarle’s upcoming quarterly announcement, Wall Street analysts are now projecting earnings of $2.74 per share (EPS), a dramatic surge compared to the company’s most recent result of just 11 cents per share. While the outlook for future earnings appears remarkably bullish, the current market landscape already gives investors plenty of reason for optimism.\nWall Street was looking for a net loss per share of 83 cents, and Albemarle completely blew those expectations out of the water, a theme that may soon become the norm rather than the exception. With this in mind, it shouldn’t be a surprise for investors to see some institutional buying take place in this financial momentum.\nThose from Geode Capital Management boosted their Albemarle holdings by 2% as of early August 2025 to build a position as high as $184.8 million today, or a net 2.5% ownership in the entire company, a vote of high conviction and expectations for the stock’s future bullish scenarios.\nLeader in Price Action: Sociedad Quimica y Minera Stock\nSociedad Quimica y Minera Today\nSQMSociedad Quimica y Minera\n$46.21 +1.13 (+2.51%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $29.36\n▼\n$47.39 - P/E Ratio\n- 21.90\n- Price Target\n- $42.50\nWhen it comes to price action, the market seems to have been rewarding Sociedad Quimica y Minera stock the most out of today’s list, and there’s a very good reason for that. After a one-week rally of roughly 27%, this stock now trades at 97% of its 52-week high, providing investors with the bullish momentum signal they have been looking for in terms of confirmation.\nThis price action is based on Sociedad Quimica y Minera stock operating between the United States and Chile, where the world’s largest lithium mines are located. This exclusive tie to Chile and the United States’ needs for lithium for data center buildouts creates the sort of tailwinds that the market may be attempting to price in right now for the company.\nAlthough there is little evidence of further optimism from institutional investors or Wall Street analysts, likely due to the company's international nature, the near future may bring a change, as the price action and financial developments themselves may lead to a new opinion on the company.\nIf it serves as any indication, investors can look to the recent 12.2% decline in short interest for this stock, signaling some short sellers may be giving up on the hopes of this company having a near-term top, with more upside to be built into it.\nA Moat for Lithium Americas Stock\nLithium Americas Today\nLACLithium Americas\n$2.94 +0.04 (+1.38%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- Price Target\n- $4.15\nThis company owns 100% of the lithium mining rights within the Thacker Pass in Nevada and other mining rights across Canada. This exposure enables the United States to source lithium more efficiently domestically and without supply chain or logistical issues.\nWith this setup in mind, it makes sense that the stock joined the lithium rally over the past week with a performance of 18.7%. This gives investors another reason to start looking into this recent behavior and whether Lithium Americas can continue this trend.\nChances are that it will, considering that this recent rally may eventually trigger what’s known as a “short squeeze.” With $68.7 million worth of short positions open, or 13% of the float, there is enough riding in bearish bets to imply additional buying pressure when and if these short sellers are forced to close their positions (which involves buying the stock).\nBefore you consider Albemarle, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Brinker Serves Up Earnings Beat, Sidesteps Cost Pressures", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/brinker-serves-up-earnings-beat-sidesteps-cost-pressures/", "text": "Brinker International Today\nEATBrinker International\n$155.72 -2.44 (-1.54%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $65.38\n▼\n$192.21 - P/E Ratio\n- 18.74\n- Price Target\n- $171.41\nBrinker International Inc. NYSE: EAT stock is surging over 2.5% on strong volume after the company’s strong second-quarter earnings report. The company reported strong, 21.3% same-store sales growth for its Chili’s and Maggiano’s chains.\nOverall revenue came in at $1.46 billion, a 20% year-over-year (YOY) increase. The news was even better on the bottom line with the company posting 54% YOY growth. The earnings beat underscores the company’s ability to maintain pricing power and drive traffic despite a more cost-conscious consumer.\nDespite the rally, EAT stock is still down overall for the last five days. Investors may believe the pre-earnings sell-off was overdone, but they may need more before confirming a new trend.\nWhat Dining in Isn’t Saying\nIn the immediate hours after the report, the headline is that Brinker’s earnings prove that consumers are still dining out. That’s probably true. However, Brinker is also forecasting only a modest gain in same-store sales.\nThe company provided cautious guidance for the remainder of 2025, noting potential volatility in commodity costs. It also reinforced a focus on menu innovation, digital ordering, and loyalty programs to drive traffic and customer engagement. The loyalty program, in particular, continues to attract repeat customers, while digital channels are boosting average ticket sizes even as the overall share of off-premise sales remains modest.\nDespite that outlook, investors are willing to reward EAT stock while it punished companies like CAVA Group and Chipotle Mexican Grill, which were punished after similar outlooks.\nThe key comes in the respective business models. Both companies offer dine-in, delivery, and to-go options. However, while Brinker noted that digital sales continue to become a larger part of the company’s business, it’s not nearly the same percentage as fast-casual names.\nThe takeaway is that Brinker’s dine-in-focused model preserves higher margins. Off-premise sales contribute to revenue growth, but aren’t as critical to overall profitability as they are for fast-casual names.\nDoes Brinker Stock Offer as Much Value as Its Restaurants\nEAT stock has been one of the strongest-performing restaurant stocks over the past five years. However, that growth has been more pronounced in 2025 as some restaurant stocks face the reality of a weak consumer.\nDespite those gains, Brinker still trades at an attractive valuation of just around 19x forward sales, a discount to the sector average. Adding to the bullish thesis is that analysts project 12.65% earnings growth over the next 12 months, which is well above the sector average. The company’s consistent track record of capital returns through buybacks and dividends also adds to shareholder appeal.\nEAT Stock Is Moving, But the Rally Needs More Volume\nBrinker International Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$171.4110.08% UpsideHoldBased on 17 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $155.72 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $215.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $171.41 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $97.00 |\n|---|\nBrinker International Stock Forecast Details\nThe post-earnings move in EAT stock has erased the losses from the prior month. However, the stock still looks stuck in the range that it’s been in since June.\nIn the short term, investors should see if the stock can cross over its 50-day simple moving average (SMA).\nEven if it does, the path back to the all-time high at $189 would require more volume and a clear breakout above intermediate resistance near $175.\nThat may have to wait until the fall. August tends to see a decline in volume, and September is one of the market’s worst months. Analysts have been raising their price targets for EAT stock in the last two months.\nInvestors will want to see if that continues post-earnings.

{"title": "Data Centers Create a Bull Case for These Nuclear 3 Stocks", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/data-centers-create-a-bull-case-for-these-nuclear-stocks/", "text": "The next wave of upside for the technology sector is now found in the future of data centers, since the United States is absolutely focused on onshoring the artificial intelligence capacity and footprint in the coming years.\nThis requires significant investment from the biggest names in the chipmaking and semiconductor industry, and most of the market is likely taking this view right now.\nThe real opportunity may lie further down the road for investors eager to be early adopters of emerging trends. America’s current energy grid is ill-equipped to handle the surge in electricity demand that data centers will create.\nThis gap could pave the way for alternative energy sources to take center stage—fueling a long-term bull run with the potential to turn portfolios into lasting wealth.\nWith this theme in mind, some of the biggest players in nuclear energy have already seen additional price action and attention, names like Cameco Corp. NYSE: CCJ, Oklo Inc. NYSE: OKLO, and even NuScale Power Corp. NYSE: SMR are the ones likely at the front of the next earnings expansion, as the evidence in today’s list will make it clear for investors now looking to get in early.\nCameco Stock: Price Action & Growth Leader\nCameco Today\n$76.85 +1.25 (+1.65%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $35.00\n▼\n$80.32 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.16%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 88.33\n- Price Target\n- $83.32\nIn terms of price action, Cameco stock is the one that leads the pack in today’s list, as the stock now trades at 96% of its 52-week high. This extremely bullish momentum can be attributed to the broader market now attempting to price in the future financial and industry performance, as well as Cameco’s role in this theme.\nDigging further into that view, investors can begin to justify this preferential treatment with recent earnings per share (EPS) figures, according to Cameco’s latest quarterly earnings results. While all of Wall Street expected Cameco to report $0.29 in EPS, the company surprised everyone by a wide margin with its actual $0.51 in reported EPS.\nThis massive beat, however, could only be the beginning, considering how important nuclear energy may become in the coming years as data centers get rolled out across the United States. As a uranium provider, it's logical that Cameco would be the first to benefit from financial expansion and market attention, but there’s more to it.\nWall Street analysts currently rate Cameco stock Buy and have a consensus $82.6 price target, which represents roughly 6.6% upside from today’s prices. However, considering the recent financial figures, Royal Bank of Canada analyst Andrew Wong decided to stand out with an Outperform rating and an implied 42% upside in his $110 target.\nOklo Is a Premium Stock in the Making\nOklo Today\n$68.89 -2.18 (-3.06%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $5.35\n▼\n$85.35 - Price Target\n- $63.78\nJudging a company’s potential and true trajectory is challenging when it hasn't reported a net income yet. However, experienced investors understand that a lack of widespread market focus can reveal where the real opportunities exist. By analyzing Oklo stock’s valuation multiples against its peer group, the answer becomes evident. A price-to-book (P/B) multiple of 35.9x will place Oklo stock massively above the rest of the energy sector’s average valuation of only 4.0x today, and that is the sort of outlier data that professionals seek answers to.\nThis stock is trading at such a premium because Oklo directly provides fusion power (nuclear) solutions to customers and government entities within the United States, aligning it with the current administration's national security and domestic production objectives.\nKnowing what lies ahead for all stocks as aligned as Oklo, short sellers decided to step off the gas a little bit. Over the past month, 1.2% of Oklo’s short interest declined as an initial sign of a bearish retreat. However, there are still $948.9 million worth of open short positions that could be wiped out if the stock rallies enough to force this buying pressure.\nNuScale’s Government Favor\nNuScale Power Today\nSMRNuScale Power\n$34.88 -0.59 (-1.66%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $6.88\n▼\n$53.50 - Price Target\n- $34.44\nA newly established U.S. regulatory commission has issued fresh guidelines for the construction of small to medium-sized reactors. With its $11.2 billion market capitalization, NuScale has the agility to pivot its entire business swiftly and make adjustments without significant structural hurdles.\nThis is why NuScale has developed the proper designs and measures to secure new government and infrastructure contracts. With the massive energy demands that data centers will bring on, NuScale will receive similar demand for its reactors to be built and used.\nLike Oklo, NuScale has no net income to report. Still, as stated, the market is willing to express its optimism for future sales contracts.\nBecause NuScale stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 229.6x, no other companies in the nuclear space come close.\nThe reason is that NuScale is already set up for massive sales growth ahead of it.\nBefore you consider Oklo, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

NASDAQ: TSLA has finally made its move and is decisive. Shares have popped 12% in the past three sessions, breaking above the upper trendline that had been capping upside momentum since late May.\nThe market has been waiting for Tesla to tip its hand, and this week’s breakout has made the call: momentum is firmly back with the bulls.\nThe pennant had been narrowing steadily, compressing price action and leaving both sides of the trade restless. Bulls had to watch the stock make a series of lower highs since June, while bears could point to the repeated failures at resistance as proof that the rally was running out of steam.\nYet, they could not send the stock to lower lows, and Monday’s 2.85% pop means the stock is now firmly above July’s high.\nTesla: Improving Fundamentals Reinforce Long-Term Investment Case\nThe good news for those of us on the sidelines is that while the technical breakout is a story, there are plenty of other reasons to be excited. Take Tesla’s fundamental situation, for example. After a run of lackluster earnings reports over the past two years, Tesla’s most recent quarterly numbers delivered a much-needed positive surprise.\nRevenue contracted less than feared, margins improved, and earnings per share came in ahead of consensus.\nFor many on Wall Street, this was a reminder that Tesla remains one of the most resilient names in the electric vehicle sector. Yes, the company still faces intense competition and macro headwinds, but it also has a proven ability to navigate challenging environments and keep innovating.\nFor investors with a long-term horizon, not to mention patience and the ability to stomach volatility, Tesla remains a compelling stock to own.\nWedbush Reiterates $500 Price Target, Sees 50% Upside\nTesla Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$303.31-9.50% DownsideHoldBased on 42 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $335.16 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $500.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $303.31 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $19.05 |\n|---|\nTesla Stock Forecast Details\nSome of the renewed analyst support around the stock backs up the argument that we’re watching a new phase of the rally begin. Wedbush Securities, one of the most vocal Tesla bulls, had already reiterated its Outperform rating earlier this month and its $500 price target.\nIncluding the gains of the past few sessions, it points to a targeted upside of nearly 50%.\nThe bullish thesis rests on Tesla’s position as the leading electric vehicle (EV) brand globally and its expanding technology platform.\nThis includes progress in energy storage, AI-driven autonomous driving capabilities, and the anticipated rollout of new models that could capture additional market share.\nWhile near-term results will still swing on quarterly deliveries and margins, Wedbush continues to believe in Tesla’s long-term trajectory.\nThe Bear Case Isn’t Gone: Valuation, Legal Risk, and Competition\nStill, the bears have their ammunition. Tesla’s price-to-earnings (PE) ratio remains nearly 200, frothy by any standard, particularly for a company whose revenue is dropping yearly. It appears Wall Street is happy to overlook this for now, but any stumble in execution over the coming months could easily trigger a sharp pullback.\nThere are also ongoing headline risks. The company faces a class-action lawsuit alleging CEO Elon Musk misled investors on safety issues tied to its self-driving technology, including its much-vaunted robotaxi.\nAnd while EV adoption is growing globally, Tesla’s market share has slipped in certain regions. As we recently noted, EV registrations may have jumped 58% last month in Germany, but Tesla’s own registrations fell more than 50%.\nMarket Context Is Helping Tesla Regain Momentum\nDespite these risks, broader market conditions are working in Tesla’s favor. The major equity indices remain at or near all-time highs, and risk appetite is strong. Investors are willing to pay for growth, and Tesla benefits from that sentiment shift.\nCompared to back in April, when the broader market was under pressure and high-multiple stocks like Tesla were being sold indiscriminately, today’s backdrop is far more supportive.\nLooking ahead, the $360 level, where Tesla peaked in May and June, is now the critical resistance to watch. If the stock can break above this level with strong volume, it could pave the way for a much larger upward move, possibly aiming for the $400 area soon.\nBefore you consider Tesla, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "3 Earnings Reports Give a Snapshot of Consumer Sentiment", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-earnings-reports-give-a-snapshot-of-consumer-sentiment/", "text": "Earnings season is not only an opportunity for investors to evaluate the success (or lack thereof) of individual companies in the last several months, but also a chance to get a more general reading on larger issues facing the economy. In 2025, with inflation creeping upward again and tariffs jolting the market in different directions, consumer sentiment is one of these larger issues.\nHow do American consumers feel as their spending gets stretched thinner amid rising prices and widespread economic uncertainty?\nWhile using individual firms as a proxy for broader sentiment has limitations, investors may nonetheless draw insight from considering three major consumer-facing brands: McDonald's Corp. NYSE: MCD, Shopify Inc. NYSE: SHOP, and DoorDash Inc. NASDAQ: DASH. In many ways, the success each of these firms experienced in the latest earnings round paints a rosy picture of consumer sentiment.\nDespite this, digging deeper will reveal reasons investors should be cautious going forward.\nEarnings Wins Across the Board Demonstrate Resilience\nMcDonald's Today\n$308.71 -0.22 (-0.07%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $276.53\n▼\n$326.32 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.29%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 26.45\n- Price Target\n- $326.87\nAll three of the firms above noted significant earnings wins for the year's second quarter, a sign of their resilience despite volatility in some corners of the market.\nFast food titan McDonald's, for example, posted modest positive surprises in both top- and bottom-line performance as global systemwide sales climbed by 6% year-over-year (YOY), and the company remains on track to open some 2,200 new locations this year alone.\nThese results suggest that consumer sentiment toward affordable dining options remains strong, even as broader economic uncertainty lingers.\nMcDonald’s menu innovation and digital ordering initiatives appear to be resonating with customers, helping sustain brand loyalty.\nIf confidence in household budgets continues to improve, the company could see even stronger traffic and sales growth in the quarters ahead.\nShopify Today\n$143.11 +1.64 (+1.16%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $65.86\n▼\n$156.85 - P/E Ratio\n- 92.33\n- Price Target\n- $148.51\nRetail giant Shopify reflects a different aspect of the consumer space.\nGiven that the company's clients are merchants keen to use Shopify's platform and services to market, sell, and manage their products to customers, the company is a step removed from the everyday consumer.\nStill, the company's strong earnings results suggest that optimism is warranted more broadly in retail.\nShopify's revenue climbed by an impressive 31% YOY, and the company also provided similarly optimistic forward guidance.\nThese results indicate that merchants remain confident in consumer demand and are willing to invest in expanding their online presence. Continued growth in e-commerce adoption points to a sustained shift in shopping habits, which benefits Shopify’s long-term outlook.\nIf consumer sentiment holds firm, the company could see both transaction volume and merchant subscriptions accelerate further.\nDoorDash Today\n$253.34 +5.34 (+2.15%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $122.32\n▼\n$278.15 - P/E Ratio\n- 140.75\n- Price Target\n- $263.88\nDoorDash similarly reported better-than-expected results on both earnings and revenue, as U.S. marketplace orders climbed YOY alongside improved delivery times and a surge in membership in the company's subscription DashPass service.\nIn response, shares of DASH surged to an all-time high.\nDespite the higher costs to consumers associated with ordering food for delivery compared to visiting a restaurant in person, DoorDash seems to have still drawn significant interest.\nThis suggests that convenience remains a strong driver of consumer behavior, even in the face of cost pressures. Strong demand for services like DoorDash can indicate that consumers still feel confident in their discretionary spending.\nIf that confidence holds, the company may continue to see elevated order volumes and subscriber growth well into the next quarter.\nNonetheless, Reasons to Exercise Caution\nDespite these wins, however, there may still be reasons for investors to exercise caution regarding consumer sentiment. First, looking at McDonald's earnings on a more granular level, while U.S. comparable sales did climb by 2.5% YOY, low-income consumer visits declined by double digits relative to the second quarter of last year.\nThis puts the firm in a difficult position as inflation pressures suggest raising prices. The fact that consumers at the lower end of the income spectrum have avoided McDonald's—as part of the fast food category, which has traditionally been one of the most affordable restaurants nationwide—may signal a red flag for future investors.\nAdditionally, Shopify's results may not paint quite as rosy a picture as they seem on an initial viewing. Despite impressive revenue growth, company executives explained that the firm's European business was the primary driver of these gains.\nFurther, revenue gains may have been more attributable to adding new large-scale merchants on the platform than increased customer spending.\nInvestors should remember that earnings reports are necessarily backward-facing, and that while they can suggest emerging or continuing trends, they do not guarantee any future performance. With several new tariffs taking effect in August and disappointing inflation results in the summer months, companies in the retail industry and the broader consumer discretionary sector could be facing an even more challenging external environment than they did in the second quarter.\nThe S&P 500 remains up 8% year-to-date, and plenty of analysts are bullish on each of the companies listed above. Still, the warning signs in these earnings reports may be enough to give some investors reason to hesitate as we enter the year's second half.\nBefore you consider McDonald's, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and McDonald's wasn't on the list.\nWhile McDonald's currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nWith the proliferation of data centers and electric vehicles, the electric grid will only get more strained.

{"title": "Gartner’s RSI Just Sank to 11: That’s a Setup You Can’t Ignore", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/gartners-rsi-just-sank-to-11-thats-a-setup-you-cant-ignore/", "text": "Gartner Today\n$239.15 +0.46 (+0.19%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $223.65\n▼\n$584.01 - P/E Ratio\n- 14.72\n- Price Target\n- $369.25\nShares of Gartner Inc. NYSE: IT are trading just over $240, down from $340 barely two weeks ago. The stock had already been trending lower since February, but few could have predicted the sheer scale of the collapse over the past fortnight. Last week’s Q2 earnings release sparked a single-session drop of 30%, adding to a selloff that has now taken shares 60% below their February peak and back to price levels not seen since 2021.\nOn the surface, it looks like a textbook example of a stock in free fall, the kind that most investors instinctively avoid. But a rare setup forming here could reward those willing to take a contrarian approach.\nRSI Hits a Historic Low\nThe selling pressure was so intense that Gartner’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) collapsed to 9 earlier this week, the lowest reading in the company’s 32-year history. For context, RSI is a popular momentum indicator ranging from 0 to 100.\nReadings above 70 suggest a stock is overbought, while those below 30 mean it’s extremely oversold. It is rare to have it drop under 20, but seeing it fall into the single digits is almost unheard of.\nAn RSI this low is the market equivalent of stretching an elastic band to its limit; it wants to snap back, and often does, violently. It’s not a guarantee of an immediate turnaround, but it’s one of the more reliable signals of a near-term bounce.\nFor short-term traders, it’s exactly the kind of setup that can produce outsized gains in a compressed timeframe.\nEarly Signs of Buying\nThere are signs that bargain hunters and short-covering traders are starting to step in. Wednesday’s 5.8% gain pushed RSI back above 20, but it remains firmly in oversold territory.\nIf shares can climb above $250, the price they opened after last week’s earnings gap, it could open the door to a potential short squeeze. This situation occurs when traders who bet against buying the stock or are forced to close their positions are compelled to do so, which can fuel a rally and significantly speed up gains.\nSuch a squeeze in a stock as heavily oversold as Gartner could be sharp.\nLooking Past the Panic\nGartner Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$369.2554.40% UpsideHoldBased on 8 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $239.15 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $557.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $369.25 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $225.00 |\n|---|\nGartner Stock Forecast Details\nWhile the Q2 numbers may have disappointed guidance-watchers, they weren’t outright misses. Gartner topped Wall Street’s expectations for revenue and earnings in the quarter. The damage was done by weaker-than-expected full-year guidance, which spooked investors and gave bears the narrative they needed to pile in.\nHowever, this ignores some critical positives. The company’s average contract value grew 5% year over year. Management reaffirmed its commitment to the share repurchase program, typically a bullish signal that leadership believes the stock is undervalued.\nGartner is actively pursuing AI initiatives as a growth driver, positioning itself to benefit from one of the strongest secular trends in the market.\nNotably, major analysts have not abandoned their bullish outlook. Barclays reiterated its Buy rating following the post-earnings plunge, with a $320 price target that wasn’t even the highest. Goldman Sachs went further, maintaining its bullish stance and setting a $457 price target, which points to nearly 90% potential upside.\nThe Case for Getting Involved\nThe near-term trade here is straightforward: with an RSI this low, the downside risk over the coming sessions may be limited, while upside potential could be significant if sentiment shifts. The first test is $250. A clean break above this level could trigger the kind of rapid short covering that sends shares surging.\nFor longer-term investors, the decision is more nuanced. Gartner’s guidance cut reflects real challenges, and it may take time for confidence to rebuild. But if you believe the worst-case scenario has already been priced in, and the extreme selling has created a valuation disconnect, this could be a rare opportunity to start building a position at a steep discount.\nBefore you consider Gartner, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "3 AI Stocks in Correction Mode: Can They Rebound?", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-ai-stocks-in-correction-mode-can-they-rebound/", "text": "They say a rising tide lifts all boats, but not every company in the artificial intelligence industry today would agree. Yes, you’ve got big winners in semiconductors, software, and hardware spreading across the market as AI capital expenditures continue to grow at eye-popping rates.\nEven the companies that make data center A/C units are seeing their stocks rise this year.\nHowever, not every company in the AI space is partying like it’s 2001. Poor earnings have been punished in Q2, and some companies reporting less-than-stellar numbers have been crushed into correction. Today, we’ll examine three AI stocks that are down at least 10% over the last month to see if the declines are deserved or overdone.\n3 Stocks Down Big in the Last 30 Days: Are The Lows In?\nAttempting to catch a falling knife is a lot like splitting 10s in blackjack: exhilarating when you win, but shameful if you lose. These stocks dropped for a reason, and if you want to call the bottom, you’ll need fundamental and technical factors in your favor. Market timing is always tricky, so ensure your risk tolerance and investment goals are aligned with these stocks.\nC3.ai: A Technical and Fundamental Breakdown\nC3.ai Today\n$18.21 +0.36 (+2.02%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $14.70\n▼\n$45.08 - Price Target\n- $27.43\nHow can C3.ai Inc. NYSE: AI, the company that managed to grab the coveted AI stock symbol, struggle when investors are going crazy for all things AI? A Death Cross followed by a series of earnings disasters is a good place to start.\nThe company reported fiscal Q4 2025 numbers after the close on May 28, and while EPS and revenue beat analysts’ expectations, losses expanded year-over-year (YOY), and it cut FY 2026 revenue guidance to a range of $447.5 million to $484.5 million.\nThe $40 million gap in high and low-end revenue projections was larger than usual, which CEO Thomas Siebel blamed on an unpredictable macroeconomic environment. Analysts weren’t convinced, and the stock faced several downgrades and price cuts in the days after the report.\nBroad tailwinds in the tech sector brought the stock back above its 50 and then 200-day moving averages, but support began to break down in late July, and the stock declined for seven consecutive days.\nThe share price plunged below two previous areas of support at the 200- and 50-day MAs, and we now know why. Technically savvy investors had sniffed out more earnings drama in the days before the company released a preliminary earnings report that sent the stock plummeting another 25%.\nHow bad is the news if you’re releasing a preliminary report? Somewhere between awful and catastrophic. On August 11, the company warned investors that Q1 2026 revenue was likely to come in around $70 million, a figure more than 30% lower than its previous projection.\nThe surprisingly sour data triggered another wave of downgrades and price reductions, including a new Street low of $13 from DA Davidson. The stock has rebounded 10% since the sell-off, but the company has much to prove to investors before this can be considered anything but a dead cat bounce.\nInnodata: Anxious Investors or Profit Taking?\nInnodata Today\n$39.58 -0.61 (-1.52%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $13.02\n▼\n$71.00 - P/E Ratio\n- 31.92\n- Price Target\n- $55.00\nInnodata Inc. NASDAQ: INOD didn’t have the earnings catastrophe that C3.ai did, but its Q2 report didn’t have investors popping champagne bottles either.\nThe company’s July 31 release saw EPS beat estimates, but revenue numbers were lukewarm despite more than 79% YOY growth.\nThe company also raised its FY 2025 organic revenue projections to 45% from 40% in response to new business agreements signed between the Q1 and Q2 releases.\nA quick 10% drop following a guidance raise is unusual activity, and the sell-off in INOD shares could be profit-taking in response to its elevated valuation (forward P/E ratio of 53.3).\nLong-term technical trends still support the consensus Buy rating on the stock. The price bounced off the 200-day MA earlier this week, which had previously been a level where buyers flocked in. A move back above the 50-day MA would further confirm that the uptrend remains intact, making it a critical area to watch in the weeks ahead.\nConfluent: Weak Guidance Overshadows Earnings Beat\nConfluent Today\n$17.87 +0.08 (+0.45%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $15.64\n▼\n$37.90 - Price Target\n- $27.36\nSoftware and data provider Confluent Inc. NASDAQ: CFLT went public in 2021 during the nadir of the post-COVID stock rally.\nAfter rallying more than 100% in its first few months of trading, the stock lost nearly 80% of its value when the Fed raised rates and the bear market of 2022 began.\nFast-forward to 2025, and the stock is still languishing, down 38% YTD.\nInvestors hoping for a momentum change following April’s Death Cross formation had their hopes dashed by the company’s Q2 earnings release on July 30.\nConfluent’s 9-cent EPS and $282 million revenue figure beat analyst expectations, and subscription revenue grew 21% YOY. But CFO Rohan Sivaram warned on the conference call that Confluent Cloud growth rates will be slower in the second half of 2025 compared to previous years. Despite the initially rosy picture, the report earned the stock three analyst downgrades and 11 price reductions.\nThe disappointing guidance on the Cloud segment hammered the stock in the succeeding sessions, shattering a previously strong 50-day MA support level. CFLT shares dropped nearly 33% the day following the earnings report, and much like C3.ai, the company will need to prove itself to win back jaded investors and analysts.\nBefore you consider Confluent, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Confluent wasn't on the list.\nWhile Confluent currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nWith the proliferation of data centers and electric vehicles, the electric grid will only get more strained.

{"title": "Amazon’s Bears Have Raised the White Flag—Get Excited", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/amazons-bears-have-raised-the-white-flag-get-excited/", "text": "Amazon.com Today\n$231.49 +0.46 (+0.20%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $161.38\n▼\n$242.52 - P/E Ratio\n- 35.29\n- Price Target\n- $262.87\nShares of tech giant Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN dropped more than 10% in just two sessions to start the month, immediately slipping into a technical correction. The move came after the company’s Q2 earnings report, a set of good results but not quite good enough to justify the 45% rally since April. While headline beats and solid performance across most business lines impressed, weaker-than-expected guidance took some of the shine off.\nThe pullback came right as the broader market was losing steam; only the opening short-term traders needed to lock in gains. For the bears, it was the long-awaited moment: a chance to finally see the deeper correction, if not the outright downtrend, they’d been predicting.\nYet barely a week later, their momentum already looks spent. The signs suggest they’ve waved the white flag, and it may be time to get bullish on Amazon again.\nThe Technical Floor Is Holding Firm\nPerhaps the most important sign comes from the chart. For the past week, sellers have been unable to push Amazon below its post-earnings low from Monday. That’s not for lack of trying; the stock has been tested multiple times, but each dip has been met with strong buying interest.\nThis matters because it signals a massive source of demand sitting at what the bulls see as a discount. The initial rebound off those lows was sharp, and while the stock has been consolidating in recent sessions, it has refused to give back those gains. That’s a key point: the panic selling has already dried up, and most of the profit-taking has run its course.\nAs long as Amazon shares can tread water above $220, they should have the foundation they need for the next leg higher. That level now represents a clear line in the sand for both bulls and bears, and investors should watch it closely.\nAnalyst Sentiment Is Still Overwhelmingly Bullish\nAmazon.com Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$262.8713.56% UpsideBuyBased on 49 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $231.49 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $305.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $262.87 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $195.00 |\n|---|\nAmazon.com Stock Forecast Details\nAny sign of real bearish momentum would likely be reflected in analyst downgrades, and we’re simply not seeing it. The opposite is happening. This month, the Goldman Sachs and Cowen teams have reiterated their Buy ratings, joining the long list of bullish calls that have followed the stock for months.\nThis steady stream of bullish coverage is exactly the backdrop that can turn a post-earnings dip into a launchpad.\nThere are also fresh price targets to consider, with some reaching up to $280, which indicates an upside of nearly 30% from current levels. If Amazon can regain its pre-earnings momentum, this would send the stock into blue-sky territory, and it feels quite feasible.\nWith the company consistently outperforming in its key business units, from AWS to advertising, and the broader stock market experiencing some of its best weeks of the year, the potential here is real.\nThe “Bad News” Is Already Priced In\nIf we accept that the weaker-than-expected guidance in July’s report was the main culprit for the drop, it now looks like the market has fully digested it. The reality is that Amazon’s business lines are firing on nearly all cylinders, and macro conditions remain supportive for big tech.\nWhen you strip away the noise, this sell-off has the hallmarks of healthy profit-taking after a big run. Guidance-driven dips tend to fade quickly when the underlying fundamentals are strong, and it feels like that’s what’s playing out here.\nConsider that broader market sentiment is still very much in risk-on mode, which means that, short of something breaking, high-quality names like Amazon don’t, and even can’t, stay down for long.\nBulls Back in Control\nIf the stock can maintain its hold above $220, the next logical target is $235, where it was trading right before the report came out. From there, attention will shift to February’s all-time high around the $240 mark, and beyond that to $280, which multiple analysts are targeting.\nUnless the bears can quickly come up with a fresh catalyst, it’s hard to see them regaining control. Amazon has spent most of the past four months showing investors its ability to rally seemingly in one direction for weeks on end, and it could be about to do the same again.\nAmazon.com, Inc.

{"title": "Deere’s Sell-Off Could Be a Long-Term Buying Chance", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/deeres-sell-off-could-be-a-long-term-buying-chance/", "text": "Deere & Company Today\nDEDeere & Company\n$490.83 +2.03 (+0.42%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $371.76\n▼\n$533.78 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.32%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 25.66\n- Price Target\n- $524.00\nDeere & Co. NYSE: DE stock is dropping sharply after it lowered its full-year guidance, citing tariff uncertainty, cautious customer spending, and weaker crop prices. The stock was down more than 8% in midday trading on Aug. 14 as investors continue to punish companies projecting a slowdown.\nIndustrial stocks have been one of the market’s best-performing sectors. Before the earnings report, DE stock had been outperforming the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund NYSEARCA: XLI, reflecting its status as a bellwether for the sector.\nThe headline numbers beat expectations. Third-quarter revenue rose to $15.2 billion versus the $14.8 billion consensus, and earnings per share (EPS) came in at $10.02 versus $9.57 expected. But that wasn’t enough to offset the market’s reaction to guidance.\nGuidance Cut Hits All Segments\nJohn Deere forecasted weakness across all business units and regions for the rest of the year, and tariffs were a key reason. As a company with significant international exposure, it’s logical that it will be concerned about tariff impacts.\nDeere now expects reciprocal tariffs in Europe and India and higher steel costs to reduce pretax results by approximately $700 million, with about half of that impact hitting in the current quarter.\nChief financial officer (CFO) Josh Jepsen told analysts, “We’ve incorporated higher steel costs and reciprocal tariffs into our guidance, which could weigh more heavily if trade tensions escalate.”\nThe company is also contending with slower equipment demand. Jepsen said Deere has reduced large tractor inventories by 45%, small tractors by 30%, and earthmoving units by 25%-30%. However, he also noted that customers still opt for used equipment, creating headwinds for new equipment sales.\nDeclining crop prices were a third factor contributing to the weaker guidance. Chief executive officer (CEO) John May noted that “corn, wheat, and soybean prices are at multi-year lows, which historically leads farmers to defer purchases of new equipment.”\nCautious Guidance May Be Overstated\nDeere & Company Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$524.006.76% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 20 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $490.83 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $602.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $524.00 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $440.00 |\n|---|\nDeere & Company Stock Forecast Details\nDeere is known for issuing cautious forecasts, and management acknowledged that tariff and crop price impacts are based on assumptions that could change. This reminds investors that management is signaling what may happen, which may differ from what will happen.\nThe guidance cut also came alongside broad market weakness triggered by hotter-than-expected inflation data.\nJepsen emphasized that the company’s operational discipline remains intact: “Our structural improvements and cost controls position us well for when demand returns.”\nDeere’s reduced inventories could create a supply tailwind if end-market demand improves. That sets up the possibility for earnings to surprise to the upside later in the fiscal year.\nDoes that mean the sell-off is overdone? That is not necessarily the case; selling momentum will likely stay with the bears in the short term. Analysts have not weighed in on DE stock at the time of this writing.\nAn Attractive Valuation and Technical Outlook\nWith around 23x earnings and 26x forward earnings, DE stock trades at a premium to its historical average. However, it’s not overvalued relative to the broader sector, and the chart suggests that patient investors may have an opportunity.\nThe sell-off has pushed DE stock below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA), a level that had been providing support for several months. Could the stock drop more?\nRecent history suggests it can. In late March to early April, DE stock dropped approximately 14%. That slide started with the stock at about the level it is now. Plus, the MACD has crossed below its signal line, which suggests more downward momentum in the short term.\nA similar 14% drop would put the bottom near $442, aligning with a prior level of support. However, it’s important to note that DE stock rallied sharply after that point.\nThe long-term buy-and-hold case for DE stock remains in place, which means a meaningful drop in the company’s stock price could present a buying opportunity.\nBefore you consider Deere & Company, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "CAVA’s Honeymoon Ends With a 16% Stock Drop", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/cavas-honeymoon-ends-with-a-16-stock-drop/", "text": "Restaurant stocks have somewhat mirrored artificial intelligence (AI) stocks this earnings season. That is, investors are not taking a one-size-fits-all approach. In the case of AI, investors are looking for companies that show an ability to monetize the technology. In the case of restaurant stocks, investors are rewarding companies that demonstrate their value proposition.\nCAVA Group Today\n$69.78 -0.12 (-0.17%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $65.70\n▼\n$172.43 - P/E Ratio\n- 58.64\n- Price Target\n- $100.44\nThat explains the sell-off in CAVA Group Inc. NYSE: CAVA after the company’s second-quarter earnings report. CAVA stock is down over 16% in midday trading following its report after the market closed on August 12.\nOverall results were mixed but leaned positive. Revenue came in at $280.62 million, just shy of the $285.65 million estimate, while earnings per share (EPS) of 16 cents topped expectations of 13 cents.\nThe closely watched same-store sales metric came in at 2.1% in the quarter, lower than the initial estimate of 6.1% growth. However, the company's guidance sent CAVA stock lower.\nThe company lowered its full-year same-store sales growth outlook from 4-6% to 3-4%, citing flat year-over-year traffic and softer demand from lower-income consumers. While traffic was unchanged compared to last summer, it improved sequentially from the first quarter. Management said higher-income markets remain resilient, but the broader consumer picture is “putting a fog” over the company’s near-term outlook.\nIt's Never Just 1 Reason\nIn the immediate aftermath of an earnings report, many analysts try to find “the one thing” that caused a good or bad report. However, there are frequently many reasons for a company’s good or bad results.\nFor CAVA, part of the slower same-store sales growth came from tougher comps after last summer’s introduction of steak, one of the company's most successful menu launches.\nManagement noted that this was particularly true in markets where steak performed exceptionally well. While the tougher comp wasn’t the only factor in this quarter’s softer numbers, it was a meaningful headwind alongside broader consumer softness.\nA Profitable and Growing Company\nThe company had some positive news on the growth front. It opened 16 net new restaurants, expanding its footprint to 398 locations across 28 states and the District of Columbia.\nThe takeaway for investors is that CAVA is still in the early stages of its national buildout. The company has a goal of 1,000 restaurants by 2032. That will mean broader national coverage and growth that won’t depend on raising prices\nA Young Stock With the Privilege of Expectations\nAfter a reaction to this quarter’s earnings report, it’s important to note that CAVA has only been publicly traded since 2023. That means analysts and investors are still getting their minds around a proper valuation.\nWith many young stocks, CAVA stock popped based on enthusiasm for how its Mediterranean-focused menu could fill a key niche in the fast-casual market. CAVA stock more than doubled in its first year, covering June 2023 to June 2024. Then the stock nearly doubled again in the six-month period from June 2024 to December 2024.\nThat's incredible growth, which also pushed the stock’s valuation to levels that were likely going to be unsustainable. Even after this sell-off, CAVA stock still has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of over 59x. That’s more than double the sector average of around 28x.\nIt’s safe to say, the company’s honeymoon period is over. However, that doesn’t mean the stock is untouchable.\nIf You Would Buy the Food, Buy the Dip\nCAVA Group Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$100.4443.94% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 19 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $69.78 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $150.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $100.44 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $74.00 |\n|---|\nCAVA Group Stock Forecast Details\nThe unsettling news from the earnings report is that CAVA Group is saying what many investors have suspected. There is a divide between the company’s higher-end and lower-end consumers. The latter are under pressure, which is clouding the company’s outlook.\nHowever, that’s different from saying that consumers are rejecting the company’s health-conscious menu out of hand. That means the revenue drop may be cyclical.\nCAVA stock may fall further in the short term, but that should create a buyable dip for investors. One reason for that is the expectation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September.\nThe CME FedWatch tool now gives that rate cut a 99.9% possibility. That would likely relieve some consumer pressure. Revenue growth and a more reasonable valuation could spark an end-of-year rally.\nThe CAVA Group analyst forecasts on MarketBeat show that analysts feel the same way. Five analysts have sharply lowered their price targets for CAVA stock, and each target is below the consensus price of $103.56.\nBefore you consider CAVA Group, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Catalysts Align: Archer Beats Estimates, Delivers Aircraft to UAE", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/catalysts-align-archer-beats-estimates-delivers-aircraft-to-uae/", "text": "Archer Aviation Today\n$9.85 +0.03 (+0.31%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $2.82\n▼\n$13.92 - Price Target\n- $13.43\nArcher Aviation's NYSE: ACHR second-quarter 2025 results have provided investors with the clearest signals yet of its transition from a developmental concept to a commercial reality.\nThe electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) leader not only reported better-than-expected earnings but, more importantly, announced it had achieved a critical operational milestone: the delivery of its first piloted aircraft to a key launch partner in the United Arab Emirates.\nFollowing the news, the Archer’s stock price saw an initial positive surge before pulling back, a move that creates a potential valuation disconnect for investors to analyze. Archer’s Q2 update demonstrates significant fundamental progress that reinforces the long-term bullish case and may present an attractive entry point for growth-focused investors who have been waiting for the right time to invest in the stock.\nArcher's Impressive Q2 Financials\nThe most critical takeaway from Archer's second-quarter financials is the company's strong and industry-leading liquidity position. Archer ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, a result of its successful capital raise in June.\nThis fortress balance sheet is paramount for a pre-revenue company in a capital-intensive industry like advanced air mobility. It provides a substantial financial runway that significantly mitigates near-term financing risk and ensures the company is fully funded to execute its plans through its commercial launch and initial production scaling. This massive cash position allows management to focus on engineering and operational milestones without the constant pressure of near-term fundraising.\nOn the earnings front, Archer demonstrated solid financial management. The company reported Q2 2025 earnings per share (EPS) of -22 cents, beating the analyst consensus estimate of -26 cents. While the company's GAAP net loss of $206 million reflects its continued heavy investment in growth, the beat on EPS signals effective cost control.\nFurther, Archer's spending was in line with expectations, with non-GAAP operating expenses of $112 million falling within its guided range. Looking ahead to the third quarter, the company projects a controlled increase in spending, with guidance for non-GAAP operating expenses between $115 million and $125 million, reflecting a planned and transparent ramp-up of its strategic investments.\nArcher's Tangible Progress\nThe company’s Q2 update and earnings call were about more than Archer’s financials; it was a powerful demonstration of operational execution. The most significant achievement was the successful delivery of its first piloted Midnight aircraft to the UAE in July 2025, meeting the \"this summer\" timeline management had previously set. This is a pivotal moment, activating the company's Launch Edition program with its partner Abu Dhabi Aviation (ADA).\nCritically for investors, Archer confirmed it expects to receive initial commercial payments from this program later in 2025, marking the company's first concrete step from a development-stage entity toward a revenue-generating enterprise. This delivery moves Archer's story from computer renderings and test flights to physical aircraft in an international launch market.\nProgress is also evident on the manufacturing front. Archer confirmed it now has six Midnight aircraft in production across its California and Georgia facilities, with three of those in the final assembly stage. This demonstrates tangible movement towards its goal of building up to 10 aircraft in 2025, which are needed for certification and early deployments.\nFurthermore, Archer is proactively building out its future revenue streams by accelerating its defense strategy. During the quarter, the company made two strategic acquisitions to bolster its Archer Defense program. It acquired a key patent portfolio and talent from Overair, a company with deep expertise in advanced rotorcraft technology, and specialized manufacturing assets from Mission Critical Composites.\nThese moves are designed to accelerate Archer's ability to meet growing demand from allied defense programs and create a second major market vertical, diversifying its business model beyond commercial passenger service.\nBullish Options and Analyst Conviction\nWall Street's reaction to Archer's progress has been notably bullish, providing external validation for the company's strategy. In the lead-up to and immediately following the earnings announcement, there was a surge in bullish options activity.\nArcher Aviation Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$13.4336.33% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 8 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $9.85 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $18.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $13.43 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $10.00 |\n|---|\nArcher Aviation Stock Forecast Details\nA high volume of call options was purchased, suggesting sophisticated traders were positioning for a positive reaction to Archer's updates and its forward-looking commentary.\nThis sentiment is also being echoed by Archer’s analyst community. Key analysts from firms like HC Wainwright and Needham & Company reiterated their Buy ratings immediately following the report, signaling their continued confidence in the company's direction. The consensus among eight covering analysts remains a Moderate Buy, with an average price target of $13.43.\nBased on the August 11th closing price of $9.55, this target implies a potential upside of over 40%. HC Wainwright's high-end price target of $18.00 suggests some analysts see even greater long-term value as the company continues to execute. This combination of bullish options activity and strong analyst conviction indicates that, despite stock price volatility, many market experts believe in Archer's growth story.\nCleared for Takeoff: Archer's Investment Case Strengthens\nArcher's second-quarter report was about more than just numbers; it was a demonstration of execution on critical promises, most notably the delivery of its first aircraft to a launch partner in the UAE.

Needham & Company reiterated its Buy rating and raised its price target from $45 to $55. KeyCorp also maintained its Overweight rating while boosting its target from $40 to $50.\nCantor Fitzgerald followed suit with one of the most significant upward adjustments, lifting its price target from $35 to $54.\nThese upgrades have notably impacted market sentiment, pushing the consensus price target from $30.40 just a month ago to $42.27 today. While this is slightly below the stock’s current market price, the narrowing gap signals growing confidence in Rocket Lab’s growth trajectory and earnings potential.\nIn total, 13 analysts have given the stock a consensus rating of Moderate Buy, underscoring the belief that Rocket Lab remains well-positioned to deliver further upside despite its strong performance this year.\nGeost Deal Completion Marks a Strategic Leap\nOn August 12, Rocket Lab announced it had officially closed its $275 million acquisition of the parent holding company of Geost, a leader in electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) sensor systems for national security space missions.\nThe deal, first revealed in late May, was financed through approximately $125 million in cash and 3.06 million Rocket Lab shares, with the possibility of an additional $50 million earnout based on future revenue milestones.\nThe acquisition is more than just an expansion of Rocket Lab’s portfolio. It transforms the company into a vertically integrated space and defense contractor. Rocket Lab can now deliver not only launch services and spacecraft but also mission-ready payloads, giving it an edge in securing high-value defense contracts.\nGeost’s EO/IR technologies are critical for missile warning and tracking, tactical intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, Earth observation, and space domain awareness. These capabilities align directly with next-generation U.S. defense initiatives such as the Golden Dome for America concept and the Space Development Agency’s Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.\nGeost has a long track record of delivering reliable and resilient payloads for classified and unclassified missions. Under Rocket Lab’s umbrella, the company gains access to greater resources, manufacturing expertise, and the ability to scale production to meet growing demand for national security applications.\nRocket Lab’s founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, emphasized that the ability to build and deploy entire satellite systems rapidly will be a cornerstone of future U.S. defense strategy.\nStrengthening the Growth Story\nThe timing of the Geost acquisition’s completion alongside the wave of bullish analyst activity creates a reinforcing narrative for Rocket Lab. Analysts clearly see potential for both near-term and long-term growth, and the company is executing strategic initiatives that enhance its relevance in critical defense markets.\nAs geopolitical tensions and space-based defense needs continue to rise, demand for integrated solutions like those Rocket Lab now offers is expected to grow.\nThe company’s unique combination of launch, spacecraft, and advanced payload capabilities gives it a competitive advantage in winning future contracts, particularly in the national security sector.\nBefore you consider Rocket Lab, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

The trends leading into the report, likely to be sustained after, include bullish institutional and analyst activity with analyst coverage firm, sentiment firming, and rising price targets.\nThe critical takeaway is that July and early August activity included several upgrades to Buy or higher equivalents, and the price targets led to the high-end range. That puts ONON stock at $64 within the next 12 months and is likely to be a low-ball target.\nTechnically speaking, On Holdings’ stock price is in an uptrend, and the post-release action in August confirmed it. The stock advanced approximately 10% in premarket trading, holding the gains into the open session, rebounding from recent lows and the uptrend line, with volume rising in support of the move.\nThe volume increase is noteworthy because it reflects an increase in demand for the stock as its price fell, increasing again as the rebound began, but there is a risk. The market for this stock is struggling with resistance at the moving averages, but will likely overcome it and continue the advance before the end of Q3.\nThe risk is short interest, which was elevated at nearly 10% in July after rising for three consecutive months.\nOn Holdings' Beat and Raise Quarter Underpin Stock Price Advance\nON Semiconductor Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$56.8412.49% UpsideHoldBased on 26 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $50.53 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $85.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $56.84 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $34.00 |\n|---|\nON Semiconductor Stock Forecast Details\nOn Holdings had an impressive quarter with revenue growing by 32% on strength in all categories. The gains were driven by new products and verticals, with strength centered in the higher-margin direct-to-consumer (DTC) business.\nDTC sales increased by 47.2% and 54.3% on an FX-neutral basis, while wholesales grew by a smaller but still strong 23.1%, 28.8% adjusted for FX translation.\nThe margin news is more impressive. The company’s operational efficiency and improved revenue leverage drove a significant increase in gross and operating margins.\nThe net result is an adjusted EBITDA margin and a 220-basis-point improvement, a 50% increase in adjusted EBITDA. More importantly, the company raised its guidance to reflect the strength and expects it to continue.\nOn Holdings Raises Guidance: No Red Flags on the Balance Sheet\nThe guidance forecasts full-year growth to run in alignment with the quarter, up about 300 basis points from the prior guidance, and for profitability to remain strong. The trends and reporting history suggest outperformance is likely and that the subsequent guides will also be improved.\nLonger term, On Holdings is forecasted to grow revenue-digit CAGR through the end of the decade and at a high double-digit CAGR at an accelerated pace. This setup can sustain the analysts, institutional, and stock price trends.\nOn Holdings’ balance sheet is a fortress capable of sustaining the long-term strategy of building shareholder value. The highlights at the end of Q2 include decreased cash and increased liabilities offset by increased total assets and steady equity. The company carries no significant long-term debt and is well-capitalized, with total liabilities running at approximately 1.35x the cash position.\nBefore you consider ON, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Why BigBear.ai Stock's Dip on Earnings Can Be an Opportunity", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-bigbearai-stocks-dip-on-earnings-can-be-an-opportunity/", "text": "When a stock you’re following is about to report earnings, it can be an anxious time for investors. The day of the release and the days that follow are often decisive in determining whether to hold the position, sell it, or place the stock on a watchlist for future consideration if conditions improve.\nBigBear.ai Today\n$5.85 -0.29 (-4.72%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $1.26\n▼\n$10.36 - Price Target\n- $6.00\nToday, shares of BigBear.ai Holdings Inc. NYSE: BBAI pose that exact question, one that investors surely would like to have answered through the actual data. Although the numbers for the company’s latest quarterly earnings results seemed bad, there is some hidden information that most might have missed, as evidenced by the market’s reaction to sell the stock off by 15% in a single day.\nHowever, that big sell-off was met with just as much buying enthusiasm, as the company traded higher toward the ranges it held before the earnings sell-off.\nThis reaction and optimism are based on one key piece of the financial profile, which is crucial for turning the stock around in the coming months and quarters and catching up to the rest of the aerospace sector.\nWhat Investors Might Have Missed\nTaking the quarterly earnings press release at face value, sellers were initially justified in letting go of their BigBear.ai stock; however, they might have missed one important piece of information, which will become clear in just a minute. First of all, an 18% revenue decline may be something to worry about, that is, until investors see where it came from.\nThe United States Army has pulled back some of its current spending (according to the company’s management), which cannot be blamed on BigBear.ai, but rather an industry-wide issue likely to affect other names in the space. That being said, a wider loss in terms of net income should be expected.\nAnd that is exactly what happened, and likely the reason why the stock sold off so aggressively. BigBear.ai reported a net loss of $228.6 million, compared to a net loss of only $14.4 million for the same quarter last year. Of course, this directly affects the company’s path to net profitability and therefore its valuation, but that’s where being a savvy investor comes into play.\nThe bulk of that net loss was driven by a $135.7 million decrease in the value of convertible bonds and other derivatives, which has nothing to do with the company’s core operations and its primary business. Investment bankers would call this a “non-recurring” item, which typically gets added back to the income statement for a better picture.\nAll told, investors can look to the cash flow statement to get the true state of affairs, and seeing a net operating outflow of $3.8 million compared to last year’s $7 million outflow is a completely different story. It suggests that BigBear.ai actually had a much better quarter than the headline numbers may suggest.\nDemand Is Very Much Alive\nAfter the stock dipped by 15% in a single day after earnings, a few big players in the market decided to step in and react to the numbers that were just broken down. They realized that this reaction was unjustified and that a fair value for the stock may be much higher than where it trades today.\nBigBear.ai Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$6.002.56% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 4 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $5.85 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $8.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $6.00 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $4.00 |\n|---|\nBigBear.ai Stock Forecast Details\nInvestors can note that allocators from JPMorgan Chase & Co. decided to build a stake worth $16.3 million in BigBear.ai stock the day of the earnings release, perhaps aiding in the stock’s quick rebound after it bottomed out altogether. This should also confirm that these bankers view the non-recurring change in derivatives as an opportunity.\nThis opportunity is not lost on the bearish side of the equation either, as short sellers closed down 9.5% of the company’s short interest over the past month, a sign of initial bearish capitulation. However, since there are still $491.6 million worth of open short positions, a recovery rally could trigger what’s known as a “short squeeze.”\nA short squeeze happens when short sellers are forced to close their positions at a loss, which involves buying back the stock and can add to upward momentum. That’s aside from the point; besides the favorable cash flow and income differences, investors still need to consider one more factor.\nBigBear.ai reported up to $380 million in backlog of orders, an impressive figure, despite the Army contracts being pulled all over the industry. This justifies the recent institutional buying and optimism for the company’s future, catching up to the pack.\nBefore you consider BigBear.ai, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Rigetti Stock: A Long-Term Quantum Play Facing Short-Term Tests", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/rigetti-stock-a-long-term-quantum-play-facing-short-term-tests/", "text": "Rigetti Computing Today\nRGTIRigetti Computing\n$16.63 -0.02 (-0.12%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $0.66\n▼\n$21.42 - Price Target\n- $17.43\nShares of Rigetti Computing Inc. NASDAQ: RGTI are down more than 2% the day after the quantum computing company delivered a mixed earnings report. Revenue of $1.8 million was roughly in line with expectations for $1.87 million.\nThe -5 cents earnings per share (EPS) came in 1 cent better than the 6-cent loss analysts had forecast. However, the company also reported a substantial year-over-year (YOY) operating loss.\nThe important thing to remember about investing in Rigetti is that this is a long-term technology story that is being heavily influenced by short-term momentum traders. Here’s what both camps need to know.\nThe Quantum Story Is Still in the Early Stages\nThere are several reasons to be bullish about quantum computing stocks and Rigetti in particular. But the company is not profitable, and that’s not expected to change anytime soon. Rigetti reminded shareholders of its economic situation with a $350 million capital raise through its ATM equity program.\nHowever, that does leave the company with over $570 million of cash on its balance sheet with no debt to fund its ongoing research and development. The company believes it has enough cash for at least the next 12 months. Nevertheless, it’s a reminder that risks exist in this sector.\nRigetti Made 2 Significant Announcements\nFor speculative investors holding on to RGTI stock for the long term, progress is important. To that end, Rigetti had two notable announcements in its quarterly report.\nFirst, the company released the industry’s largest multi-chip quantum computer, the CFS-1360, which achieved 99.5% median two-qubit gate fidelity and a 2x reduction in error rates versus its prior system.\nInvestors also know that Rigetti is pursuing a multi-chip approach and expects to deploy a 100+ qubit chiplet-based systems at 99.5% two-qubit fidelity by the end of 2025. The company is also forecasting quantum advantage in approximately four years with over 1,000 qubits, 99.9% fidelity, faster gate speeds, and error correction.\nCommercial Adoption Is Years Away\nOne risk for long-term investors is the time it will take for quantum computing to move past the conceptual stage. Right now, virtually all of Rigetti’s revenue is tied to U.S. government contracts. That’s because the technology is still in the experimental stage and governments are the ones with willingness to take on the financial risk.\nRigetti Computing Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$17.434.80% UpsideBuyBased on 6 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $16.63 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $20.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $17.43 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $12.00 |\n|---|\nRigetti Computing Stock Forecast Details\nTo move beyond the government sector, quantum computing companies will have to show:\n- A demonstrable commercial advantage to classical computing; this means the ability to provide repeatable, stable performance with real-world workloads\n- An accessible platform that can be integrated with major cloud computing providers\n- Industry-specific proof of concepts that deliver cost savings or performance boosts compared to high-end classical computing\n- Lower costs and improved reliability\nNone of these hurdles is insurmountable for Rigetti or other quantum computing companies, but Rigetti management has said they will be in the research and development stage for about four years. That tracks with analysts' forecasts that it could take between three and five years for quantum computing companies to start generating even a portion of income from commercial customers.\nShort Interest May Give Bears a Short-Term Upper Hand\nHeading into earnings, short interest in RGTI stock was over 17%. Although it was down nearly 4% in the past month, it’s still at a level where it can have an outsized influence on the stock price.\nFor example, RGTI stock was moving higher before the earnings report, moving above its 20-day SMA and closing at $16.20 on heavy volume. But momentum indicators suggest that short traders may have the upper hand.\nThe MACD remains positive but is flattening, hinting that upside strength could be fading without fresh catalysts. Traders should watch the $17 level closely. This has been a point of resistance twice this summer.\nA decisive breakout could target the $18.50 to $19 range, while failure at this level risks a pullback toward the mid-$15 support zone. If the sell-off increases, traders should eye the $14 level, which was a point of resistance earlier this year but may now act as support.\nBefore you consider Rigetti Computing, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

The losses are tied to the company’s ramping business, scaling to meet the wicked demand for cloud-native AI compute capacity, and it is money well spent.\nThe company’s revenue is growing at a hyper-triple-digit pace and will likely accelerate in the upcoming quarters.\nCoreWeave’s revenue pipeline is driven by demand from AI labs, enterprises, and hyperscalers, and it's worth more than 500% annualized growth relative to the Q2 results. The takeaway is that the release sparked a price correction, and one that investors should take advantage of because of the robust outlook.\nThis company is forecasted to sustain a high, double-digit revenue CAGR through the decade's end and grow earnings significantly faster.\nCoreWeave Growth Tops 200%, Exceeds Forecasts\nCoreWeave had a solid quarter with revenue growing by 210.3% year-over-year (YOY) to $1.21 billion. The strength was driven by demand and execution, and the company’s lean into NVIDIA’s NASDAQ: NVDA ecosystem, the driving force of AI markets today. It is the first provider to host the full Blackwell lineup, a move that plays into the ballooning expenses.\nRegarding the operating margin, the adjusted results reveal a 600 basis point contraction in operating margin and a 1000 basis point increase in the operating loss. However, as bad as it sounds, other AI-focused companies, such as Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META, a CRWV customer, have proven that increased AI spending leads to accelerating top- and bottom-line results.\nCoreWeave’s guidance affirms the outlook for ongoing strength. The company increased its outlook for Q3 and the full year, raising the revenue range to above the prior high-end and the consensus estimates. Due to the growing business momentum, the company will likely outperform its Q3 targets, and another guidance increase will follow.\nCoreWeave Is Leveraging Value for Its Investors\nThe balance sheet and share count highlights reflect intensive capital-raising but do not pose a risk for investors in the long term. The share count, while up 132% YOY, is unlikely to be increased significantly from this point, and the balance sheet remains healthy.\nCoreWeave Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$99.803.10% UpsideHoldBased on 26 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $96.80 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $200.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $99.80 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $32.00 |\n|---|\nCoreWeave Stock Forecast Details\nThe 37% increase in long-term debt is offset by increased cash and equivalents, current and total assets, with total assets up $8.4 billion to outpace the liability increase by $2.5 billion. The net result is that long-term debt leverage remains low at only 2.8x equity, and equity has shifted from negative to positive. Investors can expect to see equity continue to improve as the quarters progress.\nThe bad news is that, despite the positive biases, the analysts' sentiment trends align with an outlook for a significant price correction. The data reported by MarketBeat reveals coverage is increasing and sentiment is firm, but the rating is only a Hold, and the consensus price target lags the market.\nThe price action in CoreWeave stock increased by 50% from late July to mid-August, outpacing the consensus by approximately 65%. Although the revision trend is positive and the high-end range suggests another 30% upside is possible, the consensus of July and August targets puts this market in the range of $100 to $110, a 20% downside from the early August highs.\nCoreWeave Buying Opportunity: Wait for the Market to Make the First Move\nCoreWeave stock pulled back by nearly 10% in premarket trading following the release. The move aligns with recent support targets and may trigger buying at the open, but there is risk of a deeper pullback. The price action shows significant resistance at $147, which may lead to increasingly bearish activity in late August.\nThe critical support target is near the 30-day EMA at $125; a move below that level will likely result in a retest of the August lows near $100.\nBefore you consider CoreWeave, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

Over the past eight years, it’s finished first or second among the S&P 500’s 11 sectors five times. Since the conclusion of the last bear market, tech posted gains of 57.8% in 2023 and 36.6% in 2024. This year, its 14.36% gain is second only to industrials’ gain of 14.47%.\nMuch of its recent success was predicated on the explosive demand for AI components and infrastructure. So when news breaks of anything AI-adjacent, it has an outsized impact on the sector—specifically for companies that operate in the microchips and semiconductor industry.\nThat was the case on Aug. 6 when President Trump announced a 100% tariff on imported chips. Details are murky, but on the surface, the announcement could be devastating for companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company NYSE: TSM while serving as a boon for stateside manufacturers who are forecast to enjoy a 7.3% CAGR in the U.S. market from 2025 to 2030. While NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA receives the lion’s share of attention in the semiconductor space, these three companies are also poised to profit.\nAMD: Strong Revenue Growth and AI Demand Drive Bullish Outlook\nAdvanced Micro Devices Today\nAMDAdvanced Micro Devices\n$176.14 -1.37 (-0.77%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $76.48\n▼\n$186.65 - P/E Ratio\n- 101.23\n- Price Target\n- $180.12\nAdvanced Micro Devices NASDAQ: AMD has a market cap of $279.58 billion, which may seem like a drop in the bucket compared to NVIDIA’s $4.44 trillion, but its offerings are equally impressive. The company operates through data center, client, gaming, and embedded segments, offering microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), chipsets, data center solutions, data processing units and adaptive system-on-chip products.\nWhen AMD reported Q2 earnings, it missed on EPS by 6 cents, but it beat on revenue with $7.69 billion, representing 31.70% year-over-year (YOY) growth. In its earnings call, CEO Dr. Lisa Su noted that the company saw robust demand across its computer and AI product portfolio, with revenue growth led by record server and PC processor sales—or CPUs, a type of microchip.\nBeyond record demand for its CPUs, there’s an additional tailwind in play for AMD. NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices cut deals with the Trump administration that allow them to continue exporting made-for-China chips in exchange for a 15% payment to the U.S. federal government. While an export tax may seem counterintuitive to AMD’s bottom line, analysts estimate that line of business in China could earn $3 billion per quarter from sales of AMD’s MI308 chip.\nThere’s a reason why institutional ownership of AMD stands at 71.34% while short interest is just 2.76%.\nMicron Beats Q3 Estimates With $9.3B in Revenue and Strong EPS\nMicron Technology Today\nMUMicron Technology\n$123.55 +2.68 (+2.22%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $61.54\n▼\n$129.85 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.37%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 22.26\n- Price Target\n- $147.24\nMicron Technology NASDAQ: MU is another strong option in the semiconductor and microchip space.

EPS was $1.91 versus estimates of $1.57 and revenue was $9.30 billion versus estimates of $8.83 billion.\nAccording to CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, that was record quarterly revenue while data center revenue more than doubled YOY. In addition to Trump’s tariff announcement, Micron updated guidance for its fiscal Q4, which ends Aug. 28. That revision included revenue of $11.2 billion, non-GAAP gross margins of 44.5%, and EPS of $2.85, or 49.21% higher than Q3 EPS. Mehrotra noted that the company “expects to grow revenue by 15%.”\nThe company’s also expanding its U.S. footprint. In 2023, it began construction on the biggest chip fabrication plant in the U.S., which should go online in 2026. Micron is favored by institutional investors more than AMD with ownership at 80.84%. Over the past 12 months, buyers outnumbered sellers 1,348 to 890, with inflows exceeding outflows $14.10 billion to $9.78 billion. Short interest is just 2.99%.\nBroadcom Stock Rises on AI Chip Strength and Capital Returns\nBroadcom Today\n$305.76 -0.58 (-0.19%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $134.90\n▼\n$317.35 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.77%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 114.52\n- Price Target\n- $295.96\nBroadcom NASDAQ: AVGO could also see outsized profits from Trump’s chip tariffs. Earlier this year, the company leapfrogged Tesla to become the seventh largest publicly traded company by market cap. Broadcom operates in two segments: infrastructure software and semiconductor solutions, the latter of which makes it a pure-play chip investment.\nWhen AVGO reported Q2 earnings, it announced EPS of $1.58 versus estimates of $1.57 and quarterly revenue of $15 billion, which was an increase of 20.2% YOY and beat estimates of $14.98 billion. Icing the cake, the company returned $7 billion to shareholders in Q2 through $2.8 billion in dividends and $4.2 billion in stock repurchases.\nWith tariff momentum at its back, Broadcom provided Q3 guidance of $15.8 billion in revenue, including $5.1 billion just from its AI semiconductor business line. That would mark 10 consecutive quarters of growth as the company continues to hyperscale. The smart money is in agreement on AVGO’s future: Institutional ownership is 76.43%, and inflows of $225.68 billion have far exceeded outflows of $40.75 billion over the past 12 months. At just 1.01%, short interest is lower than that of AMD and Micron.\nBefore you consider Advanced Micro Devices, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Data Centers in Demand—This REIT Owns a Whole Portfolio", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/data-centers-in-demand-this-reit-owns-a-whole-portfolio/", "text": "The technology sector is making waves again, both in the stock market and on the political spectrum. This time around, the attention has centered on the growth of data center presence inside the United States, which creates many opportunities for companies exposed to artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and semiconductors in general.\nEquinix Today\n$769.65 -11.66 (-1.49%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $701.41\n▼\n$994.03 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.44%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 75.38\n- Price Target\n- $962.24\nHowever, it also creates a more subtle earnings growth pocket in those involved with building or leasing those data centers across the country, which is where today’s stock pick comes into play. Equinix Inc. NASDAQ: EQIX is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that controls and leases out data centers to major customers across the country, presenting a tremendous opportunity for the coming years.\nThis isn't a short-term trade but a long-term investment opportunity that merits consistent addition over time. The onshoring of computing capacity and data centers in the U.S. is just beginning, and major players like NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE: TSM currently have only a small portion of the domestic presence they aim to achieve.\nWhy Equinix’s Scale Advantage May Unlock Future Revenue Upside\nAs most of the attention was focused on semiconductor names and direct players in artificial intelligence, these lateral plays have often been overlooked, which is why investors can find Equinix stock trading at only 78% of its 52-week high. This current valuation is unrelated to underlying fundamentals, but rather due to a lack of attention.\nThat attention is quickly shifting to data center construction and rollouts, a factor that could significantly influence how the market views a stock like Equinix in the future. With this in mind, investors should begin checking off a list now before it is too late to act on this REIT.\nOne of the most important metrics to watch for REITs is adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), which accounts for the unique accounting rules and benefits tied to property ownership.\nOn this metric, investors can see that Equinix reported up to $9.91 for its latest quarter, an 11% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The key question is how the company can achieve such growth with only 4% revenue growth. This is explained by the strong demand and expansion of data centers nationwide.\nAchieving a larger scale allows Equinix to distribute its costs and terms more favorably. That expansion will eventually show in higher revenue figures when these leases can be booked as revenue. Still, for now, this AFFO growth is exactly what investors should lean on.\nWall Street Recognizes the Opportunity in EQIX\nSeeing the financials grow right along the entire data center space now and into the future, Wall Street analysts had little choice but to land on a consensus Buy rating for Equinix stock, alongside a $959.9 per share price target. Although this valuation is attractive, with a 23.7% upside, the realistic upside is significantly higher.\nEquinix Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$962.2425.02% UpsideBuyBased on 29 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $769.65 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $1,200.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $962.24 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $798.00 |\n|---|\nEquinix Stock Forecast Details\nEquinix’s 52-week high has been set at $994 per share, a level reached during the early months of 2025. However, as the year progressed, the company's focus on other technology players meant this name failed to capture the attention needed to sustain demand for its stock.\nThis is why investors could reasonably expect analysts to eventually start to float their valuations a bit closer to this 52-week high, especially as demand for data centers starts to roll out. If that assumption sounds too bold for investors, they can consider how the rest of the market feels about Equinix as well.\nThe easiest way to do this is to compare Equinix stock’s current valuation to that of its peers in the REIT industry and identify any outlier figures that warrant further examination of potential future scenarios. Equinix stock’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 76.0x is a clear outlier.\nThe rest of the REIT industry now trades at an average P/E of only 30.7x, making Equinix the premium name in this space. While most investors will see this as overextended and primed for a downfall, seasoned investors and traders will remind them that the market is always willing to pay up for the names it believes can outperform peers and the broader market.\nIn the case of Equinix, the right fundamental and financial story stands strong to justify this premium and then some, as attention comes back into data centers, investors may want to front-run the rest of the market in this fierce race.\nBefore you consider Equinix, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "3 Stocks to Consider as Tension Builds in Energy Markets", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-stocks-to-consider-as-tension-builds-in-energy-markets/", "text": "Geopolitical tensions don’t stop at the current trade tariff negotiations between the United States and its major trading partners; other complications are now brewing in the energy markets as well. New measures have been implemented to prevent countries from purchasing oil from Russia in an effort to de-escalate the ongoing war with Ukraine.\nConsidering that Russia is one of the largest players in the oil business, markets are now worried that these measures may disrupt supply chains and production volumes, directly impacting the price of oil. With this in mind, it would make sense for investors to start looking into a few names in the energy sector to find potential upside in the coming months.\nSome of these names are centered at the middle of the value chain, and are some of the biggest in the space as well; others focus on the top of the value chain and offer tremendous earnings growth potential, albeit with a much smaller size. Creating a watchlist made up of Exxon Mobil Corp. NYSE: XOM, Chevron Corp. NYSE: CVX, and Transocean Ltd. NYSE: RIG can give investors better odds from now until 2025 is over.\nWhy Exxon May Outperform Shortly\nExxon Mobil Today\n$106.70 +0.21 (+0.20%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $97.80\n▼\n$126.34 - Dividend Yield\n- 3.71%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 15.16\n- Price Target\n- $125.84\nWith the second-quarter earnings season in full swing, investors are watching closely to gauge what the back half of the year could hold for specific sectors and economies. Exxon’s recent earnings-per-share (EPS) beat is a prime example, setting the stage for a potentially higher ceiling in the quarters ahead.\nWall Street analysts had expected the company to report $1.47 in EPS. Instead, it posted a significant beat of $1.64. This demonstrates resilience in the brand’s global reach and scale, as it outperforms expectations even in the first half, when oil prices remained at the lower end of historical ranges.\nAs most investors know, where EPS growth goes, so does the stock price, and trading at only 85% of its 52-week high, Exxon Mobil provides enough room for the market to price in this earnings beat and any future growth potential.\nChevron Stock Hits the Trifecta\nChevron Today\n$155.44 -1.11 (-0.71%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $132.04\n▼\n$168.96 - Dividend Yield\n- 4.40%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 20.01\n- Price Target\n- $164.33\nNow trading at 95% of its 52-week high, Chevron stock seems to be leading the pack in today’s list. The market has good reason to reward this name with bullish momentum, which can continue for months to come, even if oil prices don’t experience a shock from the Russian situation.\nSporting another EPS beat of $1.77 compared to the $1.58 expectation, Wall Street analysts had to react accordingly with revised valuations and ratings for this company. The consensus view is now for a Hold and a $164.1 price target on Chevron stock, though some analysts were willing to stand out.\nJosh Silverstein from the UBS Group has reiterated a Buy target alongside a new $186 per share valuation for Chevron stock, calling for 20% further upside and a new 52-week high to be made in this name.\nOf course, the potential for higher oil prices and continued EPS growth isn't the only factor driving interest in this stock; there’s another critical factor to consider.\nBy paying $6.84 in dividends to its shareholders, Chevron stock is now offering an annualized dividend yield of 4.4% to beat inflation rates and the benchmark 10-year treasury bond yield in the United States, a benefit most investors would be happy to have in today’s market.\nThe Full Force of Transocean’s Earnings Swing\nTransocean Today\n$2.95 0.00 (0.00%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- Price Target\n- $4.26\nYet another beat in this list, Transocean stock offers the most potential growth and discount for investors. However, the caveat is that this $2.9 billion company is also the most volatile out of the group. The reason for the volatility lies in the company’s business model itself, but that is also where most of the reward comes from.\nAs a drilling equipment manufacturer and lessor, Transocean’s revenue and demand are directly tied to oil prices, meaning investors only receive payment if a price shock occurs in the future. Looking at this deal from a risk-to-reward perspective, it’s clear that it is an asymmetrical setup today.\nOil prices could fall by $10 per barrel on the risk side, but they could also rally by $40 per barrel on the reward side. This is why Wall Street analysts forecast a net EPS figure of eight cents for the fourth quarter of 2025 in Transocean, enough of a jump from today’s net loss of $0.10 to send the stock flying.\nBefore you consider Transocean, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Transocean wasn't on the list.\nWhile Transocean currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nJust getting into the stock market?

ESPN, one of the largest subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company NYSE: DIS, announced major agreements last week with two of the world’s most prominent sports leagues: the National Football League (NFL) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).\nThe deals mark a significant push by ESPN to bolster its live sports portfolio ahead of a critical streaming launch, underscoring the growing battle for premium sports rights in an increasingly crowded media landscape.\nThe agreements bring high-value programming to ESPN’s new direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming service, which is scheduled to launch before the start of the NFL and college football seasons.\nTKO Group Today\n$185.49 -3.36 (-1.78%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $113.16\n▼\n$194.76 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.82%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 76.65\n- Price Target\n- $187.38\nESPN reached deep into its pockets to secure these deals, including surrendering a 10% equity stake to the NFL itself.\nFor Disney, these moves come at a pivotal time as the company seeks to stabilize subscriber growth and solidify its position against rivals like Amazon Prime and Peacock, both of which have been aggressively chasing live sports content.\nBut how beneficial are these new arrangements to parent companies Disney and TKO Group Holdings Inc. NYSE: TKO?\nToday, we’ll explore why these companies came together, their strategy moving forward, and how their stocks responded in the days following the announcements.\nDisney Adds Valuable Media Properties to Growing Streaming Platform\nWalt Disney Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$131.1812.54% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 28 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $116.56 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $147.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $131.18 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $95.00 |\n|---|\nWalt Disney Stock Forecast Details\nFor Disney, adding NFL and WWE programming to its new DTC streaming app was crucial for attracting customers who might be feeling tapped out over yet another monthly subscription. Launching August 21, the new ESPN streaming app will feature programming pillars like NFL Network, NFL Red Zone Channel, and WWE ‘Premium Live Events’ such as WrestleMania, the Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam.\nWith an expected price of $29.99 per month (or $299.99 annually), this new ESPN DTC app needs to provide compelling value to consumers, and sporting events like NFL games and WWE specials remain one of the few areas of live TV where customers are willing to pay a premium. ESPN is planning to offer more than 47,000 live sporting events through this new streamer, with a cheaper option priced at $11.99 per month, featuring more targeted events like FCS-level college football, soccer, and tennis.\nThe NFL and WWE boast two of the most passionate and dedicated fan bases on Earth, and adding these massive demographics will complement Disney’s network of streaming options like Disney+ and Hulu. The company plans to offer a variety of packages and bundles for its multi-pronged streaming attack, and the launch date isn’t a coincidence either—the FOX ONE sports app is also being released on August 21.\nNFL and WWE Add Revenue Streams and Collaborative Partnerships\nThe rights to these events didn’t come cheap, and both the NFL and WWE will have lucrative new revenue streams for signing over some control to ESPN. For the NFL, the agreement with ESPN comes with a 10% equity stake, which will allow the league to make sure the programming aligns with its mission and goals.\nIt also means the NFL has a financial interest in the success of ESPN’s new streaming service, which means promotion across the NFL’s various media channels, live events, and outreach programs. An equity stake is a unique agreement between a league and a national programmer, and could finally mark a shift away from the traditional licensing models that have shown diminishing ROI.\nWWE (and its parent, TKO Holdings) receives $1.6 billion over five years in their deal, which includes ESPN paying $325 million per year for exclusive rights to stream marquee live events like WrestleMania. Formerly available on Pay-Per-View, WWE’s premium events currently air on NBC streamer Peacock, which has a lower price point but also less reach than the ESPN conglomerate.\nWWE and NBC agreed to a five-year deal worth just over $1 billion in 2021, but this time, NBC failed to match the $325 million ESPN was offering annually for the exclusive premium event rights. WWE not only gets lucrative revenue streams, but new partnership opportunities with ESPN’s cast of personalities, many of whom (such as College Gameday’s Pat McAfee) are already involved in pro wrestling. WWE’s weekly flagship program, Monday Night Raw, will continue to air on Netflix Inc. NASDAQ: NFLX through 2034.\nHow The Deals Have Affected DIS and TKO Stocks\nTKO Group Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$187.381.02% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 16 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $185.49 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $225.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $187.38 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $143.00 |\n|---|\nTKO Group Stock Forecast Details\nTKO shares have surged more than 15% in the week since the announcement, although some of that gain was due to the company’s new $7.7 billion UFC agreement with Paramount. The company’s Q2 earnings report, released after the August 6 close, also boosted confidence as revenue grew 53.7% year-over-year (YOY) to $1.31 billion, above the expected $1.23 billion.\nThanks in part to these new licensing deals, the company boosted its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $4.63 billion to $4.69 billion, the second straight quarter its raised guidance. Shares are also now trading above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, so technical and fundamental factors are beginning to align in TKO.\nFor DIS shareholders, the latest foray into the streaming space is an expensive endeavor, and the company is counting on rabid fan bases paying higher rates for their favorite live programming. A $29.99 price point isn’t aimed at mass adoption; it's for dedicated sports fans. While offering the NFL Red Zone Channel, NFL Network, and WWE’s biggest shows is an impressive lineup, pushback from fans about the elevated price could dent the potential revenue boosts.\nAdditionally, Disney risks cannibalizing some of its own growth if customers cancel Disney+ or Hulu to pay for the new app. So far, investors see more of a value proposition in TKO shares; DIS is down more than 2% over the last week and will likely need to demonstrate substantial subscriber numbers for its new DTC service to catch TKO’s gains.\nBefore you consider Walt Disney, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

NASDAQ: NVDA is up a blistering 35%.\nThe latest 10% drop to close out July broke the steady uptrend in place since spring, raising questions for long-term holders about the stock’s next move. Yet for those on the sidelines, the recent weakness could be setting up an attractive entry point.\nIt does not necessarily demand a multi-year holding period but is undoubtedly a short-to-medium term trade worth considering.\nReasons to Remain Optimistic on QCOM\nThe first thing worth noting is that Qualcomm’s underlying performance remains solid beneath the frustrating price action. Management has moved past concerns about losing business from Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL, which is shifting more production in-house. The company continues to demonstrate resilience in core markets like mobile and automotive. The semiconductor sector itself is still firing on all cylinders.\nConsider the iShares Semiconductor ETF NASDAQ: SOXX, in which Qualcomm is the fifth-largest holding. It’s up more than 50% since April, underscoring Wall Street’s belief in the growth potential of semiconductors. Against that backdrop, Qualcomm’s underperformance looks more and more like an anomaly than a warning sign.\nAppealing Valuation and Analyst Support\nQUALCOMM Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$181.1013.97% UpsideHoldBased on 22 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $158.90 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $225.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $181.10 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $140.00 |\n|---|\nQUALCOMM Stock Forecast Details\nThen there’s the valuation. With a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14, Qualcomm trades at a steep discount to both the broader market and sector peers, many of whom have P/E ratios in the triple digits. In an increasingly frothy market, this offers a rare opportunity to buy a proven business at a bargain multiple.\nA wall of recent analyst support strengthens the bullish case. Piper Sandler, Mizuho, Rosenblatt, and JPMorgan have all reiterated Buy or equivalent ratings within the past two weeks, with price targets running as high as $225.\nQualcomm closed out Monday’s session below $150, which implies some very tempting upside potential in the region of 50%.\nThe Technical Setup for QCOM\nThen there’s the technical setup, wherein lies this short-term opportunity. Despite sliding sharply since late July and staying down, Qualcomm shares have been unable to set a new low since last Wednesday. That suggests selling pressure is starting to fade, and the bears could soon be under pressure.\nIt’s worth noting that Qualcomm’s struggles aren’t being driven by a deterioration in its business, which makes this the kind of setup where short-term traders can find outsized gains.\nIf the stock can remain above the $145 level through the rest of this week and then reclaim $150, it should spark a reversal that sends it back toward the $160 mark and beyond.\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM) Price Chart for Tuesday, August, 19, 2025\nThe Reality Check\nOf course, there are reasons Qualcomm is seen as one of the more frustrating tech stocks to own. Its tendency to lag in strong markets has tested investors’ patience for years, and the latest breakdown of its uptrend is another example.\nMomentum traders will want a clean break back above $150 before committing, while longer-term investors may wait for proof that operational wins can translate into sustained stock performance.\nStill, the risk-reward is compelling. A 14 P/E, strong analyst backing, and exposure to a sector leading the market higher all year make Qualcomm a diamond in the rough. The next move could be sharply higher if the bears fail to push it to new lows in the coming sessions.\nBefore you consider QUALCOMM, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "5 Stocks Insiders Are Selling That Analysts Say Buy", "url": "https://www.insidertrades.com/education/5-stocks-insiders-are-selling-that-analysts-say-buy/", "text": "Key Points\n- Insiders are selling these stocks, but investors shouldn't; there are reasons to expect higher share prices.\n- Insiders have reasons to sell, but the results and analyst trends are leading the stock prices higher.\n- The upcoming earnings reports will be a catalyst for these markets.\nInsiders are selling stock in companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Chewy (NYSE: CHWY), and Carvana (NYSE: CVNA), but investors shouldn’t follow suit. The insiders have reasons to sell, including taxes and profit-taking, but investors don’t.\nThese stocks are performing well and have ample upside left, as indicated by the analysts. This is a quick look at what’s driving the action and what investors might expect from their stock prices by the end of the year.\nAmazon Is the #1 Stock Sold By Insiders Summer 2025\nAmazon is the #1 stock sold by insiders this summer on a dollar basis. Seven insiders made 24 transactions in the preceding 90-day period, putting their net activity at a two-year high in the first six weeks of Q3. However, the bulk of sales was made by founder Jeff Bezos, who still owns a significant stake in the company. His reasons include philanthropy, taxes, and his latest interest, space.\nMr. Bezos is investing heavily in space-oriented endeavors and will likely continue to sell AMZN stock. Recent results, which AI underpinned, are reasons why investors shouldn’t sell Amazon.\nAI aided the core consumer and AWS businesses, driving better-than-expected results and a favorable outlook. The net result is that analysts continue to lead this market higher, issuing numerous price target increases following the release, forecasting a 17% upside and a new all-time high at the consensus target.\nDell Directors Take Profits in 2025\nDell (NYSE: DELL) stock is the second-most sold on a dollar basis for the summer of 2025. Insiders, including numerous directors, sold in 17 transactions, outpacing the buyers by a large margin, resulting in a one-year high for selling.\nThe caveat is that Dell stock has seen significant gains, rising over 100% since the April lows, 100% for the trailing two-year period, and 200% for the four-year lookback, with most sales driven by a single director. That is Silver Lake Capital, which still owns about 26% of the stock.\nThe takeaway is that this investment group, which has considerable skin in the game, is taking profits and may continue to impact the price action. The analysts are bullish on this stock and are increasing their stock price targets in 2025. They rate it as a Moderate Buy and see it advancing to long-term highs by the year’s end.\nChewy Insiders Sell: Uptrend Intact\nChewy is the third-most sold by insiders, with four selling in six transactions to set a multiyear high in selling activity. Their sales align with the stock's summer price correction, which is good news for investors. The price correction put CHWY stock back at attractive levels where support is evident.\nThe August price action reveals support at the cluster of moving averages, aligning with the longer-term one-year uptrend and a complete market reversal.\nThe uptrend and late-summer reversal are driven by results, outperformance, improved guidance, and their impact on the analyst. The analysts' trends are robust, including increased coverage, firming sentiment, and a leading trend in the price target forecasting 16% upside at the consensus.\nCarvana’s Staunchest Supporters Sell in 2025\nCarvana is ranked eighth in terms of selling volume, with sales dominated by its staunchest supporters: CEO Ernest Garcia III and his father. The two invested heavily in the stock at its lowest point and are now reaping the benefits. They and other insiders still own more than 15% of the stock, so they should be expected to continue taking profits as the stock price rises.\nThe stock price will continue to rise due to the results and analysts' forecasts. The company accelerated its growth in 2025, outperforming by a wide margin, catalyzing an uptrend in analysts' sentiment. They rate the stock as a Moderate Buy and forecast a move above $400.\nInsiders Sell NVIDIA! OH NO!\nInsiders, specifically CEO Jenson Huang, are selling NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock. The caveat is that Mr. Huang is selling following a prearranged trading plan in a stock that is up 100% in the last five months and multiple factors higher over the trailing four-year period.\nSales are expected to continue rising due to the stock price increase; investors should focus on his activity as much as the institutions and analysts, who are still buying this semiconductor stock.\nData from InsiderTrades reveals the institutions are buying robustly in 2025, netting more than $2 in shares for every $1 sold. Regarding the analysts, the trends remain positive as of mid-August, including firm coverage, steady sentiment, and an uptrend in the price target, forecasting another 35% upside at the high end.\nCompanies in This Article:\n| Company | Current Price | Price Change | Dividend Yield | P/E Ratio | Consensus Rating | Consensus Price Target |\n|---|\n| NVIDIA (NVDA) | $182.01 | +0.9% | 0.02% | 58.71 | Moderate Buy | $187.61 |\n| Carvana (CVNA) | $359.78 | +2.8% | N/A | 90.17 | Moderate Buy | $383.47 |\n| Chewy (CHWY) | $40.94 | +1.1% | N/A | 46.00 | Moderate Buy | $43.78 |\n| Dell Technologies (DELL) | $138.19 | -0.1% | 1.52% | 22.04 | Moderate Buy | $143.00 |\n| Amazon.com (AMZN) | $231.49 | +0.2% | N/A | 35.29 | Buy | $262.87 |\nExperience\nThomas Hughes has been a contributing writer for InsiderTrades.com since 2019.\n- Professional Background: Thomas Hughes is the Managing Partner of Passive Market Intelligence LLC, a market research platform he launched in 2023 with the mission: “We watch the market so you don't have to.” He has worked as a blogger, stock market commentator, and independent analyst since 2010 and has been actively involved in trading and investing since 2005.\n- Credentials: He holds an Associate of Arts in Culinary Technology—training that honed his discipline, attention to detail, and ability to anticipate outcomes, all of which carry over into his work as a market analyst.\n- Finance Experience: Thomas has been writing about finance and investing since 2011, when he discovered it could be more than a personal passion—it could be a profession.

{"title": "Tempus AI’s Strong Q2 Fuels Growth Story—More Upside Ahead?", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/tempus-ais-strong-q2-fuels-growth-storymore-upside-ahead/", "text": "Over the past two years, one of the most interesting healthcare companies to go public is none other than Tempus AI NASDAQ: TEM. In a world where healthcare IPOs are typically dominated by biotech companies that generate little to no revenue, Tempus stands out.\nTempus AI Today\n$78.45 +4.67 (+6.33%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $31.36\n▼\n$91.45 - Price Target\n- $65.36\nThe firm has posted sales of approximately $952 million over the last twelve months and has made strong improvements in profitability. The stock has also been a winner for shareholders. As of the Aug. 12 close, Tempus has provided a return of 89% in 2025, nearly delivering on the double-bagger potential forecasted in December 2024.\nTempus recently reported its Q2 2025 earnings. Below, we’ll dive into the details of this report and gain an updated outlook on the stock. Ultimately, is there reason to believe that Tempus can continue to deliver the types of returns seen over the past eight months, or should investors temper their expectations? All data uses information as of the Aug. 12 close.\nTempus Executes Well in Q2, Sees Positive EBITDA in 2025\nIn Q2, Tempus generated sales of just under $315 million, equating to a massive growth rate of just under 90%. This solidly beat Wall Street estimates, which forecasted growth of around 79%. Tempus’s adjusted loss per share also came in slightly better than expected at 22 cents. The company also improved its profitability significantly, both on a yearly and sequential basis.\nAdjusted gross margin increased to 62.8%. This compares to 61.4% in Q1 2025 and 56.8% in Q2 2024. The firm’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization margin (EBITDA) increased to -1.8%. This compares to -6.3% in Q1 2025 and -18.8% in Q2 2024. Tempus also boosted its full-year revenue guidance from $1.25 billion to $1.26 billion.\nTempus says it remains on track to generate $5 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2025, compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $110 million in 2024. The big takeaway? Things are going according to plan at Tempus; its offerings are seeing robust and accelerating demand growth, and it still expects to achieve adjusted operating profitability this year. For investors, seeing management execute on the plan it has previously outlined is always a good sign.\nMorgan Stanley Boosts Tempus Target, But Near-Term Upside Appears Limited\nTempus AI Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$65.36-16.68% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 12 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $78.45 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $75.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $65.36 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $52.00 |\n|---|\nTempus AI Stock Forecast Details\nAfter Tempus AI’s Q2 earnings release, analysts at Morgan Stanley increased their price target on the stock from $65 to $68. However, the MarketBeat consensus price target on Tempus is just over $65. This indicates a slight downside in shares versus their Aug. 12 closing price of over $66. Still, recently updated targets are slightly more bullish.\nAmong targets updated since June 25, the average is approximately $68.60, implying just over 3% upside. The stock has yet to close higher than $90. Achieving this level would require an upward move of around 36%. Overall, these numbers indicate that is unlikely that Tempus will achieve similar types of near-term returns that it has seen since the beginning of 2025.\nAdditionally, if the stock continues to trade at current levels or higher, it could face elevated downside risk going into its next earnings release. Shares were trading at around $70 going into the stock’s Q4 2024 release. Very slight earnings misses that quarter caused shares to plummet 15% in one day.\nTEM Revenue Is Small Compared to R&D Spending, Highlighting Long-Term Opportunity\nDespite the uninspiring near-term upside implied by Wall Street targets, the long-term opportunity for Tempus AI shares looks much more significant. One study found that in 2021, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spent $276 billion on research and development (R&D). As companies use Tempus AI's solutions to enhance their R&D efforts, their R&D spending translates into revenue for Tempus.\nAlthough these numbers and assumptions are far from perfect, they help illustrate Tempus AI's large total addressable market. Its expected revenue of $1.26 billion in 2025 is a tiny fraction of that $276 billion R&D spending figure. This shows how Tempus has a big runway for long-term revenue growth, supporting the company’s long-term bull case.\nStill, investors will need to continue monitoring the company’s growth and profitability improvements. This will help indicate whether Tempus can actually capitalize on its large potential in a sustainable way.\nBefore you consider Tempus AI, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Brutal 2025 for Sarepta—Analysts Still Call for 179% Upside", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/brutal-2025-for-sareptaanalysts-still-call-for-179-upside/", "text": "Sarepta Therapeutics Today\nSRPTSarepta Therapeutics\n$20.99 -0.82 (-3.76%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $10.41\n▼\n$144.22 - Price Target\n- $43.63\nFor Sarepta Therapeutics NASDAQ: SRPT, 2025 has been nothing short of an unmitigated disaster. The firm owns the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved gene therapy for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), known as ELEVIDYS. Since gaining approval in June 2023, Sarepta has generated over $1 billion in revenue from ELEVIDYS. However, that success has been massively overshadowed by key failures.\nIn 2025, multiple people treated with ELEVIDYS have died, causing shares to plunge. Overall, Sarepta shares are down by more than 85% in 2025, as of the Aug. 11 close. However, multiple Wall Street analysts seem to believe a huge recovery could be in store for Sarepta.\nThat is particularly true for analysts at Wells Fargo and BMO Capital Markets. Their $50 price targets indicate that shares could nearly triple in value. As of the Aug. 11 close, these targets imply around 179% upside in Sarepta stock. Below, we’ll detail Sarepta’s journey in 2025, as well as the bull and bear arguments around the stock.\nFDA Whiplashes Sarepta, Sparking a Big Recovery in Shares\nAs of June 16, investigators found that two ELEVIDYS patients had died from acute liver failure (ALF). Then, on July 18, the FDA requested that Sarepta stop all shipments of ELEVIDYS, causing shares to fall 36%. This came after two additional deaths linked to Sarepta treatments. One patient received ELEVIDYS, while another received a different investigational drug with similar properties. On July 22, Sarepta complied with the request. Previously, Sarepta had only stopped selling ELEVIDYS to non-ambulatory patients.\nHowever, on July 28, the FDA reversed this request. They concluded that the death of the third patient treated with ELEVIDYS was “deemed unlikely to be related” to the drug. Sarepta then decided to resume ELEVIDYS sales to ambulatory patients. This is notable, as ambulatory patients make up approximately 70% to 85% of ELEVIDYS patients. Sarepta says this patient group alone allows the company to be profitable.\nSince the reversal of the FDA’s request, Sarepta shares are up 50% as of the Aug. 11 close. This demonstrates the improving sentiment around the stock, now that the company can continue generating revenue from ELEVIDYS.\nSarepta Loses Nearly $10 Billion in Market Cap, Leading to Valuation Upside\nSarepta started 2025 with a market capitalization of approximately $11.61 billion. As of the Aug. 11 close, that number has fallen to $1.75 billion. For a stock that has lost so much value in such a short period, it’s not overly surprising to see some analysts predicting massive upside in shares. Despite the turmoil surrounding ELEVIDYS, it is important to note that Sarepta has large revenue streams outside of it.\nIn fiscal 2024, 54% of the company’s net product revenue came from products other than ELEVIDYS. Although the growth outlook for Sarepta has weakened significantly, the stock now trades at a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 1.2x. This compares to a median forward P/S ratio of around 4.3x among U.S. large-cap pharma and biotech stocks. Based on this metric, the stock appears highly undervalued compared to many names in its industry.\nThe Other Side of the Coin: Sarepta’s Key Risks\nDespite some analysts' bullishness, Sarepta also faces several risks. The most obvious is the potential that another patient dies from ELEVIDYS. Such an event would hit shares and could result in the FDA reinstating its order for Sarepta to stop selling the drug to certain patients. This would greatly damage the firm’s financial prospects.\nSarepta Therapeutics Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$43.63107.84% UpsideHoldBased on 29 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $20.99 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $150.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $43.63 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $12.00 |\n|---|\nSarepta Therapeutics Stock Forecast Details\nIllustrating these risks are the respective $13 and $15 price targets from Sanford C. Bernstein and Piper Sandler. These targets indicate significant downside potential in Sarepta stock from its Aug. 11 closing price of just under $18.\nIn the long term, the firm also faces risks from competitors developing DMD therapies. That includes Solid Biosciences NASDAQ: SLDB. Their DMD treatment, known as SGT-003, has shown strong efficacy in early-stage trials. SGT-003’s delivery method is also designed to decrease liver targeting. This combination could boost the chance of the drug gaining FDA approval, as it works to mitigate one of ELEVIDYS’ key risks.\nSGT-003’s approval would likely significantly degrade Sarepta’s market share. Still, gaining FDA approval is notoriously difficult, and there is certainly no guarantee that SGT-003 will ever generate sales.\nOverall, Sarepta’s financials indicate the stock could have serious upside potential. However, investors should understand that this reality could change quickly if ELEVIDYS causes further deaths. This could result in the FDA requesting that the firm halt sales again, taking away one of its key revenue streams.\nBefore you consider Sarepta Therapeutics, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Intel's White House Reset: From Political Storm to a Clearer Sky", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/intels-white-house-reset-from-political-storm-to-a-clearer-sky/", "text": "Intel Today\n$23.66 -0.90 (-3.66%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $17.67\n▼\n$27.55 - Price Target\n- $22.17\nA multi-day rally for Intel Corporation NASDAQ: INTC this week has pushed shares back toward the $22 level, with a surge of over 5% on August 11 that continued to August 12. This newfound momentum in Intel’s stock price was not driven by a new product or an earnings beat. Instead, it was fueled by the successful resolution of a significant political uncertainty that had created an overhang on the stock.\nJust days after facing high-level scrutiny from Washington, Intel’s CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, engaged in a direct meeting at the White House that resulted in a public de-escalation of tensions. This rapid and decisive action has cleared a significant hurdle for the company, allowing investors to refocus on the core fundamentals of Intel’s ongoing turnaround with renewed confidence in its strategic alignment with U.S. policy.\nWhy a Washington Partnership Is Non-Negotiable\nFor investors, understanding the importance of Intel's relationship with the U.S. government is critical to understanding the potential of the company. Intel’s ambitious and capital-intensive turnaround is fundamentally linked to its role as a key domestic manufacturing partner.\nThe company was awarded nearly $8 billion in grants from the CHIPS and Science Act, the largest award to a single company. This funding is essential for building the advanced factories, or fabs, that are at the heart of its plan to regain technology leadership from international rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company NYSE: TSM. Any significant misalignment with the administration's America First manufacturing agenda could have jeopardized this crucial financial and strategic support.\nFurthermore, leadership stability is one of the most critical requirements during a complex corporate overhaul. With CEO Lip-Bu Tan actively executing a deep restructuring (including a 15% workforce reduction and a pivot in the company's manufacturing roadmap), the recent public scrutiny of his position posed a direct risk to the consistent execution of this long-term strategy.\nIn an age of intense global focus on supply chain security, Intel’s value proposition depends heavily on its status as a trusted, U.S.-based manufacturer. Reaffirming a constructive partnership with Washington was therefore not just a matter of public relations, but a core business imperative.\nIntel Corporation (INTC) Price Chart for Tuesday, August, 19, 2025\nHow a Meeting Turned Into a Market Advantage\nThe pivotal event was a \"candid and constructive discussion\" at the White House between CEO Lip-Bu Tan and the President. The outcome was a de-escalation, with the administration publicly praising Tan's \"amazing story\" and Intel releasing a statement reaffirming its commitment to U.S. tech sector leadership.\nMore importantly, the meeting established a path for future collaboration, with plans for follow-up discussions between the CEO and key cabinet members. This transforms the relationship from one of scrutiny to one of active partnership.\nThis renewed alignment appears to come with a tangible competitive advantage. Competitors like NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ: AMD are reportedly subject to a revenue-sharing agreement with the U.S. government, estimated to be around 15%, on certain high-performance AI chip sales to China. Intel's Gaudi AI accelerators are not currently subject to this same requirement.\nFor investors, this should be seen as a significant development. It provides Intel with a distinct edge in a key global market, allowing the company to either achieve higher effective margins on its AI hardware or pass those savings on to customers to be even more price-competitive against its rivals.\nWhy the Bull Case Is Stronger Now\nThe market's strong, positive reaction to these developments is a logical de-risking event. By successfully navigating this high-stakes test, Intel's management has removed a major, unpredictable uncertainty that was weighing on the stock.\nIntel Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$22.17-6.31% DownsideReduceBased on 29 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $23.66 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $28.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $22.17 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $14.00 |\n|---|\nIntel Stock Forecast Details\nAnalyst commentary following the meeting reflected this sentiment, with firms like Bernstein calling the resolution a \"clear positive.\" This stability now allows the investment narrative to shift back to the company's fundamental progress in its strategic execution, which remains compelling.\nInvestors can now refocus on the tangible proof points of the turnaround that were highlighted in Intel’s most recent earnings report. This includes the strong Q3 guidance for a sequential gross margin recovery, the overwhelmingly positive critical reception of the new Lunar Lake processors, and the long-term growth potential of the foundry business, which has been validated by major customer wins.\nBy reaffirming its strategic importance to the U.S. government, Intel has not just returned to its prior standing; it has arguably strengthened its position, reinforcing the long-term investment thesis for a great American company on the path to recovery.\nBefore you consider Intel, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Intel wasn't on the list.\nWhile Intel currently has a Reduce rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nNuclear energy stocks are roaring.

Below, we’ll detail two key pieces of news and explain why they are leading Apple shares higher.\nApple Adds a Fresh $100 Billion Investment to Trump Appeasement Policy\nApple Today\n$230.89 -0.70 (-0.30%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $169.21\n▼\n$260.10 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.45%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 35.04\n- Price Target\n- $237.60\nIn February, Apple announced it would make a massive $500 billion investment in the United States over the next four years. On Aug. 6, the Magnificent Seven company upped the ante, committing an additional $100 billion investment to its home country. This move comes amid President Trump’s unwavering stance that he wants to see iPhones built in America.\nTrump reiterated this stance in a joint press conference with Apple CEO Tim Cook to announce the new investment. He called the investment “a significant step toward the ultimate goal of ensuring that iPhones sold in the United States of America also are made in America.\"\nCook did not parrot this notion.\nThe economic advantage of producing iPhones overseas makes this unlikely. Analysts have estimated that producing an iPhone in the United States could bring its price to $3,500. That’s nearly triple the cost of the company’s most expensive iPhone 16 Pro Max model today, which retails for $1,199.\nThis price increase would massively deteriorate Apple’s competitive positioning in the smartphone market. It is certainly not something investors should hope for.\nThat’s part of the reason that markets are happy about the company’s latest U.S. investment.\nTrump has ramped up tariff pressure on Apple to get the firm to move iPhone manufacturing to the United States. With the latest investment, the company is garnering goodwill from the President, which can help it stay out of his tariff crosshairs.\nIn the same press conference, Trump floated a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. However, he said that companies that invest in America, like Apple, would be exempt from such regulations.\nApple is playing ball with the President to protect its interests, and thus those of its shareholders.\nIndia Hit With 50% Tariffs, But Apple Avoids Catching a Stray\nAdditionally, on Aug. 6, Trump declared that he would raise India's tariff to 50%, starting 21 days after Aug. 7. This change is a response to India's continued oil imports from Russia.\nInitially, this appeared highly relevant to Apple. The company has moved much of its production for U.S.-sold iPhones to India, partly to avoid U.S. tariffs imposed on its traditional manufacturing hub, China. It reportedly hopes to move most of this production to India by the end of 2026.\nHigher tariffs on India would severely limit the company’s ambitions to avoid higher costs. However, further reports revealed that smartphones would be exempt from Indian tariffs.\nApple won’t have to pay tariffs on Indian-made iPhones at all. It’s not unreasonable to think that the company’s $100 billion investment contributed to Trump’s exemption decision.\nOverall, Apple’s U.S. investments are helping it avoid tariffs in more ways than one: both on country and product-specific levies.\nApple Stock Gets a Flurry of Positive Sentiment, But AI Remains a Key Question Mark\nApple Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$237.602.90% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 31 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $230.89 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $300.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $237.60 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $170.00 |\n|---|\nApple Stock Forecast Details\nUltimately, these pieces of news led to Apple stock having one of its best weeks in quite a while. From Aug. 4 to Aug. 8, shares gained by more than 13%.\nTrump's tirade against the company has been one of the key factors weighing on Apple in 2025, with shares still down significantly on the year.\nThus, it is only fitting that positive developments related to President Trump have resulted in positive price action. These news items are clearly good signs for Apple, indicating that the company could face less pressure from Trump going forward.\nStill, whether Apple can truly return to being a winner for stock market investors remains up in the air.

{"title": "How Vertiv Is Cashing in on AI's Power Crisis", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/how-vertiv-is-cashing-in-on-ais-power-crisis/", "text": "Vertiv Today\n$135.60 +2.53 (+1.90%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $53.60\n▼\n$155.84 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.11%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 64.88\n- Price Target\n- $144.06\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) boom is hitting a wall—not a digital one, but one made of concrete, copper, and cooling pipes. While investors have focused on the brilliant chip designers creating AI brains, the technology titans deploying these processors are facing a much more fundamental challenge.\nThe sheer power consumption and immense heat generated by AI servers are straining data centers and the utility sector to their limits.\nThis physical infrastructure challenge has quietly become the most significant bottleneck holding back the next wave of AI expansion, creating a new and essential investment category for those who provide the foundational solutions.\nSolving the AI Heatwave\nVertiv Holdings Company’s NYSE: VRT portfolio of products hits right at the core of the issue, which lies in the incredible density of modern AI systems. Thousands of powerful GPUs are packed tightly into server racks to achieve maximum performance.\nAccording to Vertiv’s CEO, Giordano Albertazzi, these configurations push rack power densities into the \"three- and four-digit kWs,\" a level of energy concentration that generates a thermal crisis. Traditional air-cooling methods, which involve blowing cold air across servers, are simply no match for this intensity. Without a more effective solution, these multibillion-dollar AI clusters cannot run at their full potential.\nThis is the specific problem Vertiv is designed to solve. As a global leader in critical digital infrastructure, the company's offerings are non-negotiable requirements for the AI era.\n- Advanced Thermal Management: Vertiv is at the forefront of liquid cooling, which is the only viable technology for managing the heat from high-density AI. Its systems, which include direct-to-chip cooling that pipes coolant right to the source of the heat, are becoming standard in new AI data center designs.\n- Resilient Power Management: The company's portfolio of uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), power distribution units, and switchgear ensures that these energy-hungry servers receive a clean, stable, and massive electricity supply, safeguarding them from grid fluctuations.\nRecognizing that its customers' most significant challenge is deployment speed, Vertiv has moved beyond selling individual products to offering integrated solutions. Its recent launch of Vertiv OneCore is a prime example.\nThis prefabricated, modular system allows a data center's entire power and cooling infrastructure to be built in a factory and deployed rapidly on-site, drastically cutting down construction timelines.\nRack-specialist Great Lakes' planned acquisition further strengthens Vertiv’s strategic focus on integrated, turnkey solutions.\nThis deal, expected to finalize in the third quarter of 2025, deepens Vertiv’s position as a one-stop shop for building the AI factories of the future.\nTranslating Demand Into Dollars\nVertiv’s strategic positioning at the heart of the AI build-out is generating impressive and tangible financial results. The company’s second-quarter 2025 earnings report provided a clear confirmation of its momentum, surpassing analyst estimates and demonstrating that the company is effectively converting surging demand into shareholder value. For investors tracking the company's progress, several key metrics stand out:\n- Exceptional Revenue Growth: Net sales climbed an impressive 35.1% year-over-year to reach $2.64 billion.\n- Surging Demand: The company's book-to-bill ratio was approximately 1.2x, a strong indicator that new orders are flowing in faster than it can fulfill current ones, signaling future growth.\n- Significant Future Revenue Visibility: Vertiv's order backlog (the measure of contracted business yet to be delivered) grew to a record $8.5 billion. This backlog alone represents a substantial portion of the company's annual revenue, providing a reasonable degree of predictability.\nThis powerful performance gave management the confidence to raise its full-year 2025 guidance for key financial metrics, including net sales, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), and free cash flow. An upward revision of this nature signals to the market that company leadership sees a clear and sustainable growth path ahead.\nThe Price of Being Essential\nVertiv Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$144.066.24% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 23 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $135.60 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $173.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $144.06 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $75.00 |\n|---|\nVertiv Stock Forecast Details\nFollowing a year where Vertiv’s stock price has appreciated by over 95%, the company commands a premium valuation, with a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 67. This valuation reflects the market's belief that Vertiv is not just another industrial company but a critical and long-term enabler of the entire AI secular trend.\nIts growth is directly tied to one of a generation's most powerful technology shifts.\nInstitutional experts share this bullish sentiment. A consensus of 22 Wall Street analysts rates the stock a Moderate Buy, and many have increased their price targets in the wake of the company's recent strong results.\nWhile the company did note temporary margin pressures from tariffs and the costs associated with scaling its manufacturing footprint to meet the demand surge, management laid out a clear action plan and expressed confidence that these operational headwinds will be \"materially resolved by year-end.\"\nThe company's financial forecast supports this, implying a strong margin recovery to over 23% in the fourth quarter, setting a positive trajectory for 2026.\nUltimately, Vertiv's story is one of a company providing an indispensable solution to an industry's most pressing problem.\nIts role as a foundational enabler of the AI revolution, backed by strong execution and financial momentum, makes it a compelling pick-and-shovel investment for those looking to participate in the growth of the entire AI ecosystem.\nBefore you consider Vertiv, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "MP Materials Stock Rides Rare Earth Boom to New Highs", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/mp-materials-stock-rides-rare-earth-boom-to-new-highs/", "text": "Most investors would be wary of buying into a company that has yet to reach net profitability, though sometimes the macro narrative and the company-specific developments warrant a second look at some upside potential in this story. Today, one stock in the basic materials sector fits that description for several reasons.\nMP Materials Today\nMPMP Materials\n$72.00 -3.03 (-4.04%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $11.95\n▼\n$82.50 - Price Target\n- $60.63\nMP Materials Corp. NYSE: MP shares are trading near their 52-week highs for a good reason. Not only that, but this stock also has the potential to break into a new ceiling in the coming months and quarters, as the macro backdrop and rising investment interest make this stock a hot pick to keep in a growth portfolio.\nThis is where investors can look beyond the pre-profit stage of this company and explore why it has seen such bullish price action.\nBy delivering an aggressive run of 147% over the past month alone, some investors may wonder what could make this stock go higher even when operating at a loss, and whether this momentum will still be enough to deliver higher prices.\nToday, those doubts may as well wash away, because here’s why MP Materials is a stock investors want to keep around for a while.\nA Changing Global Order on Rare Earth Metals\nThe United States has now gone on a trade tariff cycle, mainly focusing on Asia and the materials that come from the region. With this in mind, one of the items that has gotten the most attention in these tariff implementations is rare earth metals, used both in the defense and technology sectors of the United States.\nGiven the United States' limited domestic sources of rare earth metals, those that have already demonstrated a successful case study are likely to receive the majority of government grants and favor, which is precisely where MP Materials stock comes into play.\nDigging into MP Materials' latest quarterly earnings report may help investors understand these current developments. Starting with the top line, MP Materials reported revenue growing to a high of $57.4 million during the quarter, or 84% higher than the same quarter last year.\nThis revenue increase can be mainly credited to the record production of its materials, which reached 597 metric tons during the quarter, representing a massive 119% increase over the past 12 months. Some bears may say that this is a fluke of a quarter that may not repeat in the future.\nHowever, there is now evidence that that is not the case. This quarter may only suggest what could come for the future of MP Materials, especially now that new partnerships have been announced. The United States government, specifically the Department of Defense, has looked to MP Materials for answers.\nNew Partnerships Equal Upside Potential on MP Materials\nMP Materials Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$60.63-15.80% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 9 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $72.00 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $80.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $60.63 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $29.00 |\n|---|\nMP Materials Stock Forecast Details\nMP Materials will not only provide rare earth metals for defense purposes across the globe but also receive additional government support from the United States. After a significant investment over the past quarter, the Pentagon is now the largest shareholder in MP Materials.\nThis is both a vote of confidence in the company’s ability to deliver on the demand needs for the United States defense, and also an ownership stake that guarantees only American interests are involved in management’s future decision-making and pivotal moves.\nMoreover, rare earth metals play a significant role in the current artificial intelligence race, particularly in areas related to semiconductors and chips. This is why Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL also decided to join the Pentagon in this partnership bidding with MP Materials.\nNow investors have access to two of the biggest tailwinds happening in the global economy, both of which are now pushing MP Materials stock’s prospects higher. Knowing this, it shouldn’t surprise investors to see short sellers start to run away from this name.\nOver the past month, 8.3% of MP Materials’ short interest declined as a clear sign of bearish capitulation, but that’s not all. Considering that there are still $1.6 billion worth of open short positions in this stock, another rally like this one could force all these short sellers to close their positions at a loss, which involves buying back the stock for additional upward pressure.\nBefore you consider MP Materials, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $5.35\n▼\n$85.35 - Price Target\n- $63.78\nOklo’s NYSE: OKLO stock is poised for a correction in mid-Q3 because its explosive stock price increase attracted a fair number of short sellers, and the Q2 earnings release did not accelerate the timeline. The release was good, chock full of juicy news to keep investors interested, but no concrete changes or improvements to the revenue timeline.\nThe takeaway is that this leading, advanced reactor company is well-positioned to deliver on its promise, with projects advancing, but no catalyst for higher share prices has emerged.\nIn this scenario, the market could fall as much as 20% from the pre-release closing price before it begins to rebound, but when it does, it will be a screaming buy.\nOklo is the leader in advanced, fast-reactor technology within the energy sector and is on track to commence operations within only a few years. Its vertically integrated model encompasses fuel, power, and adjacent isotope markets, offering a diversified income stream and cost efficiencies unmatched by any other advanced reactor company.\nCritical highlights from the quarter include the Trump administration's numerous executive orders, which clear red tape, streamline and accelerate approval processes, and provide tax credits and funding for start-up projects. Among the impacts of the orders is the potential for a technology-proving pilot project to come online as soon as July 2026, years ahead of the existing timeline.\nOther critical highlights include partnerships with Vertiv, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power, and Centrus that expand and deepen the company’s industry appeal while prepping future revenue streams.\nThe Analysts' Trends Provide Support for the Oklo Stock Price\nThe initial analysts’ response to Oklo’s news is crickets; MarketBeat tracked no notes or revisions within the first 18 hours of the release. This is good news because the trends leading into the release were bullish, providing support for this market.\nOklo Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$63.78-7.41% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 13 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $68.89 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $90.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $63.78 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $14.00 |\n|---|\nOklo Stock Forecast Details\nThe trends include increased coverage with the number of analysts rising by more than 200% to 13 since the first of the year, the Moderate Buy sentiment firming with several Strong Buy ratings creeping into the mix, and the price target advancing.\nThe consensus lags the market in mid-August but is up more than 400% in the preceding 12 months, with the high-end range aligning with recent price action. The takeaway is that the market for OKLO stock outpaced analysts' sentiment, and their targets align with a price pullback. However, the price targets should provide solid support near the $60 level if not higher, aligning with the technical support targets.\nThe institutional group is likely to be buyers on an OKLO stock price pullback. The group owns 85% of the stock and has been buying robustly this year, netting $2 in shares for every $1 sold. The Q3 activity shows buying ramping to a multiquarter high in the first half of Q3, an indication of increased demand and market support.\nShort-Interest Caps Gains in Oklo Stock in Q3\nWhile the long-term outlook for OKLO stock is bullish, the high and rising short-interest suggests the top is in for Q3 and potentially the remainder of the year. The short interest has been growing over the past few months and is running near 15% as of late July, and will likely remain high if not increase as the quarter progresses. The catalyst to cover will be a concrete improvement in the timeline to revenue, which could come at any time but may not materialize for several quarters.\nThe post-release price action was tepid; however, the market fell more than 1% suggesting it is ready to move lower. The critical near-term support is near the $69 level; a move below it will likely attract bearish activity and result in a more profound decline.\nBefore you consider Oklo, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

As Alphabet leaned into its AI prowess, cloud strength, and ad resilience, its shares surged, and momentum is now firmly back.\nBullish Momentum Returns to GOOGL\nThe stock is officially in the green year-to-date, up 6.18% as of Monday’s close, and has rocketed 32% in the past quarter alone, including an 11.5% jump this month alone.\nMost importantly, Alphabet has reclaimed the $200 level, a psychological and technical resistance point that had held it back for six months. Now sitting just under 3% from its 52-week high, Alphabet is setting itself up for a fresh breakout into uncharted territory.\nTechnically, this is not an overbought sprint. Alphabet is still building its base, not blowing past resistance like many red-hot tech peers. The clean push through $200 after building weeks of momentum below it suggests more upside could be ahead, as long as the rally remains contained and measured.\nEarnings Spark Most Recent Rally\nAlphabet’s compelling Q2 2025 earnings, released on July 23, are at the heart of the rebound. Total revenue of $96.43 billion beat expectations and reflected a substantial 14% year-over-year gain. Earnings per share came in at $2.31, well above consensus and up 22% YOY.\nAlphabet Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$211.533.94% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 43 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $203.50 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $240.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $211.53 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $172.00 |\n|---|\nAlphabet Stock Forecast Details\nKey growth came from advertising, cloud, and search. Google Cloud soared 32% to $13.62 billion, crossing the $50 billion annual run rate landmark.\nYouTube ad revenue climbed 13%, and, perhaps most importantly, Google Search & Other grew 11.7%, well above the 8% expected, helping to quiet concerns about AI disrupting Alphabet’s core business.\nThese results weren’t ignored. Following the blowout quarter, a wave of analysts raised their price targets. Barclays lifted its target to $235 from $220, and JPMorgan increased it to $232 from $200. Multiple other firms followed suit.\nInstitutional money also started flowing back in. Cathie Wood’s ARKW recently added $35 million in Alphabet shares. Zooming out, over the previous twelve months, institutions have been busy buying shares of the tech giant. In total, $96 billion worth of GOOGL has been purchased versus $52 billion in outflows over the previous year.\nValuation and Entry Perspective\nDespite the surge in momentum, GOOGL still looks reasonably priced. Its current P/E is around 21.4, and its forward P/E of 18.9 remains well below its historical standards. So even after a 32% quarterly move, Alphabet isn’t trading at a tech bubble multiple, making the risk-reward picture more compelling for disciplined investors.\nFor those anticipating more upside, a logical entry could be on a pullback toward key support zones near $190 or even $180, where resistance was overturned earlier in the year.\nIf Alphabet can reclaim a clean stair-step pattern above $200, reinforced by analyst upgrades and institutional faith, it could quietly morph into one of this year’s strongest major-cap tech stories.\nBefore you consider Alphabet, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "AMD Paves Path for Market Share Gains: Stock Rally Has Just Begun", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/amd-paves-path-for-market-share-gains-stock-rally-has-just-begun/", "text": "Advanced Micro Devices Today\nAMDAdvanced Micro Devices\n$176.14 -1.37 (-0.77%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $76.48\n▼\n$186.65 - P/E Ratio\n- 101.23\n- Price Target\n- $180.12\nAdvanced Micro Devices' NASDAQ: AMD share price is rebounding so strongly in 2025 because the outlook originally priced into the market in 2023/2024 has finally been affirmed. If you are wondering if its share price can continue to rise, the answer is yes.\nThe outlook, tied to data centers and AI, includes the long-awaited market share gains that will come at the expense of NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA.\nNVIDIA, the undisputed leader in AI infrastructure today, secured its position due to its first-mover advantage. That advantage lies in its GPU semiconductor technology, the infrastructure to support parallel computing, and the capability to deliver solutions at rack scale.\nThose last two words, rack scale, truly matter; it is why NVIDIA commands roughly 90% of the market. The hyperscalers using NVIDIA and AMD GPUs to power their increasingly large and power-hungry data centers are using the GPUs by the tens of thousands, linked into clusters and racks by the thousands. You are not a solution if you can’t deliver solutions at scale.\nAMD's technology is arguably better, at least for some applications. The company’s focus on memory capacity, cost, and efficiency makes it well-suited for some higher-intensity AI workloads and inference, which is where AI is heading.\nInference is the application of AI technology, the deployment of models and their use by businesses and consumers, and it will eventually be the bulk of AI workloads. AMD's disadvantage was its inability to deliver rack-scale solutions effectively, but that’s all changed.\nAdvanced Micro Devices on Track for Share Gains in 2026\nAdvanced Micro Devices has made great strides in fleshing out its AI stack, including the acquisition of ZT Systems and the Helios system. ZT Systems specializes in the development of designing and deploying AMD-based rack-scale solutions for data centers.\nBringing it in-house allows AMD to provide an end-to-end, integrated solution based on Helios. Helios combines the soon-to-be-launched MI400 series with EPYC CPUs in an interconnected architecture geared for AI workloads.\nThe platform is expected to be highly demanded by hyperscalers, including public, government, and commercial clouds.\nThe forecast for 2026 is robust and includes an expectation for strength in all three of AMD’s critical segments. Already gaining market share in the datacenter CPU and PC segments, the analyst forecast significant market share gains compared to NVIDIA.\nSome suggest AMD could regain the share lost in 2023 and 2024 and then take more.\nThe revenue and earnings forecasts are positive, with revisions in July and early August raising the consensus for sustained high-double-digit growth over the next five years.\nThe critical detail is that the margin is expected to widen along the way, producing accelerated bottom-line growth and a deep-value relative to the long-term forecast. Trading at roughly 45x the current year’s earnings in mid-Q3 2025, AMD is trading at only 15x the 2035 forecast and could increase by 100% over the next ten years to trade in alignment with blue-chip technology peers.\nThe Analysts' Sentiment Trends Support a Rising AMD Share Price\nAdvanced Micro Devices Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$180.122.26% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 39 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $176.14 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $210.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $180.12 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $140.00 |\n|---|\nAdvanced Micro Devices Stock Forecast Details\nThe analysts’ data reported by MarketBeat is bullish and aligns with the rising share price.\nThe group rates the stock as a Moderate Buy.

{"title": "IBM: The Last Time This Happened, the Stock Rallied 35%", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/ibm-the-last-time-this-happened-the-stock-rallied-35/", "text": "International Business Machines Today\nIBMInternational Business Machines\n$239.39 -0.33 (-0.14%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $193.71\n▼\n$296.16 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.81%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 38.86\n- Price Target\n- $268.75\nTech giant International Business Machines Corp NYSE: IBM is back on our radars after a bruising few weeks. Having traded as high as $295 earlier this summer, shares are now hovering just above the $250 level. That marks about a 15% drop from July’s peak and effectively wipes out a good chunk of the hard-won 35% rally that began back in April.\nWhile the pullback has unnerved some, it’s also sparked interest from patient investors watching from the sidelines. As we’ll see below, IBM’s sell-off looks less like a company in trouble, and more like an investor overreaction to a few wobbles in what was otherwise a strong quarterly report.\nFor some, it might be starting to feel like déjà vu. Because of the recent sell-off, IBM’s technical setup is screaming oversold. In fact, the last time it was oversold, it was followed by a sharp upside reversal. With the stock already starting to consolidate, it may be time for investors on the sidelines to think about getting involved.\nLet’s jump in and take a closer look.\nA Strong Report Overall\nWhile shares had been starting to soften in the weeks beforehand, the bulk of the recent sell-off was triggered by the company’s Q2 earnings, released in the final week of July. On the surface, the report was a success: revenue grew nearly 8% year over year, headline numbers beat expectations, margins expanded, and management raised full-year guidance.\nDigging deeper, IBM’s leadership was quick to highlight what’s driving that momentum. Like many of the mega-caps out there, the company is seeing accelerating traction in its generative AI business, now worth more than $7.5 billion, and continues to benefit from its domain expertise and deep innovation pipeline.\nIts AI-focused strategy is clearly resonating with clients across sectors, helping to drive strong results like those investors saw last month. Investors hope they can keep seeing these results in the months ahead.\nYet despite the strong print, a softer-than-expected performance in IBM’s software segment sparked some concern. That division is widely seen as a key lever in IBM’s long-term growth strategy, and the shortfall was enough to flip sentiment against the stock almost immediately; IBM shares gapped down the next day and have only drifted lower since.\nOversold and Setting Up for a Rebound\nWhile the bulls' lack of dip-buying may make it sound quite bleak, IBM’s technicals suggest the selling could be nearing exhaustion. The stock’s relative strength index (RSI) has sunk to around 27, a reading that puts it firmly into extremely oversold territory.\nWhat’s especially interesting is that IBM’s RSI last hit these levels in October of last year. Back then, shares bottomed out almost perfectly before beginning a multi-month rally that delivered gains of more than 30%.\nAnd right now, IBM has possibly begun to find support around a key psychological level, with shares consolidating above $250 for several sessions.\nThat’s because, logging weeks of weakness up to now, the bears haven’t been able to push shares below last Friday’s low. That suggests the downside momentum may be fading, and if $250 continues to hold through early next week, the stage could be set for a rebound.\nWhat Wall Street Is Saying\nMany analysts, like the team at Bank of America, remain firmly in the bull camp. Following the Q2 report, they reiterated their Buy rating and gave the stock a fresh price target of $310.\nFrom current levels, that implies a targeted upside of about 25%, a move that would closely mirror the rally IBM posted after last year’s oversold signal from the RSI.\nWith improved cash flow, clear progress on AI monetization, and strong execution across most business units, the argument for a rebound is compelling. And while software concerns may linger in the short term, it’s likely that much of the worst-case scenario has already been priced in.\nInvestors should expect this level to hold into next week and be ready to take advantage of what is increasingly looking like a great dip-buying opportunity.\nBefore you consider International Business Machines, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "CrowdStrike Faces Valuation Test Before Key Earnings Report", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/crowdstrike-faces-valuation-test-before-key-earnings-report/", "text": "CrowdStrike Today\n$426.34 -1.56 (-0.36%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $242.25\n▼\n$517.98 - Price Target\n- $460.81\nCrowdStrike Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: CRWD is down 9.76% in the last 30 trading days. However, CRWD stock is still up 79% in 2025, making it one of the best-performing technology stocks in the S&P 500.\nThe stock’s year-long rally started after the much-publicized outage caused by a faulty software update. The company took aggressive steps in damage control that restored customer confidence in the company.\nGood public relations wouldn’t have meant much if the company didn’t back it up with results. CrowdStrike has done well with revenue and earnings, increasing year-over-year (YOY).\nHowever, two weeks before the company reports earnings, CrowdStrike is facing concerns about valuation. That’s part of the reason the stock is down ahead of earnings.\nTo be fair, CrowdStrike isn’t the only company facing valuation concerns, but investors need to consider how much they want to pay for CRWD stock with earnings fast approaching.\nCrowdStrike Expands Its AI-Native Falcon Platform\nOne point for investors to consider is the company’s expansion of its AI-native Falcon platform. Approximately 92% of Fortune 500 companies use generative and/or agentic artificial intelligence (AI) in one or more business areas.\nUsing large language models (LLMs), copilots, and AI agents creates productivity opportunities that may exceed those of the internet. However, that’s also creating new risks and vulnerabilities that cybersecurity companies are racing to address.\nA key selling point of CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform is that it is AI-native. Recently, the company announced the launch of AI Systems Security Assessment and AI for SecOps Readiness. These two services allow customers to secure AI systems while safely integrating AI into their security operations.\nCrowdStrike Continues to Increase Its Share of the TAM\nCrowdStrike Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$460.818.08% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 46 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $426.34 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $555.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $460.81 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $275.00 |\n|---|\nCrowdStrike Stock Forecast Details\nIn its earnings presentation for the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year, CrowdStrike reported $194 million in new net annual recurring revenue (ARR). ARR is a key metric for cybersecurity companies because it shows how much of the topline the company can retain YOY.\nFor the current calendar year, CrowdStrike predicts that the total addressable market (TAM) for AI-native cybersecurity platforms will be $116 billion. The company forecasts that number to rise to $250 billion by 2029.\nNow consider that CrowdStrike just notched its first $1 billion in quarterly revenue in its most recent quarter. That means CrowdStrike has under 5% market share. However, management sees the long-term opportunity as more customers adopt its platformization strategy. Investors may need to ensure they’re viewing the opportunity clearly.\nLooking at CrowdStrike’s Profit\nInvestors commonly use the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio when considering a company's valuation. CrowdStrike currently has a forward P/E of 771x. That’s a little deceiving because the company reported negative GAAP earnings of 44 cents in the last quarter. That was attributable to high stock-based compensation (SBC).\nPaying employees with stock is not unusual, particularly for a growing technology company like CrowdStrike. However, the company does have an unusually high amount of SBC, similar to that of Palantir, which also faces concerns about a high valuation.\nCrowdStrike’s FY2026 outlook suggests the company can generate over $1.3 billion in adjusted operating profit, making its lofty forward multiple look reasonable on a non-GAAP basis. However, on a GAAP basis, stock-based compensation running at nearly 20% of revenue will weigh on earnings.\nSo what’s next? CrowdStrike’s guidance implies it will still have less than 5% share of its $103 billion core cybersecurity market. To triple its non-GAAP operating profits, the company would have to increase its forecasted revenue by about 2.2x, meaning a 10% market share.\nThat would put its annual revenue on par with Palo Alto Networks Inc. NASDAQ: PANW, a company also using a platformization strategy.\nYou Can Wait on CRWD Stock\nCrowdStrike stock has lost its bullish momentum. The stock has crossed below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA), and its MACD is well below the signal line, but may be showing signs of flattening. That’s consistent with an RSI around 36, which suggests a strong earnings report could cause a trend reversal.\nIf that’s the case, investors should look at $475 as an area of resistance. If the stock can push past that, it could signal a broader rally back above $500 and towards all-time highs.\nIf the results disappoint, areas of support could be at $400 (a round number and near February 2025 lows). If it slices below that, investors would have a significant buying opportunity around $375 to $380.\nBefore you consider CrowdStrike, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

The drop is a knee-jerk reaction to tepid news compounded by relatively high short interest that discounts the company’s long-term outlook. It will likely not last long.\nTrading at roughly 7x the long-term earnings forecast ahead of the release, the nearly 20% price plunge deepened the value in this well-positioned cash-generating machine. Monday.com is a leader in workflow management and AI-empowered automation. Its technology and services enable organizations to automate workflows, manage projects more efficiently, and streamline operations, and are gaining traction with businesses and industries worldwide.\nThere Was Nothing Wrong With Monday.com’s Q2 Results\nMonday.com reported a solid quarter with only two things marring the results. The first point is that growth is slowing sequentially, and compared to last year, the second is that the Q3 guidance was only as expected.\nThe takeaway for investors is that growth was expected to slow, results were better-than-forecast, and Q3 guidance had been sufficient to sustain the higher share price ahead of the release; there is no reason why it shouldn’t be afterward.\nThe more critical detail is that the Q2 strengths are expected to linger, and the full-year guide was improved. As of early to mid-August, the company's forecast indicates revenue growth of roughly 26%, which is 200 basis points hotter than MarketBeat’s reported consensus.\nDue to the business trends, this may be considered cautious guidance.\nThe Q2 results are solid. The company outperformed MarketBeat’s reported consensus by more than 100 basis points, growing revenue by nearly 27% compared to last year.\nThe gains were driven by an 8% increase in clients and an 11% increase in existing business, driven by the company’s largest client groups. They grew by 36% and 46% respectively.\nThe margin news is also healthy. The company increased its R&D and faced expense hurdles, but managed to outperform the market’s expectations. The net result is a 100-basis-point contraction in the adjusted operating margin and $1.09 in adjusted EPS, up only 16% year-over-year (YOY) compared to the 26.6% top-line advance, but more than 2500 basis points better than expected and sufficient to produce a significant gain in shareholder value.\nMonday.com Builds Value for Shareholders\nmonday.com Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$305.1870.48% UpsideBuyBased on 25 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $179.01 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $450.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $305.18 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $215.00 |\n|---|\nmonday.com Stock Forecast Details\nMonday.com’s balance sheet health and growth are tied to dilutive share sales, but the company deploys capital efficiently and produces value for investors. The 2% YOY increase in share count and increased liability are offset by increased cash, current and total assets, which lifted equity by 18% year-to-date.\nEquity is expected to continue rising as the year progresses and drive robust support from the sell-side.\nInstitutions, which own about 75% of the stock, provide a solid support base in 2025, and they are buying on balance as of mid-Q3 2025. The analysts, the vocal portion of the group, also provide solid support with their coverage increasing, sentiment firming, and price targets rising ahead of the release, indicating a deep value.\nAlready trading below the low-end of the analysts' range ahead of the release, the post-release price plunge puts the stock well below, suggesting a minimum of 50% upside with the potential for a 75% gain at the consensus.\nMonday.com’s price decline may extend to even deeper levels, but there are signs that support is strong near $200. Numerous price upswings, including two in 2024 and two in early 2025, not only show support at the $200 level but also rising support aligning with an uptrend.\nThe likely outcome is that, based on the results, valuation, and trends of institutions and analysts, this level will continue to serve as support.

However, Uber left no room for interpretation regarding its feelings.\nThe company announced a new $20 billion buyback authorization, showing that it is confident in its future positioning.\nThis buyback program equals 10.7% of Uber’s market capitalization as of the Aug. 8 close. Let’s dive into the company’s latest results to understand why it has undertaken this massive repurchase plan.\nWe’ll also look at two other notable stocks that have increased the size of their buyback chests.\nFree Cash Flow Turnaround Ushers in a New Era of Buybacks for Uber\nIn Q2, Uber’s results were solid. Revenue increased by 18% to $12.65 billion, surpassing Wall Street expectations by nearly $200 million. The company’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 62 cents also beat expectations by 2 cents.\nUber forecasted strong growth in Q3 of between 17% and 21%. Still, shares rose less than 0.2% on Aug. 6 due to the print. However, MarketBeat tracked around half a dozen analysts who boosted their price target on Aug. 7. Among analysts who issued updates, their price target on Uber rose by an average of just under $4.\nAlthough this number signals only a slightly higher confidence in Uber from analysts, the company’s $20 billion buyback plans signal that Uber's confidence in itself has increased substantially. One of the key factors in making this decision was Uber’s robust free cash flow (FCF) generation.\nUber’s last-12-month FCF hit an all-time high of $8.5 billion. Uber raked in $2.5 billion in Q2 alone, an increase of nearly 44% year-over-year. This marked the eighth time out of the last nine quarters that Uber’s FCF growth met or exceeded this level.\nFor most of the company’s history, its FCF has been negative. In conjunction with this, the company rarely engaged in share buybacks. However, now that the firm has grown into somewhat of a cash cow, it is able to confidently spend that money on buybacks.\nIn its earnings call, Uber stated, “at least half of our cash flow generation over the coming years will go to share repurchases.\" Thus, if Uber continues to bring in cash, investors should expect to get rewarded with buybacks.\nROKU’s Buyback Capacity Balloons on Big FCF Increase\nRoku Today\n$92.33 +2.04 (+2.26%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $52.43\n▼\n$104.96 - Price Target\n- $98.96\nLike Uber, entertainment stock Roku NASDAQ: ROKU reported Q2 results that beat estimates but led to a sell-off. Due to the firm's financials, shares fell 15% on Aug. 1. Roku also authorized a $400 million buyback program.\nThat equals around 3.3% of the company’s market cap as of the Aug. 8 close, a solid figure for a new buyback initiative. The company also specifically cited its FCF as a reason for this decision.\nRoku’s last 12 months FCF increased by 23% compared to Q2 2024. Throughout the company’s history, it has only spent a total of around $169 million on buybacks. This illustrates how substantial the firm’s new authorization is, being equal to over twice its total buyback spending since going public.\nLSEG Looks to Spend Over $1 Billion on Buybacks, and Fast\nLondon Stock Exchange Group Today\nLSEGLondon Stock Exchange Group\nGBX 9,285.04 +3.24 (+0.03%) As of 08/18/2025 12:15 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- 9,050\n▼\n£121.85 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.29%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 72.82\n- Price Target\n- £130\nLast up is London Stock Exchange Group LON: LSEG. This approximately $70 billion company is a massive player in capital markets, particularly in Europe. LSEG is one of the key providers of consensus earnings estimates, aggregating analyst forecasts worldwide.\nBased on USD/GBP exchange rates on June 30, the company plans to spend around $1.37 billion on buybacks in the second half of 2025. This is equal to just under 2% of its market capitalization.\nAlthough this is not a massive percentage, the company's plan to execute it in just half a year is substantial.\nOn LSEG’s earnings call, an analyst noted that this would be the largest buyback the company has ever executed over that time frame.\nUber Looks to Make Buybacks Its New Normal\nOverall, investors should see these buyback announcements as positive signs for the three companies above. That is particularly true for Uber, which has now posted positive FCF for ten quarters in a row.\nThe new authorization signals that Uber believes this will continue and wants to make buybacks a staple of its capital allocation policy.\nBefore you consider Uber Technologies, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Taiwan Semiconductor Stock: Own It, Don't Trade It", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/taiwan-semiconductor-stock-own-it-dont-trade-it/", "text": "One of the biggest mistakes investors can make is constantly trading in and out of the wrong stocks, triggering one taxable event after another on their gains. While some smaller, more volatile stocks may lend themselves to short-term trading, others call for the opposite approach—a steady buy-and-hold strategy.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Today\nTSMTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n$241.29 +2.41 (+1.01%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $134.25\n▼\n$248.28 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.02%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 27.51\n- Price Target\n- $258.33\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE: TSM fits squarely into that second category. As a dominant force in the semiconductor industry, it holds a massive footprint in one of technology’s hottest areas. The sector is on the verge of major change as the United States moves to onshore chip manufacturing, especially with new trade tariffs targeting countries that supply much of the world’s semiconductors.\nWith this in mind, Taiwan Semiconductor is a stock best suited for long-term accumulation—buying gradually and holding for an indefinite period.\nThe reason goes beyond the company’s staggering $1 trillion market value. It also lies in the major investments and expansion into the United States that are set to unfold in the coming years.\nThe Bull Case for Taiwan Semiconductor Stock\nThere has never been an invalid bull case for this company. Still, today more than ever, investors should stay alert to the underlying issues that could push this stock to new record highs. Even though it already trades at 97% of its 52-week high, chances are new ceilings will be made in the coming quarters and years, despite what volatility may come its way.\nThe reason is that President Trump is now increasing tariffs on semiconductors, and as recently announced on a live CNBC interview, his rollout points to a high of 200% tariffs by 2027, giving companies like Taiwan Semiconductors a concrete timeline to get their manufacturing capacity within the United States.\nThis means investors can get in early on this massive move, as onshoring its presence will also allow Taiwan Semiconductor to remain one of the leading names in semiconductor equipment and technology, most of which is used by other giants of industry like NVIDIA Co. NASDAQ: NVDA and Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL.\nWith a few years of gains nearly spelled out for investors, selling at the current highs would be futile, since they would only have to keep buying higher and higher, again stacking up more tax events for themselves unnecessarily. In fact, anyone who sells this stock today is most likely doing it for portfolio weighing reasons.\nFor instance, institutional investors from Sanders Capital recently offloaded 7.8% of their massive $8.7 billion position in Taiwan Semiconductor. This should not be seen as a bearish sign, considering that this stock represents 11.6% of their portfolio, a recent run to 52-week highs likely bloated the stock to become too big a name in their book.\nThis is a common practice at investment funds, where they reduce a name’s weight in a portfolio to avoid it becoming too big a constituent, thereby not necessarily indicating a change in sentiment or view toward the company.\nWhere Taiwan Semiconductor Can Go Next\nThis is a more abstract question that can be answered in the same way as it is traditionally responded to by investment banks on Wall Street. Taiwan Semiconductor stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.6x today, but it still offers a steep discount to the rest of the computer sector’s average of 50.3x.\nPerhaps some investors and analysts had discounted this stock due to fears that it was so exposed to the Asian region, where most trade tariffs seem to be focused. However, changing the game plan to onshoring in the United States renders this bearish view useless.\nThat change alone could be the catalyst to bring Taiwan Semiconductor stock to a valuation more in line with where the rest of its peers are trading today in terms of P/E multiples. More than that, the fundamental story is strong enough today to make this happen.\nIn the latest quarterly announcement, Taiwan Semiconductor's stock reported $2.47 in earnings per share (EPS) compared to the Wall Street consensus for only $2.13, reiterating the fact that even analysts may be looking at this company through an overly conservative lens.\nAs compliance with global tariffs and changes in demographics clear the way for future growth, further EPS beats in the future may very well start to deliver the sort of upside Taiwan Semiconductor has been missing out on compared to peers.

{"title": "Why SoundHound AI's Earnings Show the Stock Can Move Higher", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-soundhound-ais-earnings-show-the-stock-can-move-higher/", "text": "One of the most important questions investors need to ask during and after an earnings announcement for a stock is whether growth has been priced in or not. Typically, the days after a stock moves on earnings are when broader market participants attempt to land on a fair price that reflects the important information they’ve just received, and that is where some will fall off the track.\nSoundHound AI Today\n$14.82 -0.77 (-4.94%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $4.32\n▼\n$24.98 - Price Target\n- $13.36\nOthers will stick to the right narrative for further gains.\nThat question is being asked for shares of SoundHound AI Inc. NASDAQ: SOUN after the stock rallied by over 26% in a single day after reporting its latest quarterly earnings results. Not only is this a critical time to be aware of what comes next, but this one is particularly tricky, considering the company has yet to achieve net profitability per share, sending some investors into a cloud of doubt.\nToday, some of those doubts will be removed as investors hone in on the numbers that really matter and explain why the macro backdrop stands to help SoundHound’s services and technology into another wave of expansion for the coming quarters. When it comes to the technology sector, this stock is as good as any other despite not having net profitability.\nHere’s why that is.\nExpansion at the Forefront of SoundHound AI\nFor this $5.4 billion company, a 26% rally takes more than just a good quarter and justified attention from the market overall. As most investors are focused on the semiconductor and chipmaking areas of this artificial intelligence race, such a move implies that sentiment and attention might be shifting into other areas.\nHowever, SoundHound's bull case comes from a much broader thesis. As President Trump changes migration policies in the United States, industries like retail and service-based companies see some of their workforce demographics change. The remaining ones are now overloaded with more work to compensate for the gap.\nIn recent employment reports, it is no surprise that many workers are asking for higher wages. If businesses agree to these increases, they face two options: pass the added costs on to consumers, which could fuel inflation, or invest in technology to improve efficiency.\nThis is why SoundHound’s earnings show that the company’s services are contracted across several restaurant brands. Red Lobster, Applebee’s, IHOP, and others have sought to add SoundHound’s artificial intelligence capabilities to expedite their service process, efficiently reducing some costs to accommodate potential higher wages.\nAnd that’s not all. SoundHound has been a successful case study in other industries, such as healthcare, retail, financial services, and even automotive. Even Chinese car manufacturers have contracted SoundHound’s software to be integrated into their vehicles, a massive growth market for the company’s future.\nIt’s All in the Numbers\nWith all these tailwinds in mind, investors shouldn’t be surprised to see the company’s net revenue grow to $42.7 million this quarter, a massive 217% increase from the same quarter last year, a record in the company’s history.\nEven after this 26% rally and critical footprint expansion, SoundHound stock still trades at a dismal 54% of its 52-week high, meaning investors can still enjoy a discounted opportunity to be exposed to this further growth down the line. Moreover, enough bears are out there to trigger a jet-fueled rally higher.\nSoundHound AI Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$13.36-9.87% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 9 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $14.82 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $18.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $13.36 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $7.00 |\n|---|\nSoundHound AI Stock Forecast Details\nConsidering that short positions in SoundHound stock now amount to $1.4 billion, or 33.7% of the total float, another rally like the one investors just witnessed could trigger what’s known as a short squeeze. This is an event where short sellers are forced to close their positions at a loss, which involves buying back the stock.\nThis additional buying pressure, worth up to $1.4 billion, would be a massive boost in terms of demand for the stock, and it will be translated into higher prices if this happens. Now, for the other side of the equation, the recent earnings did trigger new institutional buying interest for this company.\nThose from Geode Capital Management justified boosting their holdings in SoundHound stock by 8.3% as of the day of the earnings release, bringing their entire position to a high of $94.8 million or 2.2% ownership in the whole company. This is not something investors should take lightly.\nInstitutions often stay away from companies this small, so when they decide to move into them, chances are they are expecting a higher long-term run backed by fundamentals, as investors can verify today for SoundHound. With this much financial momentum, it’s a matter of time before this stock reports net profitability and retests old 52-week highs of just under $25 per share.\nBefore you consider SoundHound AI, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and SoundHound AI wasn't on the list.\nWhile SoundHound AI currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nThinking about investing in Meta, Roblox, or Unity?

{"title": "Post-Earnings, How Does D-Wave Stack Up Against Quantum Rivals?", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/post-earnings-how-does-d-wave-stack-up-against-quantum-rivals/", "text": "D-Wave Quantum Today\n$16.53 -0.48 (-2.82%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $0.80\n▼\n$20.56 - Price Target\n- $19.27\nRising quantum computing star D-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS posted mixed earnings results in early August 2025, as revenue growth surpassed analyst predictions but losses came in wider than expected.\nThough not the unqualified positive signal some bullish investors were likely hoping for, D-Wave's earnings did not dent the short-term stock performance; shares remain up almost 20% in the last month.\nGiven the emerging nature of the industry, each new earnings cycle drives new speculation among investors about which quantum firm or firms may be best positioned to take the lead. Investors are likely wondering how D-Wave stacks up against competitors like IonQ Inc. NYSE: IONQ and Quantum Computing Inc. NASDAQ: QUBT in light of the latest financial information.\nWhere D-Wave Stands Mid-Year\nWith a 42% year-over-year (YOY) surge in revenue and bookings nearly doubling to $1.3 million over the same period, D-Wave may have eased concerns about marketability in this latest earnings round. With its Advantage2 system now generally available, the company is looking forward to additional sales, as well as a series of upgrades of earlier systems already operational for multiple customers.\nAdditionally, D-Wave's marketability proposition is further strengthened by the company's announcements surrounding major partnerships with an unnamed large aerospace and defense firm as well as law enforcement in North Wales. The more use cases of D-Wave's technology that emerge, the more likely it seems that the company will be able to draw additional interest across industries.\nFinally, D-Wave's advantageous cash position remains a boon. The company ended the quarter with an incredible $819 in cash reserves, positioning it well to continue to advance its technological developments—such as cryogenic packaging, which could be key to unlocking advances in gate-model tech, so far a gap for the firm—and to put forward an M&A strategy.\nIonQ Also Has Mixed Earnings, Other Factors Fueling Interest\nIonQ Today\n$40.31 +0.08 (+0.20%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $6.54\n▼\n$54.74 - Price Target\n- $45.00\nAmong D-Wave's competitors, one of the most direct comparisons is IonQ, which also reported second-quarter earnings in the same week. This rival is more than double the size of D-Wave by market cap, and its revenue is quite a bit higher as well. What's more, IonQ revenue increased YOY at roughly double the pace of D-Wave's—81.6% for IonQ compared to 40.9% for D-Wave. This brought IonQ to a tidy $3.5 million revenue surprise and a total of $20.7 million in revenue for the quarter, driven by new and expanding business in Japan, South Korea, and elsewhere.\nIonQ's growing global footprint should concern D-Wave investors, although the latter firm is also making aggressive moves to establish an international presence. However, IonQ shares D-Wave's profitability woes: losses per share of 70 cents widened significantly YOY and missed expectations by an eye-opening 57 cents.\nInvestors did not react negatively to this news, though, and IonQ shares remain up more than 9% in the last month. Perhaps one reason for this is that the widening losses are mostly attributable to operating expenses which tripled YOY as the firm boosted its R&D spending by 231%. Spending heavily to advance technology may be a worthwhile trade-off, even if it means bigger losses in the short term.\nFinally, IonQ is gaining attention from major tech firms, an update that could boost the company's prospects significantly. Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN recently bought an equity stake in IonQ worth about $37 million. Though not a huge purchase, it could signal the e-commerce giant's interest in partnering with IonQ on a range of services going forward. Additionally, IonQ's hardware is available through Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform, despite the fact that the larger firm is also building its own quantum tech. All of these could give IonQ a critical leg up on D-Wave.\nMonitor Quantum Computing for Updates\nQuantum Computing Today\nQUBTQuantum Computing\n$15.90 +0.58 (+3.79%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $0.58\n▼\n$27.15 - Price Target\n- $18.50\nFirms like Quantum Computing report earnings on a different schedule—this firm is slated to report its second-quarter fiscal 2025 results in early October. Still, there are some noteworthy aspects of Quantum Computing's recent activity to keep in mind, and these warrant investor attention when it does post earnings updates as well.\nQuantum Computing posted positive earnings of 13 cents per share in its last report, although revenue was weak and below analyst predictions. The company's new foundry in Arizona is now operational, though, and that should accelerate revenue growth in future quarters, particularly into 2026.\nQuantum Computing also has made significant moves to increase its presence through partnerships with Sloan Kettering, NASA, Delft University of Technology, and others. Despite its smaller size compared to D-Wave and IonQ, it is a worthy rival in the race toward quantum dominance.\nBefore you consider D-Wave Quantum, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Oracle’s 2025 Rally Is Only Half Over: 5 Reasons Why", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/oracles-2025-rally-is-only-half-over-5-reasons-why/", "text": "Oracle Today\n$248.86 +0.58 (+0.23%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $118.86\n▼\n$260.87 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.80%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 57.34\n- Price Target\n- $227.04\nUp roughly $75 YTD in early August, Oracle’s NYSE: ORCL 2025 stock price rally is only half over.\nThe technicals, analysts' trends, and fundamental outlook support the argument for another $75 stock price increase, and the trends are all positive.\nThe likely outcome is that Oracle’s stock price will advance by more than $75 over the mid to long term, providing investors a significant upside.\nContinued demand for cloud infrastructure, AI integration, and database solutions could serve as key catalysts, while Oracle’s strong cash flow and history of shareholder returns add further support to the bullish case.\nIf these tailwinds persist, the stock could remain one of the tech sector’s standout performers into 2026.\nThe Technical Outlook for Oracle’s Stock Price Is Robust\nThe technical factors are robust and suggest a $75 move is not only possible but will likely be quick and sharp, potentially occurring before the end of 2025. The weekly chart shows an aggressive-looking Bull Flag/Triangle pattern that is compounded by rising volume and convergent MACD.\nConvergent MACD is a sign of a strong and strengthening market, so, with Oracle’s reading at historically high levels, investors can assume a high degree of market commitment.\nLikewise, the chart of monthly price action is equally bullish, revealing a steady uptrend that began to accelerate in 2021. Since then, the market for Oracle has ramped steadily higher with MACD and volume converging the entire way. Because the outlook for Oracle’s revenue and earnings growth is still in discovery, these technical trends will likely continue for at least another quarter.\nInstitutional Trends Support the Uptrend in Oracle Stock\nThe institutions own only 44% of Oracle’s stock but support the price action. Co-founder Larry Ellison is reported to own another 40%+ of the shares, and he’s not selling, making Oracle a tightly held company with a robust institutional tailwind unlikely to end soon.\nThe strength is seen in the volume, which is elevated and rising as of early Q3, and the breadth of action. While Ellison holds most of the shares, the institutional holdings are spread across nearly 5,000 organizations, including ETFs, retirement and mutual funds, and wealth managers.\nThe Analysts Trends Support and Lead Oracle’s Market: New Highs Are Likely\nOracle Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$227.04-8.77% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 34 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $248.86 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $325.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $227.04 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $130.00 |\n|---|\nOracle Stock Forecast Details\nOracle’s analyst trends can be summed up in a single statement: Oracle is ranked prominently on MarketBeat’s list of Most Upgraded Stocks.\nThe data reveals steadily increasing coverage, firming sentiment with a bullish bias to the Moderate Buy rating, and an uptrend in the price target revisions.\nMarketBeat tracks 34 analysts, with 76% rating at Buy and none at Sell.\nThe price target, up 5% in July and 52% in the preceding 12 months, lags the price action in early August but is supportive, while the recent revisions are leading to the high-end range.\nThat puts this stock at $325, roughly $75 above the August highs and critical resistance target.\nOracle’s Business Momentum Continues to Grow\nOracle’s business is fundamentally sound, with revenue growing by double digits annually and supported by a robust pipeline. The latest news includes a partnership with DigitalReality to help accelerate digitization and AI adoption, potential for a new deal with Skydance-Paramount, and expanded demand for the Stargate Project.\nThe deal with Digital Realty and the potential deal with Skydance-Paramount demonstrate the company’s utility across various sectors, industries, and verticals, while the Stargate Project ensures long-term strength. Oracle has already begun delivering technology for the initial build, portions of which are already operational, an additional 4.5 GW are now in the pipeline, and a half dozen additional campuses are expected to be built over time.\nOracle’s FQ1 Results Will Be a Catalyst\nThe catalyst for the move will likely be the FQ1 2026 results, which are expected to be released in early September. The analysts' revisions are mixed, roughly half increasing and half decreasing their forecasts, but the outlook is solid.\nThe group forecasts revenue growth to accelerate sequentially, and compared to last year, the actual results will likely outperform the consensus. A critical factor in the company’s stock price rise this year is the growing deal pipeline and remaining performance obligation (RPO), which has been outpacing revenue growth by a wide margin and is up more than 40% in the FQ4 report.\nBefore you consider Oracle, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Oracle wasn't on the list.\nWhile Oracle currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nLooking to profit from the electric vehicle mega-trend?

{"title": "These 3 Stocks Just Announced Dividend Increases of 33% to 55%", "url": "https://www.dividendstocks.com/articles/these-3-stocks-just-announced-dividend-increases-of-33-to-55/", "text": "Key Points\n- Three energy, asset management, and automotive stocks just announced massive dividend increases.\n- These names lift their dividends by 33%, 44%, and 55%, respectively.\n- All three now have forward-looking dividend yields above the 1.1% offered by the S&P 500 Index.\nWhile shareholders often welcome dividend increases of any size, the bigger the boost, the bigger the impact. Typically, dividend boosts in a single period don’t extend much higher than 20%. However, that’s not the case for the three names discussed below.\nThey just announced huge increases of 33% or more, demonstrating their commitment to returning increasingly higher amounts of capital to shareholders. Let’s dive into the three stocks that are lifting their dividends by some of the highest percentages investors will encounter. All data is as of the August 8 close.\nExcelerate Energy More Than Triples Its Dividend in One Year\nThe first is Excelerate Energy (NYSE: EE). This mid-cap energy company just announced a dividend increase that is anything but middling. On July 31, Excelerate lifted its quarterly dividend to 8 cents per share, a rise of 33% from its previous payment. The increase comes as Excelerate acquired liquefied natural gas (LNG) and power assets in Jamaica, increasing its contracted and recurring cash flow.\nThis new dividend is payable on September 4 to shareholders of record as of the August 20 close. This gives the stock an indicated dividend yield of approximately 1.3%. Notably, this dividend increase moves the stock's yield to above the 1.1% yield of the S&P 500 Index.\nExcelerate has experienced massive growth in its dividend over the past year. In September of 2024, Excelerate paid a dividend of just 2.5 cents per share. Thus, this latest boost means that Excelerate has increased its quarterly dividend by 220% in approximately 12 months.\nThe company expects its dividend growth rate to slow significantly, but it should still be competitive. Excelerate targets a “low double-digit annual dividend growth rate” from 2026 to 2028. This shows that the firm has a solid chance of continuing to deliver a higher dividend yield for investors over the next few years.\nTPG Makes Strong Gesture to Shareholders, Raises Dividend 44%\nNext up is alternative asset manager TPG (NASDAQ: TPG). The company lifted its quarterly dividend to 59 cents per share. Compared to Excelerate, this new dividend marks an even more impressive 44% boost versus its last payout.\nStill, it is essential to note that, like many alternative asset managers, TPG’s dividend shifts quarterly. In fact, over the last 13 quarters, TPG has never paid the same dividend per share for two quarters in a row.\nThis makes it hard to put an exact number on the firm’s forward-looking dividend yield.\nHowever, extrapolating the company’s recent dividend growth would put it at around $1.94 per share over the next twelve months. That would equal a dividend yield of approximately 3.1%. Wall Street estimates that the firm’s next 12 months' yield will be around 3.7%.\nDespite the subjectivity in calculating the stock’s forward yield, the fact that TPG’s dividend has trended upward significantly over time is undeniable. It paid out $1.65 in 2024, compared to $1.09 in 2022.\nBWA Returns to Dividend Growth With Massive New Increase\nThe most significant dividend increase comes from BorgWarner (NYSE: BWA). The company makes various components for combustion, hybrid, and electric vehicles. On July 31, the company announced a huge 55% boost to its quarterly dividend. Its new 17-cent per share dividend will be payable on September 15 to shareholders of record on September 2. This move lifts the firm’s indicated dividend yield to nearly 1.8%.\nThe company’s huge dividend increase has been a long time coming; BorgWarner had not lifted its dividend in eight quarters.\nThe firm’s dividend per share returns to the same level it was from 2017 to mid-2023 after BorgWarner significantly reduced its dividend in late 2023.\nThis dividend increase comes as the company has recently seen a huge improvement in its free cash flow. Over the last 12 months, BorgWarner's FCF reached $1.175 billion, the highest level in its history. Further demonstrating the firm’s FCF improvement is that BorgWarner also increased its share buyback authorization to $1 billion.\nThis is equal to a huge 12% of the company’s market capitalization.\nEE, TPG, & BWA All Now Provide Investors With Above-Market Yields\nOverall, these three stocks’ recent dividend increases are very impressive, blowing the typical boosts companies announce out of the water.\nAdditionally, all three now hold expected yields that solidly eclipse that of the S&P 500 Index, allowing investors to generate above-market yields.\nGet Income-Generating Stocks Like Excelerate Energy in Your Inbox.\nStop riding the roller coaster of the stock market and sign-up to receive DividendStocks.com's daily ex-dividend stocks and dividend investing news for EE and related companies.\nCompanies Mentioned in This Article:| Company | Current Price | Price Change | Dividend Yield | P/E Ratio | Consensus Rating | Consensus Price Target |\n|---|\n| Excelerate Energy (EE) | $23.79 | -0.6% | 1.01% | 17.49 | Hold | $32.86 |\n| TPG (TPG) | $62.45 | -1.6% | 2.63% | -328.68 | Moderate Buy | $62.57 |\n| BorgWarner (BWA) | $41.69 | +0.6% | 1.06% | 44.35 | Moderate Buy | $39.64 |\nAbout Leo Miller\nExperience\nLeo Miller has been a contributing writer for DividendStocks.com since 2024.\n- Professional Background: Leo Miller is a financial writer with a background in investment research and market analysis.

{"title": "4 Stocks That May Get a Big Earnings Bump This Week", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/4-stocks-that-may-get-a-big-earnings-bump-this-week/", "text": "As Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN reminds us, sometimes it can be difficult to predict how the market will respond to a company's earnings report, even if the firm comes out ahead of analyst expectations for earnings and revenue. Amazon's dip following its latest report, despite top- and bottom-line beats, shows that sometimes details like forward guidance or the suggestion of short-term difficulties can be enough to undo any investor goodwill that may have built.\nWith that in mind, it's impossible to predict how the four companies below will fare as they report earnings the week of August 11. However, each of them stands out from its industry peers for its strong support from analysts and enjoys other potential selling points.\nWe'll take a closer look for anyone considering a purchase before earnings results come in.\nCrucial Player in Domestic Chip Manufacturing\nApplied Materials Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$194.8419.15% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 28 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $163.53 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $225.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $194.84 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $150.00 |\n|---|\nApplied Materials Stock Forecast Details\nApplied Materials Inc. NASDAQ: AMAT provides technologies essential to the manufacturing of chips, DRAM, and NAND memory, making it a key player in the AI/data center niche. However, the company's addressable market goes well beyond that space, and Applied Materials may play a hand in the construction of everything from personal computers and smartphones to cloud servers, among many other things.\nThe chip foundry market is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years, which should keep demand for Applied Materials' Etch and eBeam products and technology high. The company also recently announced a partnership with Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL and Texas Instruments Inc. NASDAQ: TXN to supply American-made manufacturing equipment.\nThus, the firm is poised to benefit from a regulatory landscape strongly favoring domestic chip production.\nWhile these last points will not factor into Applied Materials' most recent earnings quarter, analysts are optimistic and expect earnings to grow by 7.4% this year. Seventeen out of 25 analysts have rated AMAT shares a Buy, and the stock could have more than 10% in near-term upside potential based on price targets.\nBerry Global Deal Could Boost Amcor\nAmcor Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$11.4234.55% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 9 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $8.49 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $12.50 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $11.42 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $10.00 |\n|---|\nAmcor Stock Forecast Details\nPackaging products giant Amcor plc NYSE: AMCR is likely to get a boost in its earnings report this week, the company's fiscal fourth-quarter report, thanks to its all-stock combination with packaging rival Berry Global. The deal, valued at over $8 billion, was completed by the end of April 2025, within the latest quarter.\nAmcor has said the acquisition should provide 12% earnings per share (EPS) accretion in fiscal 2026 and at least 35% in EPS accretion by the end of fiscal 2028.\nIt's difficult to say exactly how much of this impact may be felt so early on, but signs of success in this area could excite investors, giving AMCR shares a boost. Particularly if the company can maintain its strong cash flow and attractive valuation, shares could get a bump.\nThis may be why eight out of 10 analysts view AMCR shares as a Buy. Based on analyst price targets, the company also has more than 19% upside potential.\nFinancial Services Expansion Fuels Sea's Rise\nSEA Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$173.49-2.04% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 14 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $177.11 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $219.90 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $173.49 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $100.00 |\n|---|\nSEA Stock Forecast Details\nSingaporean internet and mobile platform firm Sea Ltd. NYSE: SE has made significant inroads into the digital financial services space. This should help the company continue to dominate in the Southeast Asian region, where it already has a considerable market share for its e-commerce platform.\nOn the other hand, short interest has risen by about 2.5% in the last month, perhaps owing to the company's high valuation, which currently trades at a P/E ratio of more than 104.\nHowever, that lofty valuation is not a concern for most analysts. Ten out of 13 view it as a Buy, and a consensus price target of $159.82 suggests the stock still has room to climb about 8.2% in the near term.\nPerhaps even more interesting for investors watching the company's upcoming earnings report is the analyst conviction that Sea's earnings could quadruple in the coming year to $2.96 per share.\nAn Overlooked Credit-Tech Name With Big Growth\nQfin Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$51.7373.02% UpsideBuyBased on 3 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $29.90 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $65.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $51.73 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $37.50 |\n|---|\nQfin Stock Forecast Details\nCredit-tech platform 360 Jietiao is backed by Qifu Technology Inc.

{"title": "3 Natural Gas Stocks Powering the AI Data Center Boom", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-natural-gas-stocks-powering-the-ai-data-center-boom/", "text": "Energy stocks are notoriously cyclical. Over the last five years, the sector has lagged the broader market, especially the tech sector, mainly due to the global pandemic and uneven economic recovery.\nHowever, in 2025, natural gas stocks are making a strong rally, and the reason for that surge has to do with one of the hottest tech trends: artificial intelligence (AI).\nAs tech giants pour billions into building and expanding data centers, the demand for reliable, round-the-clock power is exploding—and much of that power is coming from natural gas.\nThink of a data center like a car. It might be engineered for performance, but without fuel, it doesn’t go anywhere. Similarly, AI data centers must run 24/7 to keep up with the relentless processing needs of large language models (LLMs). That requires a stable, scalable power source.\nThe good news for investors is that this AI-driven energy buildout will play out over years, possibly decades, so it’s not too late to invest in this trend. Here are three natural gas stocks well-positioned to benefit.\nWilliams: Data Centers Moving Closer to the Pipeline\nWilliams Companies Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$62.8611.17% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 16 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $56.54 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $70.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $62.86 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $55.00 |\n|---|\nWilliams Companies Stock Forecast Details\nThe Williams Companies Inc. NYSE: WMB operates one of the largest interstate natural gas pipeline systems in the United States, with a network spanning key energy-producing regions and high-growth population centers.\nThe company has explicitly cited rising demand from data center developers, particularly those planning large-scale AI-ready facilities. These projects require access to high-volume, low-cost, and reliable baseload power. That closely aligns with Williams' pipeline and gathering assets in regions like the Gulf Coast, Appalachia, and the Southeast.\nData center developers are now actively selecting sites near existing natural gas infrastructure to reduce both cost and permitting complexity. In some cases, Williams is engaging in direct discussions with developers to co-locate facilities or provide dedicated capacity. This is increasing the company’s capital expenditures (capex) spending, a fact that was reflected in its second-quarter earnings, in which Williams missed earnings per share (EPS) forecasts by three cents. It also shows up in the company’s 1.75% debt-to-equity ratio, which is above its historical average.\nPlus, at 29x earnings, WMB stock is expensive to its sector and to itself. However, investors can collect a dividend with a 3.45% yield to mitigate the stock’s range-pound performance in the past year.\nEQT: Certified Low-Emissions Gas Are a Competitive Edge\nEQT Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$60.3219.30% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 19 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $50.56 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $73.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $60.32 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $40.00 |\n|---|\nEQT Stock Forecast Details\nCasual industry observers might not think of putting natural gas companies and innovation in the same sentence. However, EQT Corporation NYSE: EQT may make investors rethink their position.\nEQT is the largest natural gas producer in the United States and an aggressive investor in certified low-emissions natural gas. The company participates in third-party certification programs to deliver gas tagged as “responsibly sourced” or “certified low-emissions.”\nThis is increasingly important for data center developers because of the 24/7 nature of the energy demand. The search for clean energy sources is driving nuclear energy demand. But that will take many years to build out. Low-emissions natural gas is here today, and so is the opportunity for EQT.\nA recent pullback in EQT stock makes this an attractive entry point, particularly with analysts forecasting 32% earnings growth over the next 12 months. With a forward P/E around 15x, the company trades at a discount to itself and the sector. It also has an attractive debt-to-equity ratio of 0.32.\nPowering AI with Gas Turbines and Grid Reliability\nGE Vernova Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$560.21-10.30% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 31 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $624.51 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $736.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $560.21 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $255.00 |\n|---|\nGE Vernova Stock Forecast Details\nThe first two natural gas stocks on this list have been involved with transportation. GE Vernova NYSE: GEV, the energy spin-off from General Electric, takes a different route: manufacturing the hardware essential for natural gas applications.\nGEV has been one of the best-performing stocks of 2025, up 96% as of Aug. 7. It is also one of the world’s leading producers of natural gas turbines, building the kind of equipment needed to power regions where AI data centers may create massive, unpredictable demands on the grid.\nAs hyperscale data centers increasingly seek on-site or nearby generation, GE Vernova’s turbines offer a reliable, grid-independent power solution, especially in constrained utility capacity.\nThe company is also a leader in grid modernization, supplying transformers, circuit breakers, and smart grid software to help utilities manage surging electricity demand. In short, GE Vernova doesn’t just sell energy equipment; it builds the infrastructure powering the AI era.\nTrading at 100x forward earnings, GEV stock is expensive. However, it’s also expected to grow earnings at 67.8% over the next 12 months. That demand is a key reason why analysts are increasing their price targets for GEV stock.\nBefore you consider GE Vernova, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and GE Vernova wasn't on the list.\nWhile GE Vernova currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nThinking about investing in Meta, Roblox, or Unity?

{"title": "An Atomic Sized Surge Is Brewing for NuScale Power Stock Price", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/an-atomic-sized-surge-is-brewing-for-nuscale-power-stock-price/", "text": "NuScale Power Today\nSMRNuScale Power\n$34.88 -0.59 (-1.66%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $6.88\n▼\n$53.50 - Price Target\n- $34.44\nNuScale Power’s NYSE: SMR stock price is heading for an atomic-sized surge, driven by its market position, accelerated timeline to operations, and market dynamics. The company’s position is unparalleled; it is the only one with U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission design approval and on track to deploy its first commercial reactors within a few years.\nThe accelerating timeline is caused by the Trump administration’s removal of red tape. The latest news is that an upgraded design received its first approvals faster than expected, positioning the company to serve a wider range of customers.\nRegarding market dynamics, numerous factors suggest a strengthening market with potential for growth, and a catalyst is anticipated by year-end.\nNuScale Market Volume Approaches Critical Mass\nNuScale’s market volume has been elevated and increasing for the last two years. Although the record was set in 2024, the critical detail is the 30-day moving average, which continues to rise. It stands at nearly 14 million shares daily, reflecting a strengthening market and the strength is echoed in other indicators, including the MACD.\nThe MACD momentum indicator hit record levels in July, converging with the stock price highs and indicating a high probability that the highs will at least be retested. In this scenario, the market for NuScale stock may correct from its current levels, but it will set up a buying opportunity that will likely lead to a new high down the road.\nNuScale Advances Timeline to Commercialized Operations\nAlthough Oklo NYSE: OKLO is on track to deploy a reactor sooner than NuScale, Oklo’s reactor is a trial to prove its technology. When it comes to commercializing operations, NuScale is the leader, with regulatory approvals in hand and the first U.S.-based contracts expected by the end of the year.\nPotential buyers range from hyperscalers and the data center industry to a variety of industrial sectors. The expected start of commercial revenue has moved up from a possible late-2028 or 2029 launch to as early as 2027, and perhaps even sooner.\nThat’s great news for investors because of its capital position. The company leaned into capital-raising activities in 2024 and 2025, increasing its share count and debt, but is well-capitalized in 2025. The company’s cash position should be sufficient to see it through to commercial operations with minimal risk of additional dilution.\nAs it stands, the share count is up nearly 55% YTD at the end of Q2.\nInstitutions and Analysts Drive Volume Gains in SMR Stock\nThe good news is that the institutions bought most of the new shares. The institutional activity is robust in 2025, with the group owning nearly 80% of the stock and buying on balance all year. The balance of activity was robustly bullish in the first half, netting more than $3 in shares for every $1 sold.\nThe only bad news is that most activity fell dramatically in the first month of Q3, and the balance shifted in favor of sellers, a trend that could continue as the quarter progresses.\nNuScale Power Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$34.44-1.25% DownsideHoldBased on 11 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $34.88 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $46.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $34.44 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $20.00 |\n|---|\nNuScale Power Stock Forecast Details\nThe analysts are an offsetting factor. The data tracked by MarketBeat reveals increased coverage, firming conviction in the long-term outlook, and a rapidly rising consensus price target.\nThe amount of coverage has increased by more than 70% to 11 analysts in the last six months, driving broad market sentiment.\nThe consensus rating fell from Buy to Hold, but this was offset by the increased coverage and bias within the data.\nAs of early August, there are no Sell ratings and three Buy/Strong Buys. Regarding the price target, it lags the price action in 2025 but is up more than 300% in 12 months, with the high-end range leading it.\nBefore you consider NuScale Power, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Why Trade Desk Crashed 40% Despite a Q2 Sales Beat", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-trade-desk-crashed-40-despite-a-q2-sales-beat/", "text": "Trade Desk Today\n$54.95 +2.83 (+5.43%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $42.96\n▼\n$141.53 - P/E Ratio\n- 66.21\n- Price Target\n- $88.58\nTrue to form, advertising technology stock The Trade Desk NASDAQ: TTD saw huge volatility after its latest earnings release. This time, it wasn’t for the better. Early morning trading on Aug. 8 saw shares down 39% after the results.\nThe stock took a big step back after shares gained nearly 19% following its Q1 2025 earnings release.\nSince posting Q1 earnings, shares gained around 47% through the Aug. 7 close. The market’s reaction to The Trade Desk’s latest earnings shows that investors deemed such a significant gain unjustified.\nLet’s dive into the firm’s results to understand what’s driving markets to wipe out billions in value in TTD shares.\nMarket and Wall Street Expectations for The Trade Desk’s Q2 Show Big Disconnect\nIn Q2, The Trade Desk posted revenue of $694 million for a growth rate of 19%. This was better than the $686 million and the 17.3% growth rate that Wall Street expected. The firm’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at 41 cents, one cent lower than estimated.\nOverall, adjusted EPS increased by 5% compared to Wall Street projections of 7.7%. The company’s Q3 guidance of $717 million, or 14% growth, was in line with estimates.\nStill, the company’s revenue growth and Q3 guidance indicate a significant deceleration in growth versus prior quarters. The company saw revenue growth of 26% in Q2 2024.\nGoing into that, released shares were trading at a very similar level as they were going into the Q2 2025 release of around $88. With growth coming in 700 basis points lower in Q2 2025, markets could not justify the stock’s valuation, leading to the massive sell-off.\nThis comes even though the 19% growth was technically above Wall Street estimates. Still, the precipitous rise in The Trade Desk’s stock price over the last few months meant that the true expectations were much higher than Wall Street estimates.\nWalled Gardens Punch The Trade Desk in the Mouth\nThe company’s loss of market share to advertising giants like Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META adds further disappointment to its results.\nThis is demonstrated by the fact that in Q2, Meta’s advertising revenue grew by nearly 22%, outpacing The Trade Desk’s growth. Meta is an example of a “Walled Garden.\" The company controls all of the content and data in its ecosystem and the tools used to buy ads on it.\nThis gives the company control over its advertising ecosystem's supply and demand; marketers can only buy ads (demand) shown alongside Meta’s content (supply).\nThis contrasts with The Trade Desk’s open-internet business model. The Trade Desk doesn’t have its own content (supply). Instead, its platform looks at content owned by third parties, such as podcasts posted on Spotify Technology’s NYSE: SPOT app.\nThen, it matches those who want to buy ads with the content that will allow those ads to perform best.\nOverall, one of the fundamental battles The Trade Desk is fighting is whether its or the Walled Garden model will win out long-term. The Trade Desk’s slower growth relative to Meta indicates that its open-internet model lost out in Q2. This creates elevated uncertainty over whether the open-internet model will prevail over time.\nHowever, there is reason to believe that The Trade Desk’s model can win over time. A key factor driving Meta’s robust growth is its use of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the performance of ads on its platform.\nThe Trade Desk also leverages AI, but argues that Meta can implement the technology more easily in the short term because it controls its ecosystem. Meanwhile, The Trade Desk is trying to implement AI across a vast internet landscape with a complete variety of data sets and types of content.\nThe company says this approach is more difficult to implement in the short term but will have a greater long-term payoff.\nMassive Price Target Ranges Show TTD Is a High-Risk, High-Reward Stock\nTrade Desk Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$88.5861.19% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 35 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $54.95 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $155.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $88.58 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $45.00 |\n|---|\nTrade Desk Stock Forecast Details\nThe vast range of Wall Street price targets on The Trade Desk shows intense debate between the Walled Gardens and the open internet model.\nBMO’s updated target sits at $98, while Moffett Nathanson’s is less than half that at $45.\nOne signals approximately 83% upside in The Trade Desk shares, while the other signals additional downside of 16%.\nOverall, The Trade Desk is a highly volatile stock with a stark range of opinions surrounding it.\nIt is the epitome of a stock that requires huge conviction in its business model and a willingness to ride the roller coaster long-term.\nBefore you consider Trade Desk, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "3 Big Dividend Plays With Strong Earnings to Back Them", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-big-dividend-plays-with-strong-earnings-to-back-them/", "text": "Long-term dividend plays tend to be more stable than many other stocks—after all, this stability is why they are able to provide consistent dividends in the first place. Traditional dividend stocks are large, well-established companies that are unlikely to experience significant volatility apart from trends affecting the broader market.\nThat said, even favorite names among dividend investors can cause shareholder anxiety if their fundamentals shift to the point that they have to consider reducing or even canceling distributions. It's essential for dividend stocks to maintain their top and bottom lines, their cash flow, and other key elements in order to be able to confidently continue to pay—and hopefully increase—their payouts to investors. That's why earnings season is important for dividend stocks, including those companies that are so established that they may not otherwise draw much attention when they release a report.\nLet's take a look below at three dividend-paying favorites that also had strong earnings for the most recent quarter, a sign that their distributions remain robust.\nEarnings Beat, Reduced Expenses, Strong Cash Flow For Waste Management\nWaste and recyclables collection services giant Waste Management Inc. NYSE: WM is a compelling dividend play owing to the vital and consistent nature of the work the company does. It's also large, with a network of hundreds of landfills across the country and a market capitalization of more than $92 billion.\nWaste Management Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 1.47%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $3.30\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 22 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 48.96%\n- Recent Dividend Payment\n- Jun. 20\nWM Dividend History\nThese factors have helped Waste Management to build a 22-year history of dividend increases, alongside a dividend yield of 1.43% and a payout ratio just under 49%.\nSigns of continued growth in the firm's fundamentals will help to ensure that it can maintain this dividend momentum into the future. The company's second-quarter 2025 earnings report provides just that. Waste Management noted beats on both earnings per share (EPS) and revenue, as the latter of these figures climbed by 19% year-over-year (YOY). The strength of its collection and disposal business also fueled significant gains in EBITDA.\nDividend investors will also be happy to see that Waste Management's operating expenses dropped relative to revenue, now making up less than 60% of revenue as of last quarter, thanks to improvements in telematics. With winter approaching, the company made a small trim to revenue guidance, but with expected free cash flow approaching $3 billion for the year, it appears Waste Management's dividend payouts continue to be solid.\nEarnings Growth—Though Slow—and Rate Increase Boosts Eversource\nUtility firms like Eversource Energy NYSE: ES also draw the attention of dividend investors because of their defensive status. Eversource is a major utility provider in the northeast, offering electricity, gas, and water services.\nEversource Energy Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 4.66%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $3.01\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 2 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 129.18%\n- Recent Dividend Payment\n- Jun. 30\nES Dividend History\nWhile the company's 4.56% dividend yield will interest investors, it has a less stable dividend payout ratio of 129.2%—meaning that it has paid out more in dividends than it has generated in income—and only two years of recent dividend increases.\nGrowing earnings is essential to keeping the dividend payout ratio down, and Eversource managed to do so this last quarter, if only by a penny per share. Analysts had expected EPS to remain flat YOY at 95 cents, but the company beat predictions with 96 cents.\nThe growth from this quarter helped Eversource reaffirm its full-year EPS guidance as well as its long-term growth target of up to 7% through 2029.\nWhile revenue performance was not as strong—the company's 12% YOY improvement in this area fell slightly short of predictions—electric demand is growing steadily, and a $100-million permanent rate increase in New Hampshire should help provide stability going forward.\nAll-Around Strong Performance Buoys Johnson & Johnson\nJohnson & Johnson Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 2.95%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $5.20\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 64 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 55.61%\n- Next Dividend Payment\n- Sep. 9\nJNJ Dividend History\nHealthcare products giant Johnson & Johnson NYSE: JNJ is a standout dividend stock, with a whopping 64 years of steady payout increases, a compelling yield of 3.06%, and a sustainable payout ratio of 55.6%.\nThe company's mid-July earnings report shows that it can continue to impress—it beat EPS predictions by 9 cents and revenue estimates by nearly $900 million.\nJohnson's innovative medicine business, particularly its oncology line, is fueling this growth. The company's drug candidate TAR200 for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer could generate some $5 billion in peak sales.\nImmunology and the cardiovascular section of the company's MedTech business were also standouts.\nAll of these signals point to JNJ remaining an excellent dividend play going forward in the foreseeable future.\nBefore you consider Waste Management, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "3 Stocks With Monopoly Power—and Minimal Competition", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-stocks-with-monopoly-powerand-minimal-competition/", "text": "The word \"monopoly\" has a negative reputation in the investment and economic communities, as it is often linked to abusive pricing and unfair advantages that many other businesses and investors might not face. However, monopolies (or near-monopolies for that matter) can also mean outsized returns for investors who can spot them.\nAnd the truth is that these near-monopolies are everywhere in the market. However, they lie low enough to avoid the inevitably negative media coverage that could come if they were to be identified for what they are. With this in mind, today’s list of near-monopoly stocks can offer investors much-needed upside during an uncertain economic and financial cycle for the United States.\nFitting the description, names like Copart Inc. NASDAQ: CPRT, ASML Holding NASDAQ: ASML, and Fair Isaac Corporation NYSE: FICO are examples. These names hold enough market share in their respective spaces, such as the technology sector, and trade at enough of a discount that they just can’t be ignored today. This opportunity is likely a closing window, as big institutions are likely already circling around the buy button for these businesses.\nAn Inevitable Part of the Auto Market\nCopart Today\n$47.36 +0.28 (+0.59%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $45.05\n▼\n$64.38 - P/E Ratio\n- 31.16\n- Price Target\n- $53.33\nAccidents happen; every investor understands this. What they don’t realize is what happens to most vehicles after accidents. Usually, a company like Copart buys the damaged vehicles (considered a total loss) from insurance companies, repairs them at cost, and then sells them at a profit at auctions.\nThis is a quiet area of the economy. Still, it is a hot one, and Copart brings in $4.7 billion in net revenue from it through owning roughly 40% of the entire space. This market share moat, brand penetration, and logistics capability keep Copart as a name that could be considered a near monopoly in its own field.\nGiven that this powerful name now trades at 71% of its 52-week high, investors can assume that the downside risk is largely priced in for Copart, leaving it with little choice but to start heading higher and reflect its true fundamentals.\nThis setup might explain why Motley Fool Asset Management, a known stock picker in the financial community, decided to buy up to $2.4 million worth of Copart stock as of August 2025, providing a vote of confidence in the price recovery that’s pending for this company in the future.\nInstitutions Like ASML’s Market Positioning\nASML Today\n$747.55 +5.39 (+0.73%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $578.51\n▼\n$945.05 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.84%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 31.20\n- Price Target\n- $923.80\nThe same line of thought can spill over onto ASML stock, considering it is one of the leading lithography technology companies, providing the necessary equipment for the chipmaking and semiconductor stocks that have helped the S&P 500 index run as high as it has today.\nThere is very little competition in this space, since lithography is well-patented and kept as a hidden treasure to ensure ASML’s positioning in the industry is left unchecked, a true near monopoly if there ever was one. Given the industry's recent surge, ASML’s price of only 73% of its 52-week high may have triggered some systemic buying on Wall Street.\nAs of early August 2025, institutional allocators from Envestnet Asset Management decided to kick their quarterly activity up a notch, as they justified buying an additional 0.7% in ASML stock for their current holdings.

{"title": "Rocket Lab Reports Q2 Results: Is the Bull Thesis Still Intact?", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/rocket-lab-reports-q2-results-is-the-bull-thesis-still-intact/", "text": "Rocket Lab Today\n$44.97 +0.70 (+1.58%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $5.74\n▼\n$53.44 - Price Target\n- $42.27\nRocket Lab USA, Inc. NASDAQ: RKLB has been one of the standout names in the aerospace industry, riding a wave of strong performance and growing investor enthusiasm. The stock has surged in recent months, cementing its position as a leader in small satellite launches and advanced space systems.\nWith its Electron rocket now proven one of the market's most reliable vehicles and the Neutron program making steady progress, the company has built a compelling long-term growth story.\nThe release of its latest earnings was the next major catalyst, with investors watching closely to see if the momentum could continue or if cracks might start to appear.\nStrong Q2 Results and Operational Progress\nOn August 7, Rocket Lab reported Q2 2025 revenue of $144.5 million, up 36% year-over-year (YOY) and 17.9% from Q1. This figure exceeded its guidance range of $130–$140 million. Growth was fueled by increased launch activity, including five Electron missions in the quarter, and continued expansion in satellite manufacturing and components.\nThe company also achieved notable margin gains, with GAAP gross margin rising to 32.1% and non-GAAP gross margin climbing to 36.9%, both significantly improving from last year.\nNot everything was perfect, though. The company’s net losses widened 59.5% to $66.4 million, marking the fifth consecutive year in the red. For Q2, Rocket Lab reported earnings per share (EPS) of negative 13 cents, missing the consensus estimates of negative seven cents.\nHowever, management emphasized that these losses reflect ongoing investment in the Neutron rocket program and strategic expansions to position Rocket Lab for long-term growth. The backlog remains robust at $1 billion, evenly split between launch and space systems, and features a healthy mix of government and commercial contracts.\nStrategic Moves and Neutron Development\nA key highlight from the quarter was the pending acquisition of Geost, a $275 million cash-and-equity deal expected to close soon following antitrust clearance. Geost’s expertise in electro-optical and infrared sensors will bolster Rocket Lab’s capabilities in missile warning, tracking, and space domain awareness, opening new high-value opportunities in national security.\nOperationally, Rocket Lab reached a significant milestone by proving a rapid launch cadence, completing two missions just two days apart from its New Zealand site.\nWith 69 Electron launches completed to date, the company remains on track for more than 20 launches in 2025. Meanwhile, the Neutron program continues to advance, with Stage 2 successfully cryogenically proofed and en route to Launch Complex 3 in Virginia ahead of its debut launch, targeted before the end of the year.\nWhen asked what a successful launch of Neutron might be, during the earnings call, CEO Sir Peter Beck had to say: “You're not going to hear some rubbish about just clearing the pad as success. For us, a successful launch means getting to orbit and ensuring the vehicle is ready to scale.\" A response RKLB investors surely would have liked.\nLooking Ahead, Has the Bullish Thesis Changed?\nRocket Lab Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$42.27-6.00% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 13 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $44.97 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $55.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $42.27 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $18.00 |\n|---|\nRocket Lab Stock Forecast Details\nFor Q3 2025, Rocket Lab is guiding for revenue between $145 million and $155 million, with further margin expansion expected.\nBeyond the near term, management stressed that the Neutron program is shifting from R&D into production, with supply chains, manufacturing infrastructure, and launch facilities already in place to support scalable operations.\nThe long-term thesis for Rocket Lab appears firmly intact. While the company continues to post annual losses, it is steadily expanding its capabilities across launch, spacecraft, and payload integration.\nThis diversification, especially with national security and constellation deployment contracts, gives Rocket Lab a unique position as a one-stop provider. The road ahead will still have its challenges, but for bullish investors, the latest results reinforce the view that Rocket Lab is not just competing in the new space race; it’s helping lead it.\nBefore you consider Rocket Lab, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

Consider These 3 Dividend Stocks", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/worried-about-a-fading-rally-consider-these-3-dividend-stocks/", "text": "Investors have checked plenty of boxes off their 2021 market bingo cards lately: a V-shaped recovery in the S&P 500 after a quick bear market, a wild cryptocurrency rally, and beaten-down meme stocks generating short squeezes.\nInvestors also likely remember how quickly that market became overvalued at the end of 2021, and the succeeding 2022 bear market that lingered for nearly a year as the Federal Reserve committed to crushing inflation.\nThe current market environment echoes 2021’s excess, and volatility has returned in early August. Is it time to consider more defensive positioning? If risk is weighing on your mind, the Dividend Aristocrats are here to help, and we’ve identified three with sturdy payouts for income and growth.\nEarnings Remain Strong, But Warning Signs Beginning to Emerge\nMeme stocks and crypto aren’t the only things driving investors to question what inning this rally is in. Despite the president’s protestations, jobs data continues to point to a shaky labor market following massive downward revisions in May and June numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\nOnly 73,000 jobs were added in July, and unemployment ticked up to 4.2%. Adding to market worries, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index came in at 2.6% for June, its hottest reading since February.\nMarket indices have ridden strong earnings to new all-time highs this summer, especially AI hyperscalers that continue to surpass their lofty expectations.\nThe market is becoming increasingly concentrated, and companies that gave less-than-stellar Q2 reports were swiftly relieved of their gains. Can AI capital expenditure spending support the entire S&P 500?\nWe might find out since the Magnificent Seven can now swallow more than 400 of the other 493 companies in the index.\nS&P 500 valuations are getting stretched near the upper bound of historical levels, which helps explain why expectations are so high and companies that miss targets get crushed.\nWinners and losers are beginning to appear, and if you aren’t a stock picker or market timer, you might be looking for assets that can provide a moat from volatility. Dividend stocks are usually established companies with steady, predictable profits.\nYou might not get the outsized rewards of Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META or Microsoft Corp. NASDAQ: MSFT, but you likely won’t need to worry about 40% drawdowns either (something META and MSFT have each suffered twice in the last five years).\nBuffer Your Portfolio With These Dividend Aristocrats\nWhat’s a Dividend Aristocrat? A company in the S&P 500 with at least a 25-year history of raising dividend payouts. To qualify for this index, companies must increase their dividend payout at least once a year, and failure to do so results in ejection.\nMembership in the S&P 500 guarantees minimum size and liquidity requirements, so Dividend Aristocrats are often blue-chip stocks with long histories. The following three companies fit this definition and can boost your portfolio with income during turbulent times.\nJohnson & Johnson: 6 Decades of Dividend Growth\nJohnson & Johnson Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 2.95%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $5.20\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 64 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 55.61%\n- Next Dividend Payment\n- Sep. 9\nJNJ Dividend History\nJohnson & Johnson NYSE: JNJ has been a model of stability and growth for more than 60 years.\nThe company’s diverse pipeline of pharmaceuticals and medical devices gives it a variety of dependable revenue streams, and its TAR200 bladder cancer drug was granted Priority Review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July.\nDuring the company’s Q2 earnings report, the CEO Joaquin Duato projected TAR200 sales could hit a peak of $5 billion.\nJNJ beat analysts’ expectations on both revenue and EPS in Q2, with sales growing 5.8% year-over-year (YOY).\nJNJ is also a prestigious member of the Dividend Aristocrats with a 64-year history of payout raises. The dividend has yielded between 3.03% and 3.47% over the last two years, with a current yield of 3.05% and a dividend payout ratio (DPR) of 55.6%.\nA payout rate below 60% backed by JNJ's robust cash flow indicates a secure dividend with even more room to grow.\nCincinnati Financial: Lower Payout But Higher Security\nCincinnati Financial Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 2.32%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $3.48\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 65 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 30.18%\n- Recent Dividend Payment\n- Jul. 15\nCINF Dividend History\nCincinnati Financial Corp. NASDAQ: CINF might not have the dividend yield of some of its peers (2.3% compared to an average of 5.6% in the finance sector).\nBut it has a 65-year track record of raising dividend payouts, and its 30% DPR indicates little strain on payout sustainability.\nYou won’t exactly need a Brinks truck, but you’ll sleep easy knowing a predictable payout is coming each quarter. CINF handily beat its Q2 EPS estimates by nearly 30%, and revenue still grew 15% YOY despite a slight projection miss.\nAfter the Q2 earnings report, two of the five analysts covering the stock boosted their price targets.\nRoth Capital increased its target to $175, while Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods boosted it to $168. These two figures average $171.50, which indicates upside of more than 10% from the stock’s current level.\nT. Rowe Price: High-Yield Backed Up by Cash Flow\nT. Rowe Price Group Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 4.76%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $5.08\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 39 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 56.76%\n- Next Dividend Payment\n- Sep. 29\nTROW Dividend History\nT. Rowe Price Group Inc. NASDAQ: TROW is one of the world's largest asset managers and pays the highest dividends in the healthiest industry.\nThe dividend yield is currently 4.8%, the sector average for asset managers.\nHowever, despite the high payout, the DPR is a manageable 56.8%, well above the, and the company has been raising its payout for 39 years.\nHow does TROW support such a healthy dividend? A strong brand reputation helps, as does an impenetrable cash position on its balance sheet.\nThe company boosted its cash position by more than 25% between Q1 2023 and Q1 2025, and operating cash flow in Q1 2025 was a record $611 million.\nThe yield is high, but TROW has the financial bandwidth to maintain it.\nBefore you consider Johnson & Johnson, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "3 Dividend Stocks Raising Payouts—and Backing It Up With Results", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-dividend-stocks-raising-payoutsand-backing-it-up-with-results/", "text": "Not all dividends are paid out equally; some companies try to create a “trap” by overpaying on a quarter’s dividend, attracting buyers through a short-term high dividend yield that seems too good to pass up. The realization comes much later, though, that these companies can’t afford these payouts, straining the financial profile altogether and having to decrease or cancel these dividends later.\nToday’s list of dividend increases focuses on the exact opposite of this situation. These companies and their solid fundamentals demonstrate that they can not only afford today’s increases but also continue to reward shareholders with rising income potential in the coming quarters and years.\nThis should also generate demand and upside for the stock itself during a market filled with macroeconomic uncertainty.\nThis is why considering names like Clorox Co. NYSE: CLX, Wells Fargo & Co. NYSE: WFC, and Sunoco LP NYSE: SUN can be an excellent combination for investors to keep in their dividend income watchlists. This group, which includes financial sector, consumer staples, and energy stocks, provides enough diversification and financial strength to carry portfolios forward.\nClorox Stock’s Discount Makes a Great Yield\nClorox Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 4.15%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $4.96\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 47 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 76.07%\n- Next Dividend Payment\n- Aug. 29\nCLX Dividend History\nNow that shares of Clorox have fallen to 72% of their 52-week high, their attractive dividend payout has only become more of a target after a recent increase. As stocks in other (hotter) market areas take the bulk of the bullish price action and attention, it makes sense to see a more stable company like Clorox fall behind.\nHowever, this is precisely when a competent management team typically lays out further shareholder benefits, rewarding those willing to stick around for the “bad” times in the price performance. Now paying $4.88 per dividend share, Clorox investors can enjoy a 3.94% dividend yield today.\nAlthough not the highest and still below the benchmark 10-year treasury bond yields of 4.2%, this dividend provides an added benefit to the upside that can be achieved by buying Clorox stock today. Even though Wall Street analysts rate the stock as a Reduce, recent data may soon change that.\nThe company’s latest quarterly earnings show a net earnings per share (EPS) figure of $2.87, representing a significant beat over the expected $2.24 number from Wall Street, showing analysts that their current valuations and assumptions may have been on the more conservative side, and calling for a revision (likely higher).\nStrong Outlooks Boost Wells Fargo’s Payout\nWells Fargo & Company Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 2.32%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $1.80\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 4 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 30.82%\n- Next Dividend Payment\n- Sep. 1\nWFC Dividend History\nNow that the market expects the Federal Reserve (the Fed) to lower interest rates in late 2025, sharp investors can directly spot the benefits of investing in a commercial bank like Wells Fargo, since lower rates typically translate to more demand for credit products like mortgages and credit cards.\nOf course, it should raise the bank’s expected EPS figures, which it has. Wall Street analysts now expect to see a report $1.73 in EPS for the second quarter of 2026, an increase of 12% above today’s $1.54 in reported EPS, which was also a beat over the expected $1.41.\nChances are, these forecasts for next year are also conservative, setting Wells Fargo up for another beat. With this confidence in mind, and the right macro backdrop, the bank’s management boosted its dividend payout to $1.8 per share, or an annualized yield of 2.3%.\nWhile not the most exciting yield, investors should take this as a sign of stable and strong financials, with some upside added. With a current forward price-to-earnings (P/E) valuation of 12.6x, Wells Fargo stock is well below its longer-term average of 18.0x, giving investors a decent gap to be closed on the upside.\nThe Best of Both Worlds: Sunoco Stock\nSunoco Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 6.84%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $3.64\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 3 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 179.31%\n- Recent Dividend Payment\n- Aug. 19\nSUN Dividend History\nAs oil prices remain low for an extended period, more investors will likely overlook energy stocks like Sunoco. However, management is aware of the cyclical nature of oil and is already preparing its shareholders for a reality check.\nAfter boosting its dividend payout to $3.63 per share, investors can now beat the benchmark and any inflation fears through an annualized yield of 6.68% today. The stock's ability to afford this much of an increase and also trade at 90% of its 52-week high may have given Wall Street analysts something to think about.\nThat thought led to a consensus rating making Sunoco stock a Buy, with Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Chase & Co. giving a new valuation target slightly above consensus for $67 per share, which also implies an additional 25% upside potential from where the stock trades today, giving investors the best of both income and upside potential benefits.\nBefore you consider Clorox, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

The Q2 results and outlook affirmed the bullish forecasts that have been driving the price action all year. The estimates are based on rising LNG demand supported by new infrastructure, compounded by the need for affordable, efficient, greener energy supplies.\nThe critical takeaway from the release is that business is stronger than expected, profitability is robust, and the guidance improved, news that will likely extend the stock price uptrend to new highs.\nThe new high is a significant factor for investors and traders. LNG stock has been in a strong uptrend, recently formed a triangle consolidation pattern, and looks set to extend its rally. A break to new highs would confirm the triangle as a continuation signal, potentially the halfway point in a larger rally, and lead this market into another substantial rally.\nBased on the technical setup ahead of the report, the market for LNG stock could rise by $70 to $80 in that scenario within a few quarters and up to another $60 over the long term.\nThe analysts’ sentiment, a gauge of broader market sentiment, was bullish ahead of the release and will likely strengthen in its wake. The data tracked by MarketBeat reveals coverage increasing, sentiment firming to a Buy, and the consensus price target rising compared to July, the prior quarter, and the preceding year.\nAt $260, the consensus is sufficient to put this market at a new high, break it out of the trading range, and set it up for a run toward the high-end range. That puts this market near $288, but higher targets are expected to follow.\nCheniere Blows Past Estimates: Improves Guidance for F2025\nCheniere had a solid quarter in Q2, supported by demand, volume, pricing, and the favorable impact of derivative hedging instruments. The net result is a 42.8% increase in net revenue and a significantly wider margin.\nRevenue outpaced the consensus by more than 800 basis points, while GAAP EPS more than doubled. The critical details are that demand, execution, and margin are expected to remain strong through the year’s end, allowing the company to improve its guidance.\nCheniere Energy Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$261.9313.73% UpsideBuyBased on 17 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $230.30 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $288.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $261.93 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $217.00 |\n|---|\nCheniere Energy Stock Forecast Details\nThe note details include the adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow targets, which were lifted at the low end, tightened in the first case, and lifted and tightened in the second.\nDistributable cash flow is among the reasons why analysts like this stock and will likely improve their price target forecasts in Q3.\nThe company returns ample capital to its investors, including dividends and share repurchases, and is running with a sub-50% distributable cash flow payout ratio.\nThis allows the company to reinvest in its growth while paying down debt and improving its balance sheet health. The balance sheet highlights at the end of Q2 include reduced cash, but it is offset by increased assets, reduced debt and total liability, low leverage, and increased equity.\nEquity increased by 11%, the share count fell by nearly 3%, and the dividend annualized to 0.85% as of the end of the reporting period.\nInstitutional Trends Point to Rising Prices for LNG Stock\nThe Institutional trends also align with LNG’s stock price outlook. They own more than 87% of the stock and have been buying on balance all year. The volume of activity has declined since Q1, but the balance improved sequentially, rising to a ratio of 4:1 regarding dollar buying and selling volume.\nThis trend is not expected to end in Q3 but may strengthen due to the profit outlook and capital return.\nBefore you consider Cheniere Energy, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "IPO Market Stays Hot With These 2 Debuting Stocks", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/ipo-market-stays-hot-with-these-2-debuting-stocks/", "text": "It’s a hot IPO summer as new listings make their long-awaited return to public markets. After a cool first half of 2025, the demand for Initial Public Offerings has exploded in Q3, with anticipated companies like Circle Internet Group Inc. NYSE: CRCL and CoreWeave Inc. NASDAQ: CRWV surpassing even the rosiest expectations upon their debut.\nAnd it doesn’t appear that momentum is slowing as several more promising companies are unveiling their listings.\nFactors Contributing to the IPO Rebound in Q2 2025\nA range of factors has kept the IPO market subdued recently. Not only was the macro-environment poor in the first half of 2025 due to erratic trade policies, but private companies have been staying private longer than historical norms.\nAccording to research from Morgan Stanley, companies are now staying private for nearly 11 years on average before going public, a significant increase over the seven-year average from 2014. Private companies aren’t scrutinized as closely as their publicly traded counterparts, and high rates have clogged the capital spigot over the last few years.\nCouple these factors with the rise of private markets, and there simply isn’t the enthusiasm for ‘going public’ as there was in the past. Only 84 IPOs were issued in the first half of 2025, down from over 100 in the same period last year.\nIf there’s light at the end of the tunnel, it began shining earlier this summer. We’ve seen several new listings hit the market, and many have grown exponentially in the first day or week of trading. Three reasons for the turnaround include:\n- Investors' Appetite for New Issues: Of the 16 IPOs that have raised more than $50 million so far in 2025, nine of them occurred in June. Demand for IPOs has returned in a big way, and previously private companies are striking while the investment iron is hot.\n- Momentum from Specific Sectors and Industries: You can probably guess which sectors we mean here. Artificial intelligence and its adjacent businesses continue to dominate the stock market, with some speculation in crypto and its adjacent businesses. CoreWeave and Circle soared during their first week of trading, showing investors are eager to throw money at anything AI and crypto-related right now.\n- Anticipation of Accommodative Monetary Policy: A slowing job market is bad news for the economy, but if the Federal Reserve resumes its rate-cutting cycle in September, it could create cheaper capital for IPOs. High rates have limited the demand for new issues, and a reduction before the end of the year could further juice this hot market.\n2 New Issues Garnering Investor Attention This Month\nThe first wave of big IPOs this year saw companies like CoreWeave and Circle achieve impressive gains before volatility muted the fun.

After initially looking at an opening price between $25 - $28, the stock debuted at $33 and quickly rose toward $100 before hitting the exchanges. By the end of the first day, FIG shares were trading at $115, a shocking gain of more than 200% from the opening price.\nFigma has the financial data to back up its exciting first-week performance. The company has more than 13 million active users and earned more than $228 million in revenue in Q1 2025 (a 46% year-over-year (YOY) increase), with a net income of $44.9 million.\nFIG’s market cap surged over $67 billion after the first day of trading, although a 35% pullback sent shares back under $80 in the subsequent five sessions.\nFigma’s unique platform allows designers and professionals to collaborate on different interfaces in real-time, and with 85% of current customers outside the United States, the growth prospects remain strong despite the hefty valuation at about 40x sales.\nFigma’s impressive list of corporate clients includes Stripe, Duolingo, and Netflix Inc.

{"title": "Trump GLP-1 Pilot Program Could Boost Novo Nordisk & Eli Lilly", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/trump-glp-1-pilot-program-could-boost-novo-nordisk-and-eli-lilly/", "text": "This week, drugmakers had a scare when President Trump threatened to levy tariffs of up to 250% on imported pharmaceuticals. The news jolted the health care sector, which fell by 2.74% over the past five days, compounding its struggles this year, which have resulted in its 5.13% loss—the worst among all 11 sectors in the S&P 500.\nNovo Nordisk A/S Today\nNVONovo Nordisk A/S\n$53.81 +1.40 (+2.67%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $45.05\n▼\n$139.74 - Dividend Yield\n- 3.05%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 14.78\n- Price Target\n- $83.75\nOn an individual level, some Big Pharma companies experienced more pain than others. Novo Nordisk NYSE: NVO, which reported disappointing earnings on Aug. 6, fell 5.79% over the past five days before rebounding on weak trial data from Eli Lilly NYSE: LLY. The latter company’s experimental weight-loss pill fell short of expectations, sending shares down by nearly 11% over the same period while helping Novo Nordisk rebound from subpar earnings and the Trump tariff announcement.\nBut for buy-and-hold investors looking for health care sector exposure, those two stocks—NVO and LLY—are still poised to profit from a long-term tailwind recently introduced by the Trump administration.\nTrump’s Medicare and Medicaid Plan\nWhile the tariff threat is real, long-term investors may want to look past the short-term volatility. A recently announced Trump administration initiative could be a game-changer for both companies.\nOn Aug. 1, reports surfaced that the Trump administration is testing a plan to cover costly weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Ozempic under Medicare and Medicaid. The program, led by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI)—a branch of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)—is scheduled to launch in April 2026 for Medicaid and January 2027 for Medicare.\nThat plan would vastly expand Americans’ access to anti-obesity drugs, including those who currently cannot afford their price tags. Wegovy and Zepbound, for example, cost roughly $1,000 per month before insurance, which carries strict eligibility criteria.\nIf the plan pans out, it would be an enormous boon to Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Currently, many health insurance plans, as well Medicare, only cover GLP-1 treatment for diabetes. The use of those drugs for obesity treatment is excluded. Additionally, Medicaid coverage of obesity drugs and treatments varies on a state-by-state basis.\nBut according to the CMS, if the Trump administration’s plan comes to fruition, it would allow Medicare Part D and state Medicaid programs to voluntarily cover Mounjaro, Zepbound, Ozempic, and Wegovy not just for diabetes treatments, but for weight loss management as well.\nNVO and LLY: The Pillars of Anti-Obesity Medications\nEli Lilly and Company Today\nLLYEli Lilly and Company\n$698.89 -2.34 (-0.33%) As of 08/18/2025 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $623.78\n▼\n$972.53 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.86%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 45.68\n- Price Target\n- $950.17\nDespite Eli Lilly’s recent woes, when the company reported Q2 earnings on Aug. 7, it was abundantly clear to investors that it has positioned itself alongside Novo Nordisk as the world’s two premier drugmakers for Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) weight loss treatments. The company beat on earnings while also hiking its 2025 guidance and announcing ongoing strong demand for its anti-obesity drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound.\nMeanwhile, Novo Nordisk just barely missed on revenue, reporting $11.95 billion versus analysts’ expectations of $11.97 billion, while reporting earnings per share of 93 cents versus analysts’ expectations of 95 cents. But lost in those misses was the fact that sales of its diabetes drug Ozempic and its weight loss drug Wegovy saw second-quarter sales increase by 16% from the year-prior period.\nTogether, these companies have formed a duopoly in the GLP-1 space, similar to Coca-Cola NYSE: KO and PepsiCo NASDAQ: PEP in beverages or Home Depot NYSE: HD and Lowe’s NYSE: LOW in home improvement.\nIt is increasingly evident that, despite their recent issues, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have established themselves as the two principal pillars of the anti-obesity and diabetes drug industry. And thanks to the current administration's proposal to inject GLP-1 into Medicare and Medicaid plans, the two companies are positioned to see more sales gains from their flagship drugs.\nThe Weight Loss Drug Market’s Future Is Bright\nZooming out, the anti-obesity industry is already undergoing explosive growth. According to market research and consultancy firm Grand View Research, the global weight loss drug market is forecast to undergo a noteworthy compound annual growth rate of 31.66% from 2024 to 2030.\nHowever, that market is dominated by North America, which presently accounts for 37.67% of revenue share. In the United States, the anti-obesity drug market size already stands at $6.62 billion, and it is projected to reach $7.13 billion by 2030.\nEli Lilly and Novo Nordisk may be down 14.49% and 44.22%, respectively, this year, but if Trump’s Medicare and Medicaid pilot program takes root, it could serve as the impetus to reverse the two Big Pharma drugmakers’ fortunes this year. Value investors looking for a buy-low opportunity in the health care sector would be wise to keep both stocks on their watchlists.\nBefore you consider Eli Lilly and Company, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Eli Lilly and Company wasn't on the list.\nWhile Eli Lilly and Company currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nDiscover the next wave of investment opportunities with our report, 7 Stocks That Will Be Magnificent in 2025.

{"title": "MarketBeat Week in Review – 08/04 - 08/08", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/marketbeat-week-in-review-08-04-08-08/", "text": "Stocks shook off last Friday’s sell-off with a positive week, but it wasn’t all smooth sailing. Tariff concerns weighed on stocks on Thursday and will continue to be a source of long-term uncertainty. However, for now, the trend is your friend, and that trend is higher.\nSome of that optimism is based on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates twice in the back half of 2025. However, those expectations may change next week when investors get the latest reading on inflation, the July Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), released Tuesday and Thursday. Investors will also get the latest data on retail sales.\nAll of this means that August may not be the quiet month that investors have come to expect. But the MarketBeat analysts will keep you on top of the stocks and the stories that are moving the markets. Here are some of our most popular stories from this week.\nArticles by Thomas Hughes\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. NASDAQ: AMD delivered one of the most anticipated earnings reports this week. Thomas Hughes explained why the sell-off after weak guidance is likely due to profit taking, leaving savvy investors with an opportunity to buy the dip in AMD stock.\nSticking in the chip sector, Hughes saw a similar pattern in the price action in Onsemi NASDAQ: ON stock as investors initially sold a solid, but not spectacular report. However, Hughes wrote that Onsemi’s bullish guidance will allow its summer rebound to continue.\nInvestors also eagerly awaited the earnings report from Hims & Hers Health Inc. NYSE: HIMS. Hughes explained why weak results temporarily gave short sellers an advantage. However, the long-term outlook for HIMS is favorable, but investors will want to make sure the stock has hit a bottom before buying the dip.\nArticles by Sam Quirke\nThe performance of Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN stock after its earnings report seems overdone. Sam Quirke explained this week why bearish momentum may be difficult to break after Amazon was such a strong performer heading into earnings. Nevertheless, investors who believe in the company’s long-term growth will likely be rewarded.\nDespite the company's strong earnings report, Qualcomm Inc. NASDAQ: QCOM stock is down more than 10%. Quirke pointed out old but persistent concerns that could keep pressure on QCOM stock. However, bullish analyst sentiment may reward patient investors.\nArticles by Chris Markoch\nMeeting AI's demands will require data centers, and lots of them. This week, Chris Markoch offered investors three companies that will play a key role in the data center buildout wave. These companies help provide the cooling, connectivity, and power that data centers need.\nIt's been a bad month for CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: CRWD. Markoch pointed out that the company may need a blowout earnings report to reverse the bearish trend. Investors may want to wait for the report before taking a position.\nNovo Nordisk A/V NYSE: NVO is another stock looking for a bottom. In this case, Markoch pointed investors to the company’s Aug. 6 earnings report as a potential opportunity for NVO to reverse its slide. But even if the company reports solid results, the incoming CEO faces familiar challenges.\nArticles by Ryan Hasson\nGrowth investors consistently look to the sectors that will drive the market higher in the future, and the companies in a position to capitalize on that growth. This week, Ryan Hasson highlighted five stocks leading the way in sectors like AI, clean energy, and space. Although some of these are household names, Hasson explained why there’s still a long runway for growth-oriented investors.\nHasson also looked at three technology stocks that are becoming essential in the buildout of a global AI infrastructure. This sector will play out over the years, giving each of these stocks a long runway for growth.\nArticles by Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli\nHope for the best and plan for the worst is generally good advice. This week, Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli applied that advice to investors in his article on how to invest in this market for the rest of the year. Osorio-Mazilli explained why the trend is for more upside, but there are steps investors can take to hedge against downside risk.\nAnother strategy for investing in volatile markets is to go value hunting. Osorio-Mazilli highlighted three beaten-down stocks that now offer asymmetrical upside potential.\nOne risk of chasing stocks higher was evident in the earnings report from Super Micro Computer Inc. NASDAQ: SMCI. The stock plummeted 17% after a good report that wasn’t good enough for expectations.\nOsorio-Mazilli broke down the report's elements that should matter to investors and explained why they make this selloff a buyable dip.\nArticles by Leo Miller\nTechnological shifts create their own language. This week, Leo Miller examined the quiet rivalry between two “hypervisors,” Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ: AVGO and Nutanix Inc. NASDAQ: NTNX. Miller pointed out the key role that VMWare plays in Broadcom’s dominant position and how Nutanix is making inroads that could make NTNX the better long-term play.\nMeta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META continued to push higher a week after its earnings report. Miller highlighted the role of analysts in that move. Multiple upgrades and price target increases signal another 10% upside for META stock.\nRobinhood Markets Inc. NASDAQ: HOOD has had a rough month. First, the stock was slighted by the S&P 500, and then HOOD stock dipped despite a solid earnings report. Miller explained why investors should be more interested in the recent string of analysts’ upgrades that suggest the dip creates a more attractive upside for the stock.\nArticles by Nathan Reiff\nQuantum computing investors know that D-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS is a leader in the annealing technology approach. This week, Nathan Reiff explained D-Wave's push into cryogenic packaging and how it could allow the company to compete with gate-model quantum computing technology, which many tech companies prefer.\nTiming the market is always tricky. However, there are times when opportunities may be too good to pass up. Reiff explained why that may be the case for three overlooked stocks that are underperforming the S&P 500 but give investors reason to believe in more upside ahead.\nWith so many high-tech themes for investors to track, fund investing makes a lot of sense. This week, Reiff analyzed three exchange-traded funds (ETFs) beating the S&P 500 and giving investors exposure to some of the hottest names in technology, finance, aerospace and defense.\nArticles by Dan Schmidt\nEarnings season gives many companies an opportunity to deliver a progress report to investors. Dan Schmidt spotlighted three companies that put up strong numbers this earnings season, which may have investors reconsidering the grade they’ve assigned to the stock.\nSchmidt also wrote about the ongoing battle between NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices. As Schmidt explained, NVIDIA is the clear leader in the GPU market, but the stock looks overvalued. That’s one reason investors are buying AMD stock, which was outperforming NVDA before AMD’s earnings report.\nArticles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson\nThe emerging electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) sector continues to draw in investors. This week, Jeffrey Neal Johnson wrote about two companies whose stocks were moving higher on bullish news. Industry leader, Joby Aviation Inc. NYSE: JOBY stock soared to an all-time high after the company announced two deals, including its agreement to buy the passenger business of Blade Air Mobility Inc. NASDAQ: BLDE.\nJohnson also wrote about the new long-term partnership that is taking away a key risk for investors in Vertical Aerospace Ltd. NYSE: EVTL. Specifically, the deal will ensure the company can produce the airframes for its VX4 aircraft at scale.\nJohnson also explained why, even if you’re not an active trader, you can look at a stock's options activity to find opportunities. That was the case with Applied Digital Corp. NASDAQ: APLD, which had a spike in call options that would have pointed investors to bullish sentiment about the company’s AI pivot.\nArticles by Jordan Chussler\nFinance stocks have been strong performers this year. Jordan Chussler pointed out that the sector outperformed the S&P 500 in 2025. That strong performance will continue if and when the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. Chussler highlighted the Invesco KBW Bank ETF NASDAQ: KBWB. The fund is outperforming the broader sector, making it a strong choice for investors looking for exposure ahead of rate cuts.\nBefore you consider Invesco KBW Bank ETF, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Invesco KBW Bank ETF wasn't on the list.\nWhile Invesco KBW Bank ETF currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nLearn the basics of options trading and how to use them to boost returns and manage risk with this free report from MarketBeat.

{"title": "Airbnb Beats Earnings, But the Growth Story Is Losing Altitude", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/airbnb-beats-earnings-but-the-growth-story-is-losing-altitude/", "text": "Airbnb Today\n$125.49 +0.39 (+0.31%) As of 08/18/2025 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $99.88\n▼\n$163.93 - P/E Ratio\n- 30.38\n- Price Target\n- $142.72\nAirbnb Inc. NASDAQ: ABNB stock is down 9.1% the day after the company’s second-quarter earnings report. The company beat on the top and bottom lines with earnings per share (EPS) of $1.03 and revenue of $3.10 billion. Those numbers were year-over-year (YOY) gains of 19% and 12% respectively.\nBut headline numbers show where a company has been, not where it’s going. In the case of Airbnb, the company delivered tepid guidance for the coming quarter.\nManagement’s Q3 revenue guidance of $4.02 to $4.1 billion represents about 8% year-over-year growth, a deceleration from the 12% the company just reported in Q2. It also seems to confirm that the economy may not be as strong as expected and suggests that investors may not want to buy this dip.\nA Canary in a Coal Mine\nThe July Jobs report released on Aug. 1 challenged the assumption that the U.S. consumer was holding up well. But the performance of consumer discretionary stocks in 2025 has made some investors skeptical of that outlook. A research report from Bank of America (BofA) hints that this may be a time for investors to trust their intuition.\nIn its July Consumer Checkpoint, BofA presented data showing consumer spending on services (including hotels, airfares, and dining) has declined for three straight months. One part of the report noted, “Discretionary services spending, particularly in travel, appears to be contributing negatively to services growth.”\nIt’s Getting Hard to Buy Airbnb’s Growth Story\nAirbnb's chief executive officer (CEO), Brian Chesky, was quick to tell analysts that the company was not satisfied with slow growth, saying, “We want the company to accelerate.” However, it’s fair to say that the call didn’t point to specific initiatives that would make this happen.\nFor example, in discussing the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) investments, Chesky remarked that Airbnb continues “to explore how we can use AI to improve the guest and host experience, but we’re still early in identifying the most impactful use cases.” In discussing the potential opportunity in business travel, the CEO told analysts the company was “looking at ways to make Airbnb more compelling.”\nThere were other examples, but a common theme on the earnings call was one that was non-committal without a product roadmap or a specific strategy outlined. It’s also a reminder that the reason to stay at an Airbnb property is not the same as the decision to buy ABNB stock.\nPopular Brand, Weak Momentum\nAirbnb Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$142.7213.73% UpsideHoldBased on 39 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $125.49 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $200.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $142.72 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $100.00 |\n|---|\nAirbnb Stock Forecast Details\nMany consumers swear by the home rental model and will never return to a hotel. The model works for many individuals, groups, and families, particularly those for whom the “where” is a key part of their vacation plans.\nBut does that mean ABNB stock is a good investment? Right now, slowing growth shows a mature company finding it tough to innovate.\nFor example, the company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $6 billion, which is generally positive for shareholders.\nHowever, at 30x forward earnings, ABNB is valued as a growth stock forecasting high single-digit growth, which makes it appear the company’s best days are behind it.\nThe Bears Are in Control; Bulls Will Need Patience\nThe post-earnings sell-off has given investors the potential for more upside in ABNB stock. The consensus price target of $143.07 provides about 20% upside. However, several analysts have lowered their price targets since earnings. Investors looking to buy the dip may look at a $115 price target, but stronger support is more likely to be around $110 or even $100.\nBut before taking action, investors will want to wait for other signals to confirm. For example, the sharp drop in the stock price pushed the MACD line below the signal line, and the chart shows that momentum is becoming increasingly bearish.\nThe daily volume is more than double the average daily volume, showing that investors are selling first and asking questions later.\nThis means that patience will be required before timing an entry. The 50-day SMA is flattening and starting to curl lower, putting the stock close to a bearish death cross formation that occurs when the 50-day SMA crosses below its 200-day SMA.\nBefore you consider Airbnb, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Medical Debt from Accidents: Strategies Beyond Personal Injury Claims", "url": "https://www.finance-monthly.com/medical-debt-from-accidents-strategies-beyond-personal-injury-claims/", "text": "If you are involved in a motor vehicle accident, there is a good chance that you'll incur some sort of injury. For instance, you might experience mild headaches, backaches or other pain that takes days or weeks to heal. Regardless of how severe your injuries are, you may rack up significant medical debt to treat them, and there are many ways to help manage that debt.\nWork With Your Medical Provider\nMost hospitals have programs that provide charity assistance to those who can't afford their bills. This means that your debt might be forgiven even if it isn't paid as part of a settlement or judgment against the party that caused your injuries. Even if your debts aren't forgiven, your medical provider might be willing to provide a discount or otherwise work with you to ensure that you can pay your bills in a timely manner.\nDo You Have Insurance?\nIf you have medical insurance, your coverage provider may pay for most or all of the bills related to your accident. Most policies have out-of-pocket limits that cap how much you owe in a given year. For instance, if your maximum out-of-pocket is $5,000, you would only have to pay $5,000 even if your overall bills came to $100,000 or $1 million.\nBankruptcy May Help\nMedical debts can often be included as part of a bankruptcy proceeding. This means that they can be wiped out in the event that you can't afford what you owe because you can't work or because you take a pay cut after the wreck. Depending on your income and the type of assets that you own at the time of filing, it may be possible to have eligible debts discharged without losing property or making payments to creditors.\nBorrow Money from Friends or Family\nFriends, family members or colleagues may be willing to gift or lend funds to help you cover costs related to an accident. Any funds raised may be used to cover direct expenses such as medical bills or indirect costs such as the need to hire people to drive you to work or buy your groceries.\nPersonal Injury Claims Can Take Time\nIt's important to note that these strategies can be effective even if you do plan to pursue a personal injury claim at some point. This is because it can take months or even years to settle a case. Factors such as the severity of injuries, complicated liability and the complexity of the accident can impact the amount of time it takes to process your claim. Therefore, it's critical that you know and understand your options for staying financially afloat in the interim.\nIf you have been hurt in an accident, you may be entitled to compensation from one or more parties. However, there is no guarantee that you'll receive anything or that you'll receive it anytime soon. An attorney may be able to help you understand your rights or help create a strategy for paying medical bills without the benefit of a personal injury award.", "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:54:57 +0000", "author": "Jacob Mallinder", "source": "https://www.finance-monthly.com/feed/"}
{"title": "Fred Astaire Net Worth 2025: How the Dancing Legend Built a $10M Empire", "url": "https://www.finance-monthly.com/fred-astaire-net-worth/", "text": "Fred Astaire, the icon who made the world sway to his rhythm, left behind more than a legacy of cinematic magic—he passed away in August 2025 with an estimated $10 million net worth, let's find out what happened to it.\nFrom dazzling duets with Ginger Rogers to sharing the screen with Audrey Hepburn, Astaire’s career spanned decades of unforgettable film, stage, and television performances, blending elegance, innovation, and financial savvy. In this article, we explore how the legendary performer built his fortune, his prized assets, and the lasting impact of a life spent in motion.\nFred Astaire’s Net Worth Breakdown: How the Dancing Legend Built and Preserved His Fortune\nFred Astaire’s estimated net worth at the time of his death in 1987 was $10 million, equivalent to approximately $30 million in 2025 dollars . This fortune was the culmination of a multifaceted career spanning over seven decades, encompassing film, television, music, and savvy investments according to LoveMoney.\nFilm Earnings and Box Office Success\nAstaire's film career was marked by groundbreaking work in musical comedies. He appeared in over 40 films from 1933 to 1977, many of which were highly successful at the box office. For instance, \"Top Hat\" (1935) grossed approximately $128 million adjusted for inflation, while \"Swing Time\" (1936) earned about $112 million according to Box Office Mojo. These films contributed significantly to his wealth.\nReal Estate Holdings\nAstaire owned several properties, including a residence in Coldwater Canyon, Los Angeles, which he built in 1960. This home was described as \"tastefully done but not what you might expect—classy but in a slightly bloodless way,\" featuring a library with his Oscar and Emmys, a pool table, and artwork by friends and family. The exact value of this property at the time of his death is not publicly available according to Vanity Fair.\nInvestments and Business Ventures\nAstaire's financial acumen extended beyond his earnings from entertainment. He made strategic investments that contributed to his wealth, including ventures in the dance industry. The Fred Astaire Dance Studios franchise, established in 1947, continues to operate as a testament to his lasting influence. While specific financial details of his involvement are not publicly disclosed, the franchise's success indicates a profitable venture.\nEstate Management and Legacy\nUpon Fred Astaire's death in 1987, his estate, valued at approximately $10 million at the time (equivalent to around $30 million in 2025 dollars), was distributed among his surviving family members. His second wife, Robyn Smith, a former jockey 45 years his junior, inherited the majority of his estate. Smith was instrumental in managing and protecting Astaire's legacy, particularly concerning his intellectual property rights. She took legal action to prevent unauthorized use of his image, ensuring that his legacy remained intact according to Grunge.\nAstaire's children from his first marriage, Fred Astaire Jr. and Ava Astaire McKenzie, were also beneficiaries of the estate. Fred Astaire Jr. was involved in the entertainment industry, though specific details about his inheritance and its current value are not publicly disclosed. Ava Astaire McKenzie has maintained a relatively low public profile.\nIn terms of real estate, Astaire's former London residence in Mayfair was listed for £9.5 million (approximately $12.37 million) in 2020 as per reporting from Mansion Global.

His father, Friedrich “Fritz” Austerlitz, was a tailor of Austrian descent, and his mother, Johanna “Johanna” Geilus, was German-born. Growing up in a home that valued music and performance, Fred and his older sister, Adele, were exposed to singing, piano, and dance from an early age.\nAstaire’s education was typical for the era, attending public schools in Omaha. However, it was clear early on that Fred and Adele had extraordinary talent. By the age of six, the siblings were performing in local recitals, and their parents encouraged this early engagement with the performing arts. They often practiced tap routines at home and studied the rhythms of vaudeville and Broadway, absorbing styles that would later define Fred’s signature dance moves.\nFred’s passion for dance truly ignited while observing vaudeville performances in Omaha and later during family trips to New York City. The exposure to professional performers gave him insight into timing, elegance, and showmanship—skills he and Adele honed meticulously. The duo trained rigorously under local dance instructors, focusing on tap, ballroom, and theatrical movements. Their dedication paid off, with early bookings in regional vaudeville shows, setting the stage for a lifelong career in entertainment.\nIt was in these formative years that Astaire cultivated the combination of technical skill and effortless style that would distinguish him from other dancers. According to dance historians, his meticulous rehearsal habits and deep love for music were instilled in childhood, forming the foundation for his groundbreaking contributions to film and stage musicals.\nFred’s early life demonstrates how a nurturing family, formal training, and exposure to professional performance all combined to ignite a passion that would eventually make him a household name, performing alongside legends such as Ginger Rogers and Judy Garland.\nThe Mesmerizing Career: Vaudeville Schoolboy to Hollywood Icon\nFred Astaire’s career spanned over seven decades, transforming him into one of the most celebrated dancers, actors, and choreographers in entertainment history. Alongside his sister Adele, he made his professional debut in vaudeville, performing a series of tours that showcased their impeccable timing and precision. Their Broadway debut came in 1917 with Over the Top, earning Astaire early recognition for his refined style and musicality.\nBreakthrough in Hollywood\nAstaire’s transition to Hollywood began in the 1930s, and it was in 1933 that he made a lasting impact in film with Dancing Lady, starring alongside Joan Crawford and Clark Gable. However, it was his pairing with Ginger Rogers in Flying Down to Rio (1933) that cemented his place as a dance legend. The Astaire-Rogers partnership produced ten iconic musicals, including Top Hat (1935), Swing Time (1936), and Shall We Dance (1937), earning Astaire widespread acclaim for his smooth, elegant, and seemingly effortless choreography.\nAstaire’s on-screen innovation wasn’t limited to dance; he also incorporated singing, acting, and comedic timing, creating a template for the modern musical film. His collaboration with choreographers like Hermes Pan helped redefine the genre, integrating dance into narrative storytelling in a way that had rarely been seen before.\nLater Career and Collaborations\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Astaire continued to shine in musicals such as Easter Parade (1948) and Royal Wedding (1951), which featured his famous dance on the hotel corridor walls. He also collaborated with legendary performers like Judy Garland in Easter Parade, further expanding his influence in Hollywood. Astaire’s meticulous approach to rehearsals and insistence on perfection elevated every performance, earning him respect across the entertainment industry.\nAwards and Recognition\nAstaire’s excellence was recognized with numerous honors. In 1950, he received an Honorary Academy Award for his unique artistry in film musicals, acknowledging the “inspiration he has brought to the world of entertainment.” Later, he won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical and multiple Emmy Awards for his television specials. Additionally, Astaire received a Kennedy Center Honor in 1978 and a Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award, cementing his legacy as a multi-generational icon.\nLegacy in Dance and Film\nAstaire’s influence persists in modern dance and choreography, with his routines studied by generations of performers. He was among the first to integrate film techniques—long takes, minimal cuts—into dance sequences, creating a naturalistic and flowing style that emphasized skill and grace. His body of work spans more than 30 feature films, numerous television appearances, and countless stage performances, contributing significantly to his lifetime earnings and cementing his status as a cultural icon.\nTake a look at some of our other Net Worth articles you may like:\nCarl Dean Net Worth: The Untold Story of the $20 Million Fortune of Dolly Parton's Husband.\nParis Jackson Net Worth 2025: Inside Her $150M Fortune & Unpacking Her Complex Inheritance.\nReal Estate and Assets: Fred Astaire’s Homes and Collectibles\nFred Astaire’s wealth extended beyond his performances to a thoughtfully curated real estate portfolio and personal assets, reflecting both his success and refined taste.

But trying to make sense of its intricacies—economic indicators, geopolitical factors, and complicated technical analysis—can daunt even the most disciplined traders.\n🔹 This is where forex trading Telegram signal groups are useful. They offer filtered trade ideas, saving traders time in finding high-probability trades without having to spend hours poring over charts. If you are looking for the best free forex signals Telegram groups, it is important to know how they operate before joining them.\nThe Challenges of Forex Trading\nProfitable forex trading needs a thorough comprehension of:\n- Technical Analysis: Interpretation of candlestick patterns, support/resistance levels, and indicators such as Moving Averages or RSI.\n- Fundamental Analysis: Keeping track of economic news, interest rates, and geopolitical events that affect currency values.\n- Risk Management: Position sizing, stop-loss ordering, and not trading emotionally.\nFor novices, this learning curve is steep. That is why many resort to Telegram forex signals—a shortcut that delivers actionable trade setups with defined entry and exit points.\nHow Forex Signal Groups Make Trading Easy\nA forex signal is a suggested trade that usually consists of:\n✔ Currency Pair (e.g., EUR/USD, GBP/JPY)\n✔ Direction (Sell/Short or Buy/Long)\n✔ Entry Price (The best level to open the trade)\n✔ Stop Loss (SL) (The point of exit if the trade goes against you)\n✔ Take Profit (TP) (The price target to lock in profits)\nThese signals eliminate guesswork, allowing traders to follow expert analysis without needing advanced charting skills.\nHowever, it’s essential to remember that no signal is 100% accurate—risk management and independent research are still key.\nExample of a Forex Trading Signal\nHere's an example of what a common free forex signal Telegram message would be:\n- EUR/USD – BUY\n- Entry: 1.0850\n- Stop Loss (SL): 1.0800\n- Take Profit (TP): 1.0950\n- Risk: 1% of account balance\nBreakdown:\n- BUY (Long): The signal foresees the euro strengthening against the dollar.\n- Entry at 1.0850: The best price to enter the trade.\n- Stop Loss at 1.0800: If the price drops 50 pips, the trade closes automatically to limit losses.\n- Take Profit at 1.0950: A 100-pip gain if the trade succeeds.\n- 1% Risk: Prevents you from overexposing your account.\nWhy Use Telegram for Forex Signals?\nTelegram is a popular medium for free forex signals since:\n- Real-Time Notifications: Receive instant alerts on your phone.\n- Community Engagement: Educational materials and trader chat are provided by many groups.\n- Affordability: Free or inexpensive in comparison to paid signal services.\nBut traders need to be careful—not all groups of signals are trustworthy. Some might:\n- Promise too much profitability\n- Be opaque about their strategies\nAlways check a provider's record before taking their signals!\nHow to Select the Best Forex Signals Telegram Group: A Step-by-Step Guide\nHave you ever tried looking for \"best free forex signals Telegram\"? Then you know how it feels to be bombarded by countless groups offering \"95% win rates\" and \"risk-free profits.\" The reality? Not all signal providers are made equal—some are legit, but others are complete scams.\nThe secret to success is in comparison. There are Telegram groups for gold trading, forex scalping groups, and some that mix several asset classes. You need a step-by-step approach to get the best fit. We outline the critical factors to review before you can entrust any Forex signals group with your trades.\n1. Track Record & Reputation\nA provider's reputation is your initial filter. Look for:\n- Member count & activity – Big groups (10K+) aren’t necessarily better, but active discussion indicates legitimacy.\n- Online reviews – See Forex forums (ForexFactory, BabyPips) and Trustpilot for impartial views.\n- Social proof – Are traders sharing verified screenshots of their profits, or is everything hype?\nWarning: Most groups disclaim their signals as \"not financial advice\"—a red flag if they also promise unrealistic returns.\n2. Pricing: Free vs. Paid Signals\n- Free signals – Excellent to test the accuracy of a provider, but tend to be inconsistent. (Search: best free forex signals Telegram)\n- Paid signals – Should justify their cost with transparent performance data. Avoid groups demanding upfront fees without proof of success.\nPro Tip: Some premium groups offer free trials—use them to verify quality before committing.\n3. Performance Transparency & Win Rate\nA \"90% win rate\" is meaningless without evidence. Require:\n- Confirmed trading history (MyFXBook, FX Blue, or TradingView screenshots).\n- Real-time updates – Signals must be timestamped to prevent cherry-picking.\n- Average risk-reward ratio – Even a 70% win rate can lose money if losses exceed profits.\nAvoid groups that:\n- Post only \"winning trades\" and conceal losses.\n- Refuse to give long-term performance information.\n4. Signal Frequency & Trading Style\n- Scalping (10+ signals/day) – Takes up all screen time.\n- Swing trading (3-5 signals/week) – More suitable for part-time traders.\n- High-impact news signals – Some groups focus on trading economic events.\nAsk yourself: Is their strategy compatible with your risk tolerance and timeline?\n5. Reasoning Supporting Recommendations\nThe top providers detail their trades:\n- Technical analysis (e.g., *\"EUR/USD breaking key resistance at 1.0950\"*).\n- Core drivers (e.g., \"FOMC meeting likely to weaken USD\").\n- Clear entry/exit levels – No ambiguous calls like \"Buy gold now.\"\nRed flag: Groups that use \"insider info\" or push you into spontaneous trades.\nTelegram Trading Signals vs. Personal Research: A Trader’s Guide\nFor forex traders, particularly newcomers, the promise of the top free forex signals Telegram channels provide is hard to resist. Instant trade suggestions, professional analysis, and a sense of community can seem like a recipe for instant success.\nYet, depending on signals alone—without your own research—is a dangerous bet. Here’s how to get the balance just right.\nThe Case for Telegram Signals\nConvenience\nFree Telegram signals deliver real-time trade setups, saving you hours of analysis. ⏳\nLearning Tip\nWatching entry/exit points from experienced traders can help tighten up your strategy.\nCommunity Support\nMost groups provide discussions, making you comprehend market logic.\nHowever, Be Careful\nNot all signal providers are created equal. Scams and exaggerated performance claims are widespread.\nWhy Independent Research Matters\nSignals should supplement—not replace—your own due diligence.\nCheck Performance\nRequire verified track records (Myfxbook, FX Blue). No evidence? Next.\nLearn the Strategy\nFollowing signals blindly educates nothing. Study why a trade is successful (or not).\nMarket Context\nSignals are not nuanced. Macro trends, news events, or liquidity changes can trump any setup.\nBest Practices for New Traders\n1. Test Before Trusting\n- Demo-trade signals for at least a month.\n- Consistency trumps one-time wins.\n2. Cross-Check\n- Match Telegram signals with your personal technical/fundamental analysis.\n3. Risk Management\n- Even the most excellent free forex signals Telegram channels\n- Never risk more than 1-2% of a trade.\nFinal Insights\nIn summary, identifying the most effective free forex signals Telegram channels can take your trading strategy to the next level, with AnabelSignals being a beacon of hope in terms of accuracy and reliability.\nYet, even the most accurate signal should never substitute for diligent independent research and a keen understanding of market volatility.\nProfitable trading is predicated upon disciplined risk management—never invest what you cannot afford to lose.\nAs a novice or experienced trader, integrating quality signals (such as those from AnabelSignals) with your own analysis provides assurance of a balanced strategy in tackling the dynamic forex market.\nAlways remember: In trading, knowledge and caution are equally vital as the signals themselves.\nFAQ: Best Free Forex Signals on Telegram – Your Questions Answered\nForex trading signals on Telegram have become increasingly popular among traders who want to capitalize on market movements.

{"title": "Judy Garland Net Worth 2025: Her Shocking Fortune & Hollywood Legacy Revealed", "url": "https://www.finance-monthly.com/judy-garland-net-worth/", "text": "Judy Garland may have been Hollywood’s brightest star, but at her death she left behind just $40,000—an astonishingly small fortune for the voice of The Wizard of Oz.\nFew Hollywood stars have inspired as much awe, heartbreak, and timeless admiration as Judy Garland. Known to millions as Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, she was one of the most iconic performers of the 20th century—yet at the time of her death in 1969, Garland’s net worth was a shockingly modest $40,000.\nHer story is one of glittering fame mixed with financial turmoil. Despite singing alongside Frank Sinatra and sharing the silver screen with Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland never achieved the financial stability that her talents deserved. Instead, a combination of studio contracts, personal struggles, and financial mismanagement left her with a surprisingly fragile estate.\nEven today, more than five decades later, fans continue to ask how such an extraordinary woman—whose voice could fill concert halls and whose performances lit up Hollywood—ended her life with so little compared to the fortune she generated for others.\nJudy Garland’s $40,000 Net Worth at Death — What the Numbers Really Show\nHere’s what’s documented about how Judy Garland earned, spent, and ultimately left an estate widely reported at roughly $40,000 in liquid assets in June 1969—and where those figures come from.\nWe know that Garland’s money came in waves across film, television, records, and stage.\nMGM film salaries\nGarland signed with MGM as a teenager and, by 1939, was starring as Dorothy. Contemporary reporting and later retrospectives put her “Wizard of Oz” pay at $500 per week, about $9,600 total across the shoot—modest next to co-stars like the Tin Man and Scarecrow, and far below Clark Gable–level studio pay at the time. The Los Angeles Times has cited that $500/week figure, which aligns with other historical accounts. According to the Los Angeles Times, “Garland earned $500 a week” on Oz.\nTelevision: The Judy Garland Show (1963–64)\nWhen network television came calling, the checks finally looked like superstar checks. Archival coverage recounted by Television Heaven notes Garland’s $300,000 salary for 26 episodes (plus $140,000 earmarked for key production hires) on CBS’s The Judy Garland Show, with press at the time touting the overall package as the biggest talent deal TV had ever attempted.\nWikipedia’s bibliography on the series similarly summarizes the CBS offer reported in the press as a headline-making deal. CBS structured the series contract around a $300,000 star salary line and substantial production commitments.\nRecords and touring: the Carnegie Hall peak\nGarland’s live career produced one of the most celebrated concert albums ever. Judy at Carnegie Hall (recorded April 23, 1961) spent weeks at No. 1 on the album chart and won Album of the Year and Best Female Vocal Performance at the 1962 GRAMMYs—making Garland the first woman to win Album of the Year.\nThe GRAMMY artist page confirms the wins; Britannica and Carnegie Hall’s own archive summarize the album’s historic chart run. While per-album royalty statements aren’t public, this was the commercial and critical apex of Garland’s recording career, and it generated meaningful artist royalties and performance income in the early 1960s. The album topped charts and took home the industry’s highest honors.\nBig-ticket stage engagements\nGarland’s top-of-the-marquee status also commanded premium nightclub and theater fees through the 1950s–60s (for example, well-publicized Las Vegas residencies in the mid-50s). Exact nightly or weekly guarantees vary by engagement and aren’t comprehensively documented in public ledgers, but the pattern is unambiguous: the stage paid handsomely when she was healthy—and punished her finances when cancellations or disputes arose. Summary histories outline this late-career cycle of lucrative bookings and costly setbacks.\nHow so much of it disappeared\nTax liens and garnishments\nThe single clearest through-line in Garland’s money story is debt to the U.S. government. By the early 1960s, the IRS had placed liens on her home and income streams, and in July 1967, federal tax agents seized most of her earnings on closing night of a blockbuster run at New York’s Palace Theatre to cover back taxes. Contemporary reporting summarized in standard references details the seizure and liens; it’s one of the most widely cited episodes in accounts of her finances. According to Wikipedia’s chronology (sourced to period press and biographies), IRS actions hit her assets and live earnings directly.\nLegal disputes and alleged mismanagement\nMultiple biographies and archival summaries describe prolonged disputes with managers and agents, along with claims of mismanagement and embezzlement that left Garland covering expenses far beyond her personal spending. While individual lawsuit settlements aren’t all public, the pattern—high gross income offset by high advances, commissions, legal fees, and claw-backs—recurs across reputable historical summaries.\nLifestyle and support obligations\nUnlike some peers who parked earnings in passive assets early, Garland’s finances were frequently mobilized to support family, fund comebacks, and service debt. Public auction records and later family interviews also describe posthumous sales to raise cash, consistent with an estate that lacked large, liquid reserves.\nLos Angeles Times real-estate coverage documents properties associated with Garland (e.g., homes she owned or lived in), but those sales occurred decades later under different owners—useful for provenance, less so for reconstructing her 1969 balance sheet. A Hollywood Hills home associated with Garland later sold for $4.675 million (2020), illustrating the long-term appreciation of properties tied to her name rather than cash she held at death.\nWhat she had—and didn’t—at the end\nLiquid assets at death\nModern summaries routinely state that Garland died with about $40,000 in liquid assets after obligations—an estimate that originates in entertainment-finance roundups and pop-history explainers that rely on a mix of probate reporting and secondary compilations. Because probate files aren’t universally digitized, most recent pieces cite digest outlets (often themselves citing earlier biographies).\nFor example, The List cites the $40,000 figure and notes substantial IRS obligations being paid from her estate, while also referencing contemporary reporting that she had earned the inflation-equivalent of tens of millions during her lifetime. According to The List, drawing on long-running entertainment finance databases, Garland’s liquid estate was roughly $40,000 even after a career of very large gross earnings.\nPosthumous debts and how they were handled\nStandard references recount that Liza Minnelli helped coordinate repayments of her mother’s debts with support from friends including Frank Sinatra, and that Sidney Luft organized a 1978 auction of ~500 personal items to raise funds for Garland’s heirs—again, consistent with an estate that had assets of sentimental and collectible value but limited cash. Those details are summarized in the Wikipedia biography’s estate section. According to Wikipedia, family and friends worked down tax and other obligations, and the 1978 auction brought in additional funds for her children.\nBottom line\nThe public record shows enormous gross earning power but chronically fragile net finances: big studio checks, a landmark TV deal, and a historic live album and tour counter-weighted by tax enforcement, legal fees, and volatile health and work patterns.\nThat’s how an artist whose peak projects topped charts and won GRAMMYs plausibly left an estate with only tens of thousands in liquid cash—even as her legacy (and the long-term value of memorabilia and properties associated with her name) continued to grow in the decades after 1969. According to the sources above, the $40,000 figure reflects liquid assets after debts, not a life’s worth of earnings.\n| Category | Details | Estimated Value |\n|---|---|---|\n| Film & TV Earnings | Contracts with MGM and various studios, notable films including The Wizard of Oz | $25,000 |\n| Music & Royalties | Albums, singles, streaming, and licensing agreements | $10,000 |\n| Real Estate | Homes and personal residences | $3,000 |\n| Personal Assets | Jewelry, wardrobe, memorabilia | $2,000 |\n| Total Net Worth | All categories combined | $40,000 |\nEarly Life - The Making Of A Star\nJudy Garland was born Frances Ethel Gumm on June 10, 1922, in Grand Rapids, Minnesota.

Despite an initially blissful period, their marriage was marred by mismatched personalities and Garland's emotional unpreparedness for domestic responsibilities.

In this article, we’ll break down how this Hollywood icon built his fortune, highlight key career milestones, and explore the legacy he leaves behind in the entertainment world.\nTerence Stamp’s $10M Net Worth Breakdown\nAt the time of his death in August 2025, Terence Stamp's net worth was estimated at approximately $10 million, according to multiple sources including Hollywood Life and The Econimic Times.This substantial fortune was the result of his illustrious six-decade career in film, television, and theater, as well as his savvy investments and diverse income streams.\nCareer Earnings and Film Contracts\nStamp's acting career spanned over 60 years, during which he secured lucrative contracts for his roles in various films. Notably, his portrayal of General Zod in the Superman films and his role in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert garnered significant attention and remuneration. While exact figures for each contract are not publicly disclosed, it's known that leading roles in major productions during his peak years commanded substantial salaries, often ranging from $1 million to $5 million per film, depending on the project's budget and his involvement according to the Los Angeles Times.\nRoyalties and Streaming Revenues\nAs his films continued to be popular through syndication, DVD sales, and streaming platforms, Stamp earned ongoing royalties. While specific annual earnings from these sources are not detailed in public records, it's common for actors with a legacy in popular films to receive consistent income from such channels. Given the enduring popularity of his roles, particularly in the superhero genre, it's reasonable to infer that Stamp's royalty and streaming revenues contributed a significant portion to his net worth.\nInvestments and Real Estate\nWhile Terence Stamp earned the bulk of his wealth from his illustrious acting career, his approach to real estate was unconventional. Rather than amassing a sprawling property portfolio, Stamp preferred a minimalist, flexible lifestyle, often staying in friends’ homes, guesthouses, or short-term rentals. He did, however, make one notable real estate investment: a Southern California property famously dubbed the “Stamp House.”\nBuilt in 2004, Stamp funded its construction for over $400,000 on a property originally associated with novelist Lynda La Plante. Although the home was later sold in 2015 amid personal and legal complications, the investment reflected his occasional interest in real estate as part of his net worth strategy.\nIn the United Kingdom, Stamp alternated between staying in residences across Notting Hill and Knightsbridge, as well as short-term accommodations in luxury hotels, reflecting his preference for mobility over ownership. While exact valuations of his real estate holdings remain private, the Stamp House alone represents a significant financial outlay, and the prime locations he frequented suggest that property-related assets contributed meaningfully to his overall $10 million net worth.\nPersonal Assets\nTerence Stamp’s refined tastes extended to personal possessions. He favored minimalism over extravagance, rarely amassing large collections, but he did own select luxury vehicles and a few classic cars, typically valued in the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nHis personal effects, including fine art and carefully chosen jewelry, though not publicly appraised, likely added to his wealth. These assets, combined with his strategic real estate investments and career earnings, rounded out a net worth that reflected both financial prudence and an appreciation for quality over quantity.\nLegacy and Estate\nUpon his passing, Stamp's estate is likely to be inherited by his family, including his nephews and ex-wife Elizabeth O'Rourke . The distribution of his estate included his real estate holdings, personal assets, and any residuals from his film and television work. While the exact value of the estate's assets is not publicly disclosed, it's reasonable to assume that the total value aligns closely with his estimated net worth at the time of death according to the Hindustan Times.\nTerence Stamp's $10 million net worth at the time of his death reflects a lifetime of successful acting, strategic investments, and a lifestyle that balanced luxury with discretion. His legacy continues to influence the entertainment industry, and his financial success serves as a testament to his talent and business acumen.\n| Category | Details | Estimated Value |\n|---|---|---|\n| Film & TV Earnings | Roles in classic films, streaming royalties, and contracts | $5,000,000 |\n| Real Estate | Properties in UK and US, including Los Angeles home | $3,000,000 |\n| Personal Assets | Luxury cars, jewelry, art collections | $1,500,000 |\n| Investments & Other | Stocks, bonds, and other strategic investments | $500,000 |\n| Total Net Worth | $10,000,000 |\nTerence Stamp's Early Life: An East End London Kid Who Made It To Hollywood\nEarly Life and Upbringing\nTerence Henry Stamp was born on July 22, 1938, in Stepney, East London, to Ethel Esther (née Perrott), a seamstress, and Thomas Stamp, a tugboat stoker. As the eldest of five children, Stamp grew up in a working-class environment, experiencing the hardships of post-war London. The family relocated to Plaistow, West Ham, Essex (now part of Greater London), where Stamp attended Plaistow County Grammar School.\nHis father’s long absences due to his work in the Merchant Navy meant that Stamp was primarily raised by his mother, grandmother, and aunts. Despite the challenges, Stamp developed a passion for acting early on. He idolized American film stars like Gary Cooper and James Dean, whose performances deeply influenced him. His mother took him to see Beau Geste (1939) when he was just three years old, igniting his dream of becoming an actor.\nEducation and Entry into Acting\nAfter completing his education, Stamp worked in various advertising agencies in London, gradually earning a decent salary. In the mid-1950s, he also worked as an assistant to professional golfer Reg Knight at Wanstead Golf Club in east London. During this period, he honed his skills in communication and presentation, which would later serve him well in his acting career. In his autobiography, Stamp Album, he reflected positively on this phase of his life, appreciating the experiences that shaped his character.\nStamp's breakthrough into acting came when he won a scholarship to train at the prestigious Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London. This opportunity marked the beginning of his professional acting journey. He started his career in 1960 with a role in Wolf Mankowitz's production of This Year Next Year at the West End's Vaudeville Theatre.

His commanding performance as the villainous Kryptonian earned him a place in cinematic history and a dedicated fanbase according to People.\nThe 1990s marked a resurgence in Stamp's career with standout performances in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994), where he portrayed Bernadette, a transgender woman, earning BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations. He also starred in The Limey (1999), a crime drama directed by Steven Soderbergh, which garnered critical acclaim and several award nominations as per ABC News.\nLater Years and Continued Recognition\nIn the 2000s and beyond, Stamp continued to take on diverse roles in films such as Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999), The Haunted Mansion (2003), Elektra (2005), Wanted (2008), Get Smart (2008), Yes Man (2008), Valkyrie (2008), Big Eyes (2014), and Last Night in Soho (2021) according to Time.\nHis performances remained marked by depth and nuance, earning him continued respect and admiration in the industry.

Stamp's contributions to cinema and literature ensure that his influence will be felt for generations to come.\nReal Estate Portfolio: A Life of Nomadic Elegance\nTerence Stamp, renowned for his roles in Superman and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, led a life as unconventional as his film career. Despite his substantial net worth, estimated at $10 million at the time of his passing in August 2025, Stamp never conformed to the typical celebrity lifestyle. He chose a minimalist, nomadic existence, often staying in friends' homes or luxury hotels rather than owning property according to Business Upturn.\nA Life Without Permanent Roots\nStamp's approach to living arrangements was notably unconventional. In the United States, he often stayed in guesthouses in Ojai, California, or apartments once owned by his brother in New York City and the Hamptons. In London, he alternated between friends’ residences in areas like Notting Hill and Knightsbridge. Occasionally, he treated himself to stays in luxury hotels, such as The Savoy, but these were short-term arrangements rather than ownership.\nThe \"Stamp House\" Saga\nIn 2004, Stamp invested over $400,000 to build a house in Southern California, known as the \"Stamp House.\" This decision stemmed from a verbal agreement with novelist Lynda La Plante, who suggested that Stamp could build a home on her property. However, after La Plante's divorce, the entire property was sold in June 2015, including the house Stamp had funded. Despite assurances, Stamp never received reimbursement for his investment or a share of the proceeds from the sale according to Courthouse News.\nA Philosophy of Minimalism\nStamp's lifestyle was characterized by a preference for simplicity and freedom according to The Guardian. He once stated, \"I don't own a house. I don't have a permanent address. I don't have a car. I don't have a bank account. I don't have anything.\" This philosophy allowed him to remain unencumbered by material possessions, focusing instead on his work and personal experiences.\nTake a look at some of our other Net Worth articles you may like:\nCarl Dean Net Worth: The Untold Story of the $20 Million Fortune of Dolly Parton's Husband.\nParis Jackson Net Worth 2025: Inside Her $150M Fortune & Unpacking Her Complex Inheritance.\nPersonal Life\nTerence Stamp's personal life was as intriguing and unconventional as his career. He was married once, to Elizabeth O’Rourke, from 2002 to 2008. The couple met in the mid-1990s when O’Rourke was a 23-year-old pharmacist working in Sydney. Despite their 35-year age gap, they married on New Year's Eve in 2002, with Stamp being 64 and O’Rourke 29. The marriage ended in divorce in 2008, with O’Rourke citing Stamp's \"unreasonable behaviour\" as the reason for the split.\nLegal documents revealed that Stamp had initially expressed the desire to separate and agreed to cover all associated costs. The couple had no children and had been living apart when the divorce was finalized. Reflecting on the split years later, Stamp told The Daily Mail, \"We had an incredible amount of fun. She went back to Australia, and that’s why I don’t see her, but if I do go there, I’m sure I will.\"\nStamp did not have children, a fact that contributed to his nomadic, minimalist lifestyle. Without familial obligations, he was free to travel extensively and pursue personal passions, often living abroad for months at a time.\nHobbies and Interests\nStamp was widely recognized for his love of travel and culture. He spent significant time in both the United States and the United Kingdom, exploring local art scenes, attending film festivals, and cultivating friendships with fellow actors, directors, and writers.\nHe was also a lifelong enthusiast of motorcycles and classic cars, often attending automotive shows and enjoying the craftsmanship of vintage vehicles. Beyond vehicles, Stamp had a keen interest in fine art and literature, regularly collecting select pieces and reading widely, reflecting a lifelong curiosity and dedication to culture.\nHis hobbies and personal pursuits were tightly interwoven with his professional life, allowing him to draw inspiration from the arts and experiences around him.
