Department stores – which rely on a variety of imported goods and materials, from shoes to t-shirts – have particularly been scrambling to deal with the flux in prices.\nAt Macy’s, signs advertising sales of as much as 60% off original prices were sprinkled around the store – even next to diamond-encrusted necklaces locked inside display cases in the jewelry department. But for some customers, the prices are still too high.\nNydia Olvera, 61, said that shopping at Macy’s is typically out of her budget, but she still makes trips to the store to check out the clearance section. “I remember they used to have these t-shirts for three dollars. Now, no more,” Olvera said. “Now I pay $7 to $9 for a t-shirt.”\nA recent study from analytics firm DataWeave showed that the prices of footwear, apparel and bags increased significantly from January to June. Footwear has gone up as much as 4% and apparel by nearly 2% in the last six months.\nAnd it’s unclear how much more prices could rise. The White House is still in the midst of negotiations with dozens of countries that could face new tariffs as high as 40%. These proposed tariffs are set to go into effect 1 August, after Trump pushed back an initial negotiations deadline of 9 July.\nLast week, the Trump administration announced a deal had been made with Vietnam, which is the second largest manufacturer for apparel, footwear and accessories – the bulk of what is sold at department stores – after China.\nAccording to the deal, exports from Vietnam will face 20% tariffs – half of the proposed levy of 46% Trump announced in April. Goods made in other countries, such as China, that are shipped from Vietnam will face a 40% tariff.\nWhile retail executives have said the deal is better than the initial tariffs that were announced, it will still increase costs for retailers. Macy’s recently adjusted down its earnings forecast, citing uncertainty around tariffs. The company’s stock price is down 25% this year.\nMacy’s CEO Tony Spring told CNBC, the financial news network, in May that some prices will stay the same but others are going to be more expensive, meaning the company will have to pass on some of the levies to customers. Other executives, including leaders from Nike, Target, Best Buy and Walmart have similarly said that they will have to pass on costs.\nBut retailers are also absorbing costs. Macy’s chief financial officer Adrian Mitchell said during the company’s earnings call in May that, while the company has been able to gain some vendor discounts, “we’re absorbing some of that price as well”.\nRetailers must decide how much of the increased costs it can pass onto consumers, without losing loyal customers.\nIt is a tough environment particularly for department stores, which have lost customers to online retailers over the years. Sales at department stores made up just 2.6% of retail sales in 2023, compared to 14.1% in 1993, before the rise of online shopping.\nAt Queens Center, some Macy’s customers said they have yet to notice any price increases, especially when using coupons the company typically issues.\n“The difference isn’t big; a little bit higher,” said Raphaelina Garcia, 33, who was shopping for a dress to wear at an upcoming wedding. “When you have the coupon, it’s the same price [as before].”", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 09:00:15 GMT", "author": "Lauren Aratani in New York", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

Those arrested were a 17-year-old British boy from the West Midlands, a 19-year-old Latvian man from the West Midlands, a 19-year-old British man from London and a 20-year-old British woman from Staffordshire.\nAll four of those apprehended were arrested at their home addresses and their electronic devices were seized for forensic analysis.\nThe NCA told the BBC in May that it was looking at the involvement in the attacks of Scattered Spider, a loose collective of native English-speaking hackers.\nM&S was the first retailer to be attacked in April in an incident that forced the closure of its online store for nearly seven weeks. Co-op was attacked the same month and forced to shut down parts of its IT system. Harrods announced on 1 May that it had been targeted and restricted internet access across its websites after attempts to gain unauthorised access to its systems.\nFoster said: “Cyber-attacks can be hugely disruptive for businesses, and I’d like to thank M&S, Co-op and Harrods for their support to our investigations. Hopefully this signals to future victims the importance of seeking support and engaging with law enforcement as part of the reporting process. The NCA and policing are here to help.”\nThe arrests came days after the M&S chair, Archie Norman, told MPs that two other large British companies had been affected by unreported cyber-attacks in recent months, as he detailed the “traumatic” attack on the retailer.\nNorman added that the M&S attack involved the deployment of ransomware – malicious software that effectively locks up computer systems. Hackers then typically demand a ransom in exchange for unlocking those systems, hence the term ransomware.\nNorman would not comment on whether M&S had paid a ransom. He also confirmed the involvement of DragonForce, an intermediary group that leases ransomware and other hacking in infrastructure to cybercriminals in a process known as ransomware-as-a-service.\nAn M&S spokesperson said: “We welcome this development and thank the NCA for its diligent work on this incident.”\nA Co-op spokesperson said: “Hacking is not a victimless crime. Throughout this period, we have engaged fully with the NCA and relevant authorities, and are pleased on behalf of our members to see this had led to these arrests today.”", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 11:13:06 GMT", "author": "Dan Milmo Global technology editor", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

However, these deals have long been controversial, and not have always been seen to provide value for money to taxpayers.\nMore than 650 public sector organisations have their buildings, IT and essential infrastructure managed by a private consortium under a PFI deal, and state bodies are set to pay £136bn in unitary charges for these contracts until 2052-3.\nHalf of the contracts – covering hospitals, schools and transport – are set to expire during the next decade. The PAC report called on ministers to ensure such contracts were carefully managed so that private sector firms complied with their contractual obligations and “only quality assets are handed back” to government.\nLast year a report by the Association of Infrastructure Investors in Public Private Partnerships warned that schools and hospitals that depend on PFI contracts were in danger of “severe disruption” unless they could find a way to cope once those contracts expire.\nMPs on the PAC are also calling for a more comprehensive framework for how risk is shared between the public and private sector when they work in partnership, particularly after the high-profile collapse of the outsourcing company Carillion, which halted work on new hospitals in Liverpool and Birmingham.\nThe government also needs to provide detailed information on the pipeline of future projects in order to attract new investors, according to the PAC, amid a current lack of data about the past performance of projects or when future ones will be delivered.\n“Our scrutiny has found a woefully obscured picture for any seeking to invest in big infrastructure projects in the UK, with a corresponding drain of skills overseas,” said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the PAC.\n“Without a long-term, consistent pipeline giving an idea of what to expect in years to come, UK infrastructure risks becoming stony ground for any investor.”\nThe PAC is calling on the Treasury to identify which financing models it would support for money for different types of projects, such as energy, transport or communication, to attract investors and drive competition.\nA central database covering private finance for infrastructure investment should be published, according to the report, to help the Treasury to deliver value for money, given the huge amounts of money involved in such projects, such as the £14.2bn pledged by the government for the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 23:01:51 GMT", "author": "Joanna Partridge", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}
{"title": "Zonal pricing is dead. Now Miliband should be less absolutist on his 2030 goals | Nils Pratley", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/jul/10/zonal-pricing-energy-ed-miliband-2030-targets", "text": "The chief executive of Ofgem, Jonathan Brearley, backed zonal pricing. Fintan Slye, the head of the National Energy System Operator, also supported a system that could have led to different parts of Great Britain charging different rates for their electricity. Chris Stark, the head of the “mission control” unit within Ed Miliband’s energy department, declared himself to be “zonal curious”.\nBut it’s not going to happen. After intense lobbying from both sides of the great philosophical divide in energy-land, Miliband has killed the zonal option. The policy wonks are now obliged to go back to fiddling with internal network charges – the fees paid by generators to access the transmission network – to calculate the sweet spots to encourage more renewable generation where it’s most needed, while not stifling it completely in places where, for example, it is windy. That means yet more rounds of consultation.\nIn the meantime, the maddening “constraint costs” will clock up. These include the payments to windfarms (usually in Scotland) to turn off when it’s too windy because the local grid would otherwise be overloaded, plus those made to other generators (usually gas-fired plants in the south of England) to fire up. Constraint costs, charged to our bills, were £2.7bn last year and are projected to hit £4bn by 2030 even if the newly commissioned extra transmission capacity actually arrives on time, which it probably won’t.\nPut simply, too many windfarms were built before the grid could cope. Everybody involved in energy policymaking for the past decade, including a long succession of Tory energy ministers, should be squirming. Octopus Energy, the noisiest advocate for zonal, was able to cite analysis that Seagreen, Scotland’s largest windfarm, was paid to restrict its output 71% of the time last year. If the figure is only roughly accurate, it is still excruciating.\nYet Miliband’s resistance to zonal is understandable. The switch wouldn’t have happened until the mid-2030s, so it would have done nothing to reduce constraint costs out to 2030, his target for a clean power system. And the real zonal killer, even if Miliband didn’t quite spell it out, was the cost of disruption. The non-Octopus parts of the industry probably weren’t making it up about increased costs of capital under a more uncertain pricing system.\nBids to build windfarms, for example, don’t solely depend on the initial contract-for-difference, or price guarantee for 15 years. A developer also has to take a view on the likely wholesale price of electricity once the subsidies drop away. Miliband will have feared the next auctions to build offshore wind would spit out truly painful prices. As it is, this autumn’s winning bids will probably arrive well above the current gas-dictated wholesale price of electricity, as described in this column earlier this week. Windfarms are capital-intense projects and the age of cheap money is over.\nMiliband is reportedly under pressure from Downing Street to show how his project for clean power by 2030 will bring down bills for ordinary consumers. So he should be.\n“Stepping back from zonal pricing does not, in itself, constitute a strategy,” commented Kate Mulvany, of the research firm Cornwall Insight, calling for reforms of the national pricing setup to be bold. “Presently, consumers face the worst of both worlds: paying wholesale prices that are still driven by volatile gas markets, and premium costs to replace gas in the power system with renewables,” she said. “We cannot assume they will be willing to pay like this for ever. Households and businesses care about affordable, reliable energy above all else. If reform fails to deliver that, the legitimacy of the entire system will be called into question.”\nIn a similar vein, Marc Hedin, of Aurora Energy Research, said: “We need to act quickly to minimise the cost of managing network congestion ahead of 2030, which is a sword of Damocles that could severely hurt bills and the whole credibility of the current framework.”\nBoth are pointing to the inefficiencies of the current setup, and the now-vital question of bills. In a world of trade-offs, the imperative should be to bear down on costs. The industry now has more certainty over investment. The next step should be more pragmatism, and less absolutism, about generation targets.\nClean power has been defined, oddly, as 95% low-carbon and the 2030 target itself is arbitrary. Would it really hurt to do, say, 92% by 2032 if it saved consumers billions in their bills by ensuring the grid infrastructure is actually in place in time? That is a question that officialdom has, so far, been reluctant to answer. One hopes somebody is doing modelling because the biggest risk to the government’s long-term decarbonisation ambitions would be the election of Reform UK.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 18:36:06 GMT", "author": "Nils Pratley", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

It has also struggled to stem a string of big client losses to rivals, most notably French group Publicis.\nPublicis, which overtook WPP to become the world’s biggest marketing services group by revenues last year, has snapped up billions in business including Coca-Cola’s media account in North America and, most recently, Mars’ $1.7bn (£1.25bn) global media planning and buying business.\nThe latter win, revealed by the Guardian, coincided with WPP’s move to announce Read’s departure after three decades at the company, with almost seven as chief executive.\nPhilip Jansen, the chair of WPP, said: “Cindy has led multibillion-dollar operations across the UK, EMEA and globally, built enduring client relationships and delivered growth in both enterprise and consumer environments.\n“Cindy has supported the digital transformation of large enterprises around the world – including embracing AI to create new customer experiences, business models and revenue streams.”\nIn her most recent role at Microsoft, Rose was responsible for working with large clients to use digital technology and AI for business transformation.\nRose, who has British and US citizenship, has been on WPP’s board since 2019.\nShe will be based in London and New York, where WPP has in the past considered moving its listing. She is an advisory board member at Imperial College Business School in London and McClaren Racing.\nBefore Microsoft, Rose held senior roles at Vodafone and Virgin Media, and worked for 15 years at the Walt Disney Company.\n“Cindy is an outstanding and inspirational business leader with extensive experience at some of the world’s most recognised companies and a track record of growing large-scale businesses,” said Jansen, adding that the recruitment process had been “thorough” and that internal and external candidates had been considered.\nWPP moved swiftly to secure a successor to Read, who only announced his departure last month.\nRead overhauled the group over the course of his tenure, merging agencies and selling off some businesses, which has helped cut net debt.\nHowever, client losses fuelled by being slower off the mark to build an AI offering, as well as fighting against developments by deep-pocketed big tech in the sector, meant he was not able to reinvigorate the company’s share price.\n“There are so many opportunities ahead for WPP,” said Rose. “We have and continue to build market-leading AI capabilities, alongside an unrivalled reputation for creative excellence and a pre-eminent client list. I began my career in the creative industries and this feels like coming home.”\nOn Wednesday, WPP cut its forecast for revenues and profits this year, blaming a challenging economic backdrop.

My idea of fun is an annual event in which people are crushed in pursuit of half-price Christmas decorations. But those days have passed. Welcome to the era of the always-on sale.\nIf you’re into capitalist nightmares, you might like EOFY sales, Oh No We Forgot EOFY sales, SOFY sales, Father’s Day sales, AFL grand final sales, and “my boss doesn’t want me to send this email” sales. Then we go headlong into Australia’s Black Friday sales, which start around the beginning of November and last until January, as is tradition (though not ours).\nIn fact, there is no longer a reason to leave anything on the shelf. Every minute of every day, something is marked down and waiting for your card details, as long as you’re willing to compromise your moral and ethical obligations to the planet and those who live here. Full price is dead, long live the sale.\nWe’re now in the throes of Prime Day, an event that defies the laws of time and space to inhabit a full week and is expected to generate US$23bn in sales for Amazon and its third-party sellers. For a mere 168 continuous hours, shoppers are given the option to support a global capitalist behemoth as it asks the question, “Do you need a walking desk, cat food and a 30-pack of crew socks?” To which we reply, “Yes but only if you massively accelerate climate change by delivering it tomorrow.”\nI remember a time when Prime Day (which 10 years ago lasted only 24 hours, like human days) was duly criticised by the press, at least in this country. Australia of old was proud of its anti-capitalist image. We didn’t need newfangled gear with “batteries” and “screens”. We wore the socks our grandmother gave us on our 10th birthday. When our kettle broke, we went to the shed and taped it up again.\nNo longer. TikTokers, YouTubers, bloggers and other taste makers – including serious news outlets – have jumped on the chance to scour Amazon’s endless library of cheap labour to find the best deals. It’s running ads like editorial. Prime Day isn’t just a sale, it’s fodder for desperate content factories – again, including serious news outlets – looking for literally any topic that could become clicks that become Meta revenue that becomes sweet affiliate link cash.\nNow, for the everyman, there’s no denying the bargains. Everything you could never need is here. Phones. Perfumes. TVs. Baby wipes. Scrolling the long, long, long – long long long – list of sale items is overwhelming to the point of delirium. Luckily, if you can’t decide what to buy, Amazon’s personal assistant, Alexa+, can make suggestions. Your phone? Too slow! Your treadmill? Too bulky! Your energy drinks? Not bulky enough! And where does your old stuff go? Who cares!\nIt’s easy to criticise Amazon. It pays little tax. In 2023 its US warehouse workers were allegedly injured on average twice as often as its competitors. Almost a hundred private planes flew into Jeff Bezos’s Venetian wedding. It’s an enormous contributor to the global waste problem – according to one source, to the tune of 599m pounds of plastic packaging waste in a single year.\nThat’s Prime Day – week, year – in a nutshell. A wasteful company wastes people’s money to generate more waste. Thousands of product thumbnails gradually blur together to form one giant garbage pile floating in the Pacific Ocean (if you’re not sure what that is, there are books about it on Amazon).\nHigh-income countries – like the US and Australia, where it’s possible to get same-day delivery yoga pants – produce more than one-third of the world’s waste. Globally, over the next 25 years municipal solid waste, like homewares, clothes and electronics, are expected to increase to 3.4bn tonnes.\nPrime Day has no regard for these numbers. It’s a crude marketplace in the spirit of perpetually closing-down rug shops and video game stores. It’s designed to bamboozle. It disguises itself as a social event, encouraging us to plan our wishlists, share our carts with friends and post haul videos to prove the sickness consumed us. It’s built to confuse us into thinking we need a second air fryer or a hedge trimmer or an automated bird feeder. And it insults us if we disagree: oh human, just let our AI shop for you.\nI’m not a sale prude. I live for the dopamine hit of a bargain. My postie knows me by name and parcel frequency. And, full disclosure: I have an Amazon account and occasionally order sports bras and nail polish. But I cannot, as the youth say, fuck with the heavy-handed push towards junk I don’t need to replace stuff I never wanted.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 00:17:50 GMT", "author": "Anna Spargo-Ryan", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

The regulator said it could end up saving the postal delivery service between £250m and £425m each year.\nFirst-class letters will still have to be delivered by the next working day, Monday to Saturday, and a cap will continue on the price of a second-class stamp.\nOfcom has lowered targets for first-class post to be delivered the next day from 93% to 90% and second-class to be delivered within three days from 98.5% to 95%. But Ofcom said it was adding a new “enforceable” backstop delivery target, so that 99% of mail had to be delivered no more than two days’ late. The new rules will come into force on 28 July.\nRoyal Mail has struggled to make deliveries on time, having been fined more than £16m for missed delivery targets since mid-2023. In April it increased the price of a first-class stamp for the sixth time in just over three years, from £1.65 to £1.70, and put up the cost of the second-class service by 2p to 87p.\nThe shake-up comes months after the Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský’s EP Group completed a £3.6bn takeover of International Distributions Services (IDS), the owner of Royal Mail.\nOfcom’s director for networks and communications, Natalie Black, said: “These changes are in the best interests of consumers and businesses, as urgent reform of the postal service is necessary to give it the best chance of survival.”\nIDS has for months been advocating for a pared-back second-class service, arguing that the existing USO was “unsustainable”. Last year, bosses said the network handled 7bn letters in 2024 compared with 20bn a year two decades earlier.\nThe IDS chief executive, Martin Seidenberg, welcomed the new rules on Thursday, saying it was “good news for customers across the UK as it supports the delivery of a reliable, efficient and financially sustainable universal service”.\nHowever, the Communication Workers Union said that while it “accepts the need for change”, the changes announced by Ofcom were not a solution to all Royal Mail’s problems.\nIt said: “Royal Mail has been trialling these changes in delivery offices across the country and there are clear problems on the ground.\n“These changes are not a ‘one-stop solution’ for the problems in the postal service – the real culprit behind these issues is Royal Mail’s inability to properly recruit and retain staff, which has led to workloads piling up in delivery offices and vital letters being left behind.”\nThe Liberal Democrats said it looked like Ofcom was letting Royal Mail “off the hook”.\n“This is a deeply worrying decision that could leave countless people who rely on these deliveries in the lurch,” said the Lib Dem MP Sarah Olney, the party’s business spokesperson.\n“The sorry saga of Royal Mail delays has been going on for far too long, and people are rightly furious. Instead of giving Royal Mail a free pass, Ofcom needs to step in and act by holding this failing service fully accountable.\n“Ofcom needs to think again and not let Royal Mail off the hook at the expense of people who expect the bare minimum of their post arriving on time.”\nCitizens Advice echoed those concerns, saying that Royal Mail had a “woeful track record of failing to meet delivery targets, all the while ramping up postage costs. Today, Ofcom missed a major opportunity to bring about meaningful change.”\nTom MacInnes, the director of policy at Citizens Advice, said: “Pushing ahead with plans to slash services and relax delivery targets in the name of savings won’t automatically make letter deliveries more reliable or improve standards.”", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 08:24:43 GMT", "author": "Kalyeena Makortoff", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

But it risks going down in history as the year when the international order built since 1945 collapsed.\nThe cracks had long been visible. Since the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, the intervention in Libya and the war in Ukraine, some permanent members of the security council have trivialised the illegal use of force. The failure to act vis-a-vis the genocide in Gaza represents a denial of the most basic values of humanity. The inability to overcome differences is fuelling a new escalation of violence in the Middle East, the latest chapter of which includes the attack on Iran.\nThe law of the strongest also threatens the multilateral trading system. Sweeping tariffs disrupt value chains and push the global economy into a spiral of high prices and stagnation. The World Trade Organization has been hollowed out, and no one remembers the Doha development round.\nThe 2008 financial collapse exposed the failure of neoliberal globalisation, but the world remained locked into the austerity playbook. The choice to bail out the ultra-wealthy and major corporations at the expense of ordinary citizens and small businesses has deepened inequality. In the past 10 years, the $33.9tn (£25tn) accumulated by the world’s richest 1% is equivalent to 22 times the resources needed to eradicate global poverty, according to a report by Oxfam.\nThe stranglehold on the state’s capacity for action has led to public distrust in institutions. Discontent has become fertile ground for extremist narratives that threaten democracy and promote hate as a political project.\nMany countries have cut cooperation programmes instead of redoubling efforts to implement the sustainable development goals by 2030. The available resources are insufficient, the costs are high, access is bureaucratic, and the conditions imposed often fail to respect local realities.\nThis is not about charity, but about addressing disparities rooted in centuries of exploitation, interference and violence against the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa and Asia. In a world with a combined GDP of over $100tn, it is unacceptable that more than 700 million people still suffer from hunger and live without electricity or water.\nThe richest countries bear the greatest historical responsibility for carbon emissions, yet it is the poorest who will suffer the most from the climate crisis. The year 2024 was the hottest in history, showing that reality is moving faster than the Paris agreement. The binding obligations of the Kyoto protocol were replaced by voluntary commitments, and the financing pledges made at COP 15 in Copenhagen in 2009 – promising $100bn annually – never materialised. The recent increase in Nato’s military spending makes that possibility even more remote.\nAttacks on international institutions ignore the concrete benefits the multilateral system has brought to people’s lives. If smallpox has been eradicated, the ozone layer preserved and labour rights still protected in much of the world, it is thanks to the efforts of these institutions.\nIn times of growing polarisation, terms such as “deglobalisation” have become commonplace. But it is impossible to “deplanetise” our shared existence. No wall is high enough to preserve islands of peace and prosperity surrounded by violence and misery.\nToday’s world is vastly different from that of 1945. New forces have emerged, and new challenges have arisen. If international organisations seem ineffective, it is because their structure no longer reflects the current reality. Unilateral and exclusionary actions are worsened by the absence of collective leadership. The solution to the multilateralism crisis is not to abandon it, but to rebuild it on fairer and more inclusive foundations.\nThis is the understanding that Brazil – whose vocation has always been to foster collaboration among nations – demonstrated during its G20 presidency last year and continues to demonstrate through its presidencies of the Brics and Cop 30 this year: that it is possible to find common ground even in adverse scenarios.\nThere is an urgent need to recommit to diplomacy and rebuild the foundations of true multilateralism – one capable of answering the outcry of a humanity fearful for its future.

Whether the debacle over Labour’s welfare reform bill will leave a similarly lasting mark on the Starmer administration remains uncertain. But the signs are familiar: rushed legislation, party unrest and proposals out of step with expert advice and public sentiment. The bill passed on Wednesday night bore little resemblance to its original version – it was so different, in fact, that even the title had changed. Yet MPs were asked to approve it with minimal scrutiny. The rebellion of 47 Labour MPs carries more weight than the numbers suggest – because it taps into questions of moral judgment.\nSome who voted against the bill’s third reading may be driven by factional grudges. Many think poverty is a national crisis to be ended. Rebels identified the sting in the tail of the new welfare bill: halving the universal credit health element for 90% of new claimants from April 2026. The government, rattled by party dissent, had already removed the most provocative clause – targeting personal independence payments – and rebranded the bill to gain Commons assent.\nBut old habits die hard. Ministers had shamelessly claimed their new bill lifts 50,000 people out of poverty. This only works by counting 150,000 spared harm by scrapping Tory plans. In fact, 100,000 more people – mostly disabled – will fall into poverty due to the changes in Labour’s “new” act. That’s not a progressive policy. It’s a sleight of hand disguising a deep cut. Commendably, the UN saw through it. By not implementing the Tory change, Labour has in effect incurred a cost to the Treasury of about £3.6bn, but ministers are, paradoxically, booking this non-action as both a “net saving” and a social gain.\nThe politics of welfare have long turned on the question of who deserves what and why. Kemi Badenoch’s Conservatives try to portray cruelty as common sense with talk of “makers not takers”. Under Sir Keir Starmer, welfare is no longer a right but a test of how sick is sick enough. However, outside Westminster, the arguments sound different. They arrive not as Treasury spreadsheets, but as stories. A child telling her teacher she didn’t eat last night. A mother choosing between heating and the bus fare to school.\nIn her report this week, the children’s commissioner for England offered a bleak account of what life is like for poor children. They live in dilapidated flats or hotel rooms with no kitchens and wear worn-out clothes. They talk with a clarity that adults often avoid about humiliation and exclusion. The report – based on testimony from 128 children – should have shamed the government for tolerating “almost-Dickensian” poverty. Instead, the joint call by the four children’s commissioners of the UK to tackle it was received by ministers with polite concern lest it halt the forward march of their welfare bill.\nCapping key child-related benefits to the first two children in a family is wrong. Lifting it would mean 350,000 children are removed from poverty and would help 700,000 more. Seven MPs were suspended last July for opposing the continuation of the two-child benefit cap. Wednesday’s rebellion was too big for Labour’s high command to punish; removing the whip wasn’t an option. Welfare prevents misery. Blaming it for poverty won’t wash. Sir Keir must accept that – and forget about attempting to govern by excluding critics.\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Some fans paid more than £350 for tickets with a face value of £150.\nThe watchdog said Ticketmaster had failed since then to provide any undertakings that it found acceptable to resolve the issue of the way it sold the tickets.\nOasis have been contacted for comment.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 15:57:02 GMT", "author": "Mark Sweney", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}
{"title": "UK government abandons energy ‘zonal pricing’ plan", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jul/10/uk-government-abandons-energy-zonal-pricing-plan", "text": "The government has abandoned plans for “zonal pricing” that would have charged electricity users in the south-east of England more than those in Scotland, saying that a single national price would help ensure the system was “fair, affordable, secure and efficient”.\nThe energy secretary, Ed Miliband, had been considering proposals for zonal pricing that would mean different parts of England, Wales and Scotland being charged different rates for their electricity, based on local supply and demand.\nIt was intended to encourage heavy electricity users to relocate to areas that have more generation such as Scotland, where windfarms sometimes have to switch off because of a lack of demand.\nBut senior officials said earlier this week that the scheme could put off investors and make it more difficult to build renewables.\nThe energy department confirmed on Thursday it was abandoning the proposal after a lengthy consultation that had been running since 2022.\nMiliband said: “Building clean power at pace and scale is the only way to get Britain off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel markets and protect families and businesses for good.\n“As we embark on this new era of clean electricity, a reformed system of national pricing is the best way to deliver an electricity system that is fairer, more affordable, and more secure, at less risk to vital investment in clean energy than other alternatives.\n“Our package of reforms will protect consumers and secure investment as we drive to deliver our clean power mission through our plan for change.”\nInstead, ministers said new proposals would let the government take more responsibility for planning the system and determining where clean energy infrastructure was located, based on what is needed for the long term.\nThe long-awaited decision ends the bitter feud within the industry between those who believe that zonal energy pricing could make the market more efficient and those who argue the disruption would raise costs and jeopardise the UK plan to create a virtually carbon-free power sector by the end of the decade.\nThe energy regulator, Ofgem, welcomed the decision and said it brought “certainty and confidence for the future of the energy system”.\nIt added it would work with the government “to build a decarbonised system which will bring stability and protect consumers from international volatility and the rollercoaster effect that has on bills. We’ll be setting out our thinking on network charging reforms shortly”.\nHowever, Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, had previously spoken out in favour of zonal pricing.\nThose who backed a move to zonal pricing included Greg Jackson, the founder and boss of Octopus Energy, whereas some of Britain’s biggest renewable energy companies including SSE, Scottish Power and RWE opposed the idea.\nResponding to the government’s decision, a spokesperson for Octopus said: “We must reverse the spiralling costs of electricity, so we respectfully disagree with this announcement. The UK should have followed the majority of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) and put consumer interests ahead of producers.\n“The alternative to zonal pricing – reformed national pricing – is nonexistent. There are no published models, no cost-benefit analysis and no hope it’ll tackle the precipitously rising costs of the system.”\nHowever, SSE said the move provided “much-needed policy clarity” for investors and consumers.\nChris O’Shea, the chief executive of British Gas’s owner, Centrica, said it was a “commonsense decision” and that the “theoretical benefits never stacked up against the real-world risks” in potential zonal pricing.\nUnder the dropped proposals, zones with an abundance of electricity generation relative to local demand – such as Scotland – would have had lower market prices. But densely populated areas in the south-east of England would have run the risk of higher energy bills due to higher market costs.\nThose on both sides of the debate paid consultants to produce detailed analysis to serve as evidence, and engaged in rigorous lobbying to put forward their point of view.\nAna Musat, executive director of policy at RenewableUK, said: “This decision is good news for billpayers, in part because the prices set in the government’s auctions for clean power contracts will be lower than they would have been under the costly zonal pricing regime.\n“It will give confidence to private investors that the UK is one of the best markets in the world to build new renewable energy projects, by ending the uncertainty that zonal pricing would have caused.”", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 09:45:44 GMT", "author": "Kalyeena Makortoff and Jillian Ambrose", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

{"title": "Vienna has been declared a renters’ utopia – here's why | Justin Kadi", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/10/housing-crisis-in-europe-vienna-renters-social-housing", "text": "When it comes to best-practice examples in the housing debate, Vienna is a common reference. Indeed, the Austrian capital features prominently in narratives about successful housing policies. An article in the Observer concluded that Vienna shows “decent homes for all” is not an impossible dream. And the New York Times even declared it “a renters’ utopia”.\nA considerable part of the attraction of Vienna relates to its large social-housing stock. It accounts for some 43% of the roughly 1m housing units in the city. About half of it is municipally owned council housing. The other half is provided and administered by limited-profit housing associations – an Austrian version of social housing providers that are permitted to make a small profit to finance their operations. Social housing is not just for those on low incomes, but also caters to middle- and even some upper-middle-class households.\nThe positive impacts are directly measurable. Rent levels in the social-housing sector are significantly lower than in the private rental market: newly rented units in the limited-profit and council housing sectors cost about 30% less. Housing quality, meanwhile, is often higher, particularly in the limited-profit housing stock. Moreover, the availability of social housing also dampens rent levels in the private rental market, as a recent study showed.\nThe sector has not grown overnight. It originated in the municipal socialism of “Red Vienna” in the 1920s, when the Social Democratic Workers’ party set up far-reaching social policies to improve the living conditions of the working class. Financed through progressive taxes, housing played a large role. Today, the Social Democrats are still in power and social housing provision continues, albeit in a different form. Council housing construction has waned since the 1980s, and limited-profit housing has increased. A considerable amount of the financing comes from a 1% levy on the salaries of every employee in Vienna.\nA particularly striking feature of Vienna’s social housing sector is its remarkable stability. Whereas privatisation has left large dents in the sector in cities such as London, Berlin and other large cities in Europe, in Vienna, the impact has been much more moderate. In the early 2000s, the Austrian conservative/rightwing coalition government sold federally owned housing associations to financial investors, which affected the stock in Vienna. Meanwhile, in the 1990s, a right to buy was introduced by the federal government for tenants in the limited-profit housing stock.\nSo far, the impact of the programme in Vienna has remained moderate. Many tenants decided to continue renting instead. Along with new construction, this means that social housing has not declined in relative terms, but has retained a stable share of the housing market since the 1990s.\nNot all is as glorious as these points may suggest. One issue relates to the accessibility of social housing. In a system where such a large part of housing is distributed through bureaucratic means rather than through the market, allocation is a delicate matter. Applicants can sign up for a waiting list that factors in their housing need and living situation as well as income. Housing associations allocate parts of their stock through their own channel, which makes the system additionally complicated. Moreover, parts of the housing-association stock require tenant down-payments, which can be a financial barrier. Overall, the system is complex, and tends to prioritise those who know how to navigate it and those who have been living in the city for longer.\nNewcomers to the housing market can rent privately instead. This sector has, however, changed substantially over the past three decades. Formerly, commentators have referred to it as an “integration machine”, offering low-quality yet strictly regulated and therefore relatively inexpensive housing to those unable to access social housing. In the 1980s, the deterioration of the stock was considered increasingly problematic and the government deregulated the Tenancy Act to make letting more profitable. Rent-setting was made more flexible, temporary rental contracts were introduced and landlords were allowed to charge higher rents in areas with higher land prices. While the stock has since been upgraded substantially, inexpensive housing has been lost, to the disadvantage of housing newcomers who rely on it.\nOne simple takeaway from the Vienna case may be that policy matters. Through long-term commitment to social housing and limited privatisation, housing can be made better and more affordable. An even more fruitful takeaway, perhaps, may be that Vienna, through political choices, has managed to set up a regime of housing provision that prioritises housing as a basic need to a greater extent than other European cities. This regime not only includes policymakers from local to federal level, but also planning authorities, developers, landlords, housing associations, banks and construction companies among others. Understanding how this regime came into being, how it works and how it deals with challenges may be the most useful point to study for cities that want to learn from Vienna.\n-\nJustin Kadi is Assistant Professor in Planning and Housing at the Department of Land Economy, University of Cambridge", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 06:00:12 GMT", "author": "Justin Kadi", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

No one could show where the money had gone; there was no sign of the accused people developing an expensive lifestyle – most could not even afford lawyers to defend them.

It is considered in Whitehall to be giving Google “a foot in the door” as the digitisation of public services accelerates.\nHowever, the agreement prompted concerns about the precariousness of UK public data potentially being held on US servers amid the unpredictable leadership of Donald Trump.\nThe Department of Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) said Google Cloud, which provides databases, machine learning and computing power, had “agreed to work with the UK government in helping public services use advanced tech to shake off decades old ‘ball and chain’ legacy contracts which leave essential services vulnerable to cyber-attack”.\nGoogle’s services are considered more agile and efficient than traditional competitors, but there are concerns in Whitehall’s digital circles about the government becoming locked into a new kind of dependency.\nOther US tech firms including Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic have also been providing services to civil servants as they attempt to harness technology to boost the efficiency of cash-strapped public services.\nOn Wednesday, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, met two of Mark Zuckerberg’s most senior lieutenants, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, and the head of its global business group, Nicola Mendelsohn.\nDuring the pandemic in 2020, Palantir, a tech firm founded by the libertarian Trump donor Peter Thiel, provided services to the UK government for £1 and in 2023 it won a £330m deal to create a single platform for NHS data.\nDSIT also said Google DeepMind, the tech company’s AI division, which is led by the Nobel prize-winning scientist Demis Hassabis, would “collaborate with technical experts in government to support them in deploying and diffusing new emerging technologies, driving efficiencies across the public sector, including accelerating scientific discovery”.\nBut with ministers and government regulators facing pressing decisions on how to regulate AI, search, cloud computing and copyright, Martha Dark, the co-executive director of Foxglove, a non-profit organisation campaigning for fairer use of technology, said: “How is the government going to be able to hold Trump-supporting US big tech giants to any kind of serious account on this – or any other issue – after we’ve given Google the keys to the data kingdom? It’s hard to see this as anything other than dangerously naive on the part of Peter Kyle [the science and technology secretary] and government as a whole.”\nOther experts said the agreement could “entrench the market power” of a company such as Google and leave the UK government reliant on the technology from giant firms. Kyle, who announced the deal at a Google event in London on Wednesday, said “wherever possible, UK technology companies – large and small – [will] get a fair shot” at winning public tech contracts.\nThe opportunity secured by Google was not put out to public tender as no money was changing hands, a government source said. DSIT said: “These arrangements will operate in full compliance with all applicable public procurement laws, and may be subject to future commercial agreements.”\nKyle has held 11 meetings with representatives of Google since Labour took office, according to departmental registers up to the end of March.\nThe government said the agreement does not grant permission for Google to train AI models on government data or access the data for other purposes. It also said data could only be stored overseas when satisfactory legal and security measures were in place.\nGoogle said it offered clients control of where their content was stored and processed, including in partnerships with independent infrastructure providers or through “air-gapped” systems that provide an extra layer of protection.\nKyle has said he wants to “exploit the full potential of a partnership between government and Google, with much more collaboration between their UK AI lab, DeepMind, and my own AI developers”.\nThere have been signs of new technology delivering efficiencies in the public sector. A recent trial of Microsoft’s AI Copilot tool, provided with a discount, by 20,000 civil servants found it saved them 26 minutes a day on average, according to a government study, and 82% said they did not want to return to previous working practices.\nBut Imogen Parker, an associate director at the Ada Lovelace Institute, a research body focused on ensuring technology works for society, said the deal raised questions about the UK’s digital sovereignty.\n“The public needs to understand what Google is getting from this partnership and what the return will be for taxpayers in years to come,” she said. “Deals like this might look like good value for money today, but they risk lock-in tomorrow – limiting our ability to seek alternatives in future.”\nKyle has previously been accused of being too close to big tech, and he opened his speech by saying he pleaded guilty to the “crime“ of meeting tech executives far more than his predecessor, after it was reported by the Guardian.\n“I make absolutely no apologies for meeting with technology companies – that’s the job,” he said, adding that it was important for keeping children safe on social media, making sure Britain was prepared for developments at the frontier of AI, and securing better deals for the taxpayer for the billions of pounds spent every year on technology.", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 15:42:34 GMT", "author": "Robert Booth UK technology editor", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}
{"title": "Climate anxiety meant I could no longer work as a pilot. But I love flying – and I know we can transform aviation | George Hibberd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/10/pilot-climate-crisis-aviation-industry-flying", "text": "I love flying. I’ve wanted to be a pilot since I was young. I grew up in Chichester, West Sussex, under a flight path used by Gatwick airport planes, and used to watch as they traversed the sky. In 2019, once I had qualified as an airline pilot, I began working for easyJet. Aviation connected me to my extended family in Canada, exposed me to different cultures and gave me an unforgettable career. But in November 2022, I handed over my airport ID card for the last time. I had grown increasingly anxious about the effect that our industry was having on the planet and, deep down, I knew that my concern for the climate crisis meant being an airline pilot was damaging my mental health.\nDespite no longer working in the industry, my love of aviation has driven me to protect our ability to fly for future generations. It inspires me to address the uncomfortable realities and decisions our industry now faces. Everyone knows that aviation has a gigantic emissions problem. In 2022, the UK’s domestic and international flights produced 29.6m tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions, accounting for about 7% of total UK greenhouse gas emissions. This is projected to increase to 11% by 2030, because while other sectors are decarbonising, aviation emissions will remain stable or even increase.\nBut the emissions problem stems from an even bigger problem. One report looked at emissions reduction and efficiency targets set by individual aviation companies over the past 25 years; all but one were missed and quietly abandoned. The industry knows that it’s a big contributor to the climate crisis, but decisions are made within power structures and processes that have failed to address these problems.\nAirlines fight to outcompete each other on profit. They lobby governments to avoid the measures that we need to reduce emissions and protect the industry long-term. Meanwhile, governments have done little to regulate this aspect of the industry. This same short-term thinking is reflected in unions that support airport expansion in a bid to protect jobs and livelihoods. Unions have historically done a very good job at challenging employers over pay deals and terms and conditions. But in the aviation industry, unions are guilty of the same short-term thinking as employers.\nThere are plenty of ideas for how we create an aviation industry that’s fit for the future, starting with a non-negotiable emissions budget that would set limits on the total amount of greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide aviation can produce. We will also need aviation to pay its fair share in tax (currently, jet fuel is tax free). The government could introduce a frequent flyer levy, so those who use aviation the most (ie the very wealthy) would pay a tax to help fund the research and development of low-carbon technologies, which in turn could help to create more skilled jobs. In the future, a long-haul journey might comprise multiple, slower hops in a low-carbon hybrid electric aircraft, while shorter, essential flights, such as those to and from Scottish islands, could be taken in small electric aircraft.\nThe problem isn’t a lack of options. The industry is full of highly skilled and motivated people who want to do good in the world. It’s that the industry suffers from a crisis of imagination. There are two prevailing visions for the future of aviation, neither of which are compelling. Industry leaders want eternal growth, relying on speculative technologies and unproven carbon capture. Climate activists and advocates want an immediate reduction in air travel. While aviation workers can often see right through the former vision, the latter is hardly inspiring.\nI was determined to do something about this, so in the spring of 2020 I joined Safe Landing, a community of aviation workers who want the industry to do better for the climate. We have been running workers’ assemblies that invite aviation workers to grapple with these issues which have been mostly neglected by politics. We want these to serve as an example to the government and also unions, which could commission their own assemblies to give workers a voice in how our industry will have to change. One of the most damaging ways to tackle the climate crisis is by forcing policies on people. Workers’ assemblies can bridge social divides, give people agency and control over their lives, and rebuild trust in politics.\nThere are so many ideas for how we could improve the future of flying. But first, we need to get to the heart of the power problem and start making decisions differently, both as an industry and as a country. Workers’ assemblies have to be part of the answer.\n-\nGeorge Hibberd is a former airline pilot and now works with aviation workers in Safe Landing to run workers’ assemblies.

{"title": "Cosy video games are on an unstoppable rise. Will they unleash a darker side?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/10/cosy-video-games-non-violent-cooking-farming-cozy", "text": "In 2017, a game design thinktank called Project Horseshoe gathered a group of developers together to define the concept of cosiness in video games. Games, of course, have had non-violent elements since the medium was invented. Early life simulators such as 1985’s Little Computer People, a low-stakes game in which the player interacts with a man living his unremarkable life in a house, could fit the bill; then there was the proliferation of social farming simulations after 1996’s chibi-adorable Harvest Moon.\nBut the resulting report, Coziness in Games: An Exploration of Safety, Softness, and Satisfied Needs, is probably the first organised effort to define a then-emerging genre. The group zeroed in on three core things: safety, abundance, and softness. Cosy games (cozy in US spelling) don’t have high-risk scenarios: “There is no impending loss of threat,” they wrote. They must have a sense of abundance: “Nothing is lacking, pressing or imminent.” And a soft aesthetic wraps everything up like a warm hug.\nTake developer Witch Beam’s puzzle game Unpacking, for example, which tells a story as the player takes things out of boxes and puts them into different houses. There are limitations to where you can put things: it’s a puzzle game, after all. But there’s no timer, no scoring system, no punishments for placing something wrong. And colorful pixel art brings it all together.\nProject Horseshoe’s definition came alongside the launch of the Nintendo Switch in 2017, a handheld console designed to be cosied up with on the couch, and at that time the genre was experiencing huge growth. By 2019, indie game designer Matthew Taylor had started a Twitter account – called Wholesome Games – to highlight games that fitted the definition. Eventually, Wholesome Games (led by Taylor and partners Jenny Windom, James Tillman and Victoria Tran) grew into a community that hosted showcases full of cute and non-threatening games, and it has now become a company that publishes them.\nThe success of Wholesome Games mirrors the immense growth of the genre as a whole. The first Wholesome Direct was broadcast in 2020, as the cosy genre began to explode during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns (thanks in no small part to Nintendo’s chill island escape Animal Crossing: New Horizons), and had 25,000 viewers, Tillman claims. The most recent Wholesome Direct, which debuted in June, reached 5 million people.\nYou can see this trend on Steam, where more and more games are tagged with the “cozy” moniker. In 2020, just 15 games on Steam were released with the cozy tag attached, according to SteamDB. That number more than doubled in 2021, with 39 games, then doubled again in 2022, with 85. And then, the explosion: 373 games were tagged cozy in 2024 – more than one released per day on Steam. Every time the genre seems to have reached its peak, it rises higher. There are massive commercial hits, too: Animal Crossing sold nearly 50m, more than any game in the Call of Duty military shooter series. Famous farming game Stardew Valley, meanwhile, has sold 41m.\nKelly Boudreau, associate professor of game studies and design programme lead at Harrisburg University, says that cosy games aren’t just a genre, but an “ideological shift in game design – something that can be powerful in order to express different themes and play experiences.” You can see this in the diversity of experiences that cosy games offer. A Little to the Left and Unpacking are wildly different games about organising household items; A Short Hike is about a summer vacation stroll up a mountain; Spiritfarer is a comforting management simulator about death and grief, and Venba is an emotional story about nostalgia and cooking Tamil cuisine.\nMore recently, darker games have also been considered cosy: Strange Horticulture has the player running a shop selling – sometimes – poisonous plants, while Dredge adds a horror narrative on top of traditionally low-stakes fishing and sailing. “At the core of it, these games are joyful, hopeful, and compassionate,” says Wholesome Games partner Windom. “When people play them, we want them to feel a sense of warmth and a sense of safety. But that definition has expanded to include games that, perhaps, deal with uncomfortable or uncosy topics, but within the realm of safety.”\nRhea Gupte and Prateek Saxena of India-based imissmyfriends.studio did not set out to make a cosy game, but their debut, Fishbowl, is certainly one. Fishbowl stars Alo, a 21-year-old woman who’s just moved to a new city for a job as a video editor. Then the pandemic lockdowns begin, as she grieves the death of her grandmother. Despite the weighty topics, you can see the cosy everywhere in Fishbowl – in the meticulously designed colour palette, the intricate and detailed pixel art, and the soft, comforting sound design.\n“We started off with the themes and the story and what we wanted to express,” writer and art director Gupte says. “Thinking about the design and overall feel of the game, it felt as if it needed a comforting atmosphere, otherwise it was going to become super heavy and difficult to play through. We wanted to have that sort of melancholy yet levity in the game.”\nCosy as a genre is evolving, and part of that is an understanding that cosy feels different for everyone. Still, not every non-violent game can be called cosy, Boudreau stresses: “It’s not valuable to stick that tag on everything, because it becomes meaningless.”\nFishbowl is not a cosy game in the way that Stardew Valley is, where players dream of an idyllic life on a farm. Gupte and Saxena spoke about the distance between how farming and agriculture are portrayed in games and what they are like in reality: “In India, agriculture is a very scary part of people’s lives,” Saxena said. “There’s a game from India called The Palace on the Hill, where the main character has to do farming to repay their debt. It’s a reverse cosy game. But in a different world, [farming] is considered a more laid-back life.”\nToem, a contemplative photography game released in 2021 by developer Something We Made, is another extension of the genre. Though it’s unequivocally a cosy game, it’s lacking something the genre is known for: a colour palette. Toem is rendered entirely in black and white. Monochrome can look harsh, Toem developer Lucas Gullbo says. But Toem isn’t harsh; the use of gradients and a soft aesthetic keeps the game from having “the emotional feeling of being black and white.”\nWhere does cosy go from here? Over the past year, idle games have emerged as a subsector of the genre: low-stakes affairs such as Cornerpond, in which you fish from your desktop; Ropuka’s Idle Island, where you chill with a frog; and Bao Bao’s Cozy Laundromat, where you build a launderette. These games have many of the traditional trappings of cosy – the abundance of farming and resource collection paired with cute, colourful graphics – but crucially, you barely have to do much. There’s stuff you can do, such as decorating or small mini-games, but nothing you have to do. The game can – and will – go on without you, and this is a big part of the appeal. Is there something inherently cosy about idleness? As the genre grows, there’s much to explore.\n“In the cosy, wholesome realm – but just in games in general – it’s such a young medium that we’re still discovering genres and mechanics,” Windom says. “And it’s rare when we do see something really novel come up. It felt to a lot of people, when wholesome games and cosy games emerged, that it was something they had never considered before. Instead of shooting in first-person, why don’t we take a photograph? These shifts happen. We’re still discovering what we can do with games.”", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 10:02:16 GMT", "author": "Nicole Carpenter", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

At the same time, the hospitality sector has called on ministers to tackle “eye-watering” costs.\nThe British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), which represents more than 20,000 pubs in the UK, said it expects 378 to close this year in England, Scotland and Wales, at a cost of 5,600 jobs.\nThis would mark an increase on last year’s 350 closures, continuing a long-term trend that has made more than 15,000 pubs call last orders once and for all since 2000.\nThe BBPA singled out business rates as one of the hardest costs for the industry to bear, but said that it was “not too late” for the government to reform the tax.\nBusiness rates are based on a property’s “rateable value”, an estimate by the Valuation Office Agency of how much it would cost to rent the premises.\nPubs’ business rates tend to be disproportionately high in relation to their financial viability because pubs often occupy high-value buildings, while being run on very tight profit margins.\nThe BBPA also highlighted other costs affecting the UK’s 45,000 pubs, including beer duty and VAT, which it said meant £1 in every £4 spent on beer went directly to the Treasury.\nEstablishments have also been hit by the government’s decision to increase employers’ national insurance contributions (NICs), and new waste disposal rules that the BBPA says effectively double-charge pubs for glass bottle recycling.\nThese extended producer responsibility (EPR) obligations cost the sector an additional £60m a year, according to BBPA estimates.\nEmma McClarkin, the chief executive of the BBPA, said: “Pubs are trading well but most of the money that goes into the till goes straight back out in bills and taxes. For many it’s impossible to make a profit, which all too often leads to pubs turning off the lights for the last time.\n“However, it’s not too late to change this sad state of affairs. We know government recognises the economic and social value of pubs and we’re not asking for special treatment, we just want the sector’s rich potential unleashed.\n“We’re calling on government to proceed with meaningful business rates reform, mitigate these eye-watering new employment and EPR costs, and cut beer duty.”\nSeparately, in a select committee hearing on Wednesday, hospitality bosses also raised concerns about soaring energy costs.\nDavid Wigham, the commercial director of Admiral Taverns, which runs more than 1,600 pubs in the UK, said energy costs were still up to double the level before the energy crisis unleashed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nPaul Wilson, the policy director for the Federation of Small Businesses, said hospitality was particularly vulnerable to high energy bills due to customers’ resistance to higher prices; low levels of energy efficiency across the sector; and a lack of cash reserves after the Covid pandemic.\nThe BBPA has previously advocated for capping the sector’s energy bills during periods of high prices.\nWhile pubs have struggled with long-term cost pressures, recent warm weather has lured more drinkers to the beer garden, according to the pub chain Young’s.\nOn Wednesday, it reported 7% sales growth at established sites for the first 14 weeks of its financial year, as a warm spring and early summer helped support demand.\n“We remain confident about the year ahead, despite the well-publicised challenges faced by our industry,” the company said.\nYoung’s, which operates mostly in the south of England, previously forecast an £11m rise in its annual costs after increases to the minimum wage and employer’s NICs.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 05:00:11 GMT", "author": "Rob Davies", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

As part of the EU’s preparedness strategy, officials are working out what governments should stockpile and how to bolster readiness for a health emergency, such as a pandemic, antimicrobial resistance, chemical, nuclear or biological threats.\nThe plans reflect lessons from the Covid pandemic, when EU member states scrambled to secure masks and other medical kit for themselves, leaving shortages for those most in need. They are also inspired by a handful of EU governments – named by the commission as Finland, Estonia and the Czech Republic – that are known to stockpile goods.\nThe EU should have regularly updated non-exhaustive lists of essential goods tailored to different crises, according to the strategy. By 2026 the EU intends to set up a critical raw materials centre to jointly buy such goods on behalf of interested companies, which could also be tasked with organising stockpiles. By the same year, the EU will have a list of medicines and medical technologies to be prioritised for stockpiling or joint procurement.\nA loan scheme backed by the European Investment Bank to encourage small companies and startups to develop innovative medicines and medical technologies will have its budget doubled to €200m by 2027.\nThe bloc is also working to develop a wastewater monitoring system that would “act like an early warning radar” to detect infectious diseases before symptoms appear. During the pandemic, public health experts said sewage samples provided a cost-effective way of assessing health threats.\nThe EU already has a fleet of firefighting planes and helicopters, medical evacuation planes, medical equipment and field hospitals. As the European wildfire season intensifies, with firefighters still battling the flames on the outskirts of Marseille on Wednesday, the commission said additional helicopters or light planes would be needed to protect areas newly threatened by wildfire.\nThe EU commissioner for crisis management, Hadja Lahbib, said: “We know the threats we face … hybrid attacks, power blackouts, extreme weather and spreading diseases. These are no longer distant risks. That is why we are moving preparedness from the sidelines to the frontline of our defence.”\nThe latest strategy comes after the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, reiterated her view that the EU should be ready to defend itself by 2030. “Russia’s military rearming means that they could – within two to five years – pose a credible military threat to Europe and Nato,” she told the European parliament on Tuesday.", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 12:10:13 GMT", "author": "Jennifer Rankin in Brussels", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

Where it is, the cause is not just cosmetic, it is economic. Policies relating to shopfronts, rents or parking miss the bigger picture.\n“City centres that struggle are oversupplied with shops and undersupplied with people. If local residents don’t have money to spend or a reason to be in the centre, high streets suffer – no matter what interventions are made.”\nIn more affluent areas, for example, high streets have been able to shift towards dining and drinking and other leisure activities as a portion of traditional shopping activity has shifted online, because residents have spare cash to spend on non-essentials.\nIn poorer areas where fewer people live in the city centre, the lack of spending power means this shift has not happened and funding is needed to bring people back.\n“A struggling high street is the outcome of a struggling [local] economy, not the other way round,” the report said.\nIn more affluent York, London and Edinburgh, about £1 in every £4 is spent on dining out and relatively few stores are empty – just over 9%. In London, the vacancy rate was 7.4%. However in Bradford, Stoke and Wigan – which are among the locations with the highest vacancy rates – it is about £1 in every £10 and vacancy rates are more than 16%.\nThe spending power of a local population is not just measured by high-paying jobs but also the number of people in a catchment compared with the size of a high street.\nStruggling Newport, Blackpool and Sunderland also have a relatively high proportion of shops for the population compared with successful city centres such as Oxford, Brighton or Liverpool.\nWhile York has a relatively high proportion of shops for its population, it also enjoys a strong tourist trade, something which not all cities will be able to develop.\nThe report also found that some locations – such as around Swindon and Slough – had a strong local economy, but shops struggled as consumers predominantly worked at out of town business parks.\nThe British Retail Consortium, which represents most large retailers, said: “City centres need a mix of businesses uses including shopping and hospitality, that make a city a place that people want to be.\n“However, investment in city centres continues to be held back by outdated business rates system which limits the ability to invest in shops and jobs which are vital for the everyday economy.”", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 23:01:03 GMT", "author": "Sarah Butler", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

Three cost more than the purported psychological £10 “maximum price” that many are willing to pay for a takeaway lunch.\nWith growing numbers of employers increasing their office attendance requirements, the “grab and go” lunch market is bigger business than it has been in recent years.\nPret’s new Super Plates salad range will be available at more than 250 shops nationwide from Wednesday, and the priciest of the four is the “miso salmon” version, which includes roasted salmon, avocado, black rice and quinoa, broccoli and edamame soya beans. This will cost “from £12.95”, which presumably reflects the fact that those eating in rather than taking away typically pay more because of VAT, but may also be linked to the differing prices across its outlets.\nThe starting prices for the other three salads, centred on chipotle chicken, butternut squash and shawarma chicken, are £9.95 or £10.95.\nIt is understood Pret’s most expensive takeaway salad until now was a salmon and mango one that can be picked up in at least some central London outlets for £7.95.\nWeighing in at about 450 grams-plus, Pret said the new items were almost 60% larger on average than its existing salad range and “will meet the growing demand we are seeing for more substantial, protein-rich salads”.\nA spokesperson for Pret said the use of more premium ingredients “reflects the growing trend of workers ‘treating’ themselves to a more filling lunch the days they are in the office”.\nIngredients used include “hand-massaged kale”. Asked what that meant, the chain said: “Our kale comes destemmed and sliced and is lovingly hand-massaged by our teams in our iconic French dressing for 45 seconds in our shop kitchens. This helps to soften the kale and keeps the minerals and nutrients in.”\nAfter years of cost of living pressures that millions are still facing and that have resulted in retailers battling to win over price-conscious shoppers, it may seem counterintuitive for a major chain to focus on a range where the prices are several pounds above what people typically pay. However, Pret is continuing a trend begun by the supermarkets, which have increasingly been launching pricier “premium” lunchtime meal deals that sit alongside their standard offerings. Pay a bit more and you can now grab a poké pot, a pack of baos or a Mexican burrito bowl instead of a prawn mayo sandwich or pasta salad.\nSome of this may be because of hybrid working, with many workers seemingly happy to spend more on an office-day lunch because they are “saving” money on the days when they are at home and can have something out of the fridge.\nThe retail industry publication The Grocer has talked of “an increasing willingness to spend among hybrid workers”, while the high street sushi chain Itsu has previously highlighted how those splitting their time between the office and home “are willing to spend more on lunchtime food-to-go occasions”.\nThe enthusiasm among some workers for more premium offerings may also be a response to concern about ultra-processed foods.", "published": "Tue, 08 Jul 2025 17:52:57 GMT", "author": "Rupert Jones", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}
{"title": "The CEO who never was: how Linda Yaccarino was set up to fail at Elon Musk’s X", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/10/linda-yaccarino-resigns-x-elon-musk", "text": "In May 2023, when Linda Yaccarino, an NBC advertising executive, joined what was then still known as Twitter, she was given a tall order: repair the company’s relationship with advertisers after a chaotic year of being owned by Elon Musk. But just weeks after she became CEO, Musk posted an antisemitic tweet that drove away major brands such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, Comcast, Lionsgate and Warner Bros Discovery to pause their advertising on the platform. Musk delivered an apology for the tweet later at a conference – which he called the worst post he’s ever done – but it came with a message to advertisers, specifically the Disney CEO Bob Iger: “Go fuck yourselves.” Yaccarino was in the audience of the conference.\n“I don’t want them to advertise,” he said. “If someone is going to blackmail me with advertising or money, go fuck yourself. Go. Fuck. Yourself,” he said. “Is that clear? Hey Bob, if you’re in the audience, that’s how I feel.”\nIn the two years since, Yaccarino has had to contend with the unpredictability of Musk, ongoing content moderation and hate speech issues on the platform, increasingly strained relationships with advertisers and widespread backlash her boss received for his role in Donald Trump’s administration. Her response in some cases was to remain silent; in others, she chose to defend the company. Through it all, however, experts say it was clear Yaccarino was the chief executive in title only.\n“The reality is that Elon Musk is and always has been at the helm of X,” said Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester VP. “It was clear from the start that she was being set up to fail by a limited scope as the company’s chief executive. Her background and actual authority positioned her more as the company’s chief advertising officer, rather than its CEO.”\nEven in her de facto role as a chief advertising officer, Musk’s incessant posting, impulsive decision making and obsession with X and other platforms becoming too “woke” posed huge obstacles for Yaccarino.\n“The only thing that’s surprising about Linda Yaccarino’s resignation is that it didn’t come sooner,” said Proulx.\nThis week alone, Grok, the AI chatbot integrated with X, posted several antisemitic remarks, including some praising Hitler, after the company included new guidelines for the chatbot. In guidelines xAI published, Grok had been instructed not to “shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated”. xAI removed that guideline from its code on Tuesday evening.\nYaccarino’s tenure as CEO of X was not only bookended with antisemitism scandals – Musk’s and Grok’s offensive tweets – but was also punctuated with several accusations of antisemitism against her boss throughout her short stint. In 2023, the non-profit watchdog Center for Countering Digital Hate published a report on the prevalence of hate speech, both antisemitic and otherwise, on X as well as the lack of moderation. The company’s response was to sue the organization; the suit was ultimately dismissed. Similarly, the non-profit Media Matters for America highlighted the appearance of pro-Nazi tweets alongside branded advertisements in a report that preceded a mass advertiser exodus from the social network. X sued Media Matters.\nMost notably, Musk was accused of doing back-to-back Nazi salutes at a Trump inauguration rally at the start of 2025. Musk brushed aside the allegations that it was a Nazi salute and posted several Nazi puns on X. At the time, Yaccarino provided no additional comment, but posted a laughing face emoji in response to Musk’s jokes. Musk’s salute and the ensuing backlash was one of several moments that solidified the overall rightward shift of the social network as droves of users began to flock to alternative platforms like Bluesky, and even Reddit communities began banning X links.\nPromises of an X revitalization\nWhen Yaccarino joined X, she set about courting celebrities and partnerships to reinvigorate the social network’s brand and repair relationships that Musk’s contentious takeover had damaged. Musk had long talked of making X into an “everything app” that would integrate payments, AI, messaging, livestreaming and other new features alongside the social network’s public posting, another task given to Yaccarino.\nYaccarino led a delegation of executives, including Musk himself, to meet with industry leaders at the Cannes Lions festival in 2023, and began seeking media figures who could feature on the platform.\nOne of Yaccarino’s moves toward making the platform into what she described as a “global town square” was reaching out to the former CNN host Don Lemon to start a show on X, much as the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson had agreed to put his content on site. Lemon’s first interview for the platform was with Musk, in what was intended to be a showcase of how X was shifting and bringing in big-name creators. The plan backfired after Lemon’s interview with Musk grew heated over questions about the billionaire’s drug use, which was quickly followed by Musk telling Lemon’s agent that his contract was canceled. Future shows with big-name creators never materialized.\nIn the ensuing two years, rather than become a destination for mainstream talent, a streaming powerhouse or the “everything app” that Yaccarino promoted, X has largely become a megaphone for Musk to air his grievances, boost and then feud with Trump, and promote his companies. Far-right influencers, porn spambots and meme accounts proliferate, while many media outlets have deprioritized the platform or left it altogether. Misinformation and extremism are rampant, sometimes coming from Musk himself.\nThe day before Yaccarino resigned, X became involved in a scandal that epitomized much of what the platform has become. Musk had recently posted that he would be reconfiguring xAI’s chatbot, Grok, because he did not agree with the responses it was generating. On Tuesday, users noticed that the chatbot had begun to reply to queries with blatantly antisemitic posts praising Nazi ideology. A flood of users began posting more screenshots of Grok posting rape fantasies, identifying itself as “MechaHitler” and promoting conspiracies before the company removed the posts.\nIncidents like Grok’s foray into Nazism are some of the many reasons Yaccarino’s goal of revitalizing X has sputtered. Although she succeeded in courting a number of major companies to begin advertising again last year, at a time when Musk’s connections to the White House were strongest, the platform’s ad revenues have never reached anywhere near their pre-Musk levels, according to the research firm Emarketer. The platform also resorted to threats of lawsuits against major companies such as Verizon if they did not buy advertising on the site, according to a Wall Street Journal report that Yaccarino has denied.\nAfter more than two years of Yaccarino running damage control for her boss and the platform’s myriad issues, Musk issued only a brief statement acknowledging she was stepping down.\n“Thank you for your contributions,” Musk responded to Yaccarino’s post announcing her resignation. Minutes later, he began sending replies to other posts about SpaceX, artificial intelligence and how his chatbot became a Nazi.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 09:00:15 GMT", "author": "Johana Bhuiyan and Nick Robins-Early", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

He is undocumented, and did not provide his full name.\nWhen Donald Trump returned to office in January, Rogelio said his employers cut their rates by 30% to 40%. Other laborers told him they had endured similar treatment.\n“They decreased the pay by piece because they know most of the tile setters don’t have social security numbers, so they take advantage of that. We are in their hands,” Rogelio told the Guardian. “It’s more work, less pay. We have no choice right now.\n“We’re struggling with bills. We’re struggling with food. We’re struggling with everything because we don’t get enough money to pay whatever we need to pay.”\nMany of the undocumented immigrants Rogelio knows are only leaving home to work, Rogelio said. “We have a lot of fear,” he told the Guardian. “We look for news in the morning to see if we’re able to go to work or not.”\nWith approximately 2.9 million US construction workers – about 34% of the workforce – foreign-born, construction sector lobbyists have publicly urged the Trump administration to soften their hardline stance on immigration. “While the need for safe and secure borders is paramount, mass deportation is not the answer,” Buddy Hughes, chairperson of the National Association of Home Builders, said in a statement.\nAdvocates for workers rights say some operators in the sector are using Trump’s crackdown to abuse undocumented workers.\n“Especially in construction, there’re a lot of subcontractors that take advantage of this situation by not paying them the fair wage or not even paying them at all,” said Laura Becerra, movement politics director of the non-profit Workers Defense Project based in Texas.\nUndocumented workers are unlikely to lodge an official complaint, she added. “Since people don’t want to say anything because they don’t want to be put on the radar, and they’re also getting retaliated against if they do say something.”\nThe administration is pushing ahead with public raids on undocumented immigrant workers. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency is arresting an increasing number of immigrants without any criminal history, according to a Guardian analysis of federal government data.\n“It’s an attack,” Becerra said. “It’s taking a toll on families, families that need to make ends meet, that are already suffering from low wages and doing work no one wants to do.”\nIn Tucson, undocumented workers are avoiding freeways, according to Rogelio. “Freeways are one of the worst places to drive right now because of all the police and border patrol and they look for mostly hispanic people to stop,” he said. “We are living day by day and not knowing what’s going to happen tomorrow.”\nIn some areas “there are spots where you can work with no problem,” he said. “But others, there are racist people living there and they don’t want us. They want our work, they want cheap labor, but they don’t want us.\n“We came here because we want to work and provide for our families. The only reason I’m here, personally, I have two kids who are American citizens. I’m not asking for any benefits from the government.”\nReports from across the US suggest undocumented workers are facing unprecedented pressure.\nSavannah Palmira, director of organizing for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades district council 5, which covers workers in states around the Pacific north-west, said the threat of raids is making it harder for workers to organize.\nA roofing company in Washington was raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) earlier this year after workers filed safety complaints, Palmira claimed, with the fear of retaliation stemming from that case spreading to other job sites, and leaving workers reluctant to speak out and file complaints against abusive work practices.\n“What contractors are doing is taking an opportunity to not be held accountable for their bad practices,” said Palmira. “The more and more people are starting to talk about workers getting taken advantage of, Ice is getting called on them. They’re taking a tool away from us to be able to put bad contractors on notice.”\nIn Washington, another undocumented construction worker – who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation – said many of his coworkers were “thinking about going back to their countries” due to the reality of life in the US.\n“The last company I worked for took advantage of people in every situation,” he said, from dissuading injured workers from getting medical attention to denying overtime and breaks.\n“They say, you are undocumented, so they will pay you $10 an hour because you have no work permit,” he added. “And if not, they will tell Ice.”\n“In Washington state, immigrants make up 25% of the trades workforce in construction. With a consistent labor shortage and demand for housing constantly growing, residential construction needs all the skilled workers available,” a spokesperson for the Building Industry Association of Washington said in an email. “We’ve provided our members with guidance on how to legally employ immigrants, including verifying the identity and US employment authorization of all employees. We also generally support improving US Immigration policy to allow responsible and law-abiding undocumented worker a pathway to achieving citizenship.”\nArizona Builders Alliance did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\nOn a national level the construction industry has repeatedly warned of the negative impacts of immigration raids on what they claim has already been a severe labor shortage in US construction.\nAsked about contractors allegedly using the ramp up in immigration enforcement to cut pay and increase workloads, the National Association of Home Builders issued a statement from Hughes, its chairperson, which did not directly address the claims.\n“With the construction industry facing a deficit of more than 200,000 workers, policymakers must consider that any disruption to the labor force would raise housing costs, limit supply and worsen the nation’s housing affordability crisis,” Hughes said. “To address this pressing national issue, NAHB is urging Congress to support meaningful investments in our nation’s education system to encourage students to pursue careers in the skilled trades.\n“Policymakers should also support sensible immigration policies that preserve and expand existing temporary work visa programs while also creating new market-based visa programs that will accurately match demand with available labor.”", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 11:00:48 GMT", "author": "Michael Sainato", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

Parmod Kalia was also among the 59 people the report identifies as having been driven to contemplate killing themselves.\n“I attempted to commit suicide a number of times until I was helped,” he said. “There was a point too when my marriage was under strain as well, but hopefully we’re rebuilding bridges again, and trying to make up for lost time, for the lost years.”\nAttending the publication of the report at the Oval in London, Kalia welcomed the findings of the inquiry chair, Sir Wyn Williams, that Post Office bosses should have known their Horizon IT software was faulty but “maintained the fiction that its data was always accurate”.\nYet the former post office operator – one of about 1,000 convicted of offences including theft, false accounting and fraud, based on faulty computer data between 1999 and 2015 – suggested the Post Office was still dragging its feet and “playing dirty tricks” on the topic of compensation.\n“As far as the Post Office is concerned, I think it would still be better if someone spoke to me face to face, looked me in the eye and just acknowledged and accepted they have done wrong, and continue to do so,” he said.\n“That could be due to an institutional issue, but I think it could also be a personal grudge as well against me, as one of the original people who went to court and sought to challenge them. It’s a case of: ‘How dare we?’ And it hangs over me every day.”\nFor those survivors in attendance, the memories of the roughly 350 people who died before this day came weighed heavily, including 13 who it is believed may have taken their own lives.\n“We’ve lost so many people along the way and we think of them all the time, even on days like this, which is a good day, but it’s why I would urge government to act on this report’s findings as soon as possible as we’re not getting any younger,” said Seema Misra, a former Surrey post office operator who was wrongly jailed while pregnant.\nMisra said she and fellow victims of the scandal had been impressed by Williams’s work, even if they wanted to see firmer deadlines for the compensation that remained unpaid for many. “There are more reports coming but this does at least feel like the beginning of the end.”\nScott Darlington, a branch owner-operator in Cheshire whose suspended prison sentence for false accounting has been quashed, raised an eyebrow at the finding that the government and Post Office should make a public announcement defining the phrase “full and fair financial redress”.\n“It’s a scathing report, but I think it could have been more scathing to be honest. Does it really take five years to come up with a definition of what is ‘full and fair’?” says Darlington, who is still waiting for compensation.\n“I just basically want everything that I’ve lost, not an offer on what they are prepared to do … If it was in America we’d all be getting tens of millions of pounds a year, but we just want what we deserve for what we have been put through, no less.”\nDarlington said he had “speed-read” parts of the report and would look over it later, but for now the day was about coming together with what has come to be almost a surrogate family. “Over the years we’ve made deep friendships, so it’s nice to see everyone again and feel at least that we might be heading towards some kind of final resolution,” he said.\nAsked about Paula Vennells, who was the chief executive of the Post Office between 2012 and 2019 and is a central figure in the scandal, Darlington said he wasn’t sure how much she featured in the minds of victims. “Everybody is still hoping that she has to pay for it really, and not just her. I mean, there’s plenty of people across all the teams. The tentacles go far and wide as far as people who were complicit.”\nJo Hamilton, one of the best-known victims of the scandal, was glowing about the report.\n“Oh, it’s a very good piece of work and there’s a finger wag from Sir Wyn at the government, I think, because it is effectively in charge of all the schemes now. Five years on, he’s just told them to define ‘full and fair’ because obviously what we think is full and fair isn’t what they think is full and fair, and they have until 10 October to define that.”\n“When you’ve had your claim professionally worked out and they just come back to you with the most ridiculous offer, it’s incredible,” said Hamilton, who was wrongly accused of stealing more than £36,000 from the post office branch she was in charge of at the time in South Warnborough, Hampshire. To avoid a jail sentence, she pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of false accounting, and was prosecuted in 2006.\nHamilton has now at last been paid in full, after settling at 80% of what she had claimed for before it was topped up, but she is resolute about continuing the struggle on behalf of others. “I’m still fighting for everybody … I still can’t shut the Post Office out of my life until everyone is paid.”\nOne line in particular jumped out of the report for Hamilton, where Williams wrote of how the problems with the Horizon IT system would have been no secret at various levels of the company.\n“I am satisfied from the evidence that I have heard that a number of senior, and not so senior, employees of the Post Office knew or, at the very least, should have known that Legacy Horizon was capable of error,” wrote the inquiry chair.\nFor Hamilton, this brought great satisfaction. “To me, it means everybody. I really picked it out. They can’t all have been ignorant of what was going on and it went from the foot soldiers all the way up. I think the next part, when comes to any criminal proceedings, could be very interesting.”\n-\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

{"title": "China’s coal heartland fighting for a greener future", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/09/chinas-coal-heartland-fighting-for-a-greener-future", "text": "Deep in the recesses of an underground cavern, covered in dust and soot, Xu Xiaobo wondered why, having recently graduated with a degree in mechanics, he was on his hands and knees sifting through layers of coal sludge. But there was no time to ponder the ancestral forces that had brought him down into one of his province’s oldest mines. There was coal to dig for.\nNew to the job, keeping up with colleagues was challenging. As he tried to crawl at speed under a conveyor belt of coal, he landed badly and sprained his wrist. He still can’t rotate it properly.\nXu was desperate to leave the mine. He applied for scores of jobs, but along with millions of other young people who graduated during the pandemic, he discovered that few places were hiring. One company offered him a job on the other side of the country but it was too far from his family.\n“When I first graduated, I had big dreams, maybe a bit too ambitious,” the 26-year-old said, sitting outside the coal mine in the ancient city of Datong, Shanxi province, where he still works. Eventually he managed to transfer to a job in administration. “I hate the job of coal digging,” he said, his gleaming white Reeboks testament to the fact that he is now able to work above ground.\nNow, though, as China charges down the path of modernisation and away from the coal mines that powered the first few millennia of the country’s rise, Xu has found what he thinks is a brighter future in his home province of Shanxi. He’s finding part-time work as a tour guide. “I truly love my hometown and hope that more people can see it – not just as a place full of coal dust and heavy pollution,” Xu said.\nXu’s personal journey is one that Shanxi, China’s top coal producing province, wants to mimic on a grand scale. But the challenge is immense. With the lowest GDP growth in the country and a local economy that is heavily reliant on China’s most polluting resource, Shanxi’s fate in China’s green future is uncertain.\nChina has pledged to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Many experts believe that, thanks to the rapid growth of clean energy systems, China’s emissions will peak ahead of schedule, possibly as soon as this year. Now, as China’s policymakers develop the 15th five year plan, the economic and planning document that will lay out the priorities for the period between 2026 and 2030, analysts are watching closely to see how China’s green agenda will be balanced against social and economic concerns.\nIn April, Xi Jinping, China’s leader, said: “No matter how the international situation changes, China will not slow down its efforts to address climate change”. He also spoke of the need for a “fair transition”. That question is of particular importance to the 35 million people of Shanxi.\n*****\nShanxi is at the heart of a transition that will have global, existential ramifications. In 2024, it produced 1.27bn tonnes of coal, more than India. If Shanxi was a country, it would be the second-biggest coal producer in the world, after China. That coal was dug up to feed a country whose energy demands are growing rapidly each year – at a pace that, until recently, the increases in renewable capacity have struggled to keep up with. Coal is by far the largest source of CO2 emissions from fuel in China. According to the World Bank, the transition from coal to clean energy is “the most important climate change mitigation action in the world.”\nIn recent years, China’s build-up of renewable energy has accelerated at a rate that has stunned even the most optimistic environmentalists. China is building more wind and solar power than the rest of the world combined, and in April its wind and solar power generation capacity surged to nearly 1,500 GW, exceeding fossil-fuel power for the first time. Recent analysis suggests that China’s CO2 emissions are in decline, at least for now.\nBut China’s leaders have pledged, repeatedly, that coal will continue to have a supporting role in China’s energy system. And when it comes to actual power generation in China’s energy mix, coal still accounts for nearly 60%, according to data from Ember, an energy think tank. This year’s government work report pledged to “increase coal production and supply capacity”, something that many in China’s system see as essential to ensuring energy security.\nThe spectre of blackouts, which paralysed parts of China in 2021 and 2022, haunt local officials. A lack of air conditioning in China’s scorching summers can be fatal to the elderly and vulnerable, while industry grinds to a halt without electricity. People familiar with the conversations happening inside China’s planning offices say that the recent power outages in Iberia were pointed to as an example of the perils of over-reliance on seasonally unstable renewable energy. The government has not announced a clear timeline for coal phase out. “In every document on realising the dual carbon goals, and realising the energy transition, there is some kind of role or carveout for the coal industry,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, the co-founder of Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a think tank.\nNevertheless, with improvements in battery storage technology and power grid modernisation, the direction of travel away from coal seems clear. Prices are already in decline, as are coal imports.\n“As soon as China starts to reduce its coal reliance, Shanxi province is going to be more directly hit,” said Tom Wang, a Shanxi native and climate activist. He fears the consequences of mass unemployment. “A machine can sit around getting rusty. But a person will have to be fed. A person will have a family to support … It’s about survival. It’s about how you can live with dignity”.\nEverywhere you look in Shanxi, there is coal. Mines dot the arid landscape. Lumbering coal trucks share the highways with sleek new electric vehicles. In Taiyuan, Shanxi’s capital, there is even a coal-themed cafe, selling coal-inspired drinks and cutesy anthropomorphised lumps of coal. “It represents Shanxi,” explains the young barista. “As long as the rest of the country needs it, we will provide it”.\nAround one in ten people in the province are employed in coal and related industries. “My grandfather, my father, my maternal grandmother, and even my aunt – they all work in the coal industry. They don’t want to see the coal enterprises shut down,” Xu said.\nThe world is littered with communities that have been left behind by modernisation. When towns in the Appalachian mountain range in the US lost hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the 1990s and 2000s – a process which accelerated when China joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001 – opioid-related deaths increased significantly.\nAnd China has its own examples, too.\nThe provinces of north-east China, known collectively as Dongbei, saw widespread factory closures in the 1990s when China shifted from a planned to a market economy. Millions of workers lost their jobs, and crime rates rose. Even today, the region, which has struggled to recover, is known as China’s Rust Belt.\nLocal officials are well aware of this problem. Shanxi’s provincial work report for this year said that getting rid of the “excessive dependency” on coal “still requires hard work”. More than 1.7m coal-related jobs are expected to vanish by the end of the decade, creating an economic time bomb for local officials.\nOne strategy has been to develop Shanxi’s tourism industry. Young entrepreneurs like Xu are at the forefront of that drive. He wants his home city of Datong to avoid the fate of rust belt cities, such as Hegang, a mining city in Dongbei’s Heilongjiang province that is now one of the poorest places in China. “It’s also a resource-depleted city,” Xu said. “So perhaps one day, our city, Datong, might end up like Hegang. But where we’re stronger than Hegang is that Datong has a deep cultural and historical heritage. So maybe when that time comes, young people will start leaving, but if I start working early in the tourism industry here in Datong – in the cultural tourism sector – then maybe I won’t have to leave when that time comes.”\n*****\nAs with its rich reserves of coal, Shanxi has abundant cultural resources – it just hasn’t quite figured out how to use them. Nowhere is this more apparent than Linfen, a small town of just 90,000 people and a few ancient temples. During last year’s National Day holiday, its population briefly doubled when 91,000 tourists flocked to the town, a year-on-year tourism increase of 335%, according to local authorities.\nThe sudden rush of tourists to two previously little known temples deep in China’s coallands is thanks in part to the viral popularity of a Chinese video game, Black Myth: Wukong, which was released last year. Based on classic Chinese mythology, the game includes intricate reconstructions of temples including Xiaoxitian and Guangsheng in Linfen. Both sites have since rapidly plastered themselves with Black Myth merchandise. Guangsheng erected a 7ft statue of the Destined One, the game’s staff-wielding monkey hero, at the entrance to the prayer halls.\nBut the transformation into a tourist hotspot hasn’t been a totally smooth one. Some visitors grumbled that the car park at Xiaoxitian was hard to navigate. The nearby accommodation options are limited. A 43-year-old photographer surnamed Li said that visiting Xiaoxitian felt “immersive” after playing the Black Myth video game. But sometimes, he said, ruminating on the fake cultural relics that have been built in nearby towns, “you feel they have spent their money in the wrong place”.\nWang Xiaoqi and Yu Peishi, tourists at Guangsheng temple, agreed. Aged 72, they have not played the Black Myth video game. But Shanxi has not learned how to tell its own story, they said. Take London’s Big Ben as an example, Wang said. It is “much, much younger” than the relics in Shanxi, “but its fame is much, much greater”. The UK has a better public relations strategy, Yu chimed in, resting with his puppy in a rucksack on his lap. “Everyone in the world knows about it. It’s about cultural influence. Here, it’s more regional, lacking in that kind of vision and global reach”.\nShanxi isn’t just betting on tourism. It is also trying to incorporate China’s nationwide renewables boom into the local economy.\nBy the end of last year Shanxi’s total installed capacity of clean energy reached 61.89 GW, roughly the same as the UK’s. More than half of that came from solar, which reached 34.8 GW last year. In 2022, one of China’s biggest solar companies, LONGi, opened a solar panel factory in Datong, which now employs over 160 people. More than half of the workers come from the coal industry, the company said.\nOther companies from Shanxi’s coal-dominated economy are hoping to reinvent themselves as part of China’s “clean coal” future.\nMeijin Energy, based in Taiyuan, Shanxi’s capital, is one of China’s biggest private coke companies. Founded in 1981, the company has the capacity to process more than 6m tonnes of coal each year, and 11m tonnes of coke. Its headquarters is a sprawling factory complex on the outskirts of the city. According to the company’s chairperson Yao Junlian, Shanxi is the “vanguard of the national energy revolution”.\nA desire to be part of this revolution led the company to start developing a hydrogen fuel in 2016, turning a byproduct of the coking process into clean fuel for vehicles. Sitting in the offices of the shiny new hydrogen division of the Taiyan compound, Ma Kai, a general manager, explained: “In the past, during the coking process, we might have just burned off or discharged the coke oven gas directly. First, that caused air pollution and had a negative environmental impact. Second, it meant we weren’t fully realizing the value of the resources.”\n“Now, we extract and turn all the valuable components contained in the coking process into usable products. This not only maximizes the value of the raw materials and improves our overall efficiency, but also plays a crucial role in environmental protection.”\nMeijin’s site in Taiyuan has an annual production capacity of more than 1,500 tonnes of hydrogen. Much of this goes back into the coal eco-system. Shanxi’s highways are loaded with lane after lane of towering coal trucks, some 500,000 in total, according to Ma. As Shanxi tries to decarbonise its transport sector, hundreds of hydrogen-fuelled vehicles, many made by Meijin, have started to join their ranks.\nBut experts are sceptical about the benefits of this kind of coal-to-chemical processing in the green transition. Even Ma acknowledged that it was a “contradiction” that the production of this clean fuel required digging up and burning one of the dirtiest resources. “There is no explanation that I know of about why the coal-to-chemical industry would be part of the clean utilisation of coal,” Myllyvirta said. The concept of ‘clean coal’ is “the way that the policymakers hedge between clean energy and coal to ensure that the coal industry has a role to play in the transition.”\nAnd the numbers so far are tiny. Meijin employs over ten thousand people in Shanxi, with fewer than 100 in the hydrogen sector. Hydrogen accounts for less than 5% of the company’s revenue. Last year, the company recorded a loss of more than 1.1bn yuan, which it attributed to plummeting coke prices amid an economic downturn.\nWang, the activist, believes that the answer to such economic challenges is to move away from coal entirely. “I’m not really a believer in the existence of the coal industry, because as soon as you dig it out, there are greenhouse gas emissions”. Instead, Wang believes Shanxi has the potential to build a thriving economy, powered by its massive installations of clean energy, that can sustain the province without the need for coal.\nBut Shanxi’s fate isn’t entirely in its hands. Two-thirds of the coal mined in Shanxi is exported to other provinces. Shanxi is “the heart of the entire country,” said Xu, the former miner, “continuously sending out energy and fresh blood to the rest of China”.\nAdditional research by Lillian Yang", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 05:00:42 GMT", "author": "Amy Hawkins in Shanxi; Graphics by Harvey Symons and Lucy Swan", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

The invitations are sent to MPs directly from the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) office and forwarded by party whips.\n“The PLP office has literally become a public affairs agency,” one MP said. “The wording is genuinely shocking.”\nAn invitation for a summer reception in London said it would be an MP-only event and an “opportunity for members of the PLP and frontbenchers to relax in a private setting with senior party figures as we return from the summer recess”.\nThe PLP reception would be hosted in partnership with the property developer Vistry, the invitation said, and it included a lengthy advertising pitch for the company. “As the country’s largest homebuilder, we leverage our expertise, skills and scale to deliver quality new housing,” it read, going on to promote Vistry’s timber-manufacturing capability.\nA party source said attendance was optional but at least one invitation made it clear there was an expectation to attend. “These bi-annual events are important for the party, so your attendance would be greatly appreciated,” one said.\nMPs are understood to have complained about the explicit corporate nature of the event on an MPs WhatsApp group.\nA similar event hosted for Labour MPs in the north-west has been sponsored by Mitie, the facilities management company that provides outsourcing services. One MP said this was directly at odds with Labour’s stated values to return to insourcing services.\nThis week MPs were invited to attend a “kickstart economic growth PLP reception” with “important speakers” at Mastercard’s headquarters that had been arranged so MPs would have time to return to vote in the Commons. “PLP staff are on hand outside and in the venue,” the invitation read.\nThe credit card company also hosted a reception for Labour MPs in the north-west, with the PLP office invitation offering a tour of Mastercard’s “experience centre”, where the company would demonstrate “some of the cutting-edge technology and innovation that’s supporting small businesses”.\nMPs have previously complained about a winter reception, held for the London regional group of MPs, being sponsored by the communications consultancy Kanda.\nThe invitation included a lengthy advertising blurb for Kanda, which said the company worked with clients “to understand, navigate and respond to the commercial drivers impacting the real-estate sector, including government legislature [and] local issues”.\nFirst Rail, a leading transport group operating Avanti West Coast and Great Western Railway, sponsored a similar reception for the northern regional group of MPs and another event with Go Ahead, also a large public transport group with contracts across the north of England.\nA regional reception in December for Scottish MPs was sponsored by Octopus Energy, at the same time the renewable energy group was pushing for a zonal pricing scheme that would benefit Scotland. The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, has since decided not to go ahead with the project.\nMembers of the PLP group of MPs from the north of England said they were frequently invited to commercial briefings, including with BP Teesside, Yorkshire Water and the British Association of Independent Exploration Companies that lobbies on behalf of the North Sea energy industry. The invitations were also promoted to MPs by party officials.\nA Labour party spokesperson said: “Commercial partnerships at events are a longstanding practice and have no bearing on party or government policy.”", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 17:06:19 GMT", "author": "Jessica Elgot", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

{"title": "Holiday spending: eight ways to save money and cut card costs", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jul/08/holiday-spending-save-money-cut-card-costs-debit-credit", "text": "1. Pack the right card\nWhen packing for your summer holiday, don’t forget to pay attention to your plastic. Pick the wrong card to use abroad and you will end up spending more than you need to.\nUnless your trip is imminent, it is not too late to apply for a card that won’t charge you a penny in foreign exchange fees or other bank fees when you are abroad, whether you are spending in a shop, restaurant or hotel or withdrawing cash from an ATM. Often it will take only a few days for your card to arrive.\nThe consumer group Which? has looked at the best debit and credit cards to use abroad. On debit cards, its recommended providers that are “truly fee-free to use abroad” include First Direct and the app-based Starling Bank. With both of those, you get Mastercard’s exchange rate, with no added fees or charges on top.\nWhen it comes to credit cards, Which?’s best buys include the Halifax Clarity card and Barclaycard Rewards card, both of which have no foreign transaction or cash withdrawal fees. Both use Visa’s exchange rate.\nOther options worth a look include the travel debit card Currensea. You sign up, connect your existing bank account and pay with the Currensea card, although you are spending directly from your current account. There are three price plans including one called Essential, which has no annual fee but does have a £4.95 delivery charge.\n2. Know what the deal is\nIf you can’t face applying for a new bank account or credit card or are running out of time, don’t just do nothing.\n“Check what your existing card provider(s) will charge for each purchase and ATM withdrawal,” says Andrew Hagger, the founder of the financial website MoneyComms. “That way, you can try to spend accordingly to minimise the impact of charges on your holiday budget.”\nFor example, you may want to avoid using your debit card to make lots of small payments or withdrawals if the bank applies a set fee each time, while using a credit card to withdraw currency from overseas cash machines “can be an extremely costly way of funding your holiday spending”, Hagger says.\nWatch out if you have a TSB debit card, as it is often highlighted as being one of the most expensive to use overseas. If you are paying for something outside Europe, in many cases you will pay a £1 transaction purchase fee plus 2.99% of the price paid. However, TSB points out that you won’t pay the purchase fee within Europe or if you have one of its Premier or Platinum accounts. Its Spend & Save Plus account also comes without any overseas charges on debit card use but does have a £3 monthly fee.\n3. Check your settings\nIf you use Apple Pay, Google Wallet or Google Pay and you have multiple cards set up on it, it is worth checking the settings and selecting the right primary card for your holiday, says Alastair Douglas, the chief executive of the website TotallyMoney.\n“Otherwise, when you get back, you might find out you’ve been paying extra, adding to your post-holiday blues,” he says.\n4. Pay in local currency\nWhen using a card overseas, watch out for the dynamic currency conversion trick at restaurants, shops and hotels, and at some ATMs. This is where you are offered the option of paying in sterling rather than the local currency.\n“Always remember to select the option to pay [or withdraw cash] in the local currency when you’re abroad, and never in pounds and pence,” Douglas says. “That’s because it’s likely you’ll be charged additional fees for the currency conversion, meaning you’ll be paying more money for the same thing.”\n5. Think: do you need cash?\nSome holidaymakers never take any foreign currency with them – they rely on their credit or debit cards and use ATMs to get out cash if necessary. Others like the security of having some local cash in their wallet or purse before they set off.\nAs is the case with the UK, many countries are increasingly cashless, and in some cases you may find that during your whole trip you never once reach for a banknote or coin. In Sweden, for example, only one in 10 purchases are now made with cash.\nGrowing numbers of countries are moving to contactless payment for their local transport systems such as metros, buses and trams, which usually means you can use a UK debit or credit card.\nHowever, in many places you will still need some cash for things such as entrance fees to certain sites and attractions, shopping at local markets and paying street food vendors. You may also want some for informal payments, such as gratuities. If you have booked a walking tour or excursion, for example, you will probably want some cash with you for a tip for the guide or driver.\nJapan is among the countries where locals say visitors definitely need to carry cash. For tourists shopping at smaller businesses or in rural areas or visiting sites such as temples, “you will still need cash”, according to The Tokyo Chapter, a blog.\n6. Get a good deal on cash\nIf you do plan to buy some holiday money and don’t want to get ripped off, a useful starting point is the Travel Money Max online tool run by MoneySavingExpert.com, which lets you compare exchange rates. Key in a few details including how much you want and how you want to get it – delivery or collection – and it will give you several options and show you what you would get after all charges.\nWe used the site to see who was offering the best deals for £400 of Turkish lira for a trip in a fortnight’s time. When we opted for delivery, The Currency Club came top, with Waitrose and John Lewis not too far behind. On collection – we opted for somewhere within five miles of our London King’s Cross office – Sterling FX came top, followed by Thomas Exchange Global.\nThe “walk-up” exchange rates at airport bureaux de change are notoriously poor, so steer well clear unless you are really desperate.\nAlso, don’t pop into your local bank to get some currency, as a high street bank is nearly always one of the most expensive places to change money.\n7. Check your insurance\nIf you plan to take, or withdraw, large sums of cash on holiday, make sure your travel insurance will cover you for any loss or theft. Some basic policies do not cover cash.\nEven if yours does, take care to look after your money. Don’t leave it in a bag in your room – use a safe if there is one.\n8. Dodge double conversions\nWhile preparing for your holiday, you may discover you have foreign currency left over from previous trips – great news if you can use it this time, not so great if it’s for another country.\nDouglas says you should pause before attempting to exchange it for the currency you need.\n“If you’re in the UK and switching cash from one foreign currency to another foreign currency, then it’s likely you’ll be charged two sets of fees or commissions,” he says. “One will be to convert your cash into pounds, and another from pounds into the new currency. So you might be better off waiting until you reach your destination and exchanging there.”", "published": "Tue, 08 Jul 2025 06:00:30 GMT", "author": "Rupert Jones", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

These are some steps you can take:\nWhat to do if your house keys are lost\nHere’s what you can do if you find yourself in this situation:\n-\nRetrace your steps and look in the places where you usually leave your keys. Start where you last remember having them and check where you have been since. If a passerby outdoors has found your keys, it’s possible they may have put them somewhere visible – on a wall or bench, for example.\n-\nCheck if you have left a spare key with a neighbour, family member or friend. Also, notify anyone you live with, such as a housemate or partner. This can help you get into your home, but does not remove any potential security risks.\n-\nReport the missing keys to the police. Providing a clear description of what they and any keyrings look like will help the police get them back to you in the event that they are handed in.\n-\nPost on your neighbourhood Facebook or WhatsApp group, or on an app such as Nextdoor, to see whether they have been picked up by someone. Do not include your address.\n-\nIf you think you probably lost your keys some way from your home, and there is no identifying information on them that could lead someone to the property, then some people would take the view that you don’t need to get your lock rekeyed or changed. (Rekeying is the process of changing the internal mechanism of a lock so old keys no longer work and a new set of keys can be used, and is generally cheaper than changing the whole lock.) But you may want to, just to be on the safe side.\n-\nAnd if you have lost your only set of keys, you are going to need to call a locksmith. It is worth calling round a few firms to get quotes, and agree the price before the work is done. Emergency locksmiths are available 24/7 so can help even in the early hours of the morning. The price can vary depending on the time of day and the type of lock.\n-\nIf you are renting the property, you need to tell your landlord or housing association. They might be able to help with lock changes or provide a spare key in some cases.\nWhat to do when you get new keys\nOnce you have dealt with any immediate security concerns, there are a few more things you can do to prevent future problems:\n-\nGet a spare key (or two) cut in case you lose them again. It is not wise to keep it under the doormat or a flowerpot – leave it with someone nearby whom you trust.\n-\nYou may want to consider investing in a key safe or lockbox to securely store a spare key. If you don’t know anyone in your area, this is a safe alternative – as long as you remember the code, and to put the key back afterwards.\n-\nConsider getting a smart lock if you are worried about losing your keys again. These allow you to unlock your door without a physical key using a code, card or app on your smartphone. Companies such as Yale sell various types, and tech websites such as TechRadar have have recommendations of which to buy. If you already have a smart lock, make sure you update the access code or deactivate any lost key cards.\n-\nThink about buying a Bluetooth tracking device such as an Apple AirTag, a Tile Mate tracker or the Chipolo One tracke You can attach this to your keys (or a bag or purse). This can help locate them if they go missing again.", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 06:00:44 GMT", "author": "Mabel Banfield-Nwachi", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"}

It also “repeatedly breached” rules preventing it from opening accounts for high-risk customers between 2020 and 2022.\nThe controls were lax enough that customers were able to register for accounts using “obviously implausible UK addresses when applying for an account”, FCA documents outlining the extent of the breaches said. That included well-known London landmarks including Buckingham Palace, 10 Downing Street, and Monzo’s business address.\nThe FCA’s joint enforcement director Therese Chambers said: “Monzo onboarded customers on the basis of limited, and in some cases, obviously implausible information …\n“This illustrates how lacking Monzo’s financial crime controls were. This was compounded by its inability to properly comply with the requirement not to onboard high-risk customers.”\nIt also found instances where customers of Monzo – which was founded in 2015 and is known for its bright coral-coloured debit cards – were able to register with PO boxes or foreign addresses with UK postcodes.\nOther customers were able to use one address to apply for an account but then reordered their card to a non-UK location.\nIn other cases, multiple customers were able to use the same address, raising the risk of possible money muling: where a person allows their bank account to become a conduit for the proceeds of organised crime.\nMonzo’s “decision” to neither verify nor monitor customer addresses “heightened the risk of Monzo having onboarded, and continued a business relationship with, non-UK resident customers outside of its risk appetite”, the FCA said.\nThe penalty ends four years of speculation over the basis of the FCA investigation, which was first disclosed in Monzo’s 2021 annual report.\nMonzo’s chief executive, TS Anil, said in a statement that the FCA’s fine drew a line under issues that he said “have been resolved and are firmly in the past – with our learnings at the time leading to substantial improvements in our controls.\n“I’m pleased the FCA recognises the significant investments we have made, as well as our ongoing commitment to managing these risks today, as we go from strength to strength as a business approaching 13 million customers.\n“Financial crime is an issue that affects the entire industry – and at Monzo, we have the right team, best-in-class technology and an unwavering commitment to doing all we can to stop it in its tracks,” Anil added.\nThe FCA said the fine of £21.1m had been discounted from £30.1m after Monzo agreed to resolve the problems.\nThe fine comes months after Monzo’s rival digital bank Starling was fined £29m over “shockingly lax” financial crime controls that the FCA said “left the financial system wide open to criminals and those subject to sanctions” after its own massive growth.

It will also offer Love Island: All Stars and a season each of detective series Endeavour and game show The 1% Club.\nUnder the initiative, which is being billed as a “Taste of ITVX” and a “Taste of Disney+”, each company will sell the advertising inventory around the shows they provide from their partner.\n“This mutually beneficial alliance allows us to show our complementary audiences a specially selected collection of titles,” said Kevin Lygo, the managing director of media and entertainment at ITV. “For us, this deal means even more great content for viewers on ITVX, and even more opportunities for viewers to find and enjoy our distinctive titles and services.”\nITV has committed to spend more than £800m between the launch of ITVX in late 2022 and the end of next year in a belated attempt to create a national streaming champion fit for the Netflix era.\nThe broadcaster is targeting £750m in digital revenues, 2bn hours of annual streams and hitting 20 million monthly users by next year, as it seeks to transition from its roots and reliance on the declining linear TV market.\nITVX reported 14.3m monthly active users and 1.7bn streaming hours at the end of the year to March.\nDisney+, which trails behind Netflix and Amazon in the UK, is hoping that the content provided by ITV will help boost older subscribers to its service, which tends to skew more towards children and families.\nJoe Earley, the president of direct-to-consumer at Disney, said: “This innovative collaboration will allow us to bring Disney+ customers some of the UK’s favourite and buzzworthy shows and encourage ITVX viewers to discover some of Disney+’s award-winning series and blockbuster films.”\nClaire Enders, the founder of Enders Analysis, said that such deals are going to be essential for the UK’s financially outgunned public service broadcasters (PSBs) to build streaming services of scale.\n“This is a big move in the UK market, it is becoming more of a theme in Europe now, and it marks a significant step forward in the right direction,” she said.\n“It is part of an essential trend to keep PSBs here, particularly the commercially-funded ones, alive.

Nvidia touched the mark briefly on Wednesday during trading.\nTrump praised Nvidia stock in a social media post Thursday morning.\n\"NVIDIA IS UP 47% SINCE TRUMP TARIFFS. USA is taking in Hundreds of Billions of Dollars in Tariffs,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. \"COUNTRY IS NOW 'BACK.'\"\nAn Nvidia representative declined to comment, and it was unclear what the meeting is about, but Nvidia has been grappling with export controls on its artificial intelligence chips implemented by the Trump administration in April for national security reasons.\nAt the time, the U.S. government told Nvidia that its previously-approved H20 processor — intended exclusively for the Chinese market — would require an export license. Huang previously told investors that requirement effectively cut off Nvidia's sales to China with \"no grace period.\" The AI chipmaker said that it would miss $8 billion in planned orders for the chip in the company's July quarter.\n\"The $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry,\" Huang told investors on an earnings call in May.\nNvidia also faces another potential restriction on AI chip exports after the Trump administration cancelled a planned rule by former President Joe Biden called the \"AI diffusion rule.\" The Trump administration promised newer, simpler restrictions later this year on which countries could receive Nvidia's technology.\nWATCH: Fundstrat's Tom Lee: Nvidia being the most valuable company in the S&P makes a lot of sense", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 00:42:52 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}
{"title": "Trump's 50% Brazil tariff stretches emergency powers already facing court challenge", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/trump-brazil-tariffs-ieepa-lawsuit.html", "text": "President Donald Trump's politically charged new tariff threat — a blanket 50% duty on imports from Brazil — stretches an interpretation of his powers that is already facing a high-stakes court challenge.\nTrump said in a letter Wednesday that he is imposing the massive new tariff at least partly in retaliation against Brazil's treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro.\nBut to do so, he is citing a law that only grants him emergency economic powers in order to deal with certain foreign threats to the United States, a White House official told CNBC Thursday.\nThat same law — the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA — is at the center of an ongoing lawsuit over Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs that is currently before a federal appeals court.\nTrump's lawyers say his invocation of the law to impose those tariffs was an appropriate move to address multiple national emergencies, including \"America's exploding trade deficit.\"\nThe White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's questions about Trump's letter to Brazil, including how Bolsonaro's circumstances relate to Trump's stated authority under IEEPA.\nWhile the latest levy on Brazilian imports may not have a direct impact on the lawsuit already underway, critics say it could further erode the administration's credibility as Trump pursues an aggressive trade agenda.\nTrump's letter announcing the tariff on Brazil \"takes abuse of power to a whole new level,\" said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., in a statement Thursday.\nKaine vowed to \"use all available means to block these latest job-killing tariffs.\"\nSen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, accused Trump of attempting to \"sacrifice the economy to settle his own personal scores, and it is far outside his legal authority.\"\nWhat's IEEPA?\nIEEPA gives the president some powers to deal with national emergencies stemming from \"any unusual and extraordinary threat\" that comes in whole or in large part from outside the U.S.\nTrump previously cited IEEPA in early April, when he slapped 10% tariffs on nearly all other countries' imports, plus higher rates on dozens of individual nations. His April 2 executive order announcing those tariffs also formally declared a national emergency.\nAccording to the order, foreign trade practices that \"contribute to large and persistent annual United States goods trade deficits\" have caused the loss of America's \"industrial capacity\" and \"compromised military readiness.\"\nTrump temporarily suspended the higher tariffs a week later, following a trading frenzy in global markets.\nIn late May, the U.S. Court of International Trade struck the reciprocal tariffs down, ruling that IEEPA did not authorize Trump to impose them.\nThe judges in that case found that Trump's assertion of \"unbounded\" tariff-making power \"exceeds any tariff authority delegated to the President under IEEPA.\"\nBut in June, judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit paused that decision from taking effect while the case is still pending.\n\"We'll have to see\" if Trump's tariff letter to Brazil could factor into the appeal, said Ilya Somin, a law professor who is representing plaintiffs in the case against the Trump administration.\n\"For the moment, these new Brazil tariffs are not part of the case,\" Somin said in a phone interview.\nBut he added that the letter \"further underscores the indefensible nature\" of Trump's assertion that he has virtually \"unreviewable discretion\" on tariffs.\nTrump's letter to Lula\nThis week, Trump began a new strategy: firing off individual letters to world leaders that set new tariff rates on their countries' U.S. imports, starting Aug. 1.\nThe nearly two dozen letters sent so far include identical language complaining about trade policies that have created \"persistent\" and \"unsustainable Trade Deficits against the United States.\"\n\"This Deficit is a major threat to our Economy and, indeed, our National Security!\" they read.\nBut Trump's letter to Brazil takes things much further, by explicitly declaring that he is imposing tariffs because he opposes the recent political and legal developments in the country.\nTrump specifically decried Brazil's treatment of Bolsonaro, who is facing trial over his role in an alleged coup to overturn his 2022 reelection loss.\n\"This Trial should not be taking place,\" Trump wrote in the letter to current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. \"It is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\"\nHe said the 50% tariff was coming in part due to \"Brazil's insidious attacks on Free Elections.\" He also alleged that the country has attacked the \"fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans,\" accusing Brazil's Supreme Court of unlawfully censoring U.S. social media platforms.\nTrump also knocked Brazil's trade policies. Echoing his language from prior letters, Trump claimed that Brazil's persistent U.S. trade deficits pose a national security threat.\nExcept that Brazil is one of the few trading partners with whom the U.S. maintains a goods trade surplus, not a deficit.\nThat surplus totaled $7.4 billion in 2024, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\"He's either lying or misinformed,\" Somin said of Trump's incorrect claim.\nSomin also asserted, contra Trump and his lawyers, that the U.S. having trade deficits with its partners is not unusual and does not constitute an emergency.\nSo \"it's particularly stupid when we actually have a trade surplus,\" he said.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 00:09:18 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

We are committed to continuing to work with the United States to save lives and protect communities in both our countries.\"\n\"The Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses. We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of August 1.\"\nThe 35% tariffs will be separate from all sectoral tariffs, Trump said, warning that the duty might be increased, if Canada continues to retaliate. Canada is already subject to Trump's 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, 25% tariffs on autos, and faces a 50% levy on copper shipments starting Aug. 1.\n\"If for any reason you decide to raise your Tariffs, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 35% that we charge,\" Trump said Thursday. \"Good transshipped to evade this higher tariff will be subject to that higher tariff.\"\nTrump indicated that the tariff rates in future will depend on how Washington's relationship with Ottawa pans out, while mentioning that his country faced challenges from Canada that went beyond fentanyl.\n\"[Canada] has many Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers, which cause unsustainable Trade Deficits against the United States ... The Trade Deficit is a major threat to our Economy and, indeed, our National Security!\"\nSeparately, Trump told NBC news Thursday that he intends to impose blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% on most trade partners, up from the current 10%.\nImports from Canada into the U.S. currently attract a 25% levy that Trump imposed earlier this year over the country's alleged role in the flow of fentanyl, with exemptions for those in compliance with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Energy resources from Canada are subject to a lower 10% levy.\nThursday's letter came after the two countries agreed to resume the trade talks on June 29 and to work on hammering out a deal by July 21, according to a statement from the Department of Finance Canada.\nTrump had threatened to end all trade discussions with Canada, one of its largest trading partners, after Ottawa said it would not pause the imposition of a \"digital services tax\" on American firms. Canada later withdrew that tax in order to restart trade talks with Washington.\nIn response to Trump's duties, Ottawa had also imposed 25% tariffs on non-USMCA complaint vehicles from the U.S. and a list of American exports including steel, aluminum, computers, apparels and food earlier this year. The countermeasures, Canada said in March, would stay \"until the U.S. eliminates its tariffs against Canadian steel and aluminum products.\"\nU.S. total goods trade with Canada was $761.8 billion in 2024, with Washington's deficit standing at $62 billion last year, according to U.S. Census data. In the first five months this year, the U.S. deficit in goods trade with Canada rose 9.8% year on year to $25.6 billion.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 04:30:04 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

He reportedly has considered firing Powell and, more recently, publicly naming the chairman's replacement months earlier than the end of Powell's term next spring.\nVought's letter raises the question of whether Trump will seek to remove Powell for cause, at least ostensibly.\nBut the Supreme Court in a recent decision strongly suggested that Federal Reserve board members have special protection from being fired by a president.\n\"While continuing to run a deficit since FY23 (the first time in the Fed's history), the Fed is way over budget on the renovation of its headquarters,\" Vought wrote in a post on the social media site X.\n\"Now up to $2.5 billion, roughly $700 million over its initial cost,\" Vought wrote. \"The cost per square foot is $1,923--double the cost for renovating an ordinary historic federal building.

While packing up boxes, she met her husband Kristopher Vincent, who's been at the site, known as IND8, since 2013.\nLast month, Poteau was contacted by the Department of Homeland Security, after the Trump administration canceled humanitarian immigration programs that allowed participants to live and work legally in the U.S. for two years while applying for permanent status.\nA notice from DHS told Poteau that her parole program was being terminated. Her last day at Amazon was June 28. She's among a group of warehouse workers whose jobs have been eliminated since DHS revoked the parole program that was created during the Biden administration.\nWhile Poteau tries to secure a spousal visa, her future in the U.S. is uncertain. She and Vincent, who's from Indiana, said they're concerned about being able to afford rent and costly immigration fees.\n\"We're taking it one day at a time, but it does leave me stressed that they're going to come and try to get her, even though she does have an asylum case pending in court,\" Vincent said in an interview.\n\"Everything we've seen in the news shows they flagrantly no longer care what the laws say,\" Vincent said.\nPoteau and her terminated co-workers had been protected under programs that provided Haitians, Cubans, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans with temporary legal status in the U.S. Many of the employees at IND8 are Haitian, a large enough contingent that some of the morning staff meetings are translated into Creole, Vincent said.\nAmazon last month began asking staffers who came to the U.S. under the Biden-era program to provide updated work permits within a certain timeframe or they would be put on unpaid leave, according to documents viewed by CNBC.\nSeveral workers who spoke to CNBC said they were dismissed by Amazon in late June after they couldn't get new work authorizations.\nAmazon declined to say how many employees were let go following the changes in immigration policy, but spokesperson Richard Rocha said the company prepared for potential staffing impacts due to changes in work authorization programs, and made adjustments to be in compliance with the law.\n\"We're supporting employees impacted by the government's recent changes in immigration policy,\" Rocha said in a statement. \"Over the past few months, we've been in regular communication with these employees about the changes and are ensuring they're aware of all available resources.\"\nThe company has provided impacted employees with information about where to find free or low-cost legal services, access to counseling support and other resources, Rocha said.\nA DHS spokesperson pointed to the agency's announcement terminating the humanitarian parole program.\nFired before Prime Day\nAs part of the Trump administration's broad immigration crackdown, DHS has eliminated not just the humanitarian parole program. It's also ended separate programs that provided temporary protected status to Venezuelans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Hondurans seeking refuge from their native countries, which have suffered from armed conflict and humanitarian crises. Last week, a federal judge ruled the Trump administration can't revoke the temporary protected status, or TPS, of Haitian migrants. The White House said it will appeal the ruling.\nAmazon is far from alone. Other companies including Walmart and Disney have been forced to fire employees or put them on leave in order to comply with shifting federal policies.\nAmong private employers in the U.S., only Walmart has a bigger workforce than Amazon. Most of the e-commerce giant's 1.56 million employees globally are concentrated in its warehouse operations.\nThe terminations started just as Amazon was gearing up for its annual Prime Day discount blitz, which began on Tuesday and lasts four days. The event is typically one of the busiest periods of the year for Amazon warehouse and delivery employees, alongside the holiday shopping season.\nAmazon has counted on immigrants to meet a big part of its staffing needs. In 2022, the company set a goal to hire 5,000 refugees and other forcibly displaced individuals by the end of 2024.\nWhile Trump's policies create a challenge for large employers like Amazon, the real devastation is being felt by the immigrant workers. Those who now find themselves unemployed and lacking documentation are at a higher risk of being targeted for deportation unless they can secure an alternative form of legal status.\nChristopher Lubin, an Amazon warehouse worker in Delaware, lost his job at the company on June 27, a day before Poteau received her notice.\n\"We have done everything legally in this country,\" said Lubin, 24, who is also from Haiti. \"We haven't committed fraud. We go to school, we work, and we pay taxes.\"\nDHS said it was revoking protections for Haitian nationals after a review by Secretary Kristi Noem determined \"country conditions have improved to the point where Haitians can return home in safety.\"\nThe U.S. granted TPS for Haitian nationals following a catastrophic earthquake in 2008 that destroyed much of the nation's infrastructure. In 2024, the TPS designation was extended through February 2026, as the country faced \"rapidly deteriorating security, human rights and humanitarian\" conditions, according to the United Nations Human Rights Council.\nArmed gangs control the majority of Port-au-Prince and violence has spread beyond the capital in recent months. About 10 individuals from Haiti lost their jobs at an Amazon warehouse in Spokane, Washington, after DHS revoked the TPS program, said Katia Jasmin, executive director of Creole Resources, which provides support to Haitian immigrants in the region.\nSerge, who asked to have his full name withheld out of fear of being targeted for deportation, came to the U.S. from Haiti nearly two years ago and secured a job at the Spokane warehouse as a packer. The situation in Haiti was dire when he left and it remains unsafe today, Serge said.\n\"I witnessed violence and trauma, including the loss of family members who were killed,\" Serge said. \"Others were displaced from their homes and are now homeless. I genuinely feared for my life.\"\nIn desperation, he said he sought a safer future and secured a sponsor that allowed him to come to the U.S. legally. It's \"unjust\" that Haitians are now being ordered to return to their home country when it's plagued with violence, Serge said.\n\"We're not just recipients of economic support,\" he said. \"We're also contributors who help drive the economy.\"", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 17:53:40 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

As of 2024, Filipinos were estimated to be the fourth-largest immigrant group in the United States, and Vietnamese citizens were at No. 8, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\"It could be because of family connections who live there,\" said Kamble. But there's also \"the aspirational factor and the soft power of U.S. culture, through TV shows, that still is very attractive.\"\nFilipina Pinky David spoke to CNBC Travel from the U.S., which she said she visits frequently for work, family and holidays.\n\"I think the majority of Filipinos, in general, still consider coming to America,\" she said.\nHowever, the survey showed that one nation showed little interest in setting foot on American soil anytime soon. Some 55% of Singaporeans said they are less interested in visiting the U.S. than they were last November. Only 7% said they are now more interested in going, the data showed.\nThe survey also showed that Vietnamese respondents had the strongest reaction to tariffs announced by the Trump administration. In April 2025, Trump announced a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, before reaching a trade deal on July 2 that reduced the amount to 20% for Vietnamese goods and 40% for goods shipped to Vietnam from other countries for final shipment to the United States.\nNegative buzz\nCNBC's survey mirrors a YouGov report released in March which showed that since January 2025, global \"buzz\" and \"impressions\" of the U.S. as a travel destination have plummeted.\n- Buzz: hearing anything positive or negative about a destination\n- Impressions: having a positive or negative impression of a destination\nImpressions of the U.S. continued to drop into March, with net scores falling into negative territory in Europe, the Middle East/North Africa, and Canada and Mexico, according to YouGov data provided to CNBC.\nHowever, the number of people who said they were considering the U.S. for their next international trip remained relatively stable, according to the YouGov report.\nAfter the election of Donald Trump in November 2024, interest in visiting the U.S. rose in several parts of the world, from the United Arab Emirates and India to Hong Kong and Poland, according to the report.\nHowever, interest in visiting dropped in other places, including Singapore, Canada, and Northern and Western Europe. Overall, global travel interest in trips to the U.S. fell 13%, according to the YouGov report.\nOnline sentiment\nOnline sentiment about traveling to the U.S. also varies by country, according to the analytics company Sprout Social.\nThe company found that there were more than 87,000 mentions — and more than 1 million engagements, in the form of likes, comments, or shares — on X, YouTube, Tumblr and Reddit from April 30 to June 3 that discussed travel to the United States. Nearly 50,000 were from Canada, of which 45% were negative, the data showed.\nHowever, 96% of the 18,000 mentions and interactions that originated from India were either positive or neutral, it showed.\nInterestingly, the most negative sentiment about U.S. travel came from users in the U.S. itself, the data showed.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 01:58:48 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}
{"title": "North Carolina is America's Top State for Business in 2025, led by a strong workforce and economy", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/north-carolina-top-state-for-business-america.html", "text": "With a solid economy, a world-class workforce, and a wealth of corporate hospitality, North Carolina is America's Top State for Business in 2025.\nThe Tar Heel State is on a roll. It captured top honors in the annual CNBC rankings in 2022 and 2023, and it was runner-up in 2021 and 2024 — missing the top spot last year by just three points to Virginia, which slips this year to its lowest position among states since 2018.\nNorth Carolina is not only winning the CNBC rankings, it's also attracting a steady stream of new business.\n\"North Carolina offers the ideal combination of talent, infrastructure, and forward-thinking leadership to support our mission to reshape aviation,\" said Tom O'Leary, CEO and co-founder of JetZero, an aviation startup manufacturing fuel-efficient airliners, which announced June 12 that it will build its first factory, with 14,500 jobs, in Greensboro.\nAlso in June, Amazon announced it would invest $10 billion to build new data centers in North Carolina, on top of the $12 billion the company says it has invested in the state since 2010.\n\"This latest expansion is a testament to the state's thriving business ecosystem and talented workforce,\" the company said in a statement June 4.\nCNBC's data backs up those conclusions.\nNorth Carolina finishes No. 3 in the all-important Economy category of this year's study, behind only Florida and Texas. The state's gross domestic product grew by a healthy 3.7% last year, the fifth-strongest in the country. The state added more than 60,000 jobs last year.\nThose jobs add to a well-rounded workforce — America's fourth-best, according to the CNBC study. According to Census data, North Carolina finishes third — behind Florida and Maine — in net in-migration of college-educated workers on a percentage basis. North Carolina finishes in the top tier both for science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, employees, and for its pipeline of vocational and career-educated workers.\nAttracting business is a goal both political parties agree on\nWhile no state is more politically divided than deep purple North Carolina, both parties seem to agree on the importance of keeping business happy.\n\"In recent years, we've recruited businesses that have created tens of thousands of jobs across the state,\" Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat in his first year in office, said in his state of the state address in March. \"But we cannot rest on our laurels. Other states want what we have here — it's a competitive world.\"\nGovernor Josh Stein noted in an interview with CNBC on Thursday that since January of this year, when he was sworn in, the state has announced more than $20 billion worth of investments that include 23,000 jobs.\n\"My priority, and I think the priority of Senate Republicans, will be to continue those policies that have provided that kind of environment that has made North Carolina attractive to private sector businesses,\" state Senate President Phil Berger told The Carolina Journal in March. \"Those sorts of things don't happen by accident. That kind of growth doesn't happen just by happenstance.\"\nNorth Carolina finished fourth in the Business Friendliness category of the CNBC study. Tort liability costs are the third-lowest in the country, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Institute for Legal Reform. The state is in the top 10 for \"economic freedom,\" according to the Fraser Institute, a Vancouver-based libertarian think tank, which gave the state high marks for its approaches toward government spending and labor regulation.\nAs North Carolina legislators battle over the state's budget and tax policy, Stein told CNBC he has no intention of raising taxes.\n\"No one likes to pay taxes, so we want taxes to be as low as possible,\" he said. But he also noted that the state already has the lowest corporate income tax of any that levies one, and what Stein said he does not want is to \"imprudently continue to go to zero when we have all this fiscal uncertainty coming from Washington.\"\nWith the expectation of greater state spending on health care and food assistance, given the changes being made to federal support for Medicaid and SNAP program benefits in Trump's tax and spending bill, Stein said his message to state legislators is: \"Let's go slow and make sure we have the fiscal situation we need to succeed well into the future.\"\nWhile North Carolina is almost unfailingly friendly to business, it is not terribly friendly to workers. The state comes in at No. 29 for Quality of Life — its worst category in the CNBC study this year. Oxfam International, a left-leaning anti-poverty organization, ranks North Carolina dead last in its annual report on The Best and Worst States to Work in the U.S., citing an almost complete lack of worker protections. Also, North Carolina is one of only five states with no law protecting nondisabled people from discrimination in public accommodations, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nHurricane damages, Medicaid cuts could hurt business climate\nNorth Carolina's biggest headwinds, however, come from areas that are much harder for a state to control.\nThe state is still in the early stages of recovery from Hurricane Helene, which killed 100 people and destroyed thousands of homes in North Carolina alone, causing nearly $60 billion in damages in the state. The storm, and subsequent flooding, struck in September, which means that much of the economic impact may not be reflected in this year's Top States data. The state has appropriated upward of $2 billion in recovery funds, which could accelerate if the Trump administration follows through on plans to phase out FEMA. North Carolina is also among the top recipients of research grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, which are now on the chopping block.\nStein said that as a bigger state than most, North Carolina has a sophisticated emergency response system, but he says it is critical for the federal government to maintain its primary role in disaster management. \"We don't get a huge storm every year, but the country does. It doesn't make sense for every state to have a fully staffed emergency response team,\" he said.\nThe cost of disaster response is also too high for any state alone to bear, Stein said, speaking of the $60 billion in recent damages seen across in North Carolina from storms like Hurricane Helene. \"Only the federal government can do that,\" he said, noting North Carolina has an $11.5 billion request before Congress and the administration. \"I eagerly hope they fund it soon,\" he said.\nOther Trump policies could also hurt the state. Sen. Thom Tillis, who announced June 29 that he would not seek reelection after opposing the president's signature tax-and-spending bill, warned that Medicaid cuts could cost the state as much as $32 billion and cause more than 600,000 North Carolinians to lose their health insurance.\n\"It's a real concern. This bill will result in real harm to North Carolina, harm to people and health care,\" Stein said. \"You cannot do that and not have human suffering. We have a lot of rural hospitals and those are where uninsured people will predominantly live and [those hospitals] will be the ones at risk of closing. We are very concerned,\" Stein added.\nHe pointed to the bipartisan success achieved in North Carolina two years ago when the state expanded Medicaid coverage to 660,000 people. \"Now we have to come together to defend Medicaid,\" Stein said.\nAnd that's not all. More than 20% of North Carolina's GDP in 2024 came from international trade in goods, according to data supplied for the CNBC study by Trade Partnership Worldwide. That leaves the state vulnerable to the impact of higher tariffs, which Stein told CNBC can already be seen in a recent reduction in traffic at the state's biggest port in Wilmington resulting from a trade policy that \"changes practically on a daily basis.\"\n\"We need to have stability, businesses need certainty, so they can figure out how and where to invest,\" Stein said.\nBut at least North Carolina steers into those headwinds from a strong position.\nScoring all 50 U.S. states\nThe CNBC study measures all 50 states across 10 categories of competitiveness, for a total of 2,500 possible points. North Carolina racks up 1,614 points to capture this year's crown.\nOur methodology assigns a weight to each category based on how frequently states cite it as a selling point. The idea is to measure the states based on the criteria they use to pitch themselves to businesses.\nHere are this year's categories and point totals:\n- Economy: 445 points (17.8%)\n- Infrastructure: 405 points (16.2%)\n- Workforce: 335 points (13.4%)\n- Cost of Doing Business: 295 points (11.8%)\n- Business Friendliness: 270 points (10.8%)\n- Quality of Life: 265 points (10.6%)\n- Technology & Innovation: 255 points (10.2%)\n- Education: 110 points (4.4%)\n- Access to Capital: 60 points (2.4%)\n- Cost of Living: 60 points (2.4%)\nThe rest of the Top States\nTexas is the runner-up in this year's rankings, with the top rating in the Workforce category. The Lone Star State is unparalleled when it comes to drawing in workers, according to a worker attraction index developed for CNBC by labor market data firm Lightcast. But Texas has serious Quality of Life issues, finishing No. 49 in the category. The state has the largest percentage of people without health insurance, crime is on the high side, and state laws offer few protections against discrimination.\nFlorida climbs to third place this year, with the top rating in Economy for the third consecutive year. But the state's strong growth and its lingering insurance crisis are forcing up costs. The Sunshine State is now third-highest in Cost of Living.\nVirginia, which has run neck-and-neck with North Carolina since 2021 for the top spot in CNBC's rankings, slips to fourth place this year. The Old Dominion is still a business powerhouse, tops for Education, and second best for Infrastructure. But the state's interdependence on the federal government — an economic boost in most years — leaves its economy on less solid footing as federal budget cuts loom.\nOhio joins the top five states for the first time with America's top ranking in Infrastructure. More than 142 million people live within a day's drive of Ohio, more than any other state. The Buckeye State also offers the second-lowest cost of doing business, after Oklahoma.\nThis year's Most Improved State is Massachusetts, which climbs 18 spots to No. 20 overall, bouncing back from the biggest decline last year. The Bay State still has serious issues. It's the second-most-expensive state to do business in. And cuts in federal research dollars — not just to Harvard University, but also to other institutions in the state — seriously threaten the state's heritage of innovation. But overall, Massachusetts is less dependent on Washington than most states.\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that federal funds comprise just 30% of state spending in Massachusetts. That is the 14th-lowest percentage among states, helping the state in the crucial Economy category.\nThe Bottom States\nWe rank all 50 states, so if there are Top States, there must also be Bottom States.\nTied at No. 46 are Louisiana and Rhode Island.\nThe federal government funds half of state spending in Louisiana — more than any other state — leaving the state seriously vulnerable to the Trump budget cuts. The state's roads and bridges are among the worst in the country.\nRhode Island is the fifth-most-expensive state to do business in, and it ranks No. 46 for Business Friendliness.\nMontana finishes at No. 48 overall, with America's worst ranking in the Workforce category. Montana workers rank No. 48 for productivity in terms of economic output per job, and state worker training programs are the least effective in terms of recipients finding employment within six months.\nHawaii finishes No. 49, with America's highest cost of doing business and the second-highest cost of living.\nIn last place is Alaska. Try as it might, The Last Frontier cannot wean itself from its dependence on oil, and with the price of North Slope crude down about 12% from a year ago, Alaska ranks last in the Economy category.\nJoin the conversation. Didn't see your state mentioned? You can see where it ranked overall, and in all 10 categories of competitiveness, in the full rankings of the 2025 America's Top States for Business.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 14:59:44 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}
{"title": "Levi Strauss raises sales guidance, says it will absorb some tariff costs for now", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/levi-strauss-levi-earnings-q2-2025.html", "text": "Levi Strauss raised its full-year guidance Thursday and said it's working to absorb some of the costs it's facing from higher tariffs, but that could change as President Donald Trump's trade policy evolves.\nThe denim maker doesn't disclose its key manufacturing hubs, but much of its supply comes from Southeast Asia. Many countries in the region have been targeted by Trump's so-called reciprocal tariff plan.\nLevi's is currently expecting its full-year adjusted earnings to be between $1.25 to $1.30 per share, up from a prior forecast of between $1.20 and $1.25 and better than the $1.23 analysts had expected, according to LSEG. However, that forecast only assumes a 30% tariff on China, where Levi's manufactures about 1% of its products, and a 10% tariff on the rest of the world, which could change as Trump negotiates trade deals with key manufacturing regions.\nIn an interview with CNBC, Levi's finance chief Harmit Singh said most of Levi's sourcing is from countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Trump in recent days threatened Bangladesh and Indonesia with duties of more than 30%. It's unclear how much of Levi's products are sourced from those regions, and 60% of Levi's business is outside of the U.S.\nFor now, Levi's said it's planning to absorb what it can. As policy currently stands, it anticipates tariffs will only impact the business by $25 million to $30 million for the rest of the year, or 2 to 3 cents on earnings per share.\n\"We are doing our part. We are absorbing some of the costs. What helps is that our business is so strong,\" said CEO Michelle Gass. \"We have been pulling back on promotions anyway, that's leading to more full-price selling, and some of our new innovation, our new fits, we're pricing at a premium, and they're buying. So all of those things help us navigate this time of having the tariff headwind.\"\nWhen asked by an analyst if Levi's should have raised its guidance during such an uncertain time for the economy, Singh said the company expects its consumer to keep spending.\n\"Given that we've had three quarters of high single digit growth, we see the momentum continuing, because the consumer ... is generally resilient and a continued fan of the brand,\" he said.\nBeyond tariffs, Levi's delivered fiscal second quarter earnings that beat expectations on the top and bottom lines. Here's how the jeans company did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n- Earnings per share: 22 cents adjusted vs. 13 cents expected\n- Revenue: $1.45 billion vs. $1.37 billion expected\nLevi's shares rose about 8% in extended trading.\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended June 1 was $67 million, or 17 cents per share, compared with $18 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges related to restructuring and impairment expenses, among other costs, Levi posted earnings per share of 22 cents.\nSales rose to $1.45 billion, up about 6% from $1.36 billion a year earlier.\nGiven strong demand, Levi's raised its full-year revenue guidance and now expects sales to rise between 1% and 2%, up from previous guidance of down 1% to 2%. That range is well ahead of expectations. Analysts had expected revenue to decline by 5.2%, according to LSEG.\nLevi's did cut its gross margin guidance by 0.2 percentage points, and now expects gross margin to grow by 0.8 percentage points because of the impact tariffs are having on profits.\nFor its current quarter, Levi expects sales to be up between 3% and 4%, well ahead of expectations of a 4.6% decline, according to LSEG. It expects earnings per share to be between 28 cents and 30 cents, roughly in line with expectations of 30 cents, according to LSEG.\nSince Gass took over as the retailer's CEO, she's worked to cut off underperforming parts of the business. In May, the company announced it would sell its Dockers brand to Authentic Brands Group.\nShe's also worked to drive direct sales to consumers, focused on e-commerce and stores rather than wholesale partners like Macy's and Kohl's, because it comes with higher margins and gives the company better insights into its customers.\n\"We are operating with greater rigor and discipline and really infusing the entire company with a [direct-to-consumer] first mindset,\" said Gass on a call with analysts. \"Our owned and operated channels represent over half of our business, and they continue to deliver consistent, healthy comps alongside improving profitability.\"\nWhile e-commerce comes with better data insights into shoppers, it can be a costly and complex channel to operate and it's tough for some companies to make money from digital sales. That was true for Levi's too, but online sales are now profitable because it's able to leverage its costs better through scale, Singh told analysts.\nDuring the quarter, Levi's gross margin reached what it called a record 62.6%, driven by fewer markdowns, lower product costs and 11% growth in direct sales.\nLevi's, which has long catered to a male shopper, is also trying to win over female consumers and expand from a denim company to one known for a wide range of apparel. During the quarter, it saw wins from those efforts, with revenue for women's apparel up 14% and sales of tops up 16%. Levi's women's category is the retailer's \"highest gross margin business,\" said Singh.\n\"The consumer is definitely responding and voting for this direction. So as we look ahead, we're confident,\" Gass told CNBC. \"We know that there's uncertainty in the world right now, but the consumer is proving quite resilient for Levi's.\"\nAt the core of Levi's strategy is ensuring it's still relevant with consumers. A recent partnership with Beyonce has helped the company stay top of mind with shoppers, especially as the singer continues her Cowboy Carter tour.\nIn May, the company launched a limited-edition drop of Beyonce x Levi's T-shirts, the first product to come from the collaboration.\nIt also started a partnership with Nike, which went live on Thursday on Levi's website and some of its stores. The collection includes a denim-inspired take on the Air Max 95.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 22:15:09 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

Federal job cuts are a big reason", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/virginia-drops-top-states-for-business-america-ranking.html", "text": "Six months into his second term in office, President Trump has begun to fundamentally change the relationship between the federal government and the states. In the process, he has shaken up CNBC's annual competitiveness ranking, America's Top States for Business.\nVirginia, last year's No. 1 state and a top three finisher in each of the last five years, slips to fourth place in 2025 — its worst showing since 2018 — and cedes the No. 1 spot to North Carolina.\nA major reason is a drop in the state's Economy ranking, to No. 14 in 2025 from No. 11 last year. Economy is the heaviest weighted category in the study under this year's methodology as more states pitch themselves as safe havens in a potential downturn.\nVirginia is already seeing a small downturn of sorts, as the Trump administration sets out to slash the federal workforce. That hits The Old Dominion where it lives.\nThe federal government accounted for more than 144,000 jobs in Virginia last year, according to the Congressional Research Service. That is a larger percentage of the workforce than any state except Maryland and Hawaii. And that doesn't include Virginians who work for federal contractors, or commute to federal jobs elsewhere in the D.C. metro area. Include all of those, and the number approaches 300,000.\nIn May, Virginia was one of only three states whose unemployment rate rose from the prior month, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The state is still adding jobs each month, albeit at a slower pace than last year, and Virginia's 3.4% unemployment rate in May was still below the national average. But the slowdown — and the fact that many of the federal job cuts have yet to be reflected in the official numbers — concerns University of Virginia economist Eric Scorsone, Executive Director of the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service.\n\"Virginia has been an economy, historically, that is pretty resilient,\" he said. \"But now, we're seeing something quite different, where Virginia is seeing some job losses, or at least job stagnation, whereas the nation as a whole is still creating jobs.\"\nThe Center's most recent forecast, published in April, calls for the state to lose 32,000 jobs this year, with the job losses accelerating as the year goes on.\nWhile Scorsone said those job losses will occur primarily in the federal sector, he also sees a ripple effect.\n\"Things like leisure and accommodations,\" he said. \"As people lose jobs, they're going to spend less on those things, [and] maybe in retail,\" he added.\n'Virginia has jobs,' Governor Youngkin insists\nGov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, says the state can absorb those federal job cuts.\nIn February, the state launched a web site, VirginiaHasJobs.com, targeting displaced workers with job listings and other resources from across the state.\n\"We have 250,000 open jobs posted that are unfilled. And so, there's a great opportunity for folks to find a new opportunity, new job, new career,\" Youngkin said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on April 15.\nA recent check of the site showed that the number of openings has shrunk to 199,000 as jobs have been filled and private sector hiring has slowed. That still would appear to be more than enough for the federal workers likely to be displaced. But Scorsone said it is not that simple.\n\"Virginia's federal workforce is different than, say, other states. Our workforce tends to be highly educated, professional executive level,\" he said. \"Many of the jobs that are open may be in different sectors, like health care. You can't just easily move into a health care job if that's not your area of expertise,\" he added.\nIn his CNBC appearance in April, Youngkin acknowledged the likelihood that the state will lose jobs, and that the private sector alternatives will not be an exact fit for many displaced government employees.\n\"Listen, they're not perfect matches,\" he said. \"They're high paying, good jobs that require someone to possibly get some retraining or re-skilling, or go into a new field, but they're really good jobs.\"\nYoungkin said the budget cuts, and job losses, are necessary. \"We need to rein in spending and re-establish fiscal reality back into the federal government,\" he said, adding that Virginia goes into the upheaval from a position of strength. \"We're seeing record surpluses in our budgets. We're able to use those surpluses to reduce taxes and invest in education and law enforcement and other investments in business development,\" Youngkin said.\nIndeed, Virginia is still a business powerhouse, with the top Education ranking in the CNBC study, and the second best rating for Infrastructure.\nOver time, no state has performed better than Virginia in the CNBC rankings. The state has taken top honors six times since the project began in 2007.\nBut in 2025, with economic anxiety rising, Virginia's economic situation is just shaky enough to take it down a few pegs.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 15:00:28 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

A decision on the application is expected at the end of July, and Tesla has \"expressed interest in operating within the Phoenix Metro area,\" the spokesperson said via email.\nReuters first reported Tesla's Arizona ambitions.\nThe effort to expand to Arizona comes after Tesla in June began a pilot test of its robotaxis in Austin, Texas.

The news Microsoft will be the next megacap to hit a $4 trillion stock market value, according to Wedbush, which predicts it will happen \"this summer.\" Larger-scale artificial intelligence deals are accelerating, lead analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients Thursday. \"Many Microsoft customers [are] now focused on deploying enterprise use cases across a number of verticals with financials, government, and retail clear standouts,\" he added. Even with Microsoft shares closing Wednesday at a record high of just over $503 each, Ives said the Club stock \"still has yet to price in\" the upcoming wave of cloud and artificial intelligence growth and its ability to keep a competitive edge even against other big players like Alphabet and fellow Club name Amazon . A less than $40 per share move higher in Microsoft stock would take it over $4 trillion. MSFT YTD mountain Microsoft YTD Wedbush on Thursday also raised its 12-month Microsoft price target to $600 per share from $515 — implying 19% upside to the prior closing price. That PT would push Microsoft well on its way to $5 trillion, which Ives thinks could happen over the next 18 months. He maintained his outperform buy rating on the stock. Big picture It's no surprise that Wedbush thinks Microsoft will soon join Nvidia , which on Wednesday became the first company even to enter the $4 trillion club. Shares of Nvidia, also a major portfolio name and AI leader, did not close there. However, some late-session strength Thursday could give it a shot. As for Microsoft, the Street has dramatically changed its tune following its stellar earnings beat after the market closed on April 30. The quarter crushed speculation about slowing Azure cloud growth and a deceleration in AI. The stock was already swinging higher from its lowest 2025 close on April 8, which happened before President Donald Trump paused his \"reciprocal\" tariffs. Shares experienced an earnings-driven 7.6% rally on May 1 and have hardly looked back since. Last week, Microsoft announced its biggest round of layoffs of the year, which should help control costs as the company continues to spend on AI within cloud. Ives pointed out Microsoft's \"capex guidance of $80 billion for FY25 and continuing to grow into FY26 as MSFT looks to continue its data center buildouts to keep pace with scaling laws and capitalize on strong demand trajectory.\" Bottom line Jim Cramer has been feeling much better about Microsoft recently, adding the stock to his latest acronym, M-N-M (like M & M, get it).

In May, Temu temporarily stopped shipping from China to the U.S. But as the trade war hits all the goods manufacturers across Asia, some retail experts say Temu and Shein may ultimately prevail with business models designed to eke out margins in a tough environment.\n\"The trade wars can help Shein and Temu,\" said Les Mandelbaum, president of modern home decor company, Umbra, which makes its goods in Vietnam. \"The Trump administration thinks they have been weakened, but even with the tariffs, they are the cheaper alternative for consumers. The companies have been flexible in adapting, and they have warehouses in the U.S. I don't think they are weakened to the degree the administration hoped.\"\nEd Sander, analyst at Tech Buzz China, said that by the surface numbers, the two Asian low-cost retailers have been clearly weakened by the trade war. Even with a pause in the steepest tariffs on Chinese goods, direct-to-consumer shipments from China after the cancellation of the de minimis tax exemption reach a tariff rate of 54%, and that has erased a significant amount of the price advantage that Temu and Shein previously had.\nBut Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at U.K.-based financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC that due to the nature of their business models, \"They are still likely to be formidable competition.\"\nTemu and Shein can manufacture and distribute products \"super-cheaply,\" she says, and they have no brick-and-mortar stores to support, while also relying on low-wage manufacturing locations. In addition, the companies \"have been known for implementing aggressive cost-cutting measures throughout the supply chain,\" Streeter added.\nThe Asian manufacturing methods have raised serious concerns about materials sustainability, the environmental impact of production, and human rights violations in the labor force that may be required to sustain the low price tags. But the bottom line, according to Streeter, is that \"the playing field is not level, despite the tariff changes.\"\n\"Although a growing number of consumers are increasingly concerned about sustainability and human rights, and may resist the lure of the fast fashion giants, households on tight budgets are likely to be tempted by price, rather than reputation,\" she said.\nPrice hikes to come, fear of 'consumer goods depression'\nThat is Mandelbaum's primary concern, as his company has cut down on products being manufactured overseas and exported to the U.S., shifting products to Europe, the company's second-largest market, and other parts of the world. The U.S. represents half of his company's sales.\n\"When you have a brand to protect and an original product, you have material standards and your price reflects that,\" Mandelbaum said. Temu and Shein may end up being beneficiaries of the trade war as consumers look to trade down in brands. \"There is a great appetite from the American consumer looking to pay for cheaper copies. I see more people worried about their money and that has translated into a hesitancy to spend, and they are less quality conscious,\" he said.\nUmbra has held back on raising prices on some of its items, but depending on product margin, has increased some prices up to 10%. \"On the lower-priced goods, we have not, and some of those products we are no longer exporting to the U.S. because a sale at a loss is not a sale,\" he said.\nMany of the price increases expected in retail have yet to hit, but prices are slowly creeping up, according to Dana Telsey, CEO of the retail research firm Telsey Advisory Group.\n\"Right now, we seem to be just seeing seasonal pricing swings, but in my view many of the price increases will begin mid to late summer, particularly surrounding the back-to-school time period,\" Telsey said. \"For the most part, the price increases will be more on the unique items. Many of the retailers in their most recent commentary have spoken to price increases on a select number of goods and what seems to be around an average mid-single digit percentage rate increase.\"\nTech Buzz China research has shown that Temu loses some of its competitiveness when tariffs are higher than 50%. That was why it completely stopped shipping packages to the U.S. at the end of April, according to Sander. Instead, it focused on shipping from local warehouses in the U.S., where import taxes have already been paid for the goods. That is a strategy to survive, if not thrive in the U.S. \"The disadvantage is that the price difference with other platforms is smaller when shipments are done from U.S. warehouses,\" Sanders said, citing Temu's aim to be 85% of Amazon's price.\nTemu restarted its direct-to-consumer package shipments from China after the May tariffs pause which pushes out the steepest tariffs on Chinese goods to August, and the DTC shipping strategy is expected to be fully reinstated by the end of July. But what ultimately happens between the U.S. and China in trade talks looms large for the two companies. \"If Temu and Shein will be beneficiaries will largely depend on what will happen to the tariffs after these 90 days and if they can maintain their price advantage,\" Sander said.\nTemu and Shein have proven to be highly innovative and adaptive, according to Drew Bernstein, co-chairman and co-CEO of accounting firm Marcum Asia, which specializes in working with Asia-based firms. \"We will see how they adjust their sourcing and supply chain strategies to recapture the U.S. customers they have worked so hard to win,\" he said. But for now, he added, other international markets are playing a bigger role, with 95% of Temu's sales going to non-U.S. markets in the second quarter. \"Whether this flood of cheap goods will lead those markets also to erect new tariff barriers remains to be seen,\" he added.\nBut Bernstein thinks it is too early to talk with certainty about American consumers \"trading down,\" given that jobs data continues to be solid and the tax cuts included in the newly passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\nMandelbaum says the existing economic uncertainty has been enough to do the damage. \"We are in a consumer goods depression globally,\" he said. \"I have never seen people stay put for so long. People are hesitant to move. Normally, when people move, they buy new home goods. When you stay put, you don't normally do that,\" he said.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 18:25:55 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

Proceeds from the Pentagon investment will be used to expand MP's rare earths processing capacity and magnet production, the company said.\nShares of MP Materials soared about 50% to close at $45.23. Its market capitalization grew to $7.4 billion, an increase of about $2.5 billion from the previous trading session.\nRare earths are used in magnets that are key components in a range of military weapons systems including the F-35 warplane, drones and submarines, according to the Defense Department.\nThe U.S. was almost entirely dependent on foreign countries for rare earths in 2023, with China representing about 70% of imports, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Rare earths have been a central point of contention in recent trade disputes between the U.S. and China.\nInterior Secretary Doug Burgum said in April that the Trump administration was considering making direct equity investments in critical mineral companies to break U.S. dependence on China.\nMP Materials CEO James Litinsky described the Pentagon investment as a public-private partnership that will speed the buildout of an end-to-end rare earth magnet supply chain in the U.S.\n\"I want to be very clear, this is not a nationalization,\" Litinsky told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Thursday. \"We remain a thriving public company. We now have a great new partner in our economically largest shareholder, DoD, but we still control our company. We control our destiny. We're shareholder driven.\"\nU.S. miners are facing a unique threat from \"Chinese mercantilism,\" Litinsky said. The Pentagon investment in MP could serve as a model for similar deals with other U.S. companies, the CEO said.\n\"It's a new way forward to accelerate free markets, to get the supply chain on shore that we want and make sure that mercantilism is not going to hurt our ability to do so,\" Litinsky said.\nPublic-private partnership\nThe Pentagon is buying a newly created class of preferred shares convertible into MP Materials' common stock, in addition to a warrant convertible at $30.03 a share for 10 years that allows the U.S. to buy additional common stock.\nExercising the convertible preferred shares and the warrant would leave the Pentagon holding about a 15% stake in MP Materials as of July 9, nearly twice the 8.61% held by Litinsky and the 8.27% held by BlackRock Fund Advisors, according to FactSet data.\nMP Materials will build its second magnet manufacturing facility in the U.S. to serve defense and commercial customers with support from the Pentagon. The facility, whose location wasn't disclosed, is expected to start commissioning in 2028 and will bring MP Materials rare earth magnet manufacturing capacity to 10,000 metric tons annually.\nThis manufacturing capacity is enough to \"meaningfully support U.S. defense and commercial needs,\" Litinsky told investors on a call Thursday morning.\nThe Pentagon has agreed to buy 100% of the magnets made at the new facility, called 10X, for 10 years after the plant is built to support defense needs and the commercial market. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are providing $1 billion to help finance the manufacturing facility.\nThe Pentagon is also guaranteeing a minimum price of $110 per kilogram for 10 years for neodymium-praseodymium oxide, or NdPr, that is stockpiled or sold by MP Materials. NdPr is a rare earth compound used to make permanent magnets.\nIf the market price is below $110 per kilogram, the U.S. will pay MP Materials the difference in a quarterly cash payment, Litinsky said. The Pentagon, in turn, will receive 30% of the upside above $110 per kilogram once MP Materials' second magnet facility is operational, the CEO said.\nThe Defense Department negotiated a very tough deal, Litinsky said. \"The taxpayers are going to make a lot of money,\" the CEO said.\nMP Materials also expects to receive a $150 million loan in 30 days from the Pentagon to expand its rare earth separation capabilities at Mountain Pass.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 20:14:51 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

The fundamentals of the study, now in its 19th year, are the same as they have always been, identifying the factors companies consider year after year when making site selection decisions, and that states pitch in their efforts to woo business. Each category is weighted based on how frequently states use them as a selling point in economic development marketing materials, with Economy No. 1 this year.\nNew in 2025, we have added metrics to gauge the states' risks from a trade war and a shrinking federal budget. We have also enhanced some of our Infrastructure metrics to determine how the states are delivering on companies' power and data demands. We developed our criteria and metrics in consultation with a diverse array of business and policy experts, and the states. Our study is not an opinion survey. We use data from a variety of sources to measure the states' performance. Under our methodology, states can earn a maximum of 2,500 points.

They include a claim that the school has \"Equity Advisors\" focused on equity in recruitment, and that GMU has a Task Force on Anti-Racism and Inclusive Excellence.\nThe complaint also alleges that Washington provided guidance to faculty that a prospective candidate who surpassed certain requirements for a position would be hired based on his or her \"diversity... even if that candidate may not have better credentials than the other candidate,\" according to the education department.\nGeorge Mason says it only received notice of the investigation Thursday, at the same time that news organizations did.\n\"George Mason University again affirms its commitment to comply with all federal and state mandates,\" the school said in a statement. \"The university consistently reviews its policies and practices to ensure compliance with federal laws, updated executive orders, and on-going agency directives.\"\nIn March, following a directive from President Donald Trump to comply with federal DEI policies, Washington announced the university was renaming its DEI office the \"Office of Access, Compliance, and Community.\"\n\"I am pleased to confirm that, after an initial review of our policies and practices, George Mason meets all of these federal mandates,\" Washington wrote at the time, adding that the review found \"no evidence\" of any discriminatory practices.\nThursday's probe marks the second this month for GMU, which was notified last week by the OCR that it was being investigated for allegedly failing to \"respond effectively to a pervasively hostile environment\" for Jewish community members.\nThat investigation mirrors similar ones launched into Harvard University and Columbia University, amid an intensifying Trump attack on higher education.\nSome of the schools that have been targeted by the Trump administration, such as the University of California, Berkeley, have long traditions of nurturing progressive ideas and fostering a diverse, inclusive campus.\nBut George Mason is not one of these schools.\nIn 2016, its law school was named after the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia after politically conservative donors gave tens of millions of dollars for the naming rights.\nIt has also received millions of dollars in donations from foundations affiliated with, and funded by, Charles H. Koch, the reclusive billionaire known for bankrolling conservative think tanks and libertarian causes.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 21:04:26 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

Delta says segmentation is coming to high-end cabins", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/delta-premium-seats.html", "text": "Delta Air Lines is studying new types of airplane tickets — this time in the premium cabins at the front of the plane.\nAirlines spent years slicing up their coach cabins, from extra legroom seats to bare-bones basic economy fares that don't allow changes or include a seat assignment. Delta was a pioneer in the U.S. when it launched basic economy fares over a decade ago with rivals United Airlines, American Airlines and others following suit.\nBut now airline executives are turning their focus to their premium cabins, where demand is holding up better this year than in the back of the plane.\n\"Premium has certainly been where our margins have continued to expand, and so we're highly focused on continuing to provide improved service to those customers and more segmentation,\" Delta President Glen Hauenstein said on an earnings call with analysts on Thursday. \"The segmentation that we've done in main cabin is kind of the template that we're going to bring to all of our premium cabins over time because different people have different needs.\"\nDelta's revenue from premium seats like business class rose 6% in the first half of the year to $10.6 billion, while main cabin economy ticket revenue dropped 4% to $11.7 billion. The carrier, the most profitable U.S. airline, has said for years that its share of sales from high-end seats and its lucrative loyalty program has been growing.\nU.S. carriers have largely ditched international first class in favor of larger business class cabins, where lie-flat seats have more amenities than seats of past decades.\nHauenstein declined to detail possible changes to the premium seats. It's not clear whether Delta would consider a cheaper first- or business-class ticket that might not include perks like lounge access or seat assignments, or a potentially bigger seat that could come with add-ons that standard tickets don't have.\nBut Hauenstein said Delta is testing some possibilities on customers and surveying travelers.\n\"We haven't rolled it out yet, not because we don't have the technological capability, but we want to make sure that customers understand what we're putting in market and that they find value in it,\" he said.\nHenry Harteveldt, travel consultant and president of Atmosphere Research Group, said he's not convinced that Delta would consider a stripped-down premium fare.\n\"Airplanes are expensive … and it's a lot easier when you give your passengers a reason to pay you more for your product than to pay you less,\" he said.\nOther airlines are working to outfit their top-tier cabins to offer a few seats that have extra room and even space for a visitor, like United's planned update to its long-haul Polaris cabin and American's new seats on some of its Boeing 787 Dreamliners.\nDelta's partner, Virgin Atlantic, offers the \"Retreat Suite\" at the front of its Airbus A330's Upper Class cabin that can be converted \"so up to four people can enjoy an intimate dinner together in their own private social space.\"\nWhen asked whether Delta will update some of its highest-end seats, CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC Wednesday that \"the premium products have had life cycles … and what we thought was state of the art six or seven years ago no longer is.\n\"We're continuing to upgrade and update it. So that's part of the cost of business,\" he said. \"But our product will be very, very nice.\"", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 19:51:20 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

He considered walking away, when a customer offered him $500,000 to buy the business in 2015.\nNow, a decade later, the business is worth $1.25 billion — following a $125 million fundraising round led by Cox Enterprises, the company announced on June 12. The new funding round means Gecko's valuation has nearly doubled since December 2023, when it was valued at $633 million in a different fundraising round.\nGecko began in 2012, when Loosararian and some of his electrical engineering classmates at Pennsylvania's Grove City College built a 40-pound robot with an ultrasonic scanner to climb and scan a local power plant's walls, hoping to identify costly issues in need of repair, like cracks or corrosion. The robot ended up saving the power plant millions of dollars in productivity and labor costs, Loosararian told CNBC Make It on November 23.\nLoosararian, Gecko's co-founder and CEO, decided to turn the school project into a full-time business after graduating in 2013 — hoping to build robots that could help inspect critical infrastructure of all kinds. He did it against the advice of his family and professors, he said.\n\"Everyone said, 'Don't f---ing do it,'\" said Loosararian, whose company ranks No. 30 on the 2025 CNBC Disruptor 50 list.\nDON'T MISS: A step-by-step guide to buying your first home—and avoiding costly mistakes\nHe spent nearly three years struggling to bootstrap Gecko, sleeping on friends' couches and facing bankruptcy while working 100-hour weeks, he said. Sometimes, his workplace was the \"dirty and horrible\" insides of power plant boilers, fixing early robot prototypes when they malfunctioned, he added.\nLoosararian considered giving up and walking away multiple times during that stretch, he said. But he still figured that running his own company was better than working for someone else, and the more time he spent with Gecko's customers, the more he convinced himself that his business was viable, he said.\n\"What helped me get through it was spending time with customers and hearing how important the problem was to solve ... That gave me the encouragement I needed to feel I wasn't just fooling myself,\" said Loosararian.\nIn 2016, Loosararian's resilience finally paid dividends when Gecko got accepted to Silicon Valley startup accelerator Y Combinator, paving the way for the business to land seed funding from the accelerator and its network of investors.\nToday, Gecko makes robots armed with AI technology that can climb walls, fly and even swim underwater to inspect and collect data on critical infrastructure like power plants, bridges, dams and military equipment. Its clients include the U.S. Navy, power plant operator NAES and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, according to the company.\nLoosararian's early struggles only solidified his resolve to stick it out as a bootstrapping founder, he said: \"Those scars allow you to act with confidence, courage and a will to make [your goals] become reality.

Much of his wealth comes from his roughly 3.5% stake in Nvidia, which is currently the world's most valuable public company.\nNvidia's market cap briefly passed $4 trillion on Wednesday, making it the first to ever reach that benchmark, and its stock is up roughly 22%, year-to-date. In the technology industry's artificial intelligence arms race, Nvidia's computer chips have become valuable components for multiple leading AI developers.\nThe company currently has a market cap of $4 trillion. Its market valuation could peak near $6 trillion, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah said in a client note on Wednesday, according to Forbes.\nDON'T MISS: A step-by-step guide to buying your first home—and avoiding costly mistakes\nBuffett's $144 billion estimated net worth has also grown since January 1 — by $2.19 billion, according to Bloomberg. His conglomerate holding company Berkshire Hathaway has performed well in 2025 — its stock is up approximately 5%, year-to-date — but given Nvidia's growth rate, Huang could soon overtake Buffett on the list of world's richest people.\nBuffett, 94, has also given away some of his wealth. He recently donated $6 billion to five different charities, and has now given over $60 billion of his fortune away over the past two decades — a number that's \"substantially more than my entire net worth in 2006,\" Buffett announced in a press release on June 27. (Buffett's net worth that year was $46 billion, and he was the world's second-wealthiest person, behind Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, according to Forbes.)\nOf course, Huang's net worth isn't guaranteed to surpass Buffett's. Despite Nvidia's year-to-date stock growth, the business has experienced large market swings in both directions in 2025.\nNvidia's shares dropped 17% in one day on January 27, after a report that Chinese AI lab DeepSeek used reduced-capacity chips from Nvidia to power its then-new language model, sparking panic in investors. It was the biggest single-day drop for a U.S. company in history, with Nvidia losing almost $600 billion in market cap, CNBC reported at the time.\nThe company's stock then fell 9% in one day on March 3, after U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on Mexico, where the company hosts a portion of its manufacturing. But the company has been on a winning streak on Wall Street since June, perhaps a sign that investors' concerns have quelled — at least, for now.\nHuang co-founded Nvidia with fellow engineers Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem in 1993, when he was just 30 years old. None of them had never run a company before, which may have worked in their favor, Huang told the \"Acquired\" podcast, in an episode that aired on October 15, 2023.\n\"If we realized the pain and suffering, just how vulnerable you're going to feel, and the challenges that you're going to endure, the embarrassment and the shame, and the list of all the things that go wrong, I don't think anybody would start a company,\" said Huang.\n\"I think that's the superpower of an entrepreneur,\" he added. \"They don't know how hard it is, and they only ask themselves, 'How hard can it be?'\"\nAre you ready to buy a house?

{"title": "Trump's tariffs on Brazil could make your coffee even more expensive", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/trump-brazil-tariffs-could-raise-coffee-prices.html", "text": "President Donald Trump's proposed 50% tariff on Brazilian imports is bad news for coffee drinkers.\nBrazil, the largest U.S. supplier of green coffee beans, accounts for about a third of the country's total supply, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nCoffee beans need to grow in a warm, tropical climate, making Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only suitable places in the United States to farm the crop. But, as the world's top consumer of coffee, the U.S. requires a massive supply to stay caffeinated. Mintel estimates that the U.S. coffee market reached $19.75 billion last year.\nThe increase in trade duties could leave consumers with even higher costs after several years of soaring coffee prices. Inflation-weary consumers have seen prices for lattes and cold brew climb as droughts and frost hit the global coffee supply, particularly in Brazil. Earlier this year, coffee bean futures hit all-time highs. They rose 1% on Thursday, although still well below the record set in February.\nTo be sure, there's still time for Brazil to strike a deal with the White House before the tariffs go into effect on Aug. 1. Plus, food and beverage makers are hoping that the Trump administration will grant exemptions for key commodities. U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in an interview in late June that the White House is considering exemptions for produce that can't be grown in the U.S. — including coffee.\nBut if that doesn't happen, coffee companies like Folgers owner J.M. Smucker, Keurig Dr Pepper, Starbucks and Dutch Bros will face much higher costs for the commodity. Giuseppe Lavazza, chair of Italian roaster Lavazza, said on Bloomberg TV on Thursday morning that the latest tariff could mean \"a lot of inflation\" for the coffee industry.\nRoasters will try to mitigate the impact of the higher tariff, but it won't be easy.\n\"Every company is always trying to eke out the next efficiency, to dial into their operations or find the way to minimize inflationary pressures, but a 50% tariff on a commodity that fundamentally is not available in the U.S. — you can't really do much with that,\" Tom Madrecki, vice president of supply chain and logistics for the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group that represents the consumer packaged goods industry.\nOne mitigation tactic could be to import beans from countries other than Brazil, but companies will likely still be paying more for the commodity.\n\"A characteristic of tariffs, especially when you have tariffs on multiple countries at once, is that not just the inbound cost rises. It allows the pricing floor to also rise,\" Madrecki said. \"If you have cheaper coffee in a country different than Brazil, you're not inclined to sell it at a 30% lower cost. You're going to try to bump your coffee up a bit more, too.\"\nAt-home coffee brands, like JM Smucker's Dunkin' and Kraft Heinz's Maxwell House, have already been hiking their prices this year in response to spiking commodity costs. More price increases could be on the way for consumers, although retailers may push back.\nKeurig Dr Pepper would consider additional price hikes in the latter half of the year to mitigate the impact of tariffs, CEO Tim Cofer said in late April, after Trump introduced his initial round of so-called reciprocal duties.\nAnd Smuckers warned investors on its quarterly conference call in early June that tariffs on coffee were weighing on its profits. Coffee accounts for roughly a third of the company's revenue.\n\"Green coffee is an unavailable natural resource that cannot be grown in the continental United States due to its reliance on a tropical climate,\" Smuckers CEO Mark Smucker said. \"We currently purchase approximately 500 million pounds of green coffee annually, with the majority coming from Brazil and Vietnam, the two largest coffee-producing countries.\"\nVietnam, which announced a tentative trade deal with the White House earlier this month, supplies about 8% of the U.S.'s green coffee beans. Under the agreement, the U.S. will impose a 20% duty on Vietnamese imports.\nConsumers who prefer a caramel macchiato from Starbucks for their caffeine hit will likely see a more muted impact on their wallets.\nAfter several quarters of sluggish U.S. sales, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said in late 2024 that the company wouldn't raise prices in 2025, in the hopes of winning back customers who had complained about how expensive its drinks had gotten. While it waits for its turnaround to take hold, Starbucks might choose to swallow the higher coffee costs.\nThe coffee giant also benefits from its diversity — both in suppliers and the breadth of its menu, which now includes the popular Refreshers line. Starbucks imports its coffee from 30 different countries, and roughly 10% of its cost of goods sold in North America comes from coffee.\nThe new trade duty could mean a 0.5% increase in Starbucks' North American cost of goods sold, assuming about 22% of its beans come from Brazil, TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Starbucks' packaged drinks, which are distributed by Nestle, could see their cost of goods sold increase 3.5%. Altogether, that represents a 5-cent drag on annual earnings per share, according to Charles.\nFor rival Dutch Bros, higher coffee costs also wouldn't hurt its bottom line much. Coffee accounts for less than a tenth of the drive-thru coffee chain's cost of goods sold. Assuming that Dutch Bros sources more than half of its coffee from Brazil, its cost of goods sold would rise just 1.3%, according to Charles' estimates.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 19:22:21 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

Here's how to get a good deal", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/trump-big-beautiful-bill-ends-7500-ev-tax-credit-time-to-buy-vehicle.html", "text": "President Donald Trump's signature on his so-called big beautiful bill was a death blow for tax credits that lowered the cost of electric vehicles.\nThose tax credits — worth up to $7,500 and $4,000 for purchases of new and used EVs, respectively — won't be available after Sept. 30. Another tax break that's ending lets dealers pass along savings on EV leases.\nThe credits were supposed to last for another seven years, through 2032.\nAnalysts think the abrupt end to these federal subsidies will trigger a rush by consumers to buy or lease an EV in coming months.\n\"This is going to be the summer of the EV,\" Ingrid Malmgren, senior policy director at Plug In America, a nonprofit advocating for a quicker transition to electric cars, previously told CNBC.\nAutomakers have certainly taken notice.\nTesla, the nation's largest EV maker, has taken to email blasts and social media to spread the word that the federal tax credits are soon disappearing.\n\"If there ever was a time to yolo your car purchase, it's now,\" the carmaker wrote Tuesday on X. (YOLO means you only live once.)\n\"Order Soon to Get Your $7,500,\" read a separate Tesla newsletter emailed Tuesday.\n(Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO and former head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, spoke out against the legislation that axed the tax credits, lambasting the trillions of dollars it adds to the national debt.)\n'Sense of urgency'\nThis is a theme consumers will likely see through the summer, analysts said.\nAutomakers and dealers will likely \"promote a sense of urgency: 'Buy now, the EV incentive is going away,'\" said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.\nAnother factor that may speed up purchases: Consumers must have the vehicle in their possession by Sept. 30, Malmgren said in an interview after the bill passed.\nMore from Personal Finance:\n'Big beautiful bill' doesn't eliminate taxes on Social Security\nTax changes under Trump's 'big beautiful bill' — in one chart\nTrump's 'big beautiful bill' slashes CFPB funding\nIn the eyes of the IRS, it won't be enough that consumers order one by Sept. 30 and take possession later, Malmgren said. They must be driving it off the lot by that deadline, she said.\n\"Having this deadline so soon, just in a couple months, definitely lights a fire under people's butts,\" Malmgren said. \"I expect that people who are kind of thinking about it or on the fence about it may take action now.\"\nConsumers will likely see some \"really good\" financial incentives like discounts or financing deals before Sept. 30, on top of the federal tax credits, Valdez Streaty said.\nFor example, Ford extended a \"complimentary home charger and standard installation offer\" in the U.S. until Sept. 30, Stacey Ferreira, the automaker's director of U.S. sales strategy, wrote on the company's website Tuesday.\n'The training wheels are being taken off'\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, which provided historic investments by the U.S. to fight climate change, created, extended or enhanced tax breaks (including the EV credit) meant to reduce the nation's planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.\nEVs are \"unambiguously better for the climate\" than gasoline-powered cars, even when looking across the entire lifecycle of the vehicle, from manufacturing to recycling, according to researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nHowever, they're generally more expensive — a primary sticking point for would-be buyers, Valdez Streaty said.\nThe average transaction price for a new EV in June was about $56,000, before any tax credits or incentives, according to Cox Automotive data. By comparison, the average price for all new vehicles was about $49,000, it said.\nFinancial incentives have helped bring EVs closer to price parity with traditional cars, and indeed, there's hardly a price premium for some models, analysts said.\nThe average EV buyer got financial incentives worth over $8,400 in June, in addition to federal tax credits, Valdez Streaty said. Consumers may also be eligible for subsidies offered by their state or electric utility, Malmgren said.\nThe end of the federal EV tax credits is like \"the training wheels are being taken off\" of a nascent technology, Valdez Streaty said. \"And those training wheels have helped balance and support EV adoption.\"\nWhile EVs are generally more expensive upfront, they may save consumers money over the long term, since recurring charges for maintenance and fuel are generally cheaper, experts said.\nWhat to know before getting an EV\nStart soon: EV demand may surge if there's a rush to buy this summer, and prices may rise if supply is constrained, analysts said. It's in consumers' best interest to start sooner rather than later, they said. Ensure your dealer has registered with the IRS to provide a federal tax credit before buying, they said.\nStack tax credits: \"Do your research to figure out what credits you're eligible for,\" Valdez Streaty said. Consumers may be able to stack subsidies from the federal government, and their state and utility company, analysts said. \"Stacking of EV credits\" can be a strong value proposition, especially in areas where gasoline prices are high and electricity rates are low, Valdez Streaty said.\nLook at used EVs: \"There are a ton of great deals on used EVs,\" Malmgren said. \"If I were shopping for a vehicle right now, that's what I'd be looking at.\" Used EVs are comparable on price to used gasoline-powered cars, have far fewer maintenance issues, and have strong warranties on their batteries and drive train, she said.\nConsider a lease: Buying a new EV comes with various eligibility requirements for the driver and car to qualify for a tax credit. Leasing sidesteps many of them — opening up those federal subsidies to a wider audience, Malmgren said. Check the lease agreement before signing to ensure the price reflects the tax credit.\nOpt for upfront tax credit: Consumers should opt to get their tax break upfront as a discount instead of later when filing their annual tax return, Malmgren said. \"Given all the uncertainty right now with the administration and IRS, I'd advise against doing the tax credit later,\" she said. \"Plus you compound your value because that's money you don't finance.\"", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 18:33:26 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

She also said Levi's exposure to China is minimal. The company has longstanding relationships with vendors, she continued, and since business is growing, Levi's is able to give them more volume.\n\"And then, we also are looking at our own costs, and we're taking part of it too,\" Gass said. \"We're doing everything we can to protect the consumer and protect our price points.\"\nLevi's posted earnings after the bell on Thursday, managing to comfortably beat Wall Street's expectations.

Unlike an FSA, though, the money doesn't have a \"use it or lose it\" provision. Rather, the funds sit in an account you own and can take with you should you switch jobs.\nAnother feature that sets HSAs apart: you can invest the money in the likes of stocks, bonds or exchange-traded funds. And if you invest the money in these accounts rather than spending it on pressing health-care needs, that's where some serious advantages kick in, experts say.\n\"An HSA is indeed one of the most powerful, yet underutilized, financial tools available, especially considering its unique triple tax advantage — contributions are tax-deductible, growth is tax-free and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are also tax-free,\" Sean Lovison, a certified financial planner and founder of Purpose Built Financial Services, previously told CNBC Make It.\n\"This feature positions HSAs not just as a tool for current medical expenses, but as a strategic component in long-term financial planning.\"\nNow, more people can take advantage of these accounts than ever. Here's what's changing.\nHSAs are expanding to three groups of people\nGenerally, to qualify for an HSA, you have to be enrolled in an high-deductible plan — for 2025, that means one with a deductible of at least $1,650 for individuals or $3,300 for families. You can't have any disqualifying health-care coverage, be enrolled in Medicare or be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return, among other requirements.\nUnder the new bill, three kinds of people will become eligible for an HSA for whom rules had previously been either murky or prohibitive.\n1. Everyone enrolled in bronze and catastrophic plans\nInsurance plans available on the Affordable Care Act marketplace generally fall into one of five categories: platinum, gold, silver, bronze and catastrophic. Generally, platinum plans have higher premiums and lower deductibles, and bronze and catastrophic plans (the latter are only available to people under 30 and some people with limited incomes) have lower premiums and higher deductibles.\nUntil recently, enrollees in these plans were HSA-eligible on a case-by-case basis. The new bill makes anyone covered under a bronze or catastrophic plan eligible for an HSA.\nWhile catastrophic plans aren't widely used, about 7.2 million Americans are currently covered under bronze plans, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n2. People who use direct primary care services\nUnder the new law, people enrolled in direct primary care services are eligible for an HSA, provided that their coverage meets the other HDHP requirements.\nUnder the DPC model, offered through providers such as One Medical, patients pay a recurring fee for a series of services that don't get billed to insurance — a convention that put it in a legal gray area when it came to HSA eligibility.\n\"This is really more clearing up an ambiguity issue rather than something that's going to be a paradigm shift for folks,\" says Jake Spiegel, senior research associate at the Employee Benefits Research Institute. \"What the bill says is, you can do this and still contribute to an HSA, and that's totally OK.\"\n3. Some people who use telehealth\nUnder pandemic-era legislation, including the CARES Act, high-deductible plans could waive the deductible on telehealth services — regardless of whether they were preventative — and still qualify for HSA eligibility.\nThose rules lapsed at the end of last year, but the new bill reinstated them and made them permanent.\nThat doesn't mean that high-deductible plans must offer telehealth services for enrollees to be eligible for an HSA. Rather, such plans cannot be excluded simply because they allow participants to receive telehealth without contributing toward the deductible.\nAre you ready to buy a house?

{"title": "Massachusetts is 2025’s Most Improved State for Business boosted by financial independence from D.C.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/massachusetts-most-improved-state-for-business-america.html", "text": "For 400 years, the spirit of independence has served the people of Massachusetts well. In 2025, it helped the state achieve a turnaround of sorts in CNBC's annual America's Top States for Business study.\nThe Bay State is America's most improved state in this year's rankings, rising 18 spots to No. 20 overall, after staging the biggest drop — falling 23 places — last year. Massachusetts was able to make that U-turn thanks to its relative independence from Washington. With federal budget cuts looming, this year's CNBC study considered their potential impact on each state's economy.\nEconomy is the most important category in 2025, and Massachusetts improved its ranking in the category to No. 15, from No. 40 last year.\nAccording to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, federal funds comprised 30% of Massachusetts government spending last fiscal year. That made Massachusetts the 14th least dependent state on Washington (Wyoming was the least dependent at 19%; Louisiana was the most at 50%). In addition, Massachusetts' federal workforce of about 25,000 people makes up only about half a percent of its total workforce, according to data from the Congressional Research Service. That makes the state's federal workforce the eighth-smallest in the country relative to the total.\n\"We tackle hard problems in Massachusetts. Hard stuff. Wicked hard stuff sometimes,\" Gov. Maura Healey, a Democrat, said in her State of the Commonwealth speech in January.\nShe pointed to $1.5 billion in state funding for child care to make up for federal cuts after the pandemic.\n\"We were the only state to fully replace federal support that went away,\" she said.\nMassachusetts still lags the nation in access to affordable child care, according to Child Care Aware of America, but it improved its performance this year, helping the state to an eighth-place finish in the Quality of Life category.\nHarvard vs. Trump, innovation at risk\nBut independence only goes so far, even in Massachusetts. The state is the third-largest recipient of federal health and science research grants, after New York and California. The Trump administration has taken aim at those grants nationwide, but nowhere more directly than in Massachusetts.\nSince April, the Trump administration has moved to freeze $3.2 billion in grants to Harvard University and to terminate another $100 million in federal contracts with the 389-year-old institution, accusing the university of liberal bias and of harboring antisemitism. The school has sued to block the cuts, citing the First Amendment, and the university's own efforts to curtail antisemitism on campus.\nBut Christopher Anderson, president of the Massachusetts High Technology Council — a business organization that has been advocating for the state's tech industry since 1977 — said Harvard is not the only institution threatened by the federal cuts.\n\"We do have a large number of research institutions that are critically important to generating and contributing to our innovation economy here,\" he told CNBC. \"Everyone's feeling the pinch,\" he added.\nIn May, the University of Massachusetts directed department heads to develop budget scenarios that include 3% and 5% cuts. As of mid-June, the university said it had already received $29 million less in federal research awards than at the same time a year earlier.\nTo blunt some of the impact of the cuts, the university established a matching fund that it says has committed more than $700,000 toward salaries and research funding that would otherwise be cut. But that money is a drop in the bucket, with the university normally receiving $180 million a year in federal research support, including $44 million in so-called \"indirect\" funding for facilities and administration that the administration has sought to sharply reduce.\nBudget pressures, high costs\n\"Unfortunately, the commonwealth is really not in a position to play the role of savior as perhaps it could if it had been managing its state budget more appropriately,\" Anderson said.\nAnderson said that 15 years of what he called \"unsustainable\" growth in state spending have hobbled Massachusetts at the worst possible time.\n\"At exactly the time when the federal government is cutting back, we find ourselves unable to invest quickly or effectively in the key economic development projects that are driven by powerful innovations like artificial intelligence,\" he said.\nAnderson also pointed to the Mass Leads Act, signed into law by Gov. Healey last year, which the High Technology Council supported. The four-year economic development bill purports to include hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for life science, climate technology, and artificial intelligence.\nWhile the law sets a goal of $4 billion for economic development, Anderson said only $251 million of that is currently funded due to state borrowing caps.\n\"It doesn't allow Massachusetts to keep up,\" he said.\nAn analysis by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics found Massachusetts roughly in the middle of the pack when it comes to state support for research and development, ranking 22nd in 2023.\nWhile Massachusetts improved its overall ranking in the CNBC study, it still has some serious issues beyond its budget pressures.\nIt is the second-most-expensive state to do business in, behind Hawaii. Wage costs are the highest in the nation; utility costs are the third highest. And the state ranks No. 42 for Business Friendliness, with a heavy regulatory hand.\nAnderson said the long-term solution to the state's competitive issues might be to take that independent streak a bit further, encouraging research institutions to work more closely with the private sector rather than relying on state support.\n\"This could be the beginning of a new era of collaboration between private sector companies and these institutions,\" he said.\nJoin the conversation.

Bastian said the passage of the tax and spending bill and the Trump administration rolling out more trade deals with \"less rhetoric and more action\" are giving customers more clarity and confidence.\n\"People are still traveling,\" Bastian said. \"What they've done is they've shifted their booking patterns a little bit. They're holding off making plans until they're a little closer in to their travel dates. And so that's shifted some of our bookings and yield management strategies.\"\nThat includes trimming capacity outside of top travel periods, as well as what Bastian described as \"surgical\" cuts after the peak summer travel season ends around mid-August.\nHere's how the company performed in the three months ended June 30, compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on consensus estimates from LSEG:\n- Earnings per share: $2.10 adjusted vs. $2.05 expected\n- Revenue: $15.51 billion adjusted vs. $15.48 billion expected\nDelta, the first of the U.S. airlines to report results for the three months ended June 30, expects adjusted earnings per share of between $1.25 and $1.75 in the third quarter, compared with Wall Street analysts' forecast for $1.31 a share. It also said it expects revenue that's flat to up 4%, topping forecasts for a 1.4% sales increase.\nDelta posted strong growth from sales of higher-priced seats like first class and from its lucrative American Express partnership, which increased 10% in the second quarter from the same period last year to $2 billion. Airlines have become more reliant on travelers who are willing to spend more to fly rather than more price-sensitive consumers.\nCorporate travel has also stabilized as Bastian said businesses have more clarity and confidence than they did earlier this year, but it's in line with last year, not the 5% to 10% growth Delta expected at the start of the year.\nWhile fares have dropped across the U.S., Delta's premium-product revenue rose 5%, as sales from the main cabin fell 5% from last year. Its total revenue per seat mile, a measure of how much an airline is bringing in for the amount it flies, fell 4% in the second quarter.\nBastian said Delta is prepared to continue updating its premium products.\n\"Whether it's the Delta lounges or the quality of the product on board, the premium products have had life cycles … and what we thought was state of the art six or seven years ago no longer is,\" he said. \"We're continuing to upgrade and update it.\"\nDelta has been working for years to tamp down overcrowding and long lines at Delta's popular airport Sky Clubs by building larger lounges and spaces dedicated to its top-tier Delta One cabin travelers, as well as with visit limits and other policies.\nDelta's president, Glen Hauenstein, said the airline expects to have \"almost all\" of the crowding problems resolved in the next 18 to 24 months, though he noted that one challenge is that bad weather like thunderstorms that can spark hourslong delays.\n\"You can't build a club big enough for lengthy delays,\" he said on an earnings call with analysts. \"So I think we're trying to look at alternatives that we can use as overflow in those instances.\"\nHauenstein reiterated that more customers are choosing to take European vacations after the traditional peak summer months to avoid heat waves, crowds and high hotel rates.\nIn the second quarter, Delta posted adjusted revenue of nearly $15.51 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Its net income in the three months ended June 30 totaled $2.13 billion, or $3.27 a share, up 63% on the year. That compares with net income of $1.3 billion, or $2.01 a share, in the same period last year. Adjusting for one-time items, its per-share net income was $1.37 billion, or $2.10 a share.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 20:01:20 GMT", "author": null, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html"}

It costs a fortune. It spreads death and misery, from the killing fields of Sudan to the tunnels of Gaza. It is often started out of personal hubris or blind patriotic zeal: think of Napoleon’s invasion of Russia or Japan’s decision in 1941 to provoke a war with a superpower it could not hope to defeat.

Although the arc of copper running through central Africa was first mapped by Victorian explorers and was mined by a colonial British firm, the search for deposits has been only occasionally fruitful in the years since. Kobold’s discovery is the biggest in a century. Born in California and backed by Bill Gates, the company uses everything from ancient maps to artificial intelligence in order to learn about what lies beneath the ground. Perhaps its biggest idea, though, is an economic model, pioneered at Stanford University, that helps process vast reams of information.

On July 1st he closed the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), absorbing an institution that spent 40% of its budget on sub-Saharan Africa into the State Department. The administration has yet to fill several Africa-related posts. AFRICOM, America’s military hub on the continent, speaks euphemistically of a new “African-partner-led” approach to security.

Stories are about groups in conflict, competing for limited resources, with the gains for some framed as losses for others. If China benefits from trade with America, America must lose. If foreign students enroll at American universities, that must mean fewer spots for Americans. If immigrants find work, they must be taking jobs from citizens. If a diversity initiative helps women or a racial minority, someone else must be left out. More and more, debates are shaped by a mindset that sees the world as a fixed pie—where one person’s or one group’s gain is another’s loss. That mindset is known as zero-sum thinking.

Torrential rain swept through Kerr County, in central Texas, early on July 4th. Among the dead are 27 girls and staff members carried away from a Christian summer camp as the water surged. More heavy rain is forecast this week. The charts and maps below explain what made the flood so deadly.\nPart of the cause was record rainfall in a particularly vulnerable area of the state. At the Ingram weather station near Camp Mystic—where the girls had been staying—more than 13cm (5 inches) of rain fell in 24 hours, nearly double the historical average for the whole month. In some nearby areas of Kerr County, as much as 25cm may have fallen in just a few hours.\nThe location of the downpour—at the head of the Guadalupe river—amplified its effects. Between 2.30am and 5.10am on July 4th the river rose almost nine metres (29 feet) at the Hunt water gauge near Camp Mystic. At 5.10am the river reached over 11 metres, after which the gauge stopped working for several hours. At this point more water was surging through the river than the typical flow over Niagara Falls. These levels surpassed those of a deadly flood in July 1987, when ten teenagers died while evacuating from another camp.\nKerr County and the broader Hill Country region lies in “Flash Flood Alley”, a band of central Texas that curves south from Dallas through Austin, then west via San Antonio to the Mexican border. Warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico rises over the cliffs and hills of the Balcones Escarpment. It then cools and condenses into heavy rain. This natural mechanism makes the region unusually prone to downpours, says Hatim Sharif, a hydrologist at the University of Texas at San Antonio. This weekend the amount of water vapour rose because of remnants from Tropical Storm Barry, which made landfall in Mexico on June 29th.\nThe landscape compounds the danger. Semi-arid soils soak up little water. Rain races down hills into a dense network of narrow creeks, which rise quickly. When the water surges it can sweep away buildings, vehicles and people. That danger is well known to Texans: their likelihood of dying in a flood is twice that of the average American. Between 1959 and 2019 more than 1,000 people in Texas were killed in floods—the highest death toll of any state.\nDespite the forecasts and its history of flooding, Kerr County appeared unprepared. Local news reports note that the area still lacks a flood-alarm system to notify residents and visitors: efforts to fund one have failed since 2018. The timing of the floods—in the middle of the night—may have made it harder to spread warnings and evacuate.\nQuestions are also being asked of the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Since January the National Weather Service (NWS) has lost around 560 staff—through sackings, early retirements and voluntary redundancies—reducing its workforce by 10%. Some of these roles now need to be rehired. The NWS’s offices in central Texas have unfilled posts for important positions, including a senior hydrologist and a warning-co-ordination meteorologist.\nIn an open letter published in May, former directors of the NWS who served between 1988 and 2022 warned that their “worst nightmare” was for staffing cuts to result in “needless loss of life”.

Exports have continued to grow and, despite low consumer confidence, retail sales have picked up. A manufacturing index published by Caixin, a business magazine, jumped to 50.4 in June from 48.3 the month before. “We are confident and capable of maintaining relatively rapid growth,” Mr Li trilled at the World Economic Forum’s recent meeting in Tianjin.

Initially, they peacefully expressed their anger at William Ruto, the country’s president. But by the end of the day much of downtown Nairobi was ablaze. Shop fronts were torn down and windows smashed. At least ten buildings were torched. Peter Ndengwa Mutula, a local tyre trader, says he suffered property damage worth 200,000 shillings ($1,546). Though he cannot be sure who was responsible, he believes the government deliberately “inserted itself inside the protests” in order to incite violence.

Elysia crispata, a species of these marine molluscs found in the western Atlantic and the Caribbean, is among the most notorious. When the slugs eat algae, their bodies pinch bits of the algae’s cells, known as chloroplasts, that enable photosynthesis. These are put to good use, giving the slugs their verdant hue which, along with their frilly back, earned them the moniker “lettuce slug” (see picture). They also continue to function inside the slug for about a year, providing them with photosynthetic energy. Scientists have known about this process, termed kleptoplasty, for decades.

Hidden within that firehose of information will be clues about some of the universe’s deepest mysteries—from dark matter and dark energy to the evolution of galaxies. To help scientists unlock those new celestial tales, the Rubin Observatory’s team had to invent a bespoke way to organise, analyse and share the data.

The next thing you might notice is an approaching security guard. They do not, says Neil Stubley, Wimbledon’s head of courts, like people “rolling around” on it.\nEngland is the land of the lawn. In English literature, history and life the lawn looms large. England swathed its country houses in lawns; took tea on them; invented and perfected games—like tennis and cricket—to play on them. It filled its land with lawns (there are around 24m gardens in Britain, many mostly grass). And it filled its literature with them. Evelyn Waugh’s characters lounge on them; P.G. Wodehouse’s cavort on them; Philip Larkin killed a hedgehog on one. The lawn was so sacrosanct that for decades English gardeners less gardened lawns than guarded them. In Oxford and Cambridge, beside each inviting-looking lawn stands an uninviting sign: “KEEP OFF THE GRASS”.\nWhat caused this fad? Partly it is history: from the 1740s Capability Brown, a landscape designer, ditched French-style geometry for gardens that demanded the adjective “sweeping”—then his style swept the country. Partly it is serendipity: dull English skies keep such sweeping lawns well-watered. Partly it is biology. Lawn enthusiasts like to ponder which came first, the lawn or the lawnmower? The answer is: the sheep. A lawn, says Maria Vorontsova, a grass expert at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is simply “pretty pasture” that has been “eaten by lawnmowers”.\nSnobbery played a part too: keeping grass cut short costs. Once it cost because it was so low-tech: sheep don’t come cheap, and scything is slow and heavy work. Later it cost because it was high-tech: the first lawnmower, invented in Britain in 1830, cost £1,000 ($1,360) in today’s money. Now, on Wimbledon’s centre court, between the “KEEP OFF THE GRASS” signs, a man crouches with a pair of steel scissors, snipping at stray strands of grass—a horticultural haircut, and, given hourly wages in London, a costly one.\nLawns started to represent hierarchy as well as horticulture. In “A Room of One’s Own” Virginia Woolf’s narrator is booted off an Oxbridge lawn: only men, and scholars, were allowed on the grass. It also became an eminently exportable form of Englishness. Die in the English army and, for the past 100 years, wherever you fell, your body was likely to be covered by lawn, since the organisation that buries Britain’s war dead aimed for the look of an “English churchyard” in its cemeteries in Ypres and elsewhere. Life as an Englishman might leave you. Lawns would not.\nUnless you’re Carlos Alcaraz\nImage: Francesco Montaguti for the Economist\nThe lawns at Wimbledon are not merely cut, watered, primped and preened. They are also executed when the tournament ends. Like little grassy gladiators, their lives end with the entertainment. To ensure infections don’t take hold and the grass next year is young, the court is covered with plastic, and superheated steam is piped in at 190ºC (so hot that it boils the water in the surface of the soil). Every blade dies. Wimbledon’s grass is green. Its processes are dark.\nHaughty culture\nWhich is perhaps why lawns are changing. Rewilding has become fashionable. “No Mow May” is spreading. To understand how much lawns are changing, go to King’s College, Cambridge. There, behind one of England’s most famous chapels, lies another of its most famous lawns. Today, it is barely a lawn at all; it certainly does nothing so dignified as sweep. It waves in the breeze, it buzzes with bees, it is filled with butterflies. Walk through barefoot and it will tangle your toes and scratch your legs. It will smell, faintly, of marjoram. A lawn is a subservient, almost dead, stretch of grass. Walk through this and, says Steve Coghill, the head gardener at King’s, “the whole of the meadow is alive.”\nIt began in 2018 when King’s decided to turn part of its lawn into meadow. Cambridge being Cambridge, they didn’t just stop cutting the grass: they involved soil scientists and botanists and ecologists and horticulturalists, all sorts of -ists, to ensure the right seeds were sown in the right way. They sowed the seeds (with students and mulled wine); then harvested them (with shire horses and, later, more wine).\nThen they published a scientific paper about it. The results were astonishing. Bats had increased threefold, invertebrates by 25 times. Each week, at dawn, student lepidopterists record the moths they have trapped overnight. Their names—the Grey dagger, the Nut-tree tussock—are, says Mr Coghill, “like the poetry of ‘The Faerie Queene’”. (Cambridge being Cambridge, its gardeners talk like that.)\nWhere Wimbledon executes plants, King’s has resurrected them. “The soil”, says Mr Coghill, “has memory.” Seeds of plants—clustered bellflowers, lizard orchids—that have lain dormant in Cambridge’s soil for centuries have come back to life. In the soil is a memory of another era. At one edge of the meadow is a small steel sign reading: “KEEP OFF THE GRASS”. Hidden by thistles, it is barely legible. ■\nThis article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under\nthe headline “Turf wars”\nLie down.

Other American officials were more cautious, noting that it would take time to assess the damage. Leaked preliminary intelligence reports suggest the attacks, which included the first use in battle of the GBU-57, America’s largest bunker-buster bomb, put Iran’s nuclear programme back by only a few months. The White House rejects the claims: on June 26th Pete Hegseth, America’s defence secretary, said the raid was “historically successful”, though he gave few details about the damage it inflicted. There is particular uncertainty about the amount of highly enriched uranium (HEU) Iran retains. Mapping Iran’s nuclear facilities gives a sense of the damage and how the country’s programme could endure.\nIran's nuclear facilities\nIran’s nuclear programme is distributed among several sites around the country, to make it harder to attack and disrupt.\nThe country has domestic sources of uranium. Its largest mine is at Saghand, in east-central Iran. But mined uranium is mostly the wrong type for nuclear weapons: it is over 99% uranium-238 (U-238; the number refers to the mass of each atom). Bombs require its lighter cousin, uranium-235 (U-235), which makes up just 0.7% of natural uranium.\nTo get at the lighter uranium, the metal is converted into a gas, uranium hexafluoride, and spun in centrifuges at extremely high speeds. The heavier U-238 tends to move to the outside, making the gas at the centre slightly richer in U-235. If this process is repeated many times, the concentration of U-235 can be raised as high as 90%, creating weapons-grade uranium.\nThe Natanz enrichment plant was Iran’s largest. An underground hall held around 18,400 centrifuges, according to the Institute for Science and International Security, a think-tank. The site also housed an above-ground centrifuge-research facility.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, said Israeli strikes probably caused significant damage to centrifuges in Natanz’s underground facility by taking out their power supply. America also dropped two GBU-57s on the buried part of the site.\nThe underground enrichment facility at Fordow was the main target of the American attack. Its centrifuges, though fewer in number than Natanz, were newer and more robust. The most sensitive parts of the site were thought to be buried deep under the mountainside. Media reports suggest the American strikes badly damaged the facility’s electricity supply.\nMoreover satellite imagery appears to show the GBU-57s penetrated sites near to the enrichment hall’s ventilation and access tunnels. The bombs would have sent shockwaves through the mountain, probably damaging the centrifuges. They are highly sensitive to vibration when in use—and difficult to turn off without causing damage. On June 26th the IAEA’s director, Rafael Grossi, said the centrifuges were “no longer operational” after America’s strikes.\nThe Isfahan complex houses a variety of facilities, including centrifuge-production plants and sites that turn uranium into gaseous form, which allows it to be spun and enriched. Israeli strikes targeted parts of the site used for this purpose. America later struck the complex with Tomahawk cruise missiles. Isfahan also houses a storage facility for Iran’s stock of highly enriched uranium.\nIn May the IAEA estimated that Iran had 400kg of HEU, concentrated to 60% purity. This could be developed into weapons-grade uranium relatively quickly. The amount identified would be enough for about ten bombs.\nThe whereabouts and condition of this stock is unclear. In a series of social-media posts Jeffrey Lewis, an arms-control expert at the Middlebury Institute, noted neither America nor Israel appears to have targeted the underground storage facilities near Isfahan where much of it was stored. (Other independent analysis notes the Americans did target tunnel entrances.) Mr Lewis has also suggested that no strikes have hit another big underground site near Isfahan, where the Iranians produce centrifuges and potentially house other covert activities.\nIran may have moved the uranium. Trucks were seen at Isfahan and Fordow in the days before America’s attack. There have long been concerns that Iran was hoarding undeclared centrifuges and building other secret facilities, which could allow the clandestine resumption of the programme.\nStill, dashing for a bomb would not be easy. The Iranians would have to turn the gaseous HEU back into a metallic form suitable for a bomb core, and many of the conversion facilities where this process would take place have been damaged. Meanwhile the task of “mating” a nuclear device with a projectile, such as a ballistic missile, is complex and could take substantial time. Israel’s intelligence agencies have deeply penetrated Iran’s nuclear efforts. If Israel suspects Iran is covertly working on nuclear weapons, the ceasefire between the rivals seems unlikely to hold. ■\nAmerican and Israeli strikes have done clear damage, but uncertainties remain about what has survived\n)\nAfter America’s strikes on Iran on June 22nd, Donald Trump claimed that the country’s key nuclear facilities were “totally obliterated”.

President Donald Trump said that “Operation Midnight Hammer”, had “totally obliterated” Iran’s uranium-enrichment facilities. But now an early intelligence assessment leaked on June 24th suggests the nuclear programme has only been set back by months and that some enriched uranium may have been spirited away. The report is an early “low-confidence” assessment that both the Trump administration and Israeli sources eschew. But it illuminates a bigger problem. Mr Trump wants a quick-fix to the Iran nightmare with a single, clarifying mega-strike, a ceasefire and then prosperity. Instead America faces years of uncertainty over Iran’s capabilities and intentions. As a result Mr Trump’s assumption—that he can have a one-day Middle East military triumph and then quickly secure a lasting deal—may be badly misplaced.\nCongo’s football diplomacy\nWhat is the point of the country’s sponsorship deal with AC Milan?\nGot an enemy?

{"title": "Landa Digital Printing granted protection from creditors", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001515546#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Today, the Central District Court approved the request of innovative printing machines company Landa Digital Printing, founded by serial entrepreneur Benny Landa, for a two-month stay of proceedings.\nDuring this period, which began with the filing of the request and will end at the end of August, the company’s creditors will not be able to sue it, and Landa will be able to find a possible buyer, and put together a debt settlement. The court appointed CPA Shlomi Filiba and Adv. Sigal Rozen-Rechav as administrators of the settlement in the company.\nLanda Digital Printing, which filed the application for a stay of proceedings through Adv. David Hahn, Adv. Aaron Michaeli, and Adv. Yehuda Rosenthal of Goldfarb Gross Seligman, has debt of NIS 1.7 billion arising from loans from investors and purchases of raw materials. It has raised a total of $1.3 billion from European investors, among them German companies SKion and Altana, and Singaporean-Swiss investment fund Winder, financially powerful entities under family ownership, which decided not to continue supporting the company, because of the war in the Gaza Strip.\nAccording to the company’s application for protection from its creditors, the NIS 1.7 billion debt is entirely to secured creditors, and creditors owed NIS 900 million out of the total support the application. The debt to the investors, which, as mentioned, represents the lion’s share of the company’s liabilities, arises from loans to the company. The company also owes NIS 25 million to Mizrahi Tefahot Bank, and additional sums to its employees and suppliers.\nBenny Landa invested $200 million from his own pocket in the company in the past, but in recent years his involvement in it has declined. The application for a stay of proceedings came two weeks after a downsizing in which the company laid off more than 100 employees. Now, a company mentioned as a leading candidate to buy Landa Digital Printing is HP, to which Benny Landa sold Indigo for $629 million in HP stock and potential future payments of $253 million in 2001.\nThe Commissioner of Insolvency and Financial Rehabilitation Proceedings in the Ministry of Justice also supported the application, as did more than 200 of the company’s employees, represented by Adv. Liza Hadash, who said that the company had promised payment of their salaries for June and July. In addition, thirty of Landa Digital Printing’s customers from around the world wrote to the court in support of giving the company an opportunity to put together a settlement that would ensure its continued operation.\nOn the other hand, 25 employees represented by Adv. Offir Ronen objected to the stay of proceedings, arguing that insolvency proceedings should be commenced and a receiver to run an auction for the sale of the company should be appointed, and that the employees should be enabled to receive their salaries from the National Insurance Institute.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 10, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 14:33:00 GMT", "author": "Amiram Gill", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Insightec wins new FDA approval for Parkinson's treatment", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001515554#utm_source=RSS", "text": "\"In two to three years, Insightec could be profitable,\" Dr. Maurice Ferré, CEO of the veteran Israel medical device company, told \"Globes\" recently. Insightec profitable? Let’s take a look. This is a company that in the course of its existence has raised over $600 million, more than any other privately-held biomed company in Israel, according to the startup database of Startup Nation Central. The money financed the development of exceptional technology, and the company even has impressive revenue, but it has continued to incur heavy losses.\nFerré, who has been in the post of CEO for a decade, is not sure that it’s possible to continue that way in the current state of the market.\n\"Until a few years ago, when money was readily available and the valuations given to growth companies were high, it was alright for a company to lose a lot of money,\" he says. \"Today, with rising interest rates, investors are finding it difficult to tolerate that model, and are driving the companies towards profitability. We have heard what the market is asking for, and we too are aiming in that direction.\"\nIn its last fund raising round last year, Insightec’s valuation was at just $515 million, as emerges from the financials of listed company Elbit Medical, which holds 2% of Insightec.\nIt’s starting to happen\nOf course it’s best to be profitable, but can Insightec do it? Approval received this week from the US Food and Drug Administration for the use of Insightec’s device for a new indication in Parkinson’s disease patients expands its addressable market, and represents one building block in the structure that Ferré seeks to construct. By focusing ultrasound energy from several directions under MRI guidance, the product treats non-Parkinson’s tremors, and in recent years various kinds of Parkinson’s as well. \"The competing technology is brain stimulation using electrodes, a procedure that includes opening up the skull, and it’s not a growing market. We don’t expect competition for our technology, because the barriers to entry are high,\" Ferré says.\nThe company’s products are very expensive. The system itself can cost some $2 million, and treatments are priced in the thousands of dollars per patient. No patient or hospital can afford these treatments unless the insurance companies cover them. Up to now, insurance coverage for the company’s products has been fairly thin, but its new products are doing better in that respect than its previous ones.\n\"This piece of the puzzle is about to fall into place,\" Ferré promises. \"We recently demonstrated that, five years after treatment with our product of initial non-Parkinson’s tremors, 73% of patients are still in a better condition than before the procedure. These are the kind of data that the insurance companies want to see, alongside data that show that the patient is more active, less sedentary, and less diabetic.\"\nIn 2024, Insightec’s revenue rose to $101 million from $83.5 million in 2023, and its annual net loss narrowed from $100.6 million to $68.5 million. In the first quarter of 2025, the company posted a loss of $18 million, and at the end of the quarter it had cash of $148 million.\"\nWill you be able to maintain the company without raising more money?\nFerré: \"There’s no knowing, but we’re husbanding our cash so that it will suffice for a long time, after we have reduced our burn rate.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 10, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 17:43:00 GMT", "author": "Gali Weinreb", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

The tower, owned by Tidhar and George Horesh's Union Group, will include 72 floors and is scheduled to be occupied next year. The tower overlooks the Ayalon Highway near Tel Aviv Central Savidor railway station.\nAkamai currently has offices in the ToHa 1 building on Yigal Alon Street in Tel Aviv and if the talks reach fruition the new space will be double its current office area, provide a solution to the tech company's major expansion in Israel. According to industry estimates, rents in the Beyond tower are NIS 90-100 per square meter before interior design, so the deal (if signed) will be worth at least NIS 18 million per year, even before investment in finishing work.\nTo date, most of the large deals in the tower have been for law firms. Meitar signed an agreement to lease 30,000 square meters on 17 floors for 25 years for about NIS 54 million per year; Fisher FBC (located in Azrieli Town) has leased about 14,400 square meters with an option to expand, and Lipa Meir has leased four floors in the tower.\nBeyond Towers is two towers under construction in Givatayim on the border with Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan. The second tower will include apartments, which uniquely will be for rent only. The office building was built using green construction and is set to be awarded a Platinum LEED standard - the highest level.\nNo response to this report was forthcoming from Tidhar and Akamai.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 10, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 12:52:01 GMT", "author": "Hilit Yanai-Levison", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

The area will serve as a \"roof\" over the highway and provide land for additional use. Major construction will be built on the edges of the roof, to prevent excessive load in its center.

{"title": "Shekel at strongest against dollar since April 2022", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001515438#utm_source=RSS", "text": "The shekel, which has appreciated sharply in recent weeks continues to strengthen this morning. In late morning inter-bank trading the shekel is 0.30% lower against the dollar at NIS 3.304/$ - the shekel's strongest against the US currency since April 2022, and 0.18% lower against the euro at NIS 3.872/€.\nWhy is the shekel strengthening?\nMizrahi Tefahot Bank chief markets economist Ronen Menachem explains that the main reason behind the strengthening of the shekel is domestic and corresponds with the sharp gains in stock markets with bond markets also rising. He says, \"This reflects the decline in the risk premium that the Bank of Israel stressed in its interest rate decision, and currently outweighs the general uncertainty that the Bank of Israel also emphasized.\nHe adds, \"It should also be remembered that the fact that the Bank of Israel did not cut interest rates this month, and its forecast and the governor's press briefing maintained caution and continued data-dependent policy, supports the shekel. The shekel is also appreciating against the euro, where interest rates have been halved in the past year, so the interest rate differentials also play in favor of the shekel.\"\nVertical hedge fund senior analyst Evyatar Ben David agrees with Menachem and believes there are three main factors that may support continued strengthening of the shekel. He says, \"The first, and most significant of all, is the continued rise in financial markets. The second is the continued weakness of the dollar in the global arena, and thirdly interest rate cuts by the US Fed, which will be driven mainly by a slowdown in inflation and not necessarily as a result of a recession. In the short term, it should be noted that July is one of the most positive months of the year seasonally. Continued increases in the US stock markets may lead Israeli institutional entities to continue hedging their investments overseas - a move that also supports the strengthening of the shekel. \"\nIn this context, Ben David mentions that the rate of exposure of institutional entities to foreign exchange has increased in recent years, among other things due to the judicial reform and regional geopolitical changes. \"The decline in the economy's risk premium in recent times may lead institutional entities to reduce the rate of exposure to foreign exchange to historic levels and bring their capital back to Israel.\"\nIn addition, he notes that trading volumes tend to be lower in the summer months, which increases the volatility of currency rates. \"Therefore, any movement in the dollar exchange rate in the world, if the weakening trend continues, may be more severe than usual and also contribute to the strengthening of the shekel.\nFinally, he says, \"As the market prices a more aggressive interest rate path from the Federal Reserve, this may narrow the interest rate gap between Israel and the US and provide the shekel with additional support.\"\nWill the shekel reach NIS 3/$\nMenachem recalls that the last time rate approached NIS 3/$ was in late 2021. the Bank of Israel came out with a plan to purchase up to $30 billion for its reserves and made it clear that it had identified an overvaluation of the currency. \"It worked quite quickly, and the shekel weakened quickly and sharply. The Bank of Israel did not need to purchase the entire quota,\" he explained.\nAt the same time, he stresses that it is difficult to know what will happen this time, whether the Bank of Israel will intervene, in what scope and format, and what the rate that will constitute the trigger will be. \"There is still something like 6% today, among other things, left before reaching the rate that was the trigger then. We must also remember that the previous time the dollar was strengthening in the world, while now it is weakening. In other words, back then, the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar was even more unusual. Still, it is likely that if and as the shekel continues to strengthen, the chance of such intervention increases. The Bank of Israel is also thinking about the economy and is aware of the implications for exports, especially at times when there are various threats from foreign trade.\"\nFinally, Menachem concludes, \"In my opinion, the current cautious course of the shekel will be halted at a sufficient distance from a rate of NIS/$, and it seems to me that if the Bank of Israel wants to intervene, purchasing forex reserves would be a preferable option to cutting the interest rate. \"A combined move and/or an unusual interest rate announcement cannot be ruled out, but is less likely at the moment.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 10, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 08:49:00 GMT", "author": "Maya Levin", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Mevo Carmel in pole position to house Nvidia Israel campus", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001515431#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Regional councils in northern Israel are battling it out to attract Nvidia, in the wake of the US chip giant's announcement earlier this week that it will invest NIS 2 billion in land and construction for a 180,000 square meter campus near to its current Israel headquarters in Yokneam.\nNvidia Israel country director Nati Amsterdam told the Israel Data Center Association (IDCA) conference yesterday, \"We have been contacted by heads of local authorities from Dan to Eilat,\" while sources have told \"Globes\" that Nvidia has already received documents setting out their advantages from the Sagi 2000 industrial park in the Jezreel Valley, Tziporit industrial park near Nof Hagalil, and the Afula Municipality.\nBut experts familiar with Nvidia and the data centers industry in Israel agree, the Mevo Carmel Science and Industry Park is already the major favorite to win.\nRights shared with other authorities\nThe industrial park, located between Elyakim and Kibbutz Ramot Menashe is is seen as fitting best with Nvidia's needs and the level of infrastructure it requires. It is only eight kilometers southwest of Nvidia Israel's headquarters in Yokne'am, is near Road 6 - the Cross-Israel highway, has extensive land reserves, park areas and restaurants, a low corporate tax rate and access to nearby high-voltage lines and a private power plant.\nThe park is already closely linked to Nvidia. At the start of the year, the chip giant built its largest data center in Israel for internal use, with 30 megawatts capacity at an investment of over $500 million. It is currently building a more powerful data center with 63 megawatts capacity, which when completed will be the most powerful data center in Israel, even though it will be used exclusively by Nvidia. The park is defined as a Priority A area for industry, meaning it enjoys a low corporate tax rate (5%-7%).\nMevo Carmel is in the Megiddo Regional Council on the western edge of the Jezreel Valley. Council head Gil Lin is also chairman of the Mevo Carmel Science and Industry Park. The rights to the park are shared with other local authorities, with Megiddo holding 30% and the rest in the hands of Yokneam Illit (30%), Daliyat al-Carmel (20%) and Isfya (20%), which share in municipal tax revenues estimated last year at around NIS 16 million, which should increase to NIS 60 million after its 580 dunams (145 acres) expansion plan is approved next to the Ein Tut interchange, in addition to the existing 548 dunams (137 acres).\nThe expansion will only be on the market in two to three years. Those who will benefit from this, apart from established areas such as the Ramot Menashe, Daliya and Mishmar HaEmek kibbutzim, are the Druze settlements on the Carmel, for whom the park is a major revenue channel - another consideration that will make it easier for Nvidia to make a decision to locate in the nearby park.\nMevo Carmel possesses two critical assets for a company like Nvidia, which is planning to build advanced AI infrastructure in the north - it is close to the main power lines that reach from the center to the Haifa area via Hadera, and it is adjacent to the Hagit power plant, which produces 840 megawatts using natural gas.\nAfter completing construction of the data center Nvidia is currently building, it will consume about 100 megawatts of the total production at the Hagit power plant. Four transformers from the Israel Electric Company are already being installed there, providing Nvidia with electricity with 30 megawatts capacity.\nThe downside: no public transport infrastructure\nMevo Carmel has 14 dunams (3.5 acres) of green space that can be used by employees, and another planned 1,800 square meter area for restaurants and cafes. It houses a mix of tech factories such as pharmaceutical company Unipharm, logistics facilities, Maccabi Health Services Mega Lab - a huge complex that provides service for most lab tests in the north, the Apollo Carmel solar energy technology factory Apollo Carmel and Alumlite.\nThe park also has several notable disadvantages, such as the lack of public transport infrastructure. Although it is close by Road 6, it is far from railways stations and bus lines. The local council plans to expand the Elyakim Interchange with a bus terminal and is negotiating with Egged and the Ministry of Transport about express bus lines from Tel Aviv and Haifa and setting up a \"park and ride\" lot at the Elyakim Interchange that will shuttle employees to the park.\nIn addition, Mevo Carmel is considered expensive compared with land in Afula, Migdal HaEmek and Kiryat Ata. The most expensive deal in the park was estimated at NIS 5.3 million per 1,000 square meters, while a deal closed about a year ago was closed at a price of NIS 5.1 million per 1,000 square meters. The council sees the high prices as justified due to the facilities and qualities it offers, proximity to Road 6 and a talented workforce of tech workers from surrounding communities. However, the price is more expensive than Nvidia is willing to invest in buying land - no more than NIS 500 million, but the assessment in the industry is that Mevo Carmel may offer the area at a discount to attract Nvidia to the park.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 10, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 06:55:00 GMT", "author": "Assaf Gilead", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Intel Kiryat Gat expansion frozen for foreseeable future", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001515435#utm_source=RSS", "text": "About a year ago, Intel told the contractors building its new manufacturing plant in Kiryat Gat (Fab 38) that it was freezing construction expansion and focusing on building the first and original part of the plant. This meant that of the two \"clean rooms,\" - sterile areas where the company's most sophisticated chips are manufactured, which were designed in the south, only one would be operational in the coming years, while the fate of the second clean room is unknown. The original plan to build a chip factory at a cost of $25 billion, $3 billion of which was government aid, is currently not being implemented.\nThe total number of employees who were supposed to continue working at the site until at least 2028, estimated in the thousands, has been shrinking due to non-renewal of contracts with suppliers, as well as the completion of some of the projects that were due to end anyway.\n\"Globes\" has learned that in parallel to layoffs at the existing Intel plant in Kiryat Gat (Fab 28), estimated at 200-300 employees, the number of contractor workers employed in the construction of the new plant has dropped since the peak in 2024 from 5,500 to about 2,000 workers today.\nThese are workers employed by building companies that won contracts with Intel - some were transferred to other projects, but some were fired due to failure to sign continuation contracts that the companies expected as part of the project's expansion. The state approved construction and contracting companies with about 3,000 work visas for foreign workers from countries such as India, Sri Lanka and Thailand specifically for Intel's Fab 38 project, and now - with construction of one part nearing completion and construction of the second part on hold - they are returning to their countries of origin two to three years earlier than the original plan.\nIsraeli workers have also been fired due to the move. Among the companies affected by Intel's decision not to renew contracts or to refrain from signing new contracts for the construction of the second part of the plant are: Afcon, Elmor, Hemo Aharon, Pentagon, Katz Group, BCT Piping, Carmel Insulation and Lesico.\nThe new chip is not taking off\nThe Fab 38 plant is designed as a complex with two separate plants containing a clean room for manufacturing chips, mainly for installation in laptops and servers. While the construction of the first plant has been completed and the cooling, power and piping systems have been installed, it is still waiting to be connected to production machines - a stage that is currently delayed as Intel is still rethinking its manufacturing processes and trying to find key customers who will agree to manufacture in its factories. The construction of the concrete shell and machine ceiling of the second factory in the complex is currently complete, but no new agreements have been signed to fit the factory with electromechanical systems, air conditioning and piping - an issue that has been frozen for more than a year after Intel's original decision.\nHowever, it should not be concluded that Intel's new factory will stand empty. The first part of the factory, in which an estimated $10 billion has been invested since 2019, will eventually be operational, even if Intel decides to sell the property to another chip manufacturer. Intel has previously spoken about their production areas and said that they will be able to use them in time frames ranging from 18 months to two years, depending on customer demand. Beyond Intel's financial crisis, the company has encountered another obstacle in recent weeks after it became clear that there is no demand for its new and promising 18A chip, and the company is now considering betting on its next generation 14A chip, which will require a rethinking of all production systems in the new plants.\nIntel responded: \"The project to establish the new plant in Kiryat Gat is a complex and long-term mega project, and its pace of progress is adjusted to business developments and market conditions.

{"title": "Israel to import Xiaomi cars", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001515364#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Electronic products importer Hemilton, owned by the Aharoni family, and Land Rover importer Hamizrach, owned by the Eini family, have founded a joint venture to import cars, according to the companies registry.\nIt is likely that the new company, held equally by both parties, will focus on importing Chinese company Xiaomi's electric vehicles, which will begin sales in the West next year.\nWaiting list of several months\nThe franchise of the automotive division of the Chinese electronics giant Xiaomi is considered one of the most attractive in the Israeli car import market, due to the company's dazzling success in China.\nXiaomi only began producing vehicles in March 2024 with a single electric sedan model, which competes with the Tesla Model 3, but has already delivered more than 240,000 units in China to date, with a waiting list of several months.\nThis month, the company also launched in China a sporty electric crossover called the SU7, which competes with the Tesla Model Y but offers longer range and higher power specifications at a lower price. According to reports from China, the vehicle attracted more than 200,000 pre-orders in the first three minutes of the opening of sales in China. The waiting time for the car is currently more than a year. Next year, the company is also expected to launch its first model with a plug-in drive.\nDespite the impressive sales success, Xiaomi's car manufacturing operations are still not profitable and the company loses thousands of dollars on every car it sells. However, it is reaping handsome dividends in its share price, which has almost tripled since mid-2024.\nThe company is currently completing construction of an additional manufacturing plant, which should help increase production capacity and meet demand. Xiaomi announced that it would not begin official exports to the West before 2027, but at the same time, it entered into an agreement about two months ago with an international trading company from China that will handle exports to various countries until official exports begin. The company has even begun testing cars in Europe.\nHemilton sought local infrastructure\nHemilton announced last year that it would act as importer of Xiaomi's electric vehicles, but the automotive industry estimated that the company would have to find a local partner. This is due to the fact that it does not have the infrastructure required to market and service vehicles on a national scale.\nThe Eini family, which controls the Hamizrahi company, is also a partner in UMI. It is considered an importer that focuses on luxury vehicles with the Jaguar, Land Rover and Range Rover brands. Over a decade ago, it was one of the pioneers of importing cars from China when it held the franchise of the Chinese company Great Wall until its recent activity in Europe.\nHemilton owner Ephraim Aharoni has said, \"The company plans to import Xiaomi cars. The expectation is for 2027, subject to European standards and inventory.\"\nNo response was forthcoming from Hamizrahi.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 9, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 12:15:00 GMT", "author": "Dubi Ben-Gedalyahu", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

Apple plans to integrate the development into the Personas feature of the Vision Pro augmented reality glasses, a software that allows the user to appear in the virtual space using the same personalized avatar.

{"title": "Sharp fall in new home sales after restrictions imposed", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001515394#utm_source=RSS", "text": "May was one of the weakest months for housing sales in Israel in the past 25 years, according to the latest survey by the Ministry of Finance chief economist on the residential real estate market. In May there were 6,698 housing deals, down 16% from May 2024. Sales of new homes by contractors continue to shrink with 1,720 homes sold in May, down 44% from May 2024, not including 654 homes sold at a discount in government subsidized programs.\nThe chief economist also found that a fall in developers' buy now pay later (20%-80%) offers continues. These declines began following the publication of the Bank of Israel's restrictions on such operations, however, the falls are not evenly spread in all regions of the country. The report notes, \"The Netanya region, which includes the Sharon cities, is particularly prominent. Thus, from a rate of approximately 66.6% of total builders' sales in the free market in this region in March, the rate fell to only 20% in May. A sharp decline in the prevalence of financing discounts was also recorded in the Hadera region and a more moderate decline in the Beersheva region. On the other hand, the central region stands out with an increase in the relative prevalence of financing deals in May, continuing the increase recorded in the previous month. Ramat Gan stands out in particular, with financing discounts accounting for 70% of contractors' sales in this city in May, compared with only 27% in March.\"\nRise in apartment sales with protected rooms even before Iran war\nThe report also shows that Iran is the best promoter of sales of apartments with protected rooms. The data shows from when the Iranian started launching missiles at Israel last year, apartment buyers increased their purchases of apartments with protected rooms.\nThe obligation to report whether an apartment being purchased has a protected room began only a year ago. All new apartments include a protected room, but a large proportion of older apartments were built before the obligation to include a protected room, which began in 1992, and they do not include protected rooms, with the exception of apartments that underwent the TAMA 38 process, in which a protected room was added.\nA previous survey conducted by the chief economist found that following the first and second missile attacks from Iran, in May and October 2024, the proportion of second-hand apartments sold that include a protected room jumped. After reaching 58% of all second-hand apartments purchased in May (compared with 55% in previous months), the percentage of apartments with a protected room out of all second-hand apartments purchased fell to 52%, until in September and October 2024 it rose again, reaching 56% in October. Apparently, between the two missile attacks, the public had the feeling that the escalation of hostilities with Iran, and the wars in Lebanon and Gaza, were on the decline.\nAfter the second missile attack, and with the outbreak of the campaign against Hezbollah in September 2024, the public realized that the war could last longer, and become more destructive and dangerous. By the end of 2024, a relatively high percentage of apartments purchased with a protected room remained at about 55% of all second-hand apartments purchased. This may be due to the large price differences between apartments with and without protected rooms, and to the great reliance of Tel Aviv residents on their proximity to home and public shelters.\nIn the Haifa region, on the other hand, which was threatened by rocket fire from Lebanon more than any other region, except for the north, an increase in the rate of deals with protected rooms has been recorded since the ceasefire agreement with Lebanon was signed in November 2024.\nSince January 2025, the proportion of apartments with protected room out of all second-hand apartments rose again, reaching a peak of 60% in April. The chief economist speculates that this was, \"Due the media talk about the possibility of a war against Iran, which broke out on June 13\".\nHowever, the trend was not uniform in all regions, and in the Tel Aviv region, which includes only the cities of Tel Aviv and Bat Yam, a decrease was recorded since the beginning of the year in the rate of apartments with protected rooms among all second-hand apartments purchased.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 9, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 14:21:00 GMT", "author": "Arik Mirovsky", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

This is the last regulatory approval required for Tshuva to take over the company.\nTshuva will thus shortly become the controlling shareholder in Isracard through Delek Group (TASE: DLEKG), which he controls. Delek Group will buy 37% of the shares in Isracard at a valuation of NIS 3.56 billion. Together with the Isracard shares that Delek Group already owns, this will give it a 40% stake. Delek Group will pay NIS 1.3 billion, and Isracard will also distribute a dividend. The deal is expected to close within a week to ten days.\nThe Bank of Israel stated: \"The Supervisor of Banks Department has concluded the process of examining the application for a permit to control Isracard.\" The examination was required because Isracard is one of the three largest credit card companies in Israel, and because of Tshuva’s past, which includes a debt settlement in Delek Real Estate, giving rise to concerns at the Bank of Israel about financial stability.\nThe Competition Authority approved the takeover in March, after Isracard’s shareholders voted in favor of the sale to Delek Group in February.\nIsracard became a listed company in 2019, when Bank Hapoalim was forced to sell its stake in the company in accordance with the recommendations of the Strum committee on separation of the credit card companies from the banks.\nThe battle over Isracard started two years ago, when insurance companies Harel and Menora Mivtachim competed to buy the company. Harel won, but was blocked by the Competition Authority, opening the way to a new round of bidding.\nMenora Mivtachim tried its luck again, but the race was joined by Yitzhak Tshuva, Bank of Jerusalem, and even El Al. In the end, the shareholders plumped for Tshuva’s bid, and his group has now jumped the final hurdle.\nThe race to buy Isracard began after Clal Insurance bought rival credit card company Max (formerly Leumi Card), signaling to the market the potential in the sector. The third company that is shortly expected to be up for sale is Cal, controlled by Israel Discount Bank (72%).\n\"We believe in the great potential at Isracard, and in its ability to grow in clearance, and in consumer and commercial credit, in addition to other channels into which we believe that Isracard can, and should, expand,\" said Delek Group CEO Idan Wallace. \"I believe that joining Delek Group will give Isracard a following wind, taking it forwards, and will be good news for consumers, investors in Isracard, and Delek Group, and lead to realization of the great potential that we see in Isracard, and boost competition.

Flights to Abu Dhabi will begin on August 15 and to London on August 22. On September 1 Wizz Air will reintroduce flights to Vienna, Milan, Rome, Iasi and Sofia, with more destinations added from September 15.\nThe decision on the earlier resumption of flights was taken during a call between Israel's Minister of Transport Miri Regev and Wizz Air CEO Joszef Varadi. Israel had hoped for an immediate resumption of flights but the airline made clear that aircraft had already been assigned to other routes for this month. However, Minister of Transport officials said that Wizz Air was prepared to make changes in its schedule so that flights could be resumed next month.\nWizz Air's return is major news for Israel's aviation industry, and is expected to significantly increase the number of flights and allow for greater competition that will help lower fares.

{"title": "Gov't companies report NIS 7.6b 2024 profit", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001515285#utm_source=RSS", "text": "While many Israeli companies experienced a slowdown in 2024 because of the war, the combined revenues of the 68 Israeli government-owned companies crossed the NIS 100 billion threshold for the first time to NIS 102 billion, up 11.7% from 2023. In part this was due to a boom in orders for government-owned defense companies like Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which added production lines and worked overtime to provide the IDF's wartime needs. The combined net profit of government companies was NIS 7.6 billion, up from NIS 6.2 billion in 2023.\nThese profits have macroeconomic effects. The companies distribute dividends to shareholders - the state - boosting the Ministry of Finance coffers. In current times, when the Ministry of Finance needs every shekel to finance the ongoing war and the expensive operation against Iran, every billion shekels transferred to the state from the defense companies helps.\nIn 2024, government companies declared a total dividend of about NIS 1.2 billion. The full impact of the war cannot yet be seen, because the dividends were declared for 2023 profits. Still, this is a record in terms of total dividends for one year, and almost double the 2023 figure. Although, in 2022, higher dividends of NIS 1.4 billion shekels declared, the amount also included dividend declarations for past profits, which had not been distributed from 2017 onwards by some companies.\nRafael reported a 27% jump in revenue to nearly NIS 18 billion, and net profit almost doubled to about NIS 1 billion. IAI reported a 14% increase in revenue, to over $6 billion, with a net profit of NIS 1.8 billion. These results are expected to be reflected in dividends to be distributed in 2025, which may again break records.\nBiggest profit was from Israel Electric Corp.\nDespite the outstanding financial performances by defense companies in 2024, it was the Israel Electric Corp. (IEC) that reported the biggest profits for 2024, by a considerable margin ahead of the defense industries. IEC, which undertook major work in the south and north to repair war damage, reported a profit of about NIS 3.4 billion - up 50% from 2023. A major reason for this was the sale of the Eshkol power plant for over NIS 9 billion in the privatization process.\nThe company that recorded the highest loss last year was Energy Infrastructures, amounting to NIS 41 million. Major revenue was recorded for the completion of the privatization of Israel Post, which was purchased for NIS 468 million.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 8, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 08 Jul 2025 15:39:00 GMT", "author": "Oren Dori", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

The warning was given as a Conflict Zone Information Bulletin (CZIB), which indicates a high risk for aviation in a conflict region.\nThe CZIB warning was initially published on June 13 and reaffirmed on June 30 and warned against flying in the airspace of five countries: Israel, Iran, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to the directive, all flights in these countries were considered dangerous, regardless of flight altitude, except for access to Beirut by sea and under restrictive conditions.\nThe warning followed the Israeli attack on Iran, which led to the firing of missiles by Iran at Israeli and US targets. A ceasefire was reached on June 24, but EASA warned that the situation was fragile and could escalate again. Therefore, European airlines were advised to avoid the region.\nThe warning remained in effect until yesterday. After discussions it was decided not to extend the warning. However, EASA stressed that the risks in the airspace around Israel, including areas in Sinai and northern Saudi Arabia, are still relevant and airlines should continue to monitor the security situation and regional developments.\nLast September, EASA recommended that airlines avoid operating flights in the airspace of Lebanon and Israel until the end of October. The recommendation was then lifted and foreign airlines gradually returned to Israel. Among the first airlines to resume Israel flights was Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air.\nThe lifting of the warning is positive news that should bring the return of foreign airlines to Israel closer. But some foreign airlines will not be in a rush to resume Israel flights, as carriers have diverted their planes to other destinations for the summer season. But Lufthansa Group (including Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines and EuroWings) has confirmed that it plans gradually resuming flights to Tel Aviv from August 1.

State revenues and spending in June, during the Iran operation, were almost identical to June 2024. As a result the fiscal deficit remained unchanged from the end of May at 5% of GDP, NIS 103.9 billion, Minister of Finance accountant general Yali Rothenberg reports.\nJune itself saw the biggest monthly deficit since the start of 2025 with a deficit of NIS 16.4 billion. Since the start of 2025 a deficit of NIS 31.8 billion has accumulated, although this is just half the figure in the corresponding period of 2024.\nSince the start of the year, the Ministry of Finance has enjoyed consistent revenue growth, although this came to a halt in June with the lowest revenue - NIS 35.6 billion - of the year so far. The Ministry of Finance estimates that this is a decrease before an increase: \"Following the operation in Iran and as part of the policy to aid the economy,\" the Ministry of Finance explains, \"during June, the option of postponing tax payments to the last days of the month was given.

{"title": "Now's the time to buy the dollar? Think twice", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001515171#utm_source=RSS", "text": "The impressive appreciation of the shekel against the US dollar this year, by about 10%, has occasioned substantial losses for Israelis invested in US assets. The DXY dollar index, which measures the value of the US dollar against a basket of major currencies, has also fallen by 10% so far this year. Against this background, there are those who are wondering whether this is perhaps the time to increase exposure to the dollar. Most of the market experts say that it is not.\n\"The sharp fall in the value of the dollar against the shekel stems mainly from the depreciation of the dollar on world markets,\" says Bank Leumi strategist Kobby Levi. \"Israeli investors who bought euro-denominated bonds, for example, have been hit less than those exposed to the dollar.\n\"Our expectation is that the geopolitical improvement (in Israel), which is already manifest in improvement in pricing in large parts of the capital market, such as the local stock and bond markets, will also affect the shekel and will support appreciation against the basket of currencies.\" In other words, in Levi’s view, the shekel could continue to strengthen. For that reason, he says, \"There’s no room for reducing currency hedges despite the low rates.\"\nMeitav chief economist Alex Zabezhinsky also commented earlier this week on the strength of the shekel and its consequences for the public’s asset portfolio. \"The appreciation of the shekel could go a long way,\" he wrote, adding that the reason for that was that the public in Israel was likely to sell more foreign currency-denominated assets, to the tune of billions of shekels. On the basis of the data he gathered, he says, \"The weight of foreign-currency-linked assets (not including overseas stocks) in the public’s asset portfolio was about 15% in March. That is still 2% higher than the stable levels that prevailed until the end of 2022. To return to the weight at that time, the public (including financial institutions) will need to sell foreign currency to the tune of over NIS 100 billion.\"\nZabezhinsky also points to the link between the shekel-dollar exchange rate and the performance of the S&P 500 Index in the US. When the index rises, the exchange rate falls, i.e., the shekel strengthens. In his view, there is still room for the shekel to strengthen, to levels of NIS 3/$ and even lower.\nModi Shafrir, chief financial markets strategist at Bank Hapoalim, also recommends reducing the foreign currency-denominated component of the portfolio, estimating that the shekel will continue to strengthen. This is for two main reasons: \"The first is that the basic forces supporting a strong shekel are expected to strengthen in the coming years, such as Israel’s large balance of payments surplus. The second is that, in my opinion, financial institutions will shortly start to reduce their currency exposure (because of the switch of money from investment in the S&P 500 to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to improve returns, H.S.).\nRami Dror, CEO of Value Advanced Investments Group, adds, \"The shekel-dollar rate is now consolidating at old/new levels of around NIS 3.5/$. What kept it high in the past eighteen months was chiefly the regional security-geopolitical situation. Following the changes that have taken place in the region, it is now at a new equilibrium level, and in my view we shall continue to see the shekel-dollar rate in this area.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 8, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 08 Jul 2025 09:21:00 GMT", "author": "Hezi Sternlicht", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Private electricity producers to bypass IEC", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001515172#utm_source=RSS", "text": "The electricity supply reform, which allows electricity producers to sell electricity at a discount through private suppliers, is expanding. Until now, only solar energy installations and storage facilities could provide discounted electricity to suppliers, which they then rolled on to customers. Now, conventional power plants will also be able to supply privately. This will help suppliers, most of whom are operating at a loss due to difficulty in finding enough producers to meet demand. If conventional plants offer large enough discounts, this will open the door for suppliers to increase the discounts to attract more customers.\nSome 263,000 households, out of about 2.8 million in Israel, have switched to a private electricity supplier. While this is still a small proportion of households, the growth rate is about 20,000 households per month. The discounts offered today are usually between 5% and 7% of the electricity bill, with larger discounts of up to 20% offered during hours of excess electricity supply, at noon and at night.\nSuppliers will be able to offer even bigger discounts\nSources in the electricity market say that a significant portion of the electricity supply companies are operating at a loss, partly because of the gap between the number of customers they have and the amount of electricity they can buy at a discount. The Electricity Authority says, \"The pace of construction of production facilities in the distribution network is not catching up with the demand for private electricity, and in the bilateral electricity market, a situation of surplus demand has been created that may moderate and even delay the development of competition in the supply segment.\"\nThis is one of the reasons that has led the Electricity Authority to expand the reform, and to also allow conventional power plants, which generate electricity with gas, to join the reform and offer cheaper electricity to suppliers, which will allow them to pass on part of the discount to households. In this way, the Electricity Authority hopes, suppliers will be able to offer even bigger discounts than available today, while moving from losses to profit.\nIn the coming months, electricity producers will submit a tender to the Electricity Authority, in which they will offer \"compensation\" to the electricity grid for bypassing it in favor of private suppliers. This, in turn, will affect the price they will be able to offer to suppliers, who will be able to pass this on to consumers. After the tender is completed, probably towards the end of 2025, producers will be able to offer their electricity to suppliers, and then we will also find out how much of this, if any, will be passed on to consumers. Even if the passing on of discounts to consumers will not be significant, it will support the business model of private suppliers that currently offer discounts on electricity to homes and businesses and will allow them to continue operating in the long term, and sign up more households interested in receiving discounts.\nElectricity Authority chairman Amir Shavit said, \"The reform in the electricity sector is proving itself, and we see the trust that electricity consumers are expressing in it by switching to private suppliers - and at the same time, many operations are being undertaken by private suppliers. In order to boost competition and discounts, we are promoting a series of decisions that will allow for an increase in the supply of electricity, and thus also competition for the benefit of consumers and the electricity sector.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 8, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 08 Jul 2025 10:01:03 GMT", "author": "Idan Eretz", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

In addition, the agency sees Israel’s debt to GDP ratio rising to 75% in the medium term, a significant change from its previous forecast before the war with Iran, which was 70%.

It turns out, however, somewhat surprisingly, that the central bank actually sold dollars last month, to the tune of $300 million, for the first time since the first months of the war.\nThe Bank of Israel’s intervention was a specific and limited response to Israel’s surprise attack on Iran last month. \"The sale took place on a Friday a few weeks ago, after Israel attacked Iran. After the shekel-dollar exchange rate jumped to NIS 3.7/$, the bank decided to intervene. There was very sharp movement on the market that day, and there was speculation over whether it was caused by the Bank of Israel or some other entity. In the morning, the exchange rate rose sharply, but within a few hours the market calmed down, following the intervention,\" explains Yossi Frank, CEO of Energy Finance, and an expert on the foreign exchange market.\nIn fact, this was the first time that the central bank had sold dollars since the start of the Swords of Iron war in October 2023, when, a few days after the deadly incursion by Hamas, the bank announced a program for selling dollars totaling $30 billion, in order to prevent the shekel from depreciating. In the event, the bank sold only $8.5 billion, mainly in October.\nDespite the sale, the Bank of Israel continues to hold a very high quantity of US dollars.

Lufthansa Group, which includes, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, and EuroWings, has confirmed the renewal of flights at the start of next month and says services will be resumed gradually. The Group operates regular flights from Tel Aviv to Frankfurt, Munich, Dusseldorf, Hamburg, Zurich, Vienna, and Brussels.\nThroughout the war, Lufthansa has adopted a policy of relatively long-term flight cancellations, mainly during the more extreme fighting, such as the escalation in the north in July 2024, the Iranian attack in October, and the Houthi missile landing at Ben Gurion Airport in May. However, after the situation eased, the airline usually waited to see if the calm remained, and only after a few weeks would decide to resume operations. For example, Lufthansa returned to Israel last February, after suspending its operations following the Iranian attack in October. Unlike other airlines such as Wizz Air, which resumed their flights immediately after the ceasefire, Lufthansa chose to wait a few weeks before returning to operations.\nLufthansa has also decided to resume operations gradually on previous occasions - last March, after about a month of stable operations in Israel since the resumption of flights, the company increased the number of its weekly flights from 35 to 60.

{"title": "Bank of Israel Governor warns on need for tax hikes", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001515161#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Just after the Bank of Israel Monetary Committee left the interest rate unchanged at 4.5% for the 12th consecutive time, Governor Prof. Amir Yaron criticized the Central Bureau of Statistics new method of calculating inflation and expressed cautious concern that the government will again need to raise taxes.\nThe figure that perhaps most influences the interest rate decision is the level of inflation, which is currently 3.1%, slightly above the 3% upper limit of the central bank's annual target. Inflation has been volatile in recent times, due to airfares, which although a very small component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), have boosted inflation. This, even though it is a temporary rise, which is expected to decline in the future.\nYaron complains \"The Central Bureau of Statistics has switched to a different method, in which there is more seasonality in the CPI. The switch to the new method causes more forecasting errors, at least at first.\" He added that in the meantime, the effect is still ongoing, because \"The data were also very, very affected by geopolitical events and foreign airlines that stopped coming here.\" However, it also affects prices for the entire public, which is reflected in consumption costs in retail chains. Yaron added, \"We are not looking at one figure. We didn't panic when inflation rose to 3.6%, and even when it's now at 3.1%, we're not going to get complacent.\"\nIs this the correct approach in your opinion in the case of rents, which constitutes about a quarter of the CPI?\nYaron responded negatively. \"In renewable contracts, we see a certain stability, while in new contracts, we saw an increase of 5.2% over the past year.\" According to him, the problem is, \"As time goes by, this also rolls over to the entire housing index, and in the CPI it is also part of the 'stickiness' of inflation, and it is also a figure that is less affected by the exchange rate (the shekel has strengthened by 7.3% since the start of the year). Therefore, in this area there is potential for stickiness, and perhaps even a certain acceleration in rental prices, certainly in areas of the country where buildings were damaged, and the people who were evacuated will most likely want to rent in that area.\"\nWill it be necessary to raise taxes again in the upcoming budget, because of the great defense needs following the war?\nYaron is cautious and observes, \"First of all, we need to understand where we are in the defense budget. There are very large differences between the Ministry of Defense's needs and what the Ministry of Finance is talking about.\" He sees the budgetary differences between them, \"Deriving, at the moment, from the view of where we are in terms of security risks and what is right for security in this sense.\"\nIt can be said that defense needs have increased or decreased, or that they can be spread out differently over time, and that allows for degrees of freedom in budgetary management. But assuming that there will still be differences, the government will have to find sources. First of all, priorities need to be changed on things that do not support growth. The plan, he said, is to \"Give up on inefficient things, such as unnecessary offices and negative incentives to go to work.\"\nAs for builders' promotions for buyers of new apartments, in efforts to get the public to come back and buy apartments, Yaron says that the builders do not work for the Bank of Israel and are not circumventing its restrictions. \"In the 20-80 or 10-90 deals, you do not necessarily have to go and sign on a mortgage, certainly today when there is a certain lengthening in the time to complete construction. Although it is not clear that this is the right thing for that person or household. Therefore, from a consumer perspective, it was important to us that those who have already made the biggest deal of their lives go through a signing process (for a mortgage). In the case of a mortgage in the balloon route (a delayed mortgage), the customer does sign for a mortgage, so it's definitely not the same, and there has been an improvement here.\"\nAnd yet, haven't the builders managed to bypass you?\nYaron replies with a smile: \"Will their creativity bring more deals? Of course, we will have to examine them and see that they do not create excess risks.\"\nBanks continue to earn huge amounts these days. The first quarter of 2025 was once again particularly strong, with a combined profit of nearly NIS 8 billion. Will you allow banks to distribute a 50% dividend? Bank shares have recently soared following this possibility.\nYaron: \"Throughout the war, we have been cautious in this area as well. We haven't made a decision yet, but we will think about the issue of dividends ahead of the quarterly reports.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 8, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 08 Jul 2025 04:23:00 GMT", "author": "Netanel Ariel", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Intel begins hundreds of layoffs in Israel", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001515149#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Intel today began implementing its latest wave of layoffs in Israel. Sources close to the matter have told \"Globes\" that many dozens of employees in Israel were today summoned to hearings and this will grow to hundreds of Intel Israel's 9,300 employees.\nThe hearings will take place next week and it will then become clear how many Intel Israel employees will ultimately be fired, how many will receive early retirement offers, and how many will keep their jobs or move to another position. Estimates are that Intel will lay off between 15% and 20% of its manufacturing division employees worldwide and many thousands more R&D employees at middle management levels, as part of new CEO Lip-Bu Tan's streamlining plan to make Intel a leaner and more efficient company, which can compete with its rivals.\nAfter the layoffs, Intel Israel is expected to have less than 9,000 employees and perhaps even stabilize at 8,500 people - a similar number to its 2012 headcount, with less than 4,000 employees at its manufacturing plant in Kiryat Gat.\nHarm to manufacturing plants\nWhat distinguishes the current wave of layoffs from previous waves of layoffs last year is the substantial damage to Intel's manufacturing plants worldwide, including the plant in Kiryat Gat. Employees in Israel say, \"This is the most extreme wave at the Kiryat Gat plant ever,\" which has an estimated 4,000 employees. Among workers summoned for hearings or who have informed their colleagues that they are looking for jobs are many who work in various aspects of production, such as shift managers, operations, safety, and logistics and laboratory personnel in Haifa. Several engineers in Jerusalem have also been laid off.\nEnlarged retirement packages and bonuses\nIntel Israel employees have been summoned to meetings where they were offered bonuses including increased early retirement packages of several salaries to encourage them to take voluntary retirement. If they are not interested in this, they are entitled to receive a hearing process as is customary before a dismissal process. This is in contrast to previous rounds of layoffs at Intel in which all employees were offered voluntary retirement plans, without informing those set for hearing procedures and layoffs.\nAs is customary in layoff rounds in recent years at Intel, the company offers between a single number of salaries and up to 19 salaries in the retirement package, in direct proportion to the employee's seniority. Theoretically, an employee who earns NIS 40,000 a month and has been employed by the company for 20 years could receive a pre-tax retirement bonus of NIS 760,000. Employees requesting a hearing anyway, receive a standard hearing, and if Intel is not convinced to keep them can be fired without a special retirement package.\nThe wave of layoffs is global and includes Intel facilities worldwide. In Folsom, California, 54 people will be laid off, and in Santa Clara - Intel's headquarters in the southern San Francisco Bay Area - 217 people will be laid off. In Ireland, Intel's main manufacturing plant outside the US today, 194 workers will be laid off. The layoff rate at the Irish plant will be only 4% - low by global standards, likely due to the great importance of the plant to Intel because it produces the company's latest chips - 3 and 4 nanometer chips.\nThe Intel plant in Israel is also a flagship plant, but production here is on a decline with slightly older technology: 7 and 10 nanometers. The plant in Kiryat Gat was praised by Intel executives last April, and has even been equipped with production machinery that allow it to manufacture using the most advanced technology. But according to a study by research firm RISE, after reaching an all-time high in sales of $8 billion in 2022, sales at the Kiryat Gat chip plants fell below $6 billion in 2023. Intel has not yet published data on its production in Israel last year. According to the Rise report, the number of employees in Kiryat Gat peaked in 2019 at 4,500, and gradually fell to about 4,000 in 2023.\nThe layoffs are part of Tan's efforts to flatten the hierarchy in the company and cut middle management layer, and due to Intel's lack of clarity on its new production process - 1.8 nanometer chips and afterwards 1.4 nanometers, and the ongoing effort to add chip giants such as Nvidia, Qualcomm and Amazon as customers.\nNo response from Intel has been forthcoming.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 7, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 15:08:00 GMT", "author": "Assaf Gilead and Meytal Vaizberg", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

The prime minister has instructed that initial planning for an airport at Ziklag should be ready within three months. After planning is complete, a decision will be made on the rate of progress in comparison with the site at Ramat David in the north, with planning of both airports taking place simultaneously.\nIn addition, the prime minister instructed that planning for an airport at Nevatim, also in the Negev, which has begun, should move to the environmental survey stage, that plans should be advanced for Ramat David, and that the airports should come under the National Infrastructures Law, which means expedited planning.\nZiklag is close to Kibbutz Beit Kama in the northern Negev, south of Kiryat Gat, and to Road 6. The area was examined as a possible site for a new airport in the past, and rejected because of airspace limitations. It overlaps operational flight paths of the Israel Air Force, close to the Gaza Strip border, and is liable to overload Israel’s flight path network. It is believed, however, that the defense establishment has recently softened its stance, and the matter is again under review.\nAviation industry sources have warned that the site is problematic and could become a white elephant like Ramon Airport near Eilat, in which billions of shekels were invested but which is not serving its purpose. In the past, the defense establishment that Ziklag was too close to the Gaza Strip border, but it was recently reported that the National Security Council had come to the conclusion that there was no substantial risk.\nThe prime minister’s decision represents a further chapter in a long running dispute over the location of an new airport to supplement Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport. Up to now, most of the professionals involved have recommended constructing an airport at Ramat David in the Jezreel Valley, but objections from residents and local authorities in the north, and pressure from local authorities in the south, which see an airport as an economic lever, led to renewed examination of alternative possibilities in the Negev, at first at Nevatim, east of Beersheva, and now at Ziklag.\nAccording to forecasts by the Israel Airports Authority, by 2040 Ben Gurion Airport will reach maximum capacity, of 40 million passengers annually. Expansion of the airport is not considered feasible because of limited airspace. Haifa Airport suffers from limitations on its infrastructure, and it cannot handle the size of aircraft used on trans-Atlantic flights.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 7, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 13:28:00 GMT", "author": "Stav Livne", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

At that time, there was about 80,000 square meters of empty space in prime real estate towers in Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan, according to research conducted by Geocartography, and other estimates were higher.\nThe reason for this, primarily, is the relatively high interest rate in the last two years (which stands at 4.5%), which is \"biting\" into the yield on rented office space, and since the situation has not changed significantly in this respect since the beginning of 2024 - it can be estimated that the situation today is similar, and perhaps even worse.\nIt is possible that the reason why many companies choose to purchase office space rather than lease it is, among other things, the same challenging economic situation.\nPurchasing, instead of leasing offices, after all, it is about owning the offices permanently, providing those companies with a greater sense of stability in a clearly unstable period, regardless of the economic situation of this or that landlord.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 7, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 12:59:50 GMT", "author": "Yuval Nisani", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

In terms of quality of life, Tel Aviv was ranked 28th.\nThe real estate rankings are based on the price to buy a home in the city center. Deutsche Bank's researchers found that the average home in Tel Aviv cost $18,469 per square meter in the city center, just below New York ($18,532) in seventh and well ahead of Beijing ($15,090) in ninth and Shanghai ($14,767) in tenth. Hong Kong was the world's most expensive city for residential real estate at $25,946 per square meter, followed by Zurich ($23,938), Singapore ($22,955), Seoul ($22,875), Geneva ($21,491) and London ($20,953).\nDeutsche Bank mentions that in 2012 Tel Aviv prices were just $8,795 per square meter - a rise of 110% in 13 years.\nIn other housing rankings, Tel Aviv was in a more reasonable position in terms of cost. According to the data, the monthly rent for a three-room apartment in the city center is $3,088 (NIS 10,336), ranking 22nd out of 69 cities surveyed. The cost of monthly rent in New York is $8,388 putting it at the top of the ranking. The cost of rent for a one-room apartment in Tel Aviv ($1,667) ranks it 21st out of the cities surveyed ($1,667).\nStanding out for cost of living\nIn Deutsche Bank's index that examined the quality of life in these cities, Tel Aviv ranks 28th out of 69, behind cities such as Madrid, Doha, Prague, and Tokyo. This index takes into account criteria such as safety (Tel Aviv ranks 17th), health (20th), time in traffic jams (23rd) and pollution (30th). What lowers Tel Aviv's ranking in this index are mainly the cost of living index (60th) and the cost of housing relative to income (60th).\nThe comprehensive report finds that Israel \"stars\" in another issue: the cost of living. According to the purchasing power parity price index, Israel ranks 2nd among the 48 countries examined (in some countries, several cities were examined). Switzerland is in first place, followed by Israel, and the US. Israel has \"maintained its position\" in this area since 2020.\nIn the index for a three-course dinner for two diners at a mid-range restaurant, Tel Aviv ranks eighth out of the 69 cities examined. In the index, of a \"cheap date\" as defined by the study's authors (a bottle of wine, a pair of jeans, a dress, 2 coffees, a meal at a restaurant, 2 movie tickets and 2 public transportation tickets), Tel Aviv ranks ninth, after Stockholm, New York, Copenhagen and Zurich, among others.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 7, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 11:12:00 GMT", "author": "Assaf Uni", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

The company employs some 1,200 people around the world, so it is laying off about 6% of its workforce, and 9% of its Israeli workforce.\nIn response to the report, Nayax stated, \"The move stems from the need to streamline the company’s structure following its expansion in recent years, including acquisitions it has carried out, which created overlaps in certain positions, and as part of continuing responsible management of expenses and maintenance of an efficient operating structure.\"\nNayax, headed by its co-founder Yair Nechmad, provides cashless payment solutions.

{"title": "Money invested overseas flows back to Israel", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001515089#utm_source=RSS", "text": "The fall in Israel’s risk premium and the optimism that has taken hold of local investors, thanks to the successful military operation against Iran, brought the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange one of its strongest ever months in June, with a rise of over 10% in the main indices. The trend was also manifest in the decline in yields on government bonds, and in the strengthening of the shekel against the major currencies, particularly the US dollar. The shekel-dollar exchange rate fell by 5% over the month, to NIS 3.34/$.\nThe market rally was partly fueled by money flowing to mutual funds that invest in the Israeli stock market, at the expense of investment in the US market. During June, there was an inflow of NIS 6.2 billion into the mutual funds, led by the ETFs tracking the main Israeli stock indices, which raised NIS 2.5 billion. At the same time, there was an outflow of NIS 1.15 billion from funds tracking overseas indices.\nBehind the trend of diverting money from overseas to Israel, on the part of both financial institutions and private investors, lay not just the strong returns and the confidence in the local market, but also the strengthening of the shekel, which eroded the returns on funds tracking Wall Street indices, particularly the S&P 500 Index, which has been a favorite among Israeli investors in the past two years. Although the index has risen by 5.5% so far this year, the year-to-date return for Israeli investors in funds that track it is minus 2%, because of the fact that the shekel has strengthened by 7.2% against the dollar during the period.\n\"We’re talking about a great deal of money flowing into Israeli funds, and to the extent that this trend repeats itself, I think that it could fuel a continuation of the rally here in Israel. The Israeli market is not very liquid and it’s enough if some of the people who have transferred their money to overseas tracks in the past two years start to bring it back to Israel to fuel the next rally on the local stock market,\" says Yuval Beer Even, portfolio manager at Migdal Group.\nSabina Levy, head of research at Leader Capital Markets, shares Beer Even’s optimism. \"We’re looking at a scenario that is either good or excellent for the local stock market. I find it hard to see any significant sudden negative turn of events on the market or drastic correction,\" she says. Nevertheless, she hedges her remarks by stressing that \"we have learned in recent years that unforeseeable things can happen.\"\nIn Levy’s view, the optimistic scenario has two parts to it. The first, besides the removal of the Iranian threat, also contains a geopolitical move in the form of peace agreements and normalization with more countries. That will open up additional markets for Israeli companies and bring them new customers, supporting the continuation of the positive momentum on the market.\nAlongside this she sketches another scenario, still optimistic but less so, in which there is security quiet and rapid recovery from the war, but no important diplomatic agreements. \"In this event, I think that investors will perhaps try to be more precise about their exposure. What we have seen in the past few weeks has been very broad; money has simply flowed into the market, and as soon as things stabilize and the enthusiasm wanes a little, I think that we might see specific corrections in certain sectors or stocks,\" she says.\nThe rally in insurance and real estate\nTwo sectors that have stood out way above the rest in the past month are insurance and real estate. The indices for these sectors have risen 31% and 21% respectively. \"The insurance companies are an option on the market. Besides the fact that they manage marketable assets on a large scale, and when the market rises the value of the assets they manage rises, some of the companies also have life insurance policies, so that they participate in the profits. That is to say, as the market rises and the insured accumulate profits, the company participates in this profit, and that can amount to NIS 1 billion,\" explains Beer Eeven.\nWhereas the insurance sector continued its positive trend from the previous months, in real estate the jump in share prices actually came after a less good period, in which some stocks had been in decline since the start of the year.\nBehind the jump in these stocks in recent weeks lies the assumption that real estate companies will have a part to play in rehabilitating and reconstructing buildings and infrastructure destroyed or damaged in the war, and will benefit from broad regulatory relaxations, chiefly in urban renewal, and also from the demand for apartments with protected spaces.\nTo that can be added the market’s expectation of a cut in interest rates in the wake of the decline in Israel’s risk premium and the strengthening of the shekel against the US dollar. That will have a positive effect on the income producing real estate companies. Migdal’s Beer Even explains: \"The value of their assets will rise, since appraisers will reduce the capitalization rate on their rental cash flow. In addition, if the interest rate falls, their finance costs will also fall, which will raise their values.\"\nLooking ahead, Levy and Beer Even single out two sectors that, although they have risen, are still at opportunity prices in their view. The first is commercial real estate, including companies such as Big and Melisron, which like other real estate companies are highly leveraged and will gain from an interest rate cut, and also from greater spending in a scenario of economic growth after the war.\nTo that, Beer Even adds another factor supporting these companies. \"Unlike in the office market, hardly any new shopping malls have been built in Israel recently. In the end, the number of consumers keeps growing, and purchasing power in Israel is strong, so that if the supply of places of entertainment doesn’t grow, then sales per square meter will rise; it’s a simple equation.\"\nAnother sector that Migdal and Leader single out is telecommunications, particularly Bezeq. \"In trading, this stock has underperformed the sector, where we are still seeing an absence of foreign investors on any significant scale, so if there’s a massive return on their part to Bezeq shares, there’s some kind of room for upside,\" Levy says.\nDisagreement on defense stocks\nThe two disagree on the defense sector, in which share prices have risen sharply in the past two years, because of the wars in Ukraine and Israel. Leader’s Levy believes that despite the rises there remains value in these companies. \"Looking ahead, even if the war ends, we will still see years of stock replenishment and high defense budgets, and, most importantly, as we have seen in the US and European markets, this is a sector with a momentum of investment, which can of course produce opportunities.\"\nFor his part, Beer Even of Migdal believes that, despite the global trend of expanding defense budgets, the rises in these stocks have run their course. \"The p/e ratios and valuations that the defense companies have reached are starting to be at their maximum. In a scenario in which the war between Ukraine and Russia ends, defense stocks will be heavily hit. The pricing is stretched, and these are areas in which I would be a little more wary,\" he concludes.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 7, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 09:31:00 GMT", "author": "Eitan Gerstenfeld", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

{"title": "Polus Tech drone sensor identifies targets from phone signals", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001515043#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Polus Tech, the tech company of Niv Carmi, one of the founders of cyberattack company NSO, has entered the battlefield for the first time after initially focusing on the search and rescue sector. The company, which was founded in Switzerland, is currently launching a sensor for installation on drones, which can locate targets using the radio signals transmitted from phones. Sources have told \"Globes\" that the company is in talks with Israel's Ministry of Defense Directorate of Defense R&D (DDR&D) (MAFAT) about putting its products on the market. No response was forthcoming from Polus Tech, which operates in stealth.\nThe new sensor has applications in the field of search and rescue and among other things, its systems were deployed during the rescue of survivors from floods in Jakarta, Indonesia, as well as in floods that have hit Europe in recent years. Last March, it helped locate survivors from Tropical Cyclone Alfred, where it also activated a cellular signal sensor installed on a helicopter. But Polus Tech is also interested in providing the sensor to Western armies to help identify terrorist and war targets, assisted by military intelligence.\nIdentification from the sky\nIdentifying terrorists using their mobile phones is currently undertaken by expensive means, such as planting Trojan horse software on phones, as carried out by companies such as NSO and Paragon. But this is an operation that requires numerous approvals and, in democratic countries, also a judge's order and the involvement of many parties in the process.\nCellular location using sensors is an old method and much cheaper when performed from the ground, using devices called IMSI Catchers, or using cellular base stations that act as radars in 5G phone networks. However, such location has not yet been systematically conducted from the air using a direct line of sight to the target. A sensor that roams the air and is installed by a drone can track the target live and provide a better intelligence picture than other existing means, certainly when cellular infrastructure is more outdated. It is not clear what technology is at the core of the Polus sensor, but it is assumed that it involves detecting radio frequency (RF) signals emitted by mobile phones.\nThe Polus sensor is mounted on drones that fly in the medium-high range, usually at an altitude of over one kilometer - too high to be intercepted by simple devices but low enough to use relatively simple cameras. According to company executives who spoke with Israeli officials, it appears that in addition to the sensor, the company is marketing a smart mission manager capable of talking to other systems on the same drone, including the command and control system.\nUsing flying cellular sensors like these can, for example, could have quickly detected the movement of a group of terrorists, as happened on the night of the 7th of October, and swiftly alert military intelligence. As far as is known, Polus-Tech does not breach the mobile phone and its content, as is done by cyberattack companies.\nThe idea was conceived during the war\nPolus Tech was founded in 2016 by Carmi in Zug, Switzerland with a joint investment from Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) unit Elta Systems. Subsequently, Shavit Capital, a fund specializing in late-stage investments, whose investors include Leon Recanati, also backed the company. Eyal Danan, Elta's representative in Europe, still serves on the company's board of directors.\nCarmi is a graduate of a secret IDF unit in the Intelligence Corps, and was one of the founders of NSO, which he left after less than a year. He founded Polus almost a decade ago with the aim of harnessing the skills he acquired during his life in the field of cellular communications for humanitarian purposes - using cellular means to locate those trapped in the rubble of natural disasters and war zones. Polus's intercepting cellular cell is a kind of intelligence compromise between a complete invasion of privacy like NSO, and passive listening like on telephone lines. The intercepting cells (IMSI catcher) simulate a regular cellular antenna, which manipulates the victim's cellular device to send signals to it instead of the cellular company's antenna. In this way, it is possible to listen to conversations, but also to victims of disasters, even if they are unconscious, due to cellular signals transmitted.\nSince the start of the war, Carmi, who spent many years in the Israeli defense establishment in classified positions and was discharged with the rank of major, began searching for cellular-based solutions that could assist the army in the field of intelligence and counterterrorism, as a lesson from October 7, when the Ministry of Defense did not gather sufficient digital signal-based intelligence and those that were collected were not analyzed properly. For example, the operation of many SIM cards at once was not interpreted as a sign of an attack because of past exercises in which similar cases occurred - however, monitoring the mass movement of mobile phones to the border could have provided the appropriate warning.\nA market worth billions\nPolus is not the only company in the RF sensor market for detecting ground and air targets, although it is the only one that does so from medium-altitude drones. Other companies active in the field of radio sensors are CRFS, and also GAO Tex, which focuses on 4G and 5G applications, and cannot be used for security activities in war zones.\nUS defense giant Northrop Grumman is also experimenting with building radio sensors, and in Israel, R2 is operating to locate drones and their operators by detecting changing radio signals. Dr. Zion Hadad's RunEl is applying positioning technology to the civilian market, in which cellular signal sensors know how to locate subscribers at soccer stadiums to let them order food and drink directly to their seats. The market for AI sensors for organizations is estimated to be between $10 and $15 billion.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 6, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Sun, 06 Jul 2025 14:13:44 GMT", "author": "Assaf Gilead", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

{"title": "Red Dot raises $320m third fund", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001515086#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Israel-based early growth venture capital firm Red Dot Capital Partners has announced the closing of its third fund. The firm has secured $320 million in commitments, bringing its total assets under management to $750 million. The partnership consists of Yoram Oron and Yaniv Stern (Founding Partners), Barak Salomon (Managing Partner), Atad Peled, and Danielle Ardon Baratz.\nRed Dot says that the new fund will continue to invest in early-stage growth companies across a broad range of sectors, focusing on companies that demonstrate early signs of product-market fit and that are laying the groundwork for scalable growth. Red Dot typically meets founders as early as the seed stage and leads Series A to C rounds in companies generating $1-5 million in annual revenue. Initial investments typically range from $10 million to $20 million. The new fund has already invested in four companies: Finout, which was voted \"Globes\" Most Promising Startup of 2025, Stigg, Oligo, and Bria AI.\nAccording to Red Dot, its investors frequently collaborate with its portfolio companies through commercial partnerships and, in some cases, follow-on investments. The new fund’s investor base has expanded to include Israeli institutional investors such as Harel, Mor, and Meitav, as well as investors from countries without official diplomatic relations with Israel.\n\"For some, investing in an Israeli tech venture fund serves as an economic bridge, a first trust-building move toward potential future expansion of the Abraham accords\" Yaniv Stern said. \"In today’s complex environment, their decision to invest in Israel’s tech ecosystem reflects their interest and trust - not just in Red Dot, but in the broader Israeli innovation landscape.\"\nRed Dot notes that the fundraising was completed against a backdrop of a challenging venture capital environment: reduced liquidity has limited the availability of capital for alternative investments, uncertainty around company valuations has complicated fund performance assessments, and higher interest rates have made competing asset classes more attractive. Additionally, the situation in Israel following October 7 added further complexity. \"We encountered exceptional circumstances - from air raid sirens disrupting investor calls to traveling after October 7 to meet LPs in countries without diplomatic ties to Israel in order to secure signatures,\" said Barak Salomon. \"Nonetheless, the recognition by global investors of Israel’s position as a leading innovation hub, particularly in AI, cloud, cyber, quantum, defense, and silicon, provided meaningful momentum.\"\nAmong Red Dot’s investors are funds from Singapore, Japan, and other countries in East Asia. Its original investment was from Singapore based Temasek, which invested in venture capital fund Vertex, in which Yoram Oron was also a founding partner. Between Vertex, which invests in early-stage startups, and Red Dot, which invests at a later stage, there is, however, no commercial relationship.\nRed Dot’s partners say that demand for investment in their third fund amounted to $400 million, but that they had to cut allocations in order to maintain a suitable ratio between the desirable number of investments and the number of partners. The fund does not invest at the seed or pre-seed stages, but in more mature growth companies that already have annual sales of between $1mn and $5 million, usually at the A to C stages. The fund generally invests between $10 million and $20 million in its initial investment, and takes a stake of between 10% and 20% in the company. Its partners regularly take a seat on the board of directors of investee companies.\nNotable Red Dot exits include Global-e, which made its Nasdaq IPO in 2021 and has a current market cap of some $6 billion; Armis, which was acquired by Insight Partners and Google’s investment arm for $1.1 billion, and in which Red Dot still holds shares; Granulate, acquired by Intel for $650 million; Paragon, acquired in early 2024 by private equity firm AE for some $900 million; and Sealights, acquired by Tricentis.\n\"Globes\" estimates that Red Dot’s first fund, which amounted to $150 million and was raised nine years ago, yielded a five-fold return to its limited partners. The $215 million second fund, raised in only 2020, has not yet yielded a return, but it is close to full payback.\nAmong Red Dot’s other portfolio companies are Coralogix, Quantum Machines, Travelier, Ctera, Anecdotes, EverC, SupPlant, and Trigo.\nThe third fund represents a considerable achievement for Red Dot, which until recently was fairly unknown, but which this year has become one of the largest venture capital firms in Israel, while older established and better known firms have struggled to raise new funds in recent years.

{"title": "Leader sees Bank of Israel rate cut on Monday", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001515017#utm_source=RSS", "text": "The end of the war between Israel and Iran has raised the question of whether the Bank of Israel will cut interest rates sooner than expected. Before the outbreak of Israel's operation in Iran, the market estimated that the central bank would cut the interest rate in September, but now the market is pricing in a 10% probability of a cut this week, a 65% probability of a cut in August, and an interest rate level of 3.6% by next summer.\nLeader Capital Markets also believes there is a chance that the Bank of Israel will cut interest rates in its upcoming decision tomorrow. In their estimation, there is a 65% chance of an interest rate cut this week, due to the decline in Israel's risk premium and the sharp appreciation of the shekel, which has strengthened by 6.1% against the basket of currencies since the last interest rate decision.\nLeaders also notes that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in May indicated a general moderation in inflation, including in rental prices, product prices, and service prices. Alongside this, core inflation excluding government intervention (VAT, etc.) moderated to 2.5% from 2.9%, close to the center of the Bank of Israel's price stability target. Leader also notes that \"pre-war indicators point to moderation, according to the composite index (+0.1% in May, stagnation since December 2024) and according to credit card purchase data (annual rate of 1.3% in February-April)\". Finally, Leader also refers to the rest of the global environment as a factor that is expected to support an interest rate cut: \"Since the last interest rate decision, most central banks in the world (except the US Fed) have cut interest rates or are signaling an interest rate cut\".\n\"The Bank of Israel will wait for inflation to converge towards the target\"\nOther institutional investors like Meitav and Phoenix do not expect interest rates in Israel to fall until September. Matan Shitrit, Phoenix's chief economist, says, \"Will we see an interest rate cut tomorrow? In our opinion - the answer is no. We are not betting on a reduction for August either, at least not with high probability, although we would be happy to be surprised. The main reason - the approach of dependence on the latest data and not on forward expectations (Data Dependent), when annual inflation is still above the upper target limit, and is expected to remain so in the August decision. On the other hand, it is easier for us to bet on September, since the Bank of Israel is expected to see annual inflation within the target, and if the stars align, perhaps the Fed will also take the first step by then.\nBank Hapoalim chief financial markets strategist Modi Shafrir agrees with Shitrit and believes that the interest rate tomorrow will remain unchanged, \"But due to the sharp appreciation of the shekel and the decline in inflation expectations, the Bank of Israel is expected to hint at a cut in interest rates in the coming months (August or September).\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 6, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Sun, 06 Jul 2025 11:41:03 GMT", "author": "Maya Levin", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Nvidia embarks on huge investment in Israel", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001515005#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Nvidia has published a request for information (RFI) to find a plot of land between 70 and 120 dunams in area (17.5-30 acres) for the construction of a research and development campus of between 80,000 and 180,000 square meters, with immediate contiguous building rights, located between Zichron Yaakov in the south west, Migdal Ha’emek in the east, Kiryat Ata in the north, and Haifa in the west. Nvidia currently has a total of over 100,000 square meters of office space in Israel, in Yokne’am, Tel Aviv, Beersheva, and Tel Hai.\nPublication of the RFI indicates Nvidia’s intention of entering into one the largest real estate deals ever by a foreign technology company. It I estimated that it plans to spend up to NIS 500 million on buying the land, and a further NIS 1.5 billion on the construction of the new campus, which will house several thousand new employees of a company that already employs about 5,000 people in Israel.\nThe planed built space is so large that it bears no comparison to almost any commercial or office building constructed in Israel in recent years. Azrieli Group’s Spiral Tower currently under construction in Tel Aviv at an investment of NIS 500 million in high-demand land and a further NIS 2 billion in construction, will contain a total of 150,000 square meters of space, which is less than Nvidia intends to build in the north. The total floor pace of one of Azrieli’s existing three towers in Tel Aviv is 45,000 square meters. Nvidia intends to build in the north of Israel, where land is much cheaper. Agricultural land rezoned for commerce and industry in the Jezreel Valley area or the Lower Galilee will cost some NIS 300 million, and up to NIS 500 million if Nvidia decides to locate its campus in a high-demand area, such as Haifa.\nAccording to the RFI published this morning, it would appear that Nvidia seeks to build an additional campus not far from its campus in Yokne’am, which is based on Mellanox, which Nvidia acquired in 2020, and which is the employer of most of Nvidia’s workers in Israel. At the same time, Nvidia is looking for a site \"with high transport accessibility, close to main routes and public transport.\" It can therefore be assumed that it will want to locate the campus close to Road 6 or to a station on the railway line that connects Tel Aviv to Nahariya via Haifa, or on the Jezreel Valley railway.\nIn order to obtain such a large contiguous area of land, Nvidia will probably not be able to negotiate with a single seller. It will encourage separate entities such as a group of kibbutzim or moshavim to combine to offer land and have it rezoned for industry.\nNvidia continues to see Israel as one of its strategic sites, and it is expanding all its activity in the country. Last month, it announced that it was doubling the area it rents in one of the twin Rubinstein towers in Yitzhak Sadeh Street in Tel Aviv to 22,000 square meters, more than half the floor space in the building. It will provide space for 1,200 employees, and enable the company to expand its software activity in Israel and to attract high-quality workers from the center of the country. This morning’s RFI indicates that Nvidia still sees the north of Israel as its most important focus of activity, and seeks to expand there.\nThe activity in the north based on the acquisition of Yokne’am-based Mellanox for $6.9 billion has turned out to be highly profitable for Nvidia, and one of the best technology acquisitions of all time in terms of the ratio of price to return. In the year before the acquisition, Mellanox had annual revenue of $1.3 billion. By April 2025, its activity had grown five-fold, and its workforce had doubled. In the last quarter, Nvidia’s communications activity based on Mellanox generated revenue of $5 billion, and it is the company’s second most important division, after the computing division, which includes the server and AI products.\nNo comment was forthcoming from Nvidia.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 6, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Sun, 06 Jul 2025 08:46:00 GMT", "author": "Hilit Yanai-Levison and Assaf Gilead", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

The high error rate, or \"noise\" is it is known in the industry, is a product of the microscopic scale on which the quantum operations take place.\nTo clear up the noise in the physical qubits, Qedma uses a mechanism based on optimization of measurements carried over time, one after another, such that the computing may be slightly slower, but it achieves a level of accuracy higher than average for the industry. The collaboration with IBM has been going for four years. Qedma carries out trials on an IBM quantum computer costing millions of dollars, and it is one of three companies that have been granted access to IBM’s quantum operating system, alongside Finnish company Algorithmiq and Q-CTRL from Australia. The collaboration with IBM has now matured into investment.\nDr. Sinay, who serves as Qedma’s CEO, believes that the \"quantum threshold,\" at which the qubits will become \"clean\" enough for a quantum computer to be able to carry out computing tasks more powerfully than existing super-computers, is closer than ever. \"IBM published its road map up to 2029, and other companies, such as Quantinuum, QuEra, and IonQ, are at advanced stages of processes that will enable us to see practical quantum applications by 2030. We at Qedma will demonstrate the quantum advantage in a trial with one of the largest ion computing companies in the world by the end of the year,\" Sinay says.\nNote: The amount raised by the company has been corrected from the previously reported figure.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 3, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 03 Jul 2025 18:14:00 GMT", "author": "Assaf Gilead and Meytal Vaizberg", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

This is a smart and modular system that constitutes a technological solution based on three layers necessary for effective countermeasures against drone and UAV threats - detection, identification and neutralization of the threat. The system incorporates advanced radar and enables the combination of various types of sensors: an electro-optical camera, advanced detection capabilities and the neutralization of the threat by means of 'soft kill' of all types of drones and UAVs in a defined area.\nThe added value that Sentrycs, which specializes in RF (radio frequency), will bring to the Drone Dome system is an intelligence layer, which will allow the system to quickly distinguish between authorized and unauthorized drones, reduce false alarms, improve the identification of communication frequencies, the location of the drone and its operator. Identifying the operator is significant, because in this way it is possible to neutralize extensive activity more quickly.\nUnlike conventional drone defense solutions that rely on layered and continuous detection processes, Sentrycs's aim is to interact with the drone's communication protocols, making it possible to identify and track immediately upon signal detection. Analyzing communication at the protocol level between the operator and the vehicle enables extensive situational awareness of the threat.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 3, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 03 Jul 2025 12:51:00 GMT", "author": "Dean Shmuel Elmas", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

Some destinations have disappeared from the departures and arrivals board at Ben Gurion airport, while some have been added, but above all, uncertainty reigns supreme. Turkey, which has been closed to Israeli flights for almost two years, is the most prominent example, but not the only one: Cape Town and Dublin have also fallen off the map following diplomatic crises with Israel.\nCarriers like Turkish Airlines and Pegasus, which previously operated about 20 daily flights together to Israel, are not expected to return in the foreseeable future. Both have given up their slots in Israel, an asset of great financial value, as it allows flights to operate at convenient and in-demand times.\nFlights to Marrakesh and Casablanca, which were previously operated by Israeli and Moroccan airlines, have been halted, as are flights to Cairo, Sharm el-Sheikh and Amman. Hong Kong, which was an important destination for business flights, also disappeared from the map following the absence of Cathay Pacific, which did not return to Israel throughout the war and has announced that it will not return until further notice. Toronto and Delhi will have no direct flights in the foreseeable future. Air Canada, if it returns, is expected to do so only in early September, and Air India at the end of August.\nTerminal 1 remains closed\nThe destinations to which low-cost airlines used to operate flights have lost popularity for Israelis. Terminal 1 remains closed due to the low amount of air traffic at Ben Gurion Airport, which does not justify operating two terminals. The return of low cost carriers is not in sight. Even Wizz Air, which used to resume its flights to Israel relatively quickly compared with rivals Ryanair and EasyJet, is not expected to return to Israel until September.\nOther destinations have not completely disappeared from the map, but they have become much less accessible, and can now only be reached via Israeli airlines. London, for example, is less accessible due to the absence of British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, easyJet and Wizz Air. British Airways and easyJet have announced that it will not return before the end of October - effectively giving up on the summer and holidays. Virgin Atlantic has gone so far as to announce completely halting flights to Tel Aviv with no expectation of renewal.\nAmsterdam is in a similar situation. Dutch carrier KLM announced that it would not resume flights until further notice, and easyJet has canceled its flights to Israel to October 25. easyJet's absence also affects other destinations such as Milan, Basel, Geneva and Berlin. In Germany, the situation is similar. The Lufthansa Group, which normally operates flights to Munich and Frankfurt, won't return before the end of July, which leaves routes to Germany in the hands of Israeli companies alone.\nThe worst distress is on routes to the US, which are currently only available through El Al and Arkia. El Al is the only airline that operates flights to US destinations other than New York.\nDestinations that have strengthened\nAmidst all this uncertainty, several new destinations have also been added to the map. El Al has started operating flights to Kefalonia in Western Greece, a destination that is slowly gaining popularity. Israir has been operating flights to the Peloponnese in Greece, while Arkia was operating charter flights to Madagascar as well as Zadar in Croatia, and Kalamata in Greece. According to reports, SAS is expected to return to Israel this October and operate direct flights to Copenhagen, for the first time in years, but it may change its mind before October.\nEshet Tours VP Shirley Cohen Orkaby says, \"The destinations that have strengthened in the past year and a half are close, cheap, and with high personal security, such as Prague, Burgas, the Balkan countries, Montenegro and Croatia. Malta, for example, is a destination that has not been active since the Covid pandemic. Greece has always been an attractive destination, but it is a little more expensive, so people are also looking for new destinations. Batumi is also a very strong destination, especially for this coming summer. Cyprus's reputation rose mainly because it was a major hub during the closure period, and this only reinforced the fact that Israelis were very attached to it.\"\nOphir Tours vice chairman Yoni Waksman says, \"There are destinations that were temporarily affected mainly due to aviation restrictions, such as the US, which for a period could only be flown to with El Al. Arkia only recently added this route. On the other hand, there has been a strengthening in destinations such as the UAE and the Middle East, due to the increase in flights by Emirati airlines. Nearby destinations Cyprus and Greece have also maintained high popularity due to the accessibility of flights by all Israeli airlines, alongside two Israeli-owned Cypriot airlines.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 3, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 03 Jul 2025 08:55:06 GMT", "author": "Stav Livne", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Israel Tax Authority revises wealth fund forecast upwards", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001514825#utm_source=RSS", "text": "The Israel Tax Authority has announced revised upwards the revenue forecast from royalties on gas and oil profits, following an upward revision of the gas reserves in the Leviathan reservoir and the discovery by Energean (LSE: ENOG; TASE: ENOG) of the small Katlan offshore field.\nThe current forecast sees the wealth fund receiving $57 to $74 billion over the years, compared with the previous forecast of $55 to $72 billion in 2024. In the coming decade alone, the fund is expected to bring in between $19 and $23 billion. These are just the revenues for the wealth fund, while the state also benefits from the gas reserves through the regular levies on natural resources, as well as from the profits of the gas field partners.\nThe wealth fund, officially called the Citizens of Israel Fund, is Israel's national wealth fund, which is used to accrue some of the revenues that the state collects from the gas partnerships in exchange for the production and sale of gas reserves in Israel's economic waters.\nUnlike the regular levy that goes directly to the state coffers, the wealth fund contains the \"Sheshinsky tax,\" which is collected from companies once they have passed a profit threshold that is supposed to cover their investments. So far, only the Tamar reservoir has paid the royalties, and will soon be joined by the export-oriented Leviathan reservoir and the smaller Karish reservoir, which is being used only for the domestic economy.\nA jump in revenue\nThis is expected to lead to a jump in the fund's revenue. According to the latest estimate, at least $290 million will enter the fund in 2025, an amount that will almost double to $550 million in 2026, and double again to $1.2 billion in 2027. The maximum estimate for that year is $1.9 billion. Revenue is expected to peak in 2031, when the fund will bring in between $2.7 and $3.1 billion. After that, unless new gas reserves are found, revenues will gradually fall until the gas reserves are depleted.\nAccording to the law, the fund began its operations as soon as it accumulated NIS 1 billion, which occurred in 2022. It will be possible to withdraw 3.5% of the assets accumulated in it each year for purposes such as investment in renewable energy and employment in the Negev. After the eighth year of operations, which will be in 2030, it will also be possible to withdraw profits from the fund.\nOne of the fund's aims is to prevent spending the large amounts collected all at once, which would cause \"Dutch disease\" - over-strengthening the local currency and hampering export industries, while government gets used to the large but temporary revenue from the gas reserves.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 3, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 03 Jul 2025 06:37:45 GMT", "author": "Idan Eretz", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

The US has already begun to ease the sanctions on Syria, and as part of its attempts to resolve the tensions between Israel and al-Sharaa's patron, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the US could lift the ban on the sale of F-35 aircraft to Turkey - a step that would significantly harm Israel's air superiority in the region.\nAs part of his regional vision, President Donald Trump wants conflicts to end - all the more so when it comes to tensions between Washington's strategic allies like Israel and Turkey. To realize this, Trump is putting a lot of money on the table. \"Greece and Israel are working with the US to delay approval of the sale of F-35s to Turkey,\" a senior Greek official tells Globes. \"However, all parties have already realized that it is only a matter of time before Turkey is brought back into the project.\"\n\"By the end of the year, there is a likelihood that we will reach a solution (to the F-35 issue),\" US Ambassador to Turkey Tom Burke told state-run Anadolu news agency. The main stumbling block on the way to approving the sale of fifth-generation aircraft to Ankara is not related to Israel, but to congressional laws. Turkey was removed from the F-35 project during Trump's first term, in 2019, because of Erdogan's insistence on purchasing Russian S-400 air defense batteries. The same deal led to the imposition of CAATSA sanctions, which stipulate that if you procure Russian weapons, you are defined as an adversary of the US and sanctions are imposed. \"All of these things have been discussed for five years,\" Ambassador Burke noted. \"F-35 F-16, S-400, sanctions, tariffs. Enough. \"We have to move this aside, and Congress wants to reexamine the issue.\"\nThe Turkish concession\nThe current situation is uncomfortable for the US, which operates the Incirlik Air Force Base in eastern Turkey, where nuclear weapons are stationed, and the Kurecik radar base, which is believed to have aided Israel during the Iran operation. Congress is not expected to agree to the continued deployment of the S-400 batteries, for which Erdogan reportedly paid Russia $2.5 billion, but Turkey will give them up on a model that would be favorable to Ankara. A likely scenario that would also meet Turkey's interests in strengthening the Syrian regime is to transfer the systems to Syria.\nOn the ground, it appears that the Turkish president is already engaged in a public relations campaign to get the Turkish public used to the idea of giving up the S-400 systems, after the damage caused by their procurement. Using the superiority that Israel demonstrated over Iran, Erdogan is telling the public that the S-400 systems are unable to meet \"full\" Turkish air defense requirements. \"Our society has realized this these days (in connection with the Israel-Iran war),\" Erdogan said. \"We are required to create a multi-layered air defense system.\" If Erdogan does succeed in bringing his country back into the F-35 project, a question mark will surround the continued huge Turkish investments in the development of the Turkish fifth-generation Kaan aircraft, which should become operational in the next decade and compete with the advanced aircraft manufactured by Lockheed Martin.\nSyrian refugees returning home\nThe US is interested in expanding the Abraham Accords, and Washington's ambition is to create a package deal that will include the realization of all goals, knowing that in the absence of F-35 aircraft, Erdogan will find it difficult to normalize relations with Israel.\nErdogan's hardship stems from two main factors: First and foremost, the Palestinian issue is very significant in Turkish politics in general and in Erdogan's voter base in particular. As a result, any normalization of relations with Israel is accompanied by great criticism from within. At the same time, with the establishment of the Abraham Accords in 2020, Turkey was one of the most critical voices against the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco. Now, if al-Sharaa enters the Abraham Accords, Ankara will be required to find explanations for the green light it has given to such a significant move at the regional level that benefits Israel.\nAnkara will not admit this, but there has been satisfaction over Iran’s weakness and the vulnerabilities in its ballistic missile and nuclear programs, even if Israel’s considerable power does not align well with Turkish interests. \"We do not understand why Israel does not internalize that our interests are aligned - especially in preventing Iran from regaining its influence in post-Assad Syria,\" a senior Turkish official told Al-Monitor.\nDuring Israel's Iran operation, senior Turkish security officials arrived to inspect the Turkish-Iranian border, due to concerns about an influx of refugees that would weigh on the Turkish economy. One of Erdogan’s considerations in encouraging the swift takeover of Syria by al-Sharaa immediately after the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah was the desire to return the three million Syrian refugees living in Turkey return home without forcing them back. Turkish state data indicate that since the coup in December, more than 300,000 Syrians have returned home.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 3, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 03 Jul 2025 04:13:04 GMT", "author": "Dean Shmuel Elmas", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Israelis staying 75-days annually could be liable for tax as residents", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001514806#utm_source=RSS", "text": "What is the definition of an Israeli resident for tax purposes? According to planned new legislation, anyone who stays in Israel for 75 days or more in a tax year, and whose total stay in Israel over three years is at least 183 days, will be considered an Israeli resident and will pay tax on all income to the Israel Tax Authority, including overseas income.\nThe memorandum for a new law states that criteria will be set in which an individual will be defined as an Israeli resident or foreign resident, based mainly on the number of days spent in Israel, without the need to examine all family, economic and social ties. On the other hand, anyone who has stayed in Israel for less than 74 days in each tax year for three consecutive years will be considered a foreign resident.\nThe purpose of the new law, which the Tax Authority published for public comment, is to increase certainty regarding the determination of residency for tax purposes, reduce friction between the Tax Authority and taxpayers and their representatives, and reduce damage to the state coffers from tax planning.\nIn recent years, the Tax Authority has been conducting dozens of disputes with Israelis who have traveled or lived abroad for certain periods and have not reported their income there, claiming that they were not residents of Israel. At the center of the most famous tax case in recent years was international supermodel Bar Refaeli, who was convicted along with her mother Tzipi Refaeli of a series of tax offenses, including concealing her income abroad. Another case that made headlines was poker player Rafi Amit, who paid tax as an Israeli resident despite spending most of his time abroad.\nBut disputes with tax authorities over whether those leaving are still considered residents are not reserved only for the rich and famous. This is an issue relevant to tens of thousands of Israelis who choose to travel to work abroad for fixed periods, ranging from a few months to several years. The legislation will have a significant impact on the decision-making process of all Israelis who wish to relocate or leave the country for a certain period of time.\nThe center of life criterion\nAccording to the Income Tax Ordinance, Israeli residents are required to pay income tax in Israel on all their worldwide income, while non-residents are required to pay tax in Israel only on income sourced in Israel. Thus defining if a person is an Israeli resident is very significant. Today, an individual is considered a resident of Israel if their \"center of life\" is in Israel. In examining the location of an individual’s \"center of life,\" various qualitative characteristics are examined, including the place of their permanent home, their place of residence and that of their family members, their place of usual occupation or place of usual employment, and the center of their economic interests.\nAlongside these qualitative criteria, there are also quantitative criteria relating to the number of days the individual spends in Israel during each tax year. However, the determination based on the number of days spent in Israel can be adjusted, based on the qualitative criteria of the center of life test.\nAbout two years ago, following the recommendations of a Tax Authority joint committee, the State Revenue Administration, and representative organizations, which dealt with the issue of international taxation, a memorandum for a new law was published, which was never enacted. The bill sought to define clear cases in which counting the days of stay is sufficient for setting residency, and in which there is no need to examine all the other components of the center of life test to determine whether the individual was an Israeli resident or a foreign resident in any specific year. The current proposed law sets a similar mechanism but establishes different assumptions that increase certainty relative to those in the previous memorandum, and leaves a smaller number of cases in which it will be necessary to examine the center of life test, following a re-examination and public comments.\nSetting residency based on the number of days only\nThe memorandum proposes to establish absolute assumption (non-rebuttable assumptions) based on the days of stay of the individual and his family in Israel, which, if fulfilled, will see the individual as a resident of Israel or as a foreign resident, as the case may be. According to the proposal, two types of absolute assumptions will be established - the first type, assumptions that, if fulfilled, will see the individual as a resident of Israel, and the second type, absolute assumptions that, if fulfilled, will see the individual as a foreign resident.\nThese assumptions will apply only in cases where the individual, or the individual's spouse, has stayed in Israel for a large number of days within a period of several years (in which case the individual will be considered a resident of Israel) or if they have stayed in Israel for a small number of days over a number of years (in which case the individual will be considered a foreign resident). These are clear cases in which counting the days of stay is sufficient for setting residency, and there is no need to examine all the other components of the center of life test to define if the individual was an Israeli resident or a foreign resident in that year.\nIn other cases, which do not fall within the scope of these clear cases, the existing law, which will be changed, will continue to apply, which includes the center of life test, as interpreted by the courts.\nAccording to the memorandum, an \"Israeli resident\" is someone who stayed in Israel for 75 days or more in the tax year, and whose total period of stay in Israel in one of the three-year periods is at least 183 days of stay calculated according to the following formula. A person who stayed in Israel for 30 days or more in the tax year and whose total period of stay in Israel over the three years is at least 140 days of stay, and whose spouse, including a common law spouse, will also be considered an Israeli resident for tax purposes.\nOn the other hand, someone who stayed in Israel less than 74 days in each tax year for three consecutive years and whose total period of stay in Israel did not exceed 110 days - will be considered a foreign resident, even if they have a permanent home and family in Israel.\nAnyone who together with their spouse, including a common law spouse, stayed in Israel for 90 days or less in the tax year, and whose total period of stay in Israel for each of the three-year periods is a maximum of 125 days will also be considered a foreign resident.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 2, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 14:42:00 GMT", "author": "Ela Levi-Weinrib", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Israel-US plan $200m quantum fund with UAE, Saudi Arabia", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001514752#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Former head of Israel's Military Intelligence and executive director of Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) Maj. Gen. (res.) Tamir Hayman is promoting, together with members of the US House of Representatives and Senate, the establishment of a joint US-Israel research fund for quantum computers. The proposed fund will have a budget of $200 million to fund collaborative projects with potential involvement of the UAE and Saudi Arabia, \"Globes\" has learned.\nIsrael and the US are considering promoting the plan through a presidential order signed by Donald Trump, or by promoting a bill submitted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio in 2021, when he was still a senator from Florida - to establish the research center. The legislation was not advanced during the Biden administration, and now both countries see an opportune time to implement it using an existing framework.\nAccording to the proposal formulated by the INSS and AIQ-Lab (AI & Quantum Sovereignty Lab) founder and CEO Dr. Smadar Itzkovich, which promotes policy in the field of AI and quantum computing, the legislation could make use of existing models for joint funding of Israel-US research in various foundations. Among them, the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development.(BIRD) Foundation, which finances technological collaborations, BSF - the Binational Science Foundation, and the US-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD) - which deals with joint agricultural ventures, some of which have been active since the 1970s. In the same format, the US and Israel will each invest $100 million between 2026 and 2030 in joint commercial ventures with private quantum companies - Israeli and American.\nIn this way, for example, Quantum Source, an Israeli company which is developing technology for implementing photonic quantum computers, could submit a joint application with US company PsiQuantum - which is currently building the world's largest photonic quantum computer - and be awarded millions of dollars for developing a joint venture.\nThe possibility of diverting budgets from the 2022 US Chip Act, which sought to invest $280 billion in the US hardware industry, to the fund is also being looked at. This may be done by examining the possibility of financing international cooperation under the law. The management of the fund will be divided between offices in Tel Aviv and Arlington County, Virginia.\nAccess to a data centers\nAccording to the proposal, among the aims of establishing the binational venture are: \"neutralizing Chinese ambitions in the quantum field through access to advanced hardware,\" commercializing quantum technologies for medical applications and developing new materials, and harnessing new countries to join the Abraham Accords - with Saudi Arabia at the forefront of the venture.\nSaudi Arabia joining the fund could open Israeli and US quantum companies to new investments, as well as to the graphics processors and data centers adapted to the age of AI that are being built in the region as a result of Trump's visit to the Middle East in May. In addition, according to the proposal, after the establishment of the center and the introduction of existing Abraham Accords partners, including the UAE and Bahrain, Central Asian countries such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan will also be added, and in the longer term - depending on the development of the Abraham Accords - also Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and even Qatar.\nLow priority\nTo enable joint research in the quantum field, Israel needs approval from US security agencies for joint development of quantum technology - an area that has been closed to Israeli cooperation due to Israel's refusal to monitor exports to China. Israel was close to such approval three years ago. During the Lapid government, Israel signed \"Jerusalem\" agreements with the US for joint technological development and joint working groups were built in the fields of quantum, climate, health, agriculture and AI.\nTo move forward with joint research, Israel was asked to pass regulations and legislation that would tighten the possibility of technology leakage to China according to CFIUS regulations in the US, to avoid buying Chinese equipment for government agencies, and to tighten supervision of IP leakage from Israeli academia to China. However, the Lapid government was replaced, and in the current government the issue is a low priority and has not been promoted, which explains why President Biden included Israel in the category of countries to which exports of graphics processors should be monitored. Furthermore, the initiative to establish the Quantum Research Fund is currently being promoted by non-governmental organizations such as INSS and AIQ. These organizations are in contact with parallel institutes in the US, members of the Senate and House of Representatives, and relevant lobbies.\nIsrael leads in the field\nThe initiative to establish the fund arose due to Israel's absence from the AI agreements signed in May between the US, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, and due to the failure to advance Rubio's 2021 bill for US-Israeli cooperation, which then concerned the field of AI. However, in Israel, US interests are now being recognized in the Israeli quantum industry, because of predictions of breakthroughs in the field and hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for Israeli companies that are considered leaders in the sector, including Quantum Machines and Classiq.\n\"Israel ranks among the five leading countries in the global quantum industry and its 'density' of experts in Israel is six times higher than in the US,\" says Dr. Smadar Itzkovich, one of the program's initiators. \"The US understands this and recognizes that there is planning for such legislation ahead of the US midterm elections and the general elections in Israel next year.\"\nHadas Lorber, a former senior official in the National Security Council, leads the INSS project focused on strengthening Israel-U.S. relations. \"We are now in the perfect storm in which Trump's US can give Israel partnerships that it may not have been open to in the past - there is a favorable Congress, and regional momentum after the Iran operation in which the Israeli advantage is clearly visible in the Middle East. The US also now has an interest in embracing the countries of the region to prevent their leakage to the Chinese side of the map. For Israel - this is a critical alliance - if we are not around the regional geo-technological table that dictates the new alliances, we simply will not be. If we were late for the AI train, we have enough time for it in quantum.\"\nAccording to Dr. Ariel Sobelman, a senior researcher at INSS, \"The bottleneck today in the development of AI and quantum is the inventory of computing infrastructure - the large data centers specializing in AI, and the electricity infrastructure that feeds them. The connection point to the Gulf and Saudi Arabia is aimed at these points - Israel may have knowhow in AI and a dominant group of startups and leading researchers in the quantum field, but it needs the computing and electricity infrastructure of the Gulf countries - the UAE, Bahrain and in the future Saudi Arabia too.\nThe Trump administration understood this by harnessing the world's energy suppliers in the Gulf, with the understanding that by 2030 the US will need a much larger electricity supply to drive its AI activity, while at the same time taking their eyes off China.\"\nSince the beginning of the year cooperation between the Gulf states and the US in the field of AI is growing. For example, the Trump administration announced the Stargate project to network the country with data centers in partnership with the MGX UAE wealth.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 2, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 13:15:00 GMT", "author": "Assaf Gilead", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Fares rise despite \"Transport Justice\" program", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001514745#utm_source=RSS", "text": "At the end of April, the fare tariff for public transport in Israel changed. The fare for a single journey rose from NIS 6 to NIS 8, and the price of monthly passes rose accordingly. Together with the fare hike, the Ministry of Transport launched the second phase of the \"Transport Justice\" reform initiated by Minister of Transport Miri Regev, whereby, in addition to free travel from age 65, discounts were given to people living in neighborhoods in socio-economic groups 1-5 (out of ten) by the definition of the Central Bureau of Statistics. This was in addition to the discounts in the first stage in the reform to settlements in groups 1-5, to people aged under 26, and to demobilized soldiers.\nThrough these discounts, the Ministry of Transport managed to deal with political demands by the haredi parties, embodied in the coalition agreements, for discounts on public transport for married yeshiva students and for haredi settlements. Many Arab settlements also benefit from the reform.\nAmid public criticism of the rise in fares for a service that remains sub-standard, the Ministry of Transport consistently claimed that 80% of Israel citizens came within the scope of the reform and could benefit from the discounted fares, with the result that for them travel on public transport would not become more costly.\nThis claim can be tested by means of the Consumer Price Index published by the Central Bureau of Statistics. The latest index reading, for May, went scarcely noticed in the midst of the war with Iran. It shows, however, that the rise in fares certainly had an impact, as the public transport item rose 9.8% that month.\nThis rise was exceptional, as only a few items rose by more than 3% in May: fresh fruit by 3.9%, and sweets and chocolate also by 3.9%. The general transport and communications category actually fell by 2.4%, but within that category, as mentioned, the rise in the public transport item was exceptionally high.\nService, not price\nNevertheless, although the price of public transport demonstrably rose, that is not enough to determine whether the fares reform was a negative or positive step. On the one hand, it has increased the cost of living for anyone dependent on public transport. On the other hand, government officials and transport experts claim that, contrary to basic economic logic, which would have it that a lower price brings higher demand, most of the public is not sensitive to price when it comes to public transport, but rather to service and reliability. In order to improve service and reliability, it is necessary to raise the price.\nThe Ministry of Finance has for years wanted to raise public transport fares, and it has now found an opportunity to do so. Journeys on public transport are hugely subsidized by the state, and the amount grows from year to year. It has jumped fourfold in the past decade, to some NIS 14 billion. At the same time, revenue from passengers has diminished over the years. In 2023, it averaged NIS 2.7 per journey, which compares with NIS 8 in 2004.\nThe growing subsidy to some extent offset the erosion in revenue, but did not lead to additional investment in public transport in a way that would attract more people to use it. Before the fare hike to NIS 8, the state subsidy amounted to about 90% of the cost of a journey. The Ministry of Transport believed that if that proportion could be reduced, it would be possible to invest more in service.\nIn other OECD countries, fares are much higher, and the state subsidy is substantially lower than in Israel. In these countries, not only are bus services more frequent, but infrastructure has been built that gives priority to public transport, such as bus lanes and rail tracks.\nFor Israel, all these things are late in coming. The state does not spend more than NIS 400 million annually on public transport lanes, while the five-year plan for them is budgeted at NIS 6 billion.\nThe Ministry of Transport said in response, \"The reform needs to be distinguished from the Consumer Price Index. The reform encourages a switch to using period tickets that give extensive and substantial discounts, rather than single journeys. The benefits are given to subscribers and not to public transport users in general. The effect of the benefits will be felt gradually, a more passengers adopt the periodic subscriptions.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 2, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 10:34:00 GMT", "author": "Asaf Zagrizak", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

Now, with a modest market cap of $1.1 billion, the veteran technology company is apparently looking for a buyer.\nYesterday, news website Semafor reported that the company had hired the services of an investment bank to find a buyer. The item was published during the trading session in New York, but Verint stock still lost ground. After Bloomberg reported that US private equity firm Thoma Bravo was in talks to buy Verint, however, the share price jumped by about 15% in late trading. Verint declined to comment on the report.\nVerint, which has been headed by Dan Bodner for three decades, provides software solutions for call centers combining analytics and AI, and designed to improve the customer experience. The company is US-based, but has a development center in Herzliya. Four years ago, Cognyte, which provides intelligence and cyber solutions, was spun off from Verint. Before the spin-off, the company’s market cap was $3.7 billion. Verint itself was spun off from Comverse Technology in 2013.\nIn the first quarter of this year, Verint’s revenue declined by 9.6% to $208 million, and its net profit attributable to shareholders shrank by 89.4% to $1.6 million. On a non-GAAP basis, first quarter net profit was $18.4 million, which compares with $42.6 million in the first quarter of 2024.\nWhen the results were released, Bodner said that he pleased with the growth in the company’s pipeline and the positive momentum in its AI products. In its report, Semafor stated that a possible sale of Verint would give an indication of how far AI is disrupting established industries. In this instance, the reference is to AI agents replacing human service representatives.\nAccording to Yahoo! Finance, seven investment houses cover Verint.

Such a deal would make India an even more important customer for Israel’s defense industry than it already is. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), between 2020 and 2024, India accounted for 34% of its export sales.\nIndia’s interest in IAI’s missiles arises from the lessons learned from the conflagration on its border with Pakistan in May, in which Rampage missiles hit Pakistan Air Force bases. Those missiles are produced jointly by Elbit Systems subsidiary IMI Systems, IAI’s MLM Division, and rocket propulsion company Tomer. The Indians now realize that they need long-range, precision air-to-ground missiles, hence their interest in the Air Lora.\nFire and forget\nThe Rampage missile has a range of 250 kilometers, and the Indian Air Force uses it on its Sukhoi 30 and MiG 29 aircraft. It is very accurate, but its range puts India’s combat aircraft at risk from Pakistan’s Chinese-produced air defense systems. The Air Lora missile has a range of 400 kilometers, which enables combat aircraft to hit their targets without endangering themselves in the face of advanced air defenses.\nAir Lora, which was developed in IAI’s MLM Division, is designed for attacking missile sites, military bases, and air defense systems, without endangering planes and pilots. The missile weighs 1,600 kilograms, flies at supersonic speeds, and uses satellite navigation protected against disruption. One of its outstanding features is that it is \"fire and forget\", meaning that once it has been launched at the target, there is no need to guide it. It can carry various warheads, for deployment against soft targets or against bunkers. With its 400 kilometer range and accuracy to within ten meters, it will enable India to hit any Pakistani base.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 2, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 07:52:00 GMT", "author": "Dean Shmuel Elmas", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

{"title": "Airlines want retroactive exemption on compensation claims", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001514694#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Some Israeli and foreign airlines and tour operators have asked Minister of Transport Miri Regev, Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich, and Minister of Economy Nir Barkat, to exempt them from the need to compensate passengers whose flights were canceled or changed due to Israel's operation against Iran. The airlines insist that the exceptional circumstances during the fighting does not allow them to meet the requirements of Israel's Aviation Services Law, and they are asking the government to intervene and ease the situation.\nThe main demand is a retroactive exemption from the obligation to provide assistance services to passengers such as financing accommodation, food, communications and transport, as well as offering an alternative flight, in cases where this was not possible. The companies are asking that they only be required to refund passengers the fare of canceled tickets, and claim that rescue flights approved by the state should be considered alternative flights. If the exemption is not granted, the companies demand that the state compensate them for the expenses they incurred during this period, including empty flights, loss of revenue, and compensation claims from passengers.\nAlternatively, the companies propose activating Section 9A of the law, an emergency mechanism added after October 7, which allows the Minister of Transport to declare, with the approval of the Knesset economy committee, a \"special situation\" in aviation. Such a declaration allows for the temporary suspension of some of the passengers' consumer rights, including restricting accommodation to two nights, shortening advance notice of flight cancellation from 14 days to 3 days, and exemption from payment of financial compensation. In such a case, the companies demand that the state bear the cost of the assistance services. This solution, according to the demand, should also apply retroactively from June 13.\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) representative in Israel also appealed to Miri Regev, with an urgent request to declare a retroactive exemption from the obligations imposed on airlines under the Aviation Services Law for flights canceled or changed from June 13, 2025 due to the Iran operation. If an exemption is not granted, IATA requests that the state compensate the companies for these costs. The request is being made on behalf of all IATA's member airlines, both Israeli and foreign, saying this was an exceptional security situation justifying regulatory flexibility.\nAs of now, a 'special situation' has not been declared, and the companies are still required to comply with the full provisions of the law, including providing an alternative flight and accommodation services without a time limit, even when they did not have the option of operating flights to Israel.\nThousands of passengers are already suing the airlines\nAbout a week ago, the Consumer Protection Authority sent a letter to the Israeli airlines, in which it addressed claims that arose during the Iran operation, when passengers whose flights to Israel were canceled only received an offer of a refund, without being given the opportunity to choose an alternative ticket, as required by law. According to the Consumer Protection Authority, this is a consumer violation. Real-time fares were significantly higher than the amount passengers were refunded, which led to financial loss and in many instances leaving them unable to return home. The Consumer Protection Authority stressed that the law requires offering passengers a choice between a refund and an alternative flight, and the decision in this matter should be in the hands of the consumer, not the airline.\nThe practice is not limited to Israeli airlines. \"In recent weeks, Israeli and foreign airlines have denied passengers rights without telling them,\" explains Goni Letzter, founder and owner of Righty, an online platform that allows passengers whose flights have been canceled to exercise their rights without having to do so directly with the airlines. In recent weeks, Righty has received requests from over 1,000 passengers, and according to estimates, the numbers are expected to increase significantly as more passengers who were stranded abroad return to Israel. \"There is currently regulatory uncertainty, and airlines are pinning their hopes on a possible change in the law, which may allow them to avoid payment or assistance in the future.\"\nAccording to the Aviation Services Law, there are three main rights for passengers: statutory compensation, an alternative flight ticket or refund, and assistance services (accommodation, food, communication). Since the closure of airspace, the statutory financial compensation obligation is not valid (since the flight cancellation was not under its control), but the right to an alternative flight ticket and refund remains in effect. Passengers are forced to spend significant amounts on accommodation, food, and communication, and there are also Israelis who are unable to return to Israel because they are not offered an alternative flight. In many cases, airlines did not even notify passengers about this or provide them with an alternative ticket.\nLetzter says, \"Although the companies can and are able to offer alternative flights or flights to nearby destinations, in most cases they simply did not do so. In only a few cases were passengers proactively offered a hotel voucher, but even then, no one informed the passengers that this was their right. In practice, many passengers paid and are still paying large sums out of pocket. The law, in its current form, does not limit the scope of assistance either in time or in money. Unless the Minister of Transport declares a \"special situation\" according to the amendment to the Aviation Services Law from last February - then the rights are reduced: passengers receive assistance services with a limit of only two nights. The amendment made in the past was proportionate to the circumstances, and it is hoped that this will also be the case in the current plan.\"\n\"Flight organizers (travel agents and travel agencies) also have full responsibility towards their customers. In practice, many agencies have abandoned their customers. There have been cases of organized trips where the tour guide simply abandoned the passengers at the end of the trip, without assistance or response. Some agencies have switched to \"emergency\" mode and started offering paid rescue flights. There are also those that have charged illegal handling fees, in complete violation of the law. According to the law, passengers are entitled to a full refund, and the agent is obliged to assist them if they request it.\"\nWill European regulation protect Israeli passengers?\nThe Aviation Services Law was enacted as part of an Israeli commitment as part of the EU Open Skies agreement. Israeli law is similar in many ways to European regulation EC 261/04. In Europe, there is no limit on assistance services even in extreme events. When a flight departs from the EU, or is operated by a company that has signed the agreement, it is subject to dual regulation, both European and Israeli, and the Israeli passenger also has the option of suing in Europe. The absurdity is that Israeli passengers benefit more from the protection of European regulation than from that of Israel itself.\nLetzter believes that despite the magnitude of the aviation crisis in Israel, this is not a unique or unprecedented case in its scope. \"There is an attempt to depict the current situation as an unprecedented aviation crisis, but from a global perspective this is not unusual. The CrowdStrike incident, for example, affected 4% of global aviation, but passenger rights were not affected. Hurricane Debbie in Florida, cybersecurity attacks, strikes and fires, all caused many cancellations worldwide, but did not lead to a change in regulation. No country or airline has denied basic service or prevented fair compensation from passengers, even when it was a case of force majeure or unforeseen circumstances. Now, Israel is considering another amendment to the law, even though companies, especially Israeli ones, still benefit from the situation and do not bear the costs. If it is amended, it will create a situation in which Israelis will be better off suing airlines in European courts.\"\nFor example, the McDonagh v. Ryanair ruling issued by the European Court of Justice in 2013 states that even when a flight is canceled due to extraordinary external circumstances beyond the airline's control, such as a volcanic eruption, the company is still required to provide passengers with all the assistance services stipulated by law: accommodation, food, transport, etc. The court stressed that the duty to provide assistance remains in effect indefinitely, even when there is a long waiting period, as the passengers are in a state of helplessness and have no other way to return home. The ruling constitutes an important precedent in Europe, and it strengthens the protection of passengers' rights in times of crisis.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 1, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 15:22:00 GMT", "author": "Stav Livne", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

This brings the total amount raised by the company to $45 million. Also participating in the finance round was existing investor Aguras Pathology Investments. The company is developing AI-based personalized medicines in collaboration with Oracle.\nImagene AI was founded in 2020 by CEO Dean Bitan, CDSO Jonathan Zalach and CTO Shahar Porat. The company uses a variety of data sources, such as biopsies, genomic information and medical record data, to improve clinical trials for companies, and for personalized medicine, such as diagnosing diseases, testing response to treatment, predicting disease recurrence, and more. The company's activities began in the field of oncology, and are now expanding to other areas.\nThe system has been implemented to date in about 20 medical centers and laboratories around the world, including some of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies. The company's most advanced test allows it to identify cancer mutations in a healthy person based on the biopsy image, and this in a few minutes instead of several weeks in the mutation detection process today, which allows the start of personalized treatment earlier. The test is already approved for marketing and is distributed in the US by Tempus. In Israel, the company collaborates with leading medical centers, including Ichilov and Sheba hospitals.\nEllison said, \"Imagene AI's ability to unite imaging, omics, and clinical data in a single foundation model is exactly the kind of breakthrough we believe will drive the next generation of drugs and diagnostics.

The Haifa Municipality is promoting a first-of-its-kind policy document to reduce the number of abandoned buildings in the city. A survey conducted revealed that there are some 700 abandoned buildings in Haifa, which wastes land resources, scars the urban fabric, harms the housing market, and costs the municipality NIS 33 million annually in lost taxes.\nIn November 2024, the National Economic Council conducted a study on buildings that are unfit for use, including residential buildings. It found an estimated 2.5 million square meters in Israel that are defined as unfit for use, most of the buildings in areas of demand.\nExemption from municipal taxes encourages owners not to act\nThe National Economic Council recommended promoting legislation that would require property owners to pay municipal taxes, initially partially, and then in full - according to their classification, after three years in which the buildings will be exempted. All this in the hope that their owners will work to renovate and use them.\nThe Haifa Municipality estimates that there are 700 abandoned buildings in the city, and that they cost the municipality NIS 33 million annually in lost tax revenues. This is according to information that will be revealed at the Future Plans for Haifa and the North conference to be held this week in Haifa.\nAccording to Vitali Dubov Dotan, head of Haifa Municipality's abandoned buildings unit, the reasons for the abandonment of the buildings are many and range from large renovation costs, disputes between heirs and buildings in unsought-after areas. Added to all this is the exemption from municipal taxes, which encourages owners not to act.\nFollowing the conclusions of the National Economic Council's report, the municipality decided to promote its first policy document, which will deal with reducing the number of abandoned buildings in the city. The municipality will contact property owners, and encourage them to use them, to assist in promoting plans or building permits, and perhaps connect them with entities that would be interested in purchasing or renting the properties, and providing loans for renovation.\nDubov-Dotan says that when he contacts property owners, he receives a wide variety of responses. \"When it comes to a large building owned by a company or corporation, there is already professional and business ability to move things along. When it comes to private apartment owners, they are suspicious and ask me what they would be given in return. Of course, they were not given financial compensation, but professional guidance.\" However, the core of the problem lies, in his opinion, in the fact that there is currently no real lever of pressure, as long as the owners of abandoned buildings are exempt from municipal taxes.\nDan Kaczynski, CEO of the Real Estate Center, which is organizing the Haifa and North Future Plans Conference, says, \"Haifa is a pioneer in dealing with abandoned buildings and the first to establish a regulated local mechanism for the systematic treatment of this complex phenomenon, and it could serve as a model for other cities to follow in the coming years.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on July 1, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 12:15:00 GMT", "author": "Arik Mirovsky", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "TASE board approves Friday trading", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001514595#utm_source=RSS", "text": "In the midst of Israel's Iran operation, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE:TASE) board of directors headed by chairman Prof. Eugene Kandel convened to decide on a change to the TASE regulations so that trading will take place from Monday to Friday instead of Sunday to Thursday, as at present. The change, which is supported by the Israel Securities Authority and Bank of Israel, will come into effect at the start of 2026.\nThe change will bring the TASE into line with the trading days of the world's main stock markets, which do not trade on Sundays. Trading on Sundays will be canceled and trading on Fridays will end at 2pm so that traders will have time to return home before the start of Shabbat. About six months ago, Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich announced that would approve the change in trading days.\nThe collective agreement with the stock exchange employees has been updated in preparation for the transition to the new trading week.\nA move to increase accessibility for foreign investors\nThe decision by the TASE board of directors effectively launches the move that was first announced a little over a year ago. From the TASE perspective, the change in trading days is a strategic move that will help increase accessibility for global investors, increase their presence in the Israeli market, and contribute to the Israeli economy and local companies in particular.\nTASE CEO Itay Ben Zeev told \"Globes\" at the end of last year, \"This is a joint move by us with the Securities Authority and the Bank of Israel, which stems from the understanding that we are part of the world. The whole world trades from Monday to Friday, and we know from foreign investors that the fact that we are not open on Friday bothers them. In the long run, this will bring more foreign investors and increase the chance that we will be able to enter indexes like MSCI Europe. This will bring passive money to the market, which in turn will also attract active funds.\"\nThe move has many supporters in the capital market, who claim, among other things, that a large part of trading is already done via apps, so that there will be no need for substantial changes in the personnel of trading bodies. On the other hand, changing trading days is expected to result in changes to existing employment agreements at banks, investment houses, insurance companies, and, as mentioned, at the TASE itself.\nLivnat Mizrahi Rinsky, CEO of IBI Brokerage, a TASE member, said, \"We welcome the change in trading days and its acceptance for foreign markets on Mondays and Fridays. We are confident that this will lead to an increase in trading volumes in the context of foreign client activity in Israel and in general.\"\n\"This is an important and fundamental step both in terms of connecting the Israeli capital market and the stock exchange to the world and in terms of the exchange member's activity with customers.

The size of the order for TSG, which develops advanced software systems and solutions for the defense and commercial markets, is for hundreds of thousands of dollars, and a source close to the matter has told \"Globes\" that the end customer is the US Army.\nThe order marks the start of the March agreement signed between the parties, in which TSG's advanced technology will be integrated into advanced sensor-based defense systems. As part of the order, the Israeli company will provide licenses for the use of the advanced system it has developed, which will be integrated into the US Army. \"Licenses are our product.

{"title": "Rafael wins $2.2b Romanian air defense deal", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001514565#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Romania's Ministry of Defense announced today that it has selected Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems as the winner of its tender for the procurement of a short-range and ultra-short-range air defense system (V/SHORAD). The tender is worth an estimated €1.9 billion ($2.2 billion), with previous reports indicating that the system offered by Rafael is the Spyder. The agreement between the Romanian Ministry of Defense and Rafael has not yet been signed, but the ministry’s statement indicates that the decision has been made and the signing is a formal procedure.\nOn signing, this deal will become the second largest defense sale ever by the State of Israel, after the sale of the Arrow 3 air defense system by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) to Germany in 2023, for $3.5 billion. That deal broke the record of the sale of the Barak 8 (MRSAM) systems to India in April 2017, for $1.6 billion. About a month later, naval Barak 8 missiles were sold for an additional $630 million.\nSpyder is an advanced air defense system, which is in operational use in several armies around the world, including the Czech Republic and Morocco, and provides air defense solutions at different ranges and against a variety of aerial threats, including drones, aircraft, helicopters and short-range ballistic missiles. The system intercepts the threats using two families of interceptors manufactured by Rafael - Python and Derby.\nThe tender that Rafael won was approved by the parliament in Bucharest in 2020, and the procurement process began in 2023. This strategic deal completes Romania's air defense procurement, which included shoulder-launched missile systems and platforms for long-range threats.\nThe Romanians plan to finance part of the deal, using funding from the EU, including the Ammunition Production Support Act (ASAP) and the Strengthening the European Defense Industry through Joint Procurement Act (EDIRPA), which will require the Israeli company to subcontract production to companies In Europe, and Romania in particular. However, Rafael has extensive experience in integrating foreign companies, with its well-known product series - Spike series anti-tank missiles - being manufactured in Europe by Eurospike, which is a joint venture of Rafael and two European companies, with equal holdings.\nRafael defeated Germany and France\nBeyond the deal itself and its high value, this is a significant achievement for Rafael, due to the rivals it faced in the tender: the Korean company League NEX1 was eliminated from the process last year, due to problems with the tender documents, but more significant than it were the European giant MBDA and the German company Diehl. MBDA, headquartered in Paris, offered the Mistral 3, while Diehl offered the IRIS systems. About a month ago, Rafael remained the final bidder left in the tender process, but at that time, there was concern that it might be canceled, due to gaps between the Israeli company and the Romanian Ministry of Defense. Gaps that were clarified today that had been resolved, and led to the closing of the deal.\nA substantial advantage of the Spider system, which likely influenced the Romanian decision-making process, is the possibility of using the Spider in its unique All in ONE version. This configuration offers a complete air defense system that includes: an integral radar, a dedicated electro-optical payload, an advanced command and control system, and Python and Derby interceptors, all installed on just one vehicle.\nThis configuration constitutes an optimal air defense solution for point defense or as air defense for maneuvering forces, as part of a Spider battery or in an independent deployment and operated by a minimal team of operators. In a trial conducted in January 2024 in Israel, several scenarios simulating existing and future threats were examined, during which the Spider system, in its new configuration, intercepted an unmanned aerial vehicle in a challenging operational scenario with a direct and precise hit.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 30, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 18:42:00 GMT", "author": "Dean Shmuel Elmas", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "All Israelis will foot bill for mandatory rooftop solar panels", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001514556#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Later this year, Israel will become one of the first countries in the world to require the installation of solar panels on roofs, according to new regulations approved by the National Planning Authority, Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, and the Ministry of Interior. From December, obtaining an occupancy permit (Form 4) will be conditional on the installation of solar panels on roofs of every house with a roof area of more than 100 square meters, industrial buildings, public buildings, and even non-residential buildings with a roof area of 250 square meters or more.\nThe regulations were approved as part of a trend to expand electricity production from solar panels on roofs, with a target of 100-150,000 roofs by 2030, and increasing production from them even more by 2040. This is to decentralize the grid and increase use of renewable energy. While the benefits are clear, experts and government officials warn that it will cost hundreds of millions of shekels a year in incentivized tariffs paid to the owners of the rooftop solar panels, which will roll directly onto our electricity bills. Despite the criticism, the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure insists that there is a market failure that needs to be fixed.\nThe Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure has also approved new payment methods for those who install solar panels on their roofs, with a more rapid return on investment and linking payments to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). All this while locking in the price for 25 years, even assuming that production from solar panels will become more efficient and cheaper in the future. Today, panels that produce up to 15 kilowatts reward the property owner with NIS 0.48 per kWh, 3-4 times the amount paid for panels on large solar fields, and even NIS 0.54 per kWh for properties in large cities. Electricity consumers pay the bill for these incentivized tariffs.\nThe public is in no rush\nDespite the generous subsidy, there are only about 30,000 solar paneled roofs in Israel. According to Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure sustainable energy division head Ron Eifer the reason is \"A lack of familiarity with or attention to the issue among builders\" as well as \"an ‘agency problem’ in which the party constructing the building will often not be the party that will benefit from the ongoing profits from the solar panel system.\" This is why, he says, the law requires the installation of a relatively small system (starting at 5 kilowatts, such as a small private roof), and the roof owners will decide whether they want to expand it.\nThe first US state to impose such a legal requirement was California in 2020, and a few years later France and Italy enacted similar legislation, as well as several states in Germany. The EU will gradually impose such a requirement between 2026 and 2032.\nBut the question arises: Why are both subsidies and coercion required? According to Eifer, there are major benefits that make it worthwhile. \"It contributes to making the electricity sector cleaner, more decentralized and more resilient. Also, bringing electricity production closer to where it is consumed will save on electricity losses and the need to build expensive power lines that take up a lot of space.\"\nBut some doubt this. A study by the National Economic Council claims that even after calculating the benefits in saving land in the Negev and the costs of building transmission infrastructure, it is still more profitable to build large solar fields than hundreds of thousands of solar roofs. These are significantly more efficient, and require a much lower payment per kWh produced. In addition, there is no need for a long-term commitment of 25 years and special payment tracks. According to the same study, converting solar rooftops and other dual-use projects with a low chance of realization to large ground-based solar fields would save the economy about NIS 8 billion.\nHowever, Eifer from the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure stresses that the ministry's policy is to promote both fields and solar panel rooftops. The Israel Electricity Authority is also concerned about the considerable cost, especially due to the high payment guaranteed to those who install solar panels on their roofs. They estimate that, assuming that the solar roofs will not come at the expense of ground-based facilities but at the expense of conventional gas-fired generation, reaching the Ministry of Energy's goal of 100,000 new solar roofs will cost the electricity sector NIS 425 million per year. Reaching the more ambitious goal of 150,000 roofs will cost NIS 888 million per year - which will increase electricity bills for the entire country by 2.5%.\nWhile the Electricity Authority recognizes the advantages that the Ministry of Energy presents on solar paneled roofs, it is concerned about the high price. \"There are great advantages in the requirement to install solar panels on roofs, because it will make it easier to plan a more efficient and cheaper distribution network for consumers,\" the Electricity Authority says, \"However, as the subsidy for renewable energies is already high today, the Authority recommends focusing on creating a tariff structure that will encourage investments without an additional and burdensome cost on the electricity tariff for consumers.\"\nEither way, at the end of 2026, the current regulatory arrangements around subsidies for solar panels on roofs will end, which will open the door to lowering the tariff for new installers. If this happens, will allow for more efficient planning of the network, but with a lower subsidy for production.\nIn any case, the main hope of the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure is actually fewer private homes, and more large solar roofs such as those on factories and hospitals that will produce much more for the first 15 kilowatts purchased by the Israel Electric Co. (IEC) at an extremely high price.\n\"Extreme and harsh step\"\nA senior government official in the energy sector is protesting the new policy to force the installation of solar paneled roofs, calling it an \"extreme step\" and \"a harsh regulation that violates property rights, raises housing prices and increases the cost of living.\" According to him, \"There are already high solar panel tariffs that encourage installation and guarantee a handsome return for those who choose to do so. The fact that the scope of installation is insufficient does not justify the use of the harshest regulatory tool: a blanket requirement.\"\nIn the private sector, opinions are divided: the Manufacturers' Association, whose factories will be a major factor in the production of solar paneled roofs, is strongly opposed. According to its president, Dr. Ron Tomer, \"We see this as a gross interference by the government in the considerations of industry and the business sector.\" He would prefer \"regulatory incentives for installing solar panels, such as fast-track building permits, so that they choose to install these panels of their own free will and not through regulatory coercion that could only harm them.\"\nOn the other hand, solar panel installers will of course benefit from the new regulations. Volta Solar founder and CEO Eran Tal says, \"Solar energy is a critical national infrastructure, especially in a densely populated, hot, and threatened country like ours. The obligation to utilize the roofs of public, commercial, and private buildings for the production of clean electricity is a necessary step in terms of energy security, emergency resilience, and economic savings for every household. From the perspective of the entire economy, saving land, reducing pollution, easing the burden on the electricity grid, and increasing energy independence are steps that carry double value - both for the national economy and for the individual consumer.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 30, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 15:06:00 GMT", "author": "Idan Eretz", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Israeli tech companies raised record amounts in Q2", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001514484#utm_source=RSS", "text": "The second quarter of 2025 is shaping up to be one of the strongest quarters in capital raising for Israeli tech companies in recent years. But estimating exactly how much money was raised depends on who you ask and how you count.\nAccording to the IVC-LeumiTech report for the second quarter, about $2.72 billion was raised in 90 financing rounds, up 20% compared from the preceding quarter. In contrast, Startup Nation Central estimates the total fundraising to be more than double - about $6 billion. The gap between the estimates is not new, and is due to differences in measurement approaches. IVC relies on deals that have actually been reported only, and does not include confidential rounds and those whose details have not yet been published. Startup Nation Central, on the other hand, also incorporates estimates of deals that have not yet been disclosed, alongside information from broader sources. In the current quarter, the gap may be largely due to the inclusion of Safe Superintelligence (SSI) massive round, which reportedly raised $2 billion - a deal that was not included in IVC’s report.\nThe IVC report was published too soon to include cybersecurity company Cato Networks $359 million financing round, announced today, the final day of the quarter.\nHowever, both reports show a recovery after a prolonged period of declining funding. Startup Nation Central notes that the first half of 2025 was the strongest since the \"hype\" days of 2021, with total funding of $9.3 billion, a 54% increase over the previous half. However, IVC highlights a decline in the number of rounds, amid a trend of convergence towards follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies.\nDespite the differences in numbers, both reports point to the same trend: much of the capital flowed into generative AI, and cybersecurity. According to IVC, 85% of the total capital was invested in 37 rounds in these two areas. There was also a significant strengthening in the defense-tech sector, due to the war and the demand for advanced command and control systems.\nThe enterprise software sector led in fundraising according to Startup Nation Central, with $3.19 billion in 71 rounds, up 32% from the previous half. The sector includes, among other things, companies that provide software solutions for businesses, such as information management platforms, automation, cloud infrastructures and tools for organizations.\nThe cybersecurity sector ranked immediately after it with fundraising of $1.98 billion in 56 rounds, followed by the fintech sector with fundraising of $751 million in 29 rounds, including $500 million raised by Rapyd. Also notable are the giant deals by cybersecurity companies Cyera, which raised $540 million, and Island, which raised $250 million, as well as AI company AI21 Labs, which raised $300 million, deals that significantly impacted the data. However, there was an overall fall in the number of new rounds: from 214 in the first quarter to 151 in the second quarter, according to Startup Nation Central.\nSignificant exits and dominant global investors On tech exits, Startup Nation Central reports there was a historic record in merger and acquisition deals in the first half of 2025, with $39.2 billion, mainly due to Google's acquisition of Waze for $32 billion.\nNext Insurance was acquired for $2.6 billion and Melio for $2.5 billion, were other notable acquisitions. Outside of acquisitions, eToro's IPO on Nasdaq, valued at over $5 billion, was also successful, with the company's stock jumping by more than 30%.\nLeumiTech CEO Maya Eisen-Zafrir said, \"The technological strength that Israel demonstrated during the operation in Iran, and the signs of positive developments in the region, provide optimism for investors.\"\nStartup Nation Central CEO Avi Hasson added, \"Entrepreneurs continue to build, and investors continue to believe, even in the midst of a complex security reality.\"\nMore data in an encouraging picture\nAlong with the increase in capital raised, an encouraging trend was seen in the early stages in the second quarter: investments in seed and pre-seed round jumped 50%, to $607 million, although the number of rounds fell from 157 to 150, Startup Nation Central reports. Mid-stage rounds (B and C) saw an even sharper recovery, with a 60% increase in funds raised, from $1.05 billion to $1.68 billion, according to Startup Nation Central. The life sciences sector saw the highest number of rounds, 69, but raised only $623 million, with a median raising of just $2 million.\nIn addition, Startup Nation Central reported a five-year high in PIPE investments - private investments in public companies, a figure that indicates a return of interest from institutional bodies in Israeli tech, and also in trading on the TASE and not only in private fundraising. According to IVC, in the second quarter, about 190 fundraising rounds were completed, but only 90 of them were publicly reported as of the date of publication of the report. This means that its official figure of $2.72 billion represents only the visible part of the actual quarterly activity.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 30, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 12:48:51 GMT", "author": "Meytal Vaizberg", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

{"title": "Cato Networks raises $359m at $4.8b valuation", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001514443#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Israel's cybersecurity industry continues to raise vast sums from foreign investors. Cato Networks has announced the completion of a $359 million Series G financing round at a company valuation of $4.8 billion.\nIn less than two years since its previous financing round, the company's valuation has jumped from $3 billion to nearly $5 billion and become one of Israel's most valuable cybersecurity companies. Earlier this month Israeli data security company Cyera raised $540 million at a company valuation of $6 billion and in March enterprise browser security company Island raised $250 million at a valuation of nearly $5 billion.\nCato Networks annual recurring revenue (ARR) increased from $100 million at the end of 2022, on the eve of the previous round, to $250 million at the end of 2024. This figure represents a multiple of 19-20 on revenue, a low figure compared with earlier stage companies, but more realistic and more appropriate for a mature growth company like Cato, which raised its first capital almost a decade ago.\nIf Cato wants to hold an IPO, this represents a reasonable multiple, which is appropriate for Wall Street. Palo Alto Networks' revenue multiple is about 15, while Fortinet's is about 12. According to Cato, it is growing at twice the rate of the rest of the market in which it operates, the cloud-based network security (Secure Access Service Edge -SASE) market, and it claims that it is increasing its market share at the expense of players like Palo Alto Networks, Cisco, and Fortinet.\nThe round was led by new investors including Vitruvian Partners and ION Crossover Partners as well as existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners, Acrew Capital, and Adams Street Partners. The latest financing brings the total amount raised by the company to more than $1 billion. In the past Cato's investors have included Greylock, Coatue, Singtel and SoftBank.\nThe company's high growth rate brings it closer to an IPO. Cato's founder and CEO Shlomo Kramer told \"Globes\" even before the outbreak of the war in October 2023 that the company would go public in late 2024 or early 2025. But it seems that Cato is still waiting for an opportunity to go public, especially since it is not yet known when it will move to profit..\nCato says, \"The company maintains a high level of preparedness to become a public company, and we will be ready to do so at the push of a button, when the timing is right and market conditions are optimal. The current funding strengthens the company's financial position and gives us the flexibility needed to accelerate strategic initiatives, as well as to continue to challenge the boundaries of the SASE and AI-based security industry, deepen the variety of uses supported by the platform, and expand the potential market (TAM) to additional customers.\"\nCato was founded by Kramer and his former colleague at Imperva Gur Shatz who is no longer with the company, as a \"third generation of enterprise firewall,\" - a cybersecurity company that uses the latest cloud technologies to protect the corporate communications network from the outside world. It became a unicorn in 2020, when it raised $130 million, but it took a little longer to gain recognition. Cato has 1,400 employees including about 700 in Tel Aviv's Landmark Tower.\nOnly in 2023 did it manage to convince the research firm Gartner to establish a special industry category for the field and call it \"SASE\" - SASE (or: Secure Access Service Edge). In the ranking of companies in the field published last year by Gartner, Cato was placed in second place, between Palo Alto Networks and Netscape.\nThis category contains companies that have developed a new way to protect access to devices in an organization - such as a phone, computer, car or even a refrigerator - all connected to the cloud - through a service provided to the IT manager, also via the cloud.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 30, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT", "author": "Assaf Gilead", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

Startups that participate in these challenges and are selected by the company will conduct pilot programs for integrating their technologies within Teva, fully financed by the company.\nThe program is international, but is being launched in Israel in collaboration with the Israel Innovation Authority, the 8400 Health Network, and Startup Nation Central. Teva said that it hoped that Israeli companies would be leading participants in the challenges.\nNew challenges twice a year\nTeva intends to launch new challenges twice yearly on set dates. In addition to the call for proposals, Teva will actively look for companies that could be appropriate for participation. As mentioned, the challenges will concern the integration of innovations in all areas of Teva’s business. For example, one area in which a challenge might be launched is technologies for reducing the use of animal trials.\nYossi Ofek, general manager of Teva Israel, said, \"Two years ago, we launched our Pivot to Growth strategy, the aim of which was to place a greater emphasis on innovative products and to grow faster in the coming years. So far, that strategy has been very successful. We are now at the acceleration stage.\n\"In order to continue to grow rapidly, we also need to be at the forefront of the adoption of the new supporting technologies in the drug business, specifically in AI. The aim is to reach a situation in which we can bring more drugs to the market, at lower cost, in a shorter time, for the benefit of Teva and of humanity as a whole.\"\nIsrael is a world leader in these areas. \"Teva’s connection with the Israeli biomed ecosystem is already strong,\" says Ofek. \"We invested, for example, in the Sanara incubator for digital health and medical devices, and later in Sanara Capital. There are already fifteen startups there. We are investors in the Aion Labs venture studio, together with other companies, where we set up companies that use artificial intelligence to meet challenges at the cutting edge of science at the advanced stages of drug development. We have cooperation arrangements with academic institutions in Israel, chiefly in brain research, and in the wake of the war we have also set up a support project in mental health. We also have a support program for those who treat patients, and we also support accelerators in the areas of psychological resilience and health.\" Teva already has several collaborations with Israeli AI companies.\nTeva CEO and president Richard Francis came to Israel specially for the launch of the challenge here. This is not the first time that Francis has come to Israel in less than ideal conditions from a security point of view. Francis stressed the reputation and success of the local ecosystem and the potential for creative cooperation.\nMark Sabag, Teva executive vice president International Markets Commercial, said, \"We are looking at Israel for the long term, and we see great potential there and a future engine for finding the best solutions for many links in the Teva value chain - from drug development, to production, operations, and the commercial side.

{"title": "THAAD's Israel deployment proves effective but expensive", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001514426#utm_source=RSS", "text": "As part of the current memorandum of understanding, the US invests $3.3 billion annually in military aid to Israel but in the operation against Iran, US assistance reached an especially high amount. According to the \"Bulgarian Military\" website, during the 12 days of fighting between Israel and Iran, the US has launched about 15%-20% of all THAAD system interceptors in the world against Iranian ballistic missiles, costing more than $800 million.\nTHAAD was developed by Lockheed Martin. The system is designed to intercept ballistic missiles, and directly hits threats to intercept them (Hit to Kill). THAAD is unique in its design to intercept the missiles in the terminal phase, usually at altitudes of 40-150 km, using an advanced radar from Raytheon. Each THAAD battery has 6-8 launchers, with eight interceptors in each.\nThe US system has maneuvering capabilities, similar to Israel's David's Sling, which is designed for mid-range threats, with THAAD able to track up to seven targets at once. In Israel, THAAD is designed to provide protection against the extensive barrages launched by the Iranians. When identifying threats with radar, the Israeli air defense system examines its type, speed and height, and according to all of these - one of the systems is activated.\nThe main disadvantage of the THAAD system\nTwo THAAD batteries have been deployed in Israel by the US. The first battery arrived in October 2024 and the second in April 2025, and their operation, including the cost, is the responsibility of the US. The Americans arrived in Israel with a system that has already proven itself at the operational level, with the first interception on January 17, 2022 of a ballistic missile launched by the Houthi rebels in Yemen against the UAE, but the scale of the interceptions in Israel's operation against Iran does not come close to what THAAD had previously handled.\nThe main disadvantage of THAAD, similar to other US systems, is the extremely high armament costs. Each THAAD US interceptor missile costs about $12.7 million, according to the budget of the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA), much more than the Israeli Arrow 3 (about $2 million) or Arrow 2 (about $1.5 million). A comparison between other Israeli and US systems demonstrates similar results. While a David Sling interceptor missile costs an estimated $700,000, the cost of intercepting a Patriot PAC-3 system is about $6 million. This system was the basis of US defense at the Al-Udeid base in Qatar last week, where, according to \"Defense News\", two Patriot batteries with about 44 soldiers - the oldest of whom is a 28-year-old captain - operated the mission to intercept about 14 Iranian ballistic missiles.\n85%-90% interception rate\nData from the Institute for National Security Studies shows that Iran launched about 591 ballistic missiles at Israel over 12 days, with Israeli and US defense systems intercepting about 85%-90% - a higher rate than expected before the war. Of these, about 60-80 interceptions were carried out by THAAD, according to \"Bulgarian Military.\" Usually, the asymmetric investment between attack costs and interception costs, refers to drones. However, this issue is also reflected in the field of ballistic missiles, especially in the case of US systems. THAAD, with a price tag of about $12-15 million per interceptor, has faced ballistic missiles whose prices range from about $100,000 for relatively old models such as the Fateh-110 to about $1 million for advanced models such as the Sejil or Khorramshahr.\nIn summary, the deployment of THAAD in Israel may provide a challenge to the Trump administration for two reasons: economic and operational. In the economic sphere, the Department of Defense last week presented its budget request for fiscal year 2026, which stands at about $961.6 billion. That amount includes, among other things, $205 billion for procurement, $107 billion for operation and maintenance, and $1.2 billion for R&D. In the longer term, the Pentagon budget is expected to cross the trillion-dollar mark by 2027. As the US is required to invest more in operational use of its interceptors, which are already relatively expensive, the investment will increase.\nAt the same time, the US is deployed all over the world. When the THAAD system was developed in the 1990s, it was aimed at the Iranian ballistic missile threat, but also at that of North Korea. Today, the Chinese DF-21D and DF-26 missiles are also on the agenda, and as Beijing's threat to Taiwan increases and tensions between Pyongyang and Seoul increase, it is possible that the top brass of the Pentagon will wonder whether there is a need to reinforce air defense systems in the East Asia.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 30, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 04:14:02 GMT", "author": "Dean Shmuel Elmas", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

Isrotel notified the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) this morning that the family had sold 2.4 million shares - a 4.4% stake - for NIS 88.30 per share for an overall NIS 210 million. The share price of the sale represents a 7% discount on the current market price at the opening of trade this morning. The deal was led by Tzvika Manes's Barak Capital Underwriters.\nThe Isrotel hotel chain, led by CEO Lior Raviv, has a market cap of NIS 5.6 billion. In the first quarter, Isrotel reported revenue of NIS 368 million, up 14% from the corresponding quarter last year. Net profit was NIS 2.2 million, down 92% from the corresponding quarter last year. This is due to erosion in the gross profit rate and an increase in selling and administrative expenses. These figures precede the Iran operation, the impact of which will only become clear later in the summer, with publication of the second quarter results.\nThe Lewis family sold shares in Isrotel for the first time in February 2024. The family founded the chain in 1980 in Eilat, and has gradually opened hotels around the country. The family's latest move is intended to express confidence in the TASE, due to the war, and primarily to increase the share's tradability. The share is listed on the Tel Aviv 125 index, and has risen by 20% over the past year (before investors reacted to the current sale).

{"title": "Is a BoI interest rate cut on the cards?", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001514321#utm_source=RSS", "text": "The war with Iran, surprisingly, boosted optimism on the local capital market in almost every respect. The stock market reached new heights, prices of government bonds shot up, and the shekel strengthened against the US dollar to a level not seen in two and half years. In the real economy, however, the picture is less rosy. Besides the military costs, the war has meant huge government expenditure on compensation to businesses, and to those whose homes have been damaged. Private consumption was also depressed by the state of emergency and the closure of businesses. Has the time arrived for the Bank of Israel to cut its interest rate?\nThe rate is currently 4.5%, after a single cut, in January 2024, following the outbreak of the Swords of Iron war in the Gaza Strip. Since them, contrary to the trend in most countries (other than the US), the interest rate has remained the same. Why? First of all, because the Bank of Israel is legally required to keep the annual rate of inflation in the 1-3% range. The inflation rate in the twelve months to the end of May was 3.1%. Apart from that, the Bank of Israel is concerned about risks that could accelerate inflation, chiefly the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, which creates uncertainty for economic activity, raises fears of supply-side constraints, and causes volatility in shekel exchange rates. In addition, the US president’s tariff measures are expected to cause extensive price rises.\nWar costs\nThe war with Iran imposes huge costs. Following the outbreak of war in the Gaza Strip, it should be recalled, the government raised the rate of VAT from 17% to 18%, which contributed to higher prices, and it is not inconceivable that a further similar measure will be considered because of the costs of the war in Iran. There are also additional inflationary risks arising from the situation, such as a rise in rents (which account for a quarter of the Consumer Price Index) because of greater demand from people evacuated from their homes, and the fear that Israelis will set off a rise in prices with a spending spree to compensate for two weeks in which the economy was largely shut down.\nLess uncertainty\n\"The inflation story isn’t over, since there’s pressure on rents as a result of the war, and the airlines have not restored all the flights, but I think that the end of the event reduced the uncertainty,\" says Danny Yardeni, head of Bank Leumi’s nostro management division. \"The Bank of Israel has stated more than once that one of the factors that keeps the interest rate at its current level is uncertainty, but it now looks as though, in the geopolitical equation, the uncertainty has receded.\n\"The shekel is strengthening, and inflation expectations as priced in by the capital market are touching 2%, right in the middle of the Bank of Israel’s target range. I believe that these are signs that will enable the Bank of Israel to examine the possibility of not leaving the interest rate at its current level.\"\nYardeni adds: \"We are in a situation in which the state needs a great deal of money for rehabilitation. It’s clear that fiscal intervention is required here. But monetary intervention should also be on the agenda. The market is already pricing in an interest rate cut.\"\nThe Bank of Israel Research Department sees an average interest rate of 4% until the first quarter of 2026, but the markets are more optimistic, and estimate that the rate will fall faster. Yardeni himself expects one rate cut within the next few months. He says that without an end to the war with Iran, \"the expectation of an interest rate reduction was a first cut only towards the end of the year, or even early next year.\"\nIsrael not alone\nIsrael, however, is not entirely alone in the high interest rate band. The US Federal Reserve rate is also 4.5%, despite public pressure from President Trump to reduce it. \"In the US too, the view that inflation is under some kind of control (an annual rate of 2.4% in May, H. S.), and that there’s room to start thinking about cutting the interest rate, is becoming widespread. I’m not sure that we in Israel are in a very different position. Five-year inflation expectations in the US are at 2.3%, and they’re at around 2% in Israel. If calls for an interest rate reduction are growing in the US, then it certainly shouldn’t be different in Israel.\"\nNevertheless, Yardeni stresses that \"the labor market in Israel is tight.\" As demand for workers grows, so do upward pressures on wages, which translates into higher prices all round. \"Therefore,\" Yardeni says, \"the interest rate should not be cut sharply in my opinion, but there is room to examine a gradual reduction.\"\nAn interest rate cut will make life easier for people with mortgages and other loans, but it will also make investment in bonds, money market funds, and bank deposits less attractive.\nYardeni recommends that investors should not make big changes to their portfolios in anticipation of an interest rate cut. \"Everything could blow up again in seconds,\" he says, and recommends CPI-linked government bonds with a medium duration, of two to four years.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 29, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 09:34:00 GMT", "author": "Hezi Sternlicht", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

Because of this, the Ministry of Finance does not plan to increase the rate of debt raising in Israel and abroad to cover the costs of the war.\nRothenberg also believes that the credit rating agencies will respond positively to the geopolitical developments in Israel's security arena after the operation against Iran. This, after having cut Israel's rating several times since October 7.\nIsrael's fiscal deficit was 5% of GDP at the end of May. The target for the end of in the 2025 budget is a fiscal deficit of 4.9% of GDP. Even if the accountant general's positive forecast is realized, and the figure stabilizes at its current level by the end of 2025, the Ministry of Finance will still be required to open the budget, because while the deficit target is not binding, the spending limit is rigid in law, and the government is prohibited from exceeding it, even if revenues have increased.\n\"Continuing tension\"\n\"Behind the dialogue with the Ministry of Defense on the 2025 budget, there is a continuing tension between security needs and other vital public needs like transport and education and the need to reduce the deficit to return to fiscal flexibility. Ultimately the politicians must decide on priorities,\" added Rothenberg when presenting the state's financial statement for 2024.\nCurrently, the differences between the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Finance on the scale of immediate additions for 2025 are still very wide, so it is still difficult to know exactly how much defense spending will increase. The Budget Division, responsible for identifying budgetary sources and negotiating with the IDF, is warning that if talks with the Ministry of Defense do not converge on realistic amounts, they will promote \"adjustments\" on the revenue side - a euphemism for tax hikes.\nBut this warning must be qualified. Even within the Budget Division, it is believed that the short schedule for opening the budget, at this late stage of the year, will make it difficult to implement such adjustments. On the expenditure side, the Ministry of Finance is planning an across-the-board flat cut of NIS 700 million in the budgets of government ministries.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 29, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 12:38:30 GMT", "author": "Oren Dori", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

One of the main beneficiaries of all the hype is Israeli advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) company Mobileye Global Inc (Nasdaq: MBLY), which saw its share price jump 22% on Monday and Tuesday to a market cap of $14.6 billion.\nOppenheimer Israel investment researcher Omri Efroni says, \"The major automakers have not been able to develop the technology themselves, so they are collaborating with Mobileye, and it benefits from this dynamic. Tesla is very advanced and has a huge competitive advantage, and on the other hand, China has lenient regulation that also hurts Western manufacturers, and their solution for both factors is to work with Mobileye and not develop it themselves. They will not buy technology from Tesla, which is a direct rival, and therefore prefer Mobileye, which is a systems supplier and not a competitor.\"\nNow, he says, the market expects Mobileye to present more contracts with major automakers, including Mercedes and GM, for example. Mobileye is already working with some of the manufacturers on other products, and the market expects more.\nAccording to Yahoo Finance, the average target price for Mobileye shares is about $19, a premium of 5.9%. Mobileye held its Wall Street IPO two and a half years ago at a price of $21 per share, which reflected a valuation of about $17 billion, so it is still lower than the IPO price even after the latest increase.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 26, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 12:56:35 GMT", "author": "Shiri Habib-Valdhorn", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

The success of the operation in Iran has lowered the risk premium in Israel and increased the interest of foreign investors in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Now, with the end of the war, economists around the world are publishing optimistic forecasts for the Israeli economy.\nEconomists at Bank of America, one of the largest banks in the US, published a review of the Israeli economy and noted that \"With the end of the conflicts in the Israeli region, the local economy has the potential to grow faster, as the problems of supply shortages will be resolved. It is likely that the shekel will appreciate as the risk premium decreases, which will help reduce inflationary pressures while GDP accelerates.\"\nOn interest rates, Bank of America stresses that it is changing its estimate that the Bank of Israel will cut interest rates by 25 basis points between July and September due to the war between Iran and Israel. However, they note, \"In an environment where growth is weak, the currency is stable, and inflation is falling, the Bank of Israel may act sooner.\" Bank of America believes the Bank of Israel's base interest rate will be 4% (down from the current 4.5%) at the end of the year, and annual inflation for 2025 will be 2.7%, below the upper limit of the Bank of Israel's annual inflation target range of 3%. .\nOn the fiscal deficit, Bank of Israel economists note that they still expect a budget deficit of 4.3% of GDP this year, but with upside risks due to higher military spending and reduced economic activity.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 26, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 11:42:00 GMT", "author": "Maya Levin", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

The charge for service at pumps will remain unchanged at NIS 0.24 per liter. This is the second consecutive month that the price of gasoline has risen by NIS 0.01.\nThe monthly fuel price update this time also takes into account the effects of the war with Iran.

At the same time, the shekel has strengthened significantly against the dollar, pushing down the final retail price at gas stations in Israel.\nSince the start of 2025, the maximum price of government price controlled 95 octane gasoline at self-service pumps in Israel has fallen by NIS 0.05 per liter. For the sake of comparison, the most expensive that 95 octane gasoline has been recently was NIS 7.90 in May 2024 and the cheapest was NIS 6.81 in April-May 2023, partly due to a temporary cut in excise tax.\nThe price of gasoline is calculated by the Ministry of Energy at the end of each month, based on the average oil prices in the Mediterranean region and the shekel-US dollar exchange rate.

{"title": "Only US has more big drone companies than Israel", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001514148#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Israel's strength in the field of drones was clearly evident in the operation against Iran. A report recently published by \"Defense Post\" website entitled the \"Top 100 Drone Defense Companies in 2025,\" further reinforces Israel's role as a leading player in the international arena on drone technology. Among the 100 largest companies in the field, eight are from Israel (second in the world after the US), with Elbit Systems ranked in fifth place.\n\"Defense Post's\" methodology in ranking the companies takes into account annual revenue, R&D investment, growth trajectory, and forward-looking innovation, offering a comprehensive view of the companies truly shaping the future of autonomous defense technologies. To ensure fairness and clarity, companies owned or controlled by governments, such as Israel Aerospace Industries and Rafael, were not included.\nIsrael's Elbit Systems, ranked ahead of global giant defense companies such as Italy's Leonardo, Britain's BAE, the US's Lockheed Martin, and Germany's Rheinmetall.\nElbit scores high in the ranking\nThe main products that saw Elbit ranked fifth are the Hermes 450 and 900 UAVs, and Starliner. The citizens of Iran became familiar with the Hermes UAVs when they took over the skies of the Islamic Republic. The Hermes 900 is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) designed for medium altitude and long duration in the sky, with a range of about 1,000 kilometers or more. In contrast, the Starliner is a civilian model, designed to stay in the air for up to 36 hours at a time, fly at an altitude of up to 25,000 feet, and carry camera and radar systems weighing 450 kilograms.\nThe second Israeli company on \"Defense Post's\" list is Aeronautics (ranked 26th), a UAV company that operates various types of devices for a range of mission. For example, there is the MALE UAV (the sector similar to the Hermes 900) Dominator model, with an operating time of 20 hours and a maximum takeoff weight of 1,900 kilograms, and also the heavy Octopus drone, designed for operations of up to four hours and a takeoff weight of 25 kilograms.\nThree places behind Aeronautics, ranked 29th, is Israeli company Percepto. The company produces drones designed to be independently launched for reconnaissance and collection activities.\nA company with a different area of expertise and a significant international presence is UVision, ranked 38th, which manufactures loitering munitions. The company produces the Hero series of UAVs, which includes lighter models in terms of weight that are operated by fighters in the field, and heavier models that are launched from dedicated platforms.\nThe Hero 120 has a maximum range of 40-60 kilometers, an operating time of one hour, and the warhead of the Hero 120 weighs about 4.5 kilograms (about 10 pounds). Compared with the 120 model, the Hero 1250 is a large and deadly model, carrying a 50 kilogram warhead, with a range of more than 200 kilometers and an operating time of up to 10 hours.\nThe other Israeli company in the top 50 is Xtend, which is ranked 41st. The company, which manufactures autonomous drones based on artificial intelligence and tactical drones, won a contract worth $8.8 million with the US Department of Defense about six months ago to supply drones for precision strikes. At the same time, as part of trials conducted by Israel's Ministry of Defense for systems to combat UAVs, XTEND joined forces with AXIOMA and Elbit, as part of the development of an advanced drone interception system.\nSecond place after the US>/b>\nThe other three Israeli drone companies ranked in the top 100 are Urban Aeronautics (67th), CopterFix Pro (68th) and Colugo Systems (96). Urban is a company with commercial and defense activities. In the commercial sector, it has eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) vehicles designed for urban transport, and in the security sector, it has the Cormorant - an autonomous VTOL with internal rotors, designed for tactical logistics and casualty evacuation.\nCopterFix is one of the companies in which the Ministry of Defense has invested more than NIS 150 million during the war in R&D and procurement of drones. The drones produced are for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, and carry dedicated cameras, and are capable of operating in a GPS-free environment.\nColugo, founded just seven years ago, this month signed an agreement with Eilon Insurance and Financial for an investment of $3 million, in an $8.5 million financing round. Colugo has developed several innovative aircraft models with unique technology, which has been dubbed AWT (Adaptive Wing Technology). The aircraft's free-floating wings allow for optimal integration between the control systems of a drone and an airplane, and adapt themselves to changing wind conditions.\nAt the Israeli UAV industry national level there are many reasons for optimism with so many non-government companies, which has earned it second place after the US in the number of companies in the top 100. Israel has overtaken, among others, the UK (5 companies) and France (7).\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 26, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 10:04:12 GMT", "author": "Dean Shmuel Elmas", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

Three of the institute’s buildings were hit in the first days of the war with Iran. It has now launched a crowdfunding campaign to fund reconstruction.\nIn an instant, the missiles destroyed a bank of biological samples that had been gathered over years, and unique, expensive equipment. The money will not be able to repair all the damage, but it will certainly help, even for one of the wealthiest academic institutions in Israel. The institute estimates that rehabilitation will cost $300-500 million.\nUniversities around the world enable their alumni and the general public to donate even small sums (in comparison with classic academic philanthropy), but the Weizmann Institute has not done so until now. \"We decided to embark on this campaign because of the public’s response,\" says Tamar Levine, head of Resource Development at the institute. \"People contacted us from all over the world: Israelis and Jews who see the institute as a symbol of Israel that they are proud of; our graduates, whether from Israel or other countries; our partners around the world; and the academic community as well. Scientists with no connection to Israel approached us and said that they were pained by the harm to science and wanted to help.\" At the same time, the institute has started talking to its regular donors and well-known philanthropists.\nThe institute has not only built a landing page for collecting donations, it has even distributed it on social networks. The campaign deviates from the Weizmann Institute’s general image. The institute is sometimes perceived as somewhat remote from the public, both because only students for second degrees or higher study there, and only in the exact sciences, and because of its tendency to go \"the Weizmann way\" as Levine puts it, that is, to do things slowly and carefully. Up to now, this has also characterized the institute’s relationship with the media and the general public.\n\"In the wake of this event, we’re seeing a change in our connection with the public,\" Levine say. \"We’re more visible in the media, something we’re not accustomed to, and the current campaign appealing to the public follows on from that.\"\nBen Gurion University of the Negev has also launched a crowdfunding campaign on the Internet, alongside approaches to its regular donors. Jeff Kaye, the university’s vice president for Public Affairs and Resource Development, says that besides its research laboratories located in Soroka Hospital in Beersheba and were directly hit by the Iranian missile that landed on the hospital, university buildings close to Soroka were damaged by the shock wave, and shrapnel landed on a sports hall. Dozens of homes of students and faculty were damaged, and the university is giving those affected personal grants. In addition, Soroka Hospital will use the university’s medical school for joint activity instead of the building that was hit, and the university will have to find alternative premises for teaching medicine.\nKaye estimates the damage in the tens of millions of dollars. The government compensation fund will pay only 30-50% of the amount, since it pays out in accordance with the value of the old buildings, whereas restoration will require the construction of new buildings.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 26, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 17:24:00 GMT", "author": "Gali Weinreb", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

It’s possible that the damage is such that it will take years to rehabilitate the program.\nAerial photographs published last week show that the Iranians have started work on the nuclear site at Natanz.

{"title": "Azerbaijan's SOCAR completes acquisition of 10% Tamar stake", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001514061#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Union Energy, controlled by Israeli businessman Aaron Frenkel, has completed the allocation of 48.3% of the shares it holds in the Tamar offshore gas field, to the State Oil Company of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOCAR). The deal, which will give SOCAR a 10% stake in Tamar, is worth an estimated $1.25 billion.\nThe deal, revealed by \"Globes\" and signed six months ago by Union Energy and SOCAR, is now being completed after the receipt of regulatory approval by the Petroleum Council and Israel Competition Authority. As part of the deal, SOCAR will hold its 10% stake in Tamar through a 48.3% holding in Union Energy and 3% of Tamar Petroleum (TASE: TMRP), an investment company in which SOCAR has acquired roughly 17.9% of Frenkel's holding, in which prior to the sale he held a 24.99% stake. SOCAR joins the other partners in Tamar, which include the US energy major and field operator Chevron (25%) and the Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala (11%).\nThe deal brings Azerbaijan and Israel closer together\nThe Tamar gas field, which is 90 kilometers west of Haifa in the Mediterranean, was discovered in 2009 and production began in 2013. The reservoir's current production capacity is 10.3 billion cubic meters (BCM) annually and its gas reserves are estimated at 291.5 BCM. The partners in the reservoir, along with Frankel, Tamar Petroleum, Mubadala and Chevron, are Isramco and Dor Gas. SOCAR is a state-owned energy company that manages Azerbaijan's oil and gas industry based in the country's capital, Baku. The move has a geopolitical dimension that effectively brings Azerbaijan and Israel closer together.\nFrenkel built his direct position in the gas reservoir through an option deal with Mubadala Petroleum, which he exercised in December 2022, as well as by purchasing a stake from the Harel insurance company and Israel Infrastructure Fund (IIF) in September last year. Together with the purchase of the shares in Tamar Petroleum, the cost of Frankel's investment in the reservoir was NIS 3.4 billion - an investment made mainly with bank financing.\nIn the most recent deal that Frankel undertook, he paid about $280 million (over NIS 1 billion) a few months ago for 3.5% of the rights in the reservoir that he purchased from IIF, which gave the reservoir a value of over $8 billion (about NIS 28 billion at the time of the deal). This was a relatively small and unusual deal regarding the reservoir; as this value is almost double the value of the reservoir in the 2021 deal, in which Delek Drilling (now NewMed Energy) sold 22% of the rights to Mubadala for $1.1 billion, based on a value of about $5 billion for the Tamar reservoir (NIS 15.8 billion).\nFrenkel himself recently told \"Globes\" about the investment in Tamar. He said, \"This is an investment that was created as part of the response to the Abraham Accords. I entered into it as a result of the good relations I have in Abu Dhabi and the UAE. We sat there with senior people at the top who said: How do we turn the signing on paper (in the Abraham Accords) into something concrete? We knew that Yitzhak Tshuva (controlling owner of Delek Drilling) was obliged to sell holdings in the Tamar reservoir by December 2022. So they (Mubadala) bought in and gave me an option, but I was the one who initiated the interest.\"\nMubadala bought 22% of Tamar and offered Frenkel an option to buy half its holding in the field (11%). He went on to purchase another 3.5% stake, and at the same time purchased about 24.99% of Tamar Petroleum, which owns 16.75% of Tamar. \"I directly and indirectly own a stake of about 18.7% of Tamar,\" he said, \"and since I am one of the controlling owners of Tamar Petroleum, you could say that I influence 31.25% of the reservoir.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 25, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Wed, 25 Jun 2025 14:02:29 GMT", "author": "Dean Shmuel Elmas", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

(TASE:ELAL) has announced the resumption of ticket sales for flights to and from Israel. In recent days the carrier has focused mainly on rebooking the company's customers whose flights were canceled during the Iran operation. The airline will resume its regular operations to all destinations starting this Sunday, June 29, and its subsidiary Sun D'or will resume operations from Tuesday, July 1.\nFor those who purchase tickets for flights departing before the end of June, the airline is offering a fixed price list for flights departing before next Tuesday.\nThe company has said that customers who have El Al or Sun D'or tickets and whose flight was canceled during the Iran operation will be able to rebook at no additional cost for an alternative flight from the same geographical area. Registration for rebooking can be done through El Al's service center or through the travel agent, depending on the original method of purchase.\nEl Al also announced that passengers with tickets for departures before July 15, who do not wish to use the flight, can cancel their ticket (up to 72 hours before departure) and receive a credit voucher for future use. The vouchers are valid for two years and can be issued independently on the company's website.\nArkia has also announced that it will resume operating Tel Aviv - New York flights this week, as part of a gradual return to its summer flight schedule. In the coming week, two flights will operate on this route, using aircraft leased from Bulgarian carrier GullivAir. Passengers who held tickets for flights that were canceled during the Iran operation will be able to use them on upcoming flights, depending on availability and ticket conditions. Flights departing from Israel on June 26 and 28 will make a technical stop in Larnaca for crew change, without disembarking passengers. A one-way ticket from New York to Tel Aviv next week will start at $1,000.\nForeign companies starting to return\nSo far, a number of foreign airlines have announced plans to return to Israel. flyDubai resumed flights last night, TUS and Blue Bird, which will restart flights today, Cyprus Airways will restart flights tomorrow and China's Hainan Airlines will return next week. Air Europa, will restart Israel flights in mid-July.\nTourism wholesalers are also resuming operations at Ben Gurion Airport with Flying Carpet and Aviation Links operating flights to the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe from the beginning of July by chartering planes European airlines.\nOnly a small number of foreign carriers are expected to resume services to Israel in the coming weeks and Minister of Transport Miri Regev has admitted that this summer, most of the activity at Ben Gurion Airport will be by Israeli airlines. This is because some foreign airlines have already diverted their planes to other destinations, and their return is expected to be delayed. The supply of flights will remain limited in the summer season when demand is at its peak, and fares are set to jump.\n\"Globes\" sampled prices for one-way flights to Israel during the coming weeks with fares varying. On flyDubai, the price of a ticket from Dubai to Israel starts at $374. On TUS Airlines, tickets from Larnaca are available until July 1 at low prices, after which fares start at $352. On Blue Bird, fares from Athens to Israel start at $349.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 26, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 04:18:00 GMT", "author": "Stav Livne", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Few flights, high fares await Israeli travelers this summer", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001513801#utm_source=RSS", "text": "After two weeks of restrictions on air traffic because of Operation Rising Lion against Iran, Ben Gurion, Ramon and Haifa airports are returning to full activity. The Israel Airports Authority announced yesterday evening that the limitations on the number of flights, the number of passengers on each flight, and on the entry of people accompanying travelers to the airports, had been removed. The Israeli airlines have announced a significant increase in flights. \"Globes\" has put together the information that travelers may be seeking.\nCan anyone leave and return to Israel whenever they want?\nThe directive that anyone leaving Israel could return only after thirty days has been canceled, and there are no restrictions on entering and leaving. The number of seats on airlines operating in Israel is, however, limited at present, and it will not be easy to buy tickets in the next few weeks. The airlines report overloading of their booking websites, but it is expected that with the lifting of restrictions at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport, the foreign airlines will gradually return, expanding the supply.\nWhich airlines are operating in Israel at the moment?\nAt present, the Israeli airlines El Al, Israir, Arkia, and Air Haifa are the only airlines operating in Israel. The foreign airlines have yet to return to Ben Gurion Airport, but some have requested to do so, and once they receive approval some of them will return immediately. Among the airlines that have submitted requests to return are flyDubai, Ethiopian, Red Wing, Hainan, Bluebird, and TUS. They could receive approval at any moment.\nWhen will it become possible to book tickets as usual?\nTickets can be booked for all the foreign airlines in accordance with the date that each has announced that it will resume operations. Some may do so earlier than announced, particularly those that have already submitted requests to return to Israel.\nWhat about the Israeli airlines - can tickets be booked with them?\nIn the case of the Israeli airlines, which at this stage are still focusing on rescue flights, tickets for outbound flights can be booked freely, but, last time we looked, availability was still limited, and seats were only available on flights of Air Haifa.\nEl Al will continue its rescue flights from the eight places already announced - Larnaca, Athens, Rome, Paris, London, Bangkok, New York, and Los Angeles. In the next two days, the company will also operate flights from Budapest, Bucharest, Amsterdam, Prague, Madrid, Milan, Warsaw, and Sofia. Once all the airline’s stranded customers have been assigned flights, booking for incoming flights will be opened to the public at large.\nIsrair is due to operate rescue flights in the coming days from Athens, Larnaca, Varna, Tbilisi, Rome, London, Budapest, and Batumi. The company has not yet announced a return to its full summer schedule.\nArkia has announced that, from July, it will renew the flight schedule it planned for the summer to all its destinations, which include Rhodes, Crete, Corfu, Athens, Paris, Milan, Geneva, Kalamata, Mykonos, Larnaca, Amsterdam, Barcelona, New York, and Tivat (Montenegro). For anyone who has booked the rescue flights, which will continue to operate until July, their tickets are still valid.\nAir Haifa will continue rescue flights from Larnaca to Haifa. Seats on today’s outbound flights from Haifa are available for purchase on the company’s website. Flights from Thursday to Monday (June 26 to June 30) will be advertised tomorrow (Thursday), and tickets will be for sale in the course of the day. From July 1, the company is due to return to its regular schedule, which includes flights to Athens, but the route to Eilat’s Ramon Airport will be resumed at a later date.\nWhat if I bought tickets for July or August?\nIf an airline cancels a flight, it has to notify the passenger and offer a refund, a voucher for future use, or an alternative flight. Passengers who have bought tickets for July or August and have not received notification of cancellation can assume at this stage that the flight will take place as normal, but this is subject to change in accordance with the decisions of the various airlines.\nIf the airline has not yet announced that it is resuming operations, should I initiate cancelation of the flight?\nIt is not recommended to cancel flights on your own initiative, as a customer who does so is not entitled to a full refund or an alternative flight. It is preferable to wait patiently for an official update from the airline. Meanwhile, it is worth booking accommodation that is cancellable without charge. If you have already booked accommodation and the booking cannot be cancelled, it is recommended that you should contact the hotel or apartment owner by email and find out whether there is any flexibility over arrival dates.\nI wish to buy tickets for this summer. What is going to happen to prices?\nAccording to Minister of Transport Miri Regev, most of the flights at Ben Gurion Airport this summer will be by the Israeli airlines. This is because some of the foreign airlines have already assigned their planes to other destinations, and so their return to Israel will be delayed. Although there are foreign airlines that will resume flights to Israel in the near future, the supply of seats will remain limited, precisely in the summer season when demand is at its highest.\nWhen there is high demand and low supply, prices rise. That mechanism sometimes arouses public anger at the airlines operating in the market, but in fact it raises the chances of seats being available at the last minute, which is critical in cases of medical or humanitarian need. So prices will probably remain high both now and close to the flight date. Lower fares will be on the cards only when a significant number of foreign airlines starts flying to Israel again.\nEstimated dates when airlines will resume Israel flights (those for which information is currently available):\nBy June 30: Lot, KLM, Ethiopian Airlines, flyDubai.\nBy July 14: Air France.\nBy July 15: Etihad.\nBy July 31: Air India, Air Europa, Lufthansa, Austrian, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings, ITA Airways, United.\nBy August 31: Delta.\nBy September 7: Transavia France.\nBy September 8: Aegean, Air Canada.\nBy September 15: Wizz Air.\nBy September 30: Air Baltic.\nBy October 25: British Airways, EasyJet, Swiss, Iberia Express, Ryanair.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 25, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Wed, 25 Jun 2025 08:41:00 GMT", "author": "Stav Livne", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Cellcom sells stake in fiber optic cable co IBC", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001514145#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Israeli telecom company Cellcom (TASE: CEL) is selling its holdings in the fiber optic communications company IBC (Unlimited) to Phoenix Financial (TASE: PHOE) and the More Investment House. Cellcom is following in the wake of Hot and the Israel Infrastructure Fund, which have sold their stakes in IBC recently.\nCompleting the sale for NIS 520 million will produce a respectable capital gain for Cellcom, because the cost of the investment in IBC is recorded in Cellcom's books at NIS 121 million. Cellcom holds 23% of the company's equity. The expected cash flow impact on Cellcom's statements will be the amount of the sale proceeds, net of tax. In this way, Cellcom will be able to reduce its net debt, which at the end of the first quarter stood at about NIS 1.6 billion.\nOver the years, Cellcom has had the highest debt among Israeli telecom companies, but the debt has been on a downward trend for some time, and the sale will help accelerate the trend. The move is also expected to affect Cellcom's ability to return to distributing a dividend to its shareholders, for the first time in over a decade, similar to telecom rival Partner (TASE: PTNR), which recently returned to distributing a dividend (Bezeq (TASE: BZEQ) returned earlier).\nIf the transaction to sell the shares is not completed within 10 months from the date of the agreement, either party may cancel it. In addition, completion of the transaction is subject to approval from the Ministry of Communications and other authorities.\nCellcom will remain in the venture as a customer\nA few weeks ago, Hot and Israel Infrastructure Fund (IFC) agreed to sell their stake in IBC to a group consisting of Phoenix and Mor Investment House, and Cellcom also received an offer to sell its stake in the venture. The IBC fiber optic project, in which Cellcom invested in 2019, is deploying fiber optic infrastructure throughout the country, mainly for use by private customers. The project is one of two entities in the country deploying fiber, alongside Bezeq. Cellcom is both part of the controlling interest in it and its customer, and is now expected to remain a customer, with no change in the commercial terms. The project originally belonged to the Israel Electric Company, which still holds 30% of the controlling interest in it.\nAt the same time, Cellcom plans to continue the lawsuit it recently filed against IBC, following a dispute over its obligation to purchase services from the company. Cellcom claims that its obligation is to purchase service from 15% of the lines until 2 million households are connected, a goal that has already been achieved, and nothing more. In other words, according to the lawsuit, the Phoenix-More acquisition is based on a misrepresentation regarding Cellcom's commitment.\nCellcom CEO Eli Adadi said, \"The sale of Cellcom's holdings in the IBC fiber project is a significant move for the company and another step in the strategic plan we are promoting to improve its profitability, reduce debt and increase cash flow, while focusing on the company's core activities, with the aim of maintaining our leadership in Israel's communications market.\"\nCellcom is traded on the TASE at a market cap of NIS 4.5 billion after a 103% increase in its share price over the past year, due to the improvement in the company's own results and the improved sentiment in the communications market in general. The controlling shareholder in the company is the Fortissimo Fund, headed by Yuval Cohen, which last year purchased Discount Investments' holdings in the company (about 35% of the capital) for NIS 936 million, and today the value of its holdings is already worth roughly NIS 1.6 billion.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 26, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 08:23:02 GMT", "author": "Shiri Habib-Valdhorn", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "Treasury presents retroactive unpaid leave, grants plan", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001514100#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Israel's Ministry of Finance, which only a day and a half ago, presented a plan to compensate employers and employees for the closing of the economy during the war with Iran, was taken by surprise by the rapid end of the operation against Iran. The Ministry of Finance has been working on several changes to the plan to adjust it to the swift military developments.\nThe first change by the Ministry of Finance is necessarily more generous and helps employers and employees even more. In the original aid outline that was presented, the state allowed workers to go on unpaid leave under lenient conditions, while shortening the minimum unpaid leave period stipulated by law from 30 days to 14 days. However, during the 12-day war, employees did not reach the 14-day threshold required to receive unemployment benefits from the state.\nAfter talks with the Histadrut and employer representatives, the Ministry of Finance agreed to lower the requirement to 12 days. This allows for compensation for everyone who has been absent from work since June 13. Initially, all those workers who temporarily returned for one working day, last Thursday, were still excluded from the safety net. Many Israelis did this following the momentary easing of Home Front Command restrictions on the economy, which were tightened again shortly afterwards following the US attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. However, later, the Histadrut reached understandings with the Ministry of Finance that would prevent these employees from losing their entitlement to unpaid leave.\nAccording to the understandings, \"The period of absence qualifying for unpaid leave will be 12 calendar days, with the employee required to be absent for at least 11 days of the period, not necessarily consecutively, in order to be eligible for unemployment benefits.\"\nRetroactive unpaid leave model\nThe unpaid leave model for the brief war against Iran will operate retroactively. A person who did not work throughout the operation will be entitled to unemployment benefits from the National Insurance Institute, even if registering for unpaid leave after the operation ended.\nHow will the Ministry of Finance prevent abuse of the scheme? First, an employee who has actually worked will not agree to receive only unemployment benefits, which are tens of percent lower than the regular salary, instead of their full salary. In addition, the National Insurance Institute can check based on the data who worked and who did not.\nYet, the Ministry of Finance remembers well from aid schemes in previous years improper attempts to manipulate the law, in order to obtain entitlements for unpaid leave even by those who did work and by those going on unpaid leave unnecessarily, in order to benefit from government assistance without working. The aid scheme, including the unpaid leave model, remains in effect until the end of the month. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance intends to make amendments to the law that will close loopholes that encourage non-employment.\nIn contrast, in the past, there have even been cases of partial cash payments \"in the black\" by the employer, plus a payment from the National Insurance Institute, for false registration of unpaid leave. The Ministry of Finance will have to prepare, as much as possible, to deal with the possibility of such an improper conduct.\nRethinking compensation for big businesses\nThe timing of publishing the aid outline, hours before US President Donald Trump's announcement of a ceasefire, is not problematic from the perspective of the Ministry of Finance. From the outset, it decided to issue details of the plan if the severe restrictions on the economy lasted more than a week. But it would have preferred to publish a retroactive plan, after the event was already over and the costs were covered.\nTherefore, most employers need not fear the cancellation or dilution of the grant program for those whose income was affected. The Ministry of Finance has no such intentions. The benefits announced in the plan will be implemented despite the cessation of fighting. With one possible exception.\nIn the Ministry of Finance's plan published earlier this week, eligibility for grants was proposed for businesses with annual revenue of up to NIS 400 million. This is similar to the plan provided by the state in the months after October 7, 2023. The difference is that this time it was agreed, somewhat vaguely, that even the largest businesses in the economy would be able to receive assistance, from a special fund of NIS 60 million, which would be managed by the president of the Business Sector and supervised by the Ministry of Finance.\nMinistry of Finance officials were never enthusiastic about this idea. Today, with the rapid end of the military campaign, it is no longer certain that the Ministry of Finance intends to transfer money to such a mechanism. This is based on an interpretation of the agreements with the business sector, in which tens of millions of shekels were supposed to be put aside in the event of an extreme scenario in the economy, which ultimately did not materialize. However, a final decision on the matter has not yet been made within the Ministry of Finance.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 25, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Wed, 25 Jun 2025 15:22:00 GMT", "author": "Oren Dori", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

Xero will make an immediate payment of US$2.5 billion in cash and shares and a further $500 million in milestone payments and continued employment of current staff members.\nMelio, which was founded by Bar, Ziv Paz, and Ilan Atias, has raised nearly $600 million. The company raised $250 million in September 2021, at the peak of the Covid tech boom, at a company valuation of $4 billion. At the end of last year, Melio raised a further $150 million at a valuation of $2 billion. Major investors include Fiserv, Thrive Capital, General Catalyst, Tiger Global Management, Bessemer, Coatue, Aleph, Accel, Corner Ventures, and Latitude.\nThe big winners in the deal are the founders - Bar, Paz and Atias - who together hold 7%-9% of the company's shares and will earn about $100 each from the exit. Bessemer has an 18% stake and Aleph holds a 12% stake. Each fund will generate a multiplier of several dozen times their original investment in the company's first financing round. Coatue also has a 12% stake although its returns are not as large as it invested at a later stage.\nMelio has developed a pay platform for small and medium sized business that integrates accounting and payments, and offers US companies and their accountants and bookkeepers easy-to-use accounts payable workflows and a wide choice of payment methods, providing more visibility and control over their cash flow. Xero says the acquisition of Melio will help it expand in the US market.\nXero CEO Sukhinder Singh Cassidy said, \"We’re thrilled to announce we’re acquiring Melio, a leading US B2B payments platform that strongly aligns with our 3x3 strategy and US growth ambitions. Adding Melio's world-class team, technology platform, and innovative A/P solutions to Xero enables a step change in our North America scale and the potential to help millions of US SMBs and their accountants better manage their cash flow and accounting on one platform. Xero and Melio are highly complementary - together they complete the key jobs to be done for US SMBs, extend reach across customer segments, provide both direct and syndicated offerings, and deliver multiple revenue drivers.\"\nMelio cofounder and CEO Matan Bar added, \"Joining Xero is an incredible opportunity for the Melio team to further our mission to reinvent the way businesses pay each other. Having worked closely with the Xero team, we’re excited by our shared purpose to scale in the US and combine Xero’s accounting capabilities with Melio’s accounts payable and receivable solutions to create comprehensive product offerings for our collective, valued customer base.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 25, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Wed, 25 Jun 2025 03:59:00 GMT", "author": "Assaf Gilead", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}
{"title": "NIS 100b flowed into TASE during Iran operation", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001513707#utm_source=RSS", "text": "After six straight trading days of rises in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) main indices, the market fell yesterday. The sellers were probably profit taking after the past week's sharp gains.\nEven so, a cumulative jump of about 7% in the leading Tel Aviv-125 Index, since the successful surprise attack in Iran on June 13, makes the TASE one of the best performing stock markets in the world since the beginning of the year (after South Korea, Hungary, Poland and Russia), and the best in the West, with a return of 19% in the leading index. For comparison, the Wall Street S&P 500 index has risen by less than 2% since the start of 2025.\nAnother result of the increases since the start of the Iran operation is the increase in the value of the TASE, with the companies traded there (over 530 in number) adding over NIS 100 billion to their aggregate value since the start of the operation. That value now stands at about NIS 1.4 trillion.\nWhen examining the sectors into which the money flowed, it becomes clear that the Tel Aviv-Banks 5 Index, which includes the shares of the five largest banks (Leumi, Hapoalim, Mizrahi-Tefahot, Discount and First International), has added NIS 31 billion to its value since the start of the operation in Iran - the largest increase in value.\nA major reason for this is that foreign investors seeking exposure to Israel usually do so by investing in banks, which are a kind of mirror of the local economy. The banks have also shown particularly strong results in recent years, partly due to the increase in interest rates and inflation.\nThe Tel Aviv Banks Index has risen by about 12% since the start of the operation in Iran (and by 41% since the beginning of the year), and the combined value of the five largest banks is already approaching NIS 300 billion - over 20% of the value of the entire stock market.\nReal estate is also to the fore\nAfter the Banks Index, the increase in value for residential real estate companies stands out, having recorded especially sharp gains since the start of the operation, in some cases by tens of percent. This is against the backdrop of investor assessments that companies in the industry will be required to work to restore the damage of the war and promote urban renewal projects that include adding new housing units.\nThe Tel Aviv Construction Index has risen by about 20% since the start of the operation in Iran, and its aggregate value has been added to by NIS 14 billion in about a week, an increase that has offset the declines in the index since the beginning of the year.\nAnother sector that has enjoyed sharp increases is insurance stocks, with the Tel Aviv Insurance Index jumping 18% since the start of the Iran operation, completing a jump of 57% since the start of 2025. The nine insurance companies included in the index (including Phoenix, Harel, Menora Mivtachim, Clal Insurance and Migdal) have added about NIS 12 billion to their aggregate value.\nThe Tel Aviv Oil & Gas Index has gained about 12% since the start of the Iran operation and about 37% since the start of the year, amid the rise in world oil prices in recent days. In the index, the Navitas Petroleum partnership led by Gideon Tadmor, which develops oil reserves in the Gulf of Mexico, has climbed 48% since the start of the year with a market cap of NIS 11.1 billion.\nWhen examining the stocks that have been the most notable gainers in the Tel Aviv-125 index since the start of the Iran operation until Monday afternoon, the Menora-Mivatchim insurance company is in first place, adding about 25% to its value in the past week, and trading at a market cap of about NIS 15 billion.\nFollowing it are representatives of the construction and infrastructure sector - the shares of Shikun & Binui, Ashtrom Group, Inrom and Carasso Real Estate, all with a jump of over 20% during this period.\n\"Massive entry to the indices\"\nTASE EVP head of trading, indices and derivatives Yaniv Pagot observes that overall in the past week, quite a few stock indices have recorded exceptional performances. He says, \"There are over 10 indices that have risen by more than 10% in this period. Alongside them, those that have risen only slightly are the Tel Aviv Technology Index (2% since the start of the operation in Iran) and the dual stock indexes.\"\nAccording to Pagot, the institutional investors, the managers of public savings, have set the tone by pouring demand into the TASE since the start of last week. \"Day after day, there was a massive influx of hundreds of millions of shekels into investment instruments that track the Tel Aviv-35, Tel Aviv-90 and Tel Aviv-125 indexes. And we are only beginning to scratch the surface of the potential there.\"\nIn his estimation, \"Since the start of the year, about NIS 6 billion has been raised in investment vehicles that track stock indices on the stock exchange (ETFs and imitating funds). We are at a peak in fundraising for these products, which are the way to increase liquidity and exposure to the local stock exchange.\"\nPagot further notes that \"We came to the current situation with a market share of retail investors (the general public) that is larger than we knew in the past. If we used to talk about 5%-6% of the daily turnover on the stock exchange, today it is probably double that.\"\nWhen asked whether the general public, who is used to buying mainly products that track the S&P 500 index, which has become a hit with Israelis in recent years, is now easier to buy products that track the Tel Aviv indices, Pagot answers in the affirmative: \"We are touching only the tip of the iceberg. For example, someone who bought a money market fund (which provides a return similar to a bank deposit), now buying a fund that invests in bonds is simple for them. \"They have already crossed the Rubicon.\"\nPsychology of the gains\nPagot, like other experts, says it is also worth paying attention to the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar, which is driving the transfer of money by local investors from Wall Street to Tel Aviv. \"There has been an appreciation of about 6% in the shekel against the dollar since the beginning of the year. Most people do not understand the connection between stock returns and exchange rate performance. I estimate that by the end of this year the shekel will be even stronger against the dollar, and this affects Israelis' investments abroad.\"\nAnd yet the strength of the gains on the TASE has surprised many experts tracking it. After all, the missile barrages from Iran have not stopped for a single day. Pagot offers a different perspective: \"When you woke up on Sunday morning this week and heard that the reactor in Fordow had been attacked by the US and was possibly destroyed, did you feel that your situation as a country or as a people had improved or gotten worse? Most people would say, in my opinion that their situation had improved. \"And if it has improved, that should be reflected in asset prices,\" Pagot concludes.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 24, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 14:22:44 GMT", "author": "Hezi Sternlicht", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

The chain had previously decided not to sell products originating in Jewish West Bank settlements, but has now expanded the boycott to Israeli products in general.\nIn doing so, Israel joins a list of countries that the chain - which tries to promote an ethical and fair image - is boycotting, including Russia and Iran. The chain noted that there are \"internationally recognized\" human rights violations by Israel. The list compiled by the chain includes about 100 Israeli products that it will gradually stop stocking, starting this month, including carrots and mangoes.\nThe chain said that the boycott was not expected to affect its financial results, as it concerns a \"few\" of the products it sells. Co-Op chair Debbie White said, \"This policy, which has been developed over the past year is a clear demonstration of our co-operative values in action, where the voices of our members have been listened to and then acted upon. \"We are committed, where we can, to removing products and ingredients that come from countries where there is an international consensus that their values are incompatible with ours.\"\nThe list of countries banned also includes Somalia, Syria and North Korea. The UK \"Daily Mail,\" which reported on the decision, said that during pro-Palestinian protests in Britain last year, activists vandalized avocados, hummus and dates that came from Israel, and were on the shelves of a branch of UK supermarket chain Waitrose.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 25, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Wed, 25 Jun 2025 09:42:00 GMT", "author": "Assaf Uni", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

Still, he says protecting workers against noncompetes remains a priority.\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\nThe Trump administration is weighing whether to continue defending the federal government's ban on noncompetes. Those are employment agreements that restrict workers from taking a new job with a competing business or starting one of their own. An estimated 30 million workers in America are bound by them. The ban enacted under President Biden has been held up in court, but now under President Trump, it could end. NPR's Andrea Hsu explains.\nANDREA HSU, BYLINE: Rebecca Denton's experience with a noncompete illustrates the harm such agreements can do to workers. Denton signed a noncompete in 2019 when she took a job in real estate, handling paperwork for closings. She was 52 at the time.\nREBECCA DENTON: I was older. I knew what I was signing. I just didn't realize what that implication could actually be for me.\nHSU: In the midst of the pandemic's surge in housing sales, she found herself working 16-hour days. She wanted out, but her noncompete meant she couldn't do similar work in a three-state area for a year.\nDENTON: You feel trapped, shackled with a ball and chain.\nHSU: Fearing for her health, she quit anyway and resorted to lower-paying gig work till her noncompete was up. She knows many people don't have the luxury to wait it out. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission under President Biden narrowly approved a new rule banning nearly all noncompetes nationwide. Here's then-chair Lina Khan talking about it on CNBC.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nLINA KHAN: At the end of the day, what noncompetes do is they keep talent locked up. And so getting rid of noncompetes will be good for workers, it'll be good for the labor market, but it's also going to be good for our economy.\nHSU: But the rule never took effect. A federal judge in Texas found the FTC had likely exceeded its authority in issuing it and blocked it entirely. The Biden administration appealed, but now Trump's FTC chair, Andrew Ferguson, looks to be taking a different approach. As a commissioner, he voted against the ban last year, saying he doesn't believe the FTC has the power to nullify tens of millions of employment contracts. He reiterated that position on Fox Business after becoming chair.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nANDREW FERGUSON: I think that rule is unconstitutional. I think it violates other laws as well.\nHSU: At the same time, Ferguson is not exactly a fan of noncompetes. He has spoken about how they can help companies protect the investments they make in their workers, but he's also cited examples of how they can be harmful to workers, limiting their opportunities. He told Fox Business, on his watch, the FTC will police them.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nFERGUSON: One of my top priorities is getting our super-talented enforcers at the FTC out there looking for noncompete agreements, no-poach agreements that violate the Sherman Act and making sure that the FTC is enforcing those laws to protect America's workers.\nHSU: The Sherman Act is an 1890 law prohibiting activities that restrict competition. Elizabeth Wilkins doesn't think that approach is going to work. She's former chief of staff to Lina Khan and one of the architects of the FTC's noncompete rule.\nELIZABETH WILKINS: The FTC has something like 1,400 employees to police the entire economy - not just workers, not just labor markets, but everything.\nHSU: And noncompetes, she says, are everywhere. She says some employers go to great lengths to keep workers under their thumb, even getting people to sign noncompetes in states where such agreements are unenforceable under state law.\nWILKINS: A clear and simple ban on noncompetes is, to my mind, the only way to truly protect workers.\nHSU: The FTC did not respond to NPR's questions about its enforcement strategy. Ban or no ban, Rebecca Denton has advice for companies about how to retain employees.\nDENTON: If you're a good company and you're a good place to work, and you are paying your employees at scale or better, and you're treating them well, you have nothing to fear of them leaving.\nHSU: Five years on, she's back to handling paperwork for real estate closings but working for herself.\nAndrea Hsu, NPR News.\n(SOUNDBITE OF BADBADNOTGOOD AND GHOSTFACE KILLAH SONG, \"FOOD\")\nCopyright © 2025 NPR.

{"title": "As shekel gains strongly, is it heading for NIS 3/$?", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001513676#utm_source=RSS", "text": "In the wake of Israel's ceasefire with Iran, the strong appreciation of the shekel is continuing. In afternoon inter-bank trading the shekel-dollar rate is down 1.33% at NIS 3.398/$ and the shekel-euro rate is down 1.05% at NIS 3.94/€. The shekel has strengthened by nearly 5% against the US dollar since the beginning of the month and is trading at its strongest level since the end of 2022. Since the start of the month the shekel has strengthened by 3.6% and 5.4% against the euro and sterling, respectively.\nThe strengthening of the shekel against the dollar comes at a time when the US currency is slightly recovering against the world's major currencies, after declining almost 9% since the start of 2025. In fact, in the past month the dollar has weakened against only 4 currencies, besides the shekel, which recorded the most significant appreciation - the euro and the currencies of Russia, Denmark and Switzerland.\nWhy is the shekel rising against the dollar?\nThe fall in Israel's risk premium following the operation in Iran is behind the recent shekel appreciation. The military successes of the past week, which were reinforced by the US attack on the nuclear sites in Iran, has led to optimism among investors, which has also been reflected in increases on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE), the strengthening of the shekel and a decrease in government bond yields, (which reflects a fall in the risk that investors are pricing in).\nBank Hapoalim chief financial markets strategist Modi Shafrir says, \"In the run-up to the attack and at its beginning, when its results were not yet clear, we saw Israel's risk premium increase. This was also reflected in the forex market with the dollar rising to NIS 3.7/$. But quite quickly, we saw over the past week how Israel's risk premium fell. Since the markets began to price in a new Middle East, in which the Iranian threat is removed, and the geopolitical situation is improving.\"\nAlong with the decline in the risk premium, there are also those who point to the resilience demonstrated on the home front, not only in recent events but throughout the war, as another factor that supported the increases in the markets and the shekel exchange rate against the dollar.\nBank Leumi markets strategist Kobby Levi says, \"The resilience, adaptability and restraint that investors in Israel have learned to demonstrate after almost two years of geopolitical tensions and wars were reflected in the markets last week.\"\nCan the shekel-dollar rate fall below NIS 3/$\nLooking ahead, the analysts say that, in addition to the expected decline in Israel's risk premium, structural factors in the Israeli economy will continue to support the strengthening of the shekel. Thus, among other things, they point to the current account surplus, the economy's bias toward exports, and foreign investment in Israel in industries such as high-tech.\nThese factors raise the question of whether the shekel could fall below the NIS 3/$ mark - something not seen this century. \"In the long term, years ahead - I think so, but we are not close to there right now,\" Shafrir estimates. Levi is even more cautious. \"In general, the dollar could fall below NIS 3/$, but in such an uncertain environment, it is impossible to estimate.\"\nLevi recalls that in 2021 the dollar approached the NIS 3/$ threshold, but stresses that at that time \"it was an event that mainly stemmed from the weakness of the dollar. We saw a strong shekel at the time, due to tech activity, which flourished in the post-Covid period, and due to foreign investments that flowed into Israel. It should be remembered that during that period, the Bank of Israel operated very significantly in the forex market, both in terms of interest rates and in terms of currency purchases. In other words, the Bank of Israel has a significant ability to offset and extend the duration of the shekel's appreciation and make it gradual.\"\nWho are the players operating in the forex market?\nThere are quite a few dominant players in Israel's forex market: foreign investors, speculators, and the biggest of all, according to estimates, are the institutional investors - the bodies that manage the investments of the Israeli public, such as investment houses and insurance companies. Similar to what happened on the TASE, the major players, led by the institutions, drew optimism from the decline in Israel's risk premium and increased their exposure to it, including in the forex market. In this context, the increase in the purchase of Israeli shares and other assets in the country was also apparently supported by a reduction in forex surpluses, which also contributed to the appreciation of the shekel.\nBeyond the investors themselves, there are quite a few forces that influence the shekel-dollar exchange rate, such as the interest rate differentials between Israel and the world. The fact that the interest rate in Israel stands at 4.5%, one of the highest in the world at the moment, plays in favor of the local currency.\nThe stock market also affects the shekel, and is known for its high correlation with developments on Wall Street and in particular on Nasdaq. As the US tech-biased index rises, the shekel strengthens against the dollar. The reason for this lies again with institutional investors. These are limited in their exposure to foreign exchange, and therefore when the value of their assets in major Wall Street stocks increases, they are required to balance the increase in the dollar component by increasing their exposure to the shekel, which strengthens the local currency.\nDoes the strengthening of the shekel bring an interest rate cut closer?\nBut is the strengthening of the shekel necessarily good news for the Israeli economy? By and large, yes. \"A strong shekel is an indication of a strong economy,\" explains Shafrir. \"Beyond that, it is also good in that it moderates the inflationary pressures that are here. The strengthening of the shekel is a pretty necessary condition right now for the Bank of Israel to decide to lower the interest rate, because it also contains the decrease in the risk premium, which the Bank of Israel wants to see, and will also moderate inflation.\"\nHowever, Levy and Shafrir agree that it is too early to estimate when the Bank of Israel will cut the interest rate. \"I don't think that the change in the value of the shekel right now will have an impact on the interest rate,\" Levi believes. \"As long as this uncertainty continues, I estimate that the Bank of Israel will keep the interest rate stable. It is possible that in the main scenario, that this war really ends, then in the coming months there will be at least one interest rate reduction.\"\nWho are the big losers?\nBut not everyone benefits from a strong shekel. For quite a few Israelis, this is less good news. Anyone whose income is in foreign currency, whether in stocks and indices or real assets, loses from the strengthening of the Israeli currency, such as exporters or many dual-currency companies (traded both on Wall Street and in Israel).\nEven those who decided to increase their investment portfolio exposure to foreign stock indices or bonds denominated in dollars (or in other currencies that have strengthened against the shekel), lose from the shekel's appreciation. Thus, anyone who bet on the leading US index, the S&P 500, will have to give up part of their returns when converting dollar assets into shekels. The US index has attracted a large number of Israelis and in the provident fund sector, it represents about 8% of the funds.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 24, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 12:38:04 GMT", "author": "Eitan Gerstenfeld", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!\" the president posted.\nIran fired a barrage of missiles at all parts of Israel this morning just before ceasefire was due to come into force at 7:00 am. Four people are reported killed after a direct hit on a seven-floor residential building in Beersheva in the south of Israel. 26 people have so far been admitted to Soroka Hospital in the city. Rescue services are still combing the building. Considerable damage has also been caused to surrounding buildings. Shortly after 7:00, Iranian television announced that the ceasefire had begun \"after four waves of Israeli attacks.\"\nThe ceasefire, which involved Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani of Qatar as an intermediary, was announced last night. A White House official said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had agreed to the ceasefire as long as Iran did not launch further attacks.\nAn official Israeli government statement issued this morning said: \"Last night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened the security cabinet together with the minister of defense, the chief of staff, and the head of the Mossad, to report that Israel had achieved all the goals of Operation Rising Lion, and even more than that.\n\"Israel has removed from itself a double existential threat - both the nuclear threat and the threat from ballistic missiles. In addition, the IDF achieved full aerial control in the skies of Iran, hit its top military personnel hard, and destroyed dozens of important targets of Iran’s regime. Within the past 24 hours too, the IDF has struck severe blows at government targets in the heart of Teheran, killed hundreds of members of the Basij militia - the repression mechanism of the terrorist regime - and killed another senior nuclear scientist.\n\"Israel thanks President Trump and the United States for their support in the defense of Israel and their participation in the removal of the Iranian nuclear threat. In the light of the achievement of the goals of the operation, and in full liaison with President Trump, Israel has agreed to the president’s proposal of a bilateral ceasefire. Israel will act powerfully to any breach of the ceasefire. The citizens of Israel should continue to observe the instruction of the Home Front Command until the complete fulfilment of the ceasefire is made certain.\"\nNetanyahu has instructed government ministers not to comment publicly on this turn of events. Opposition party Israel Beitenu leader Avigdor Liberman has however described the ceasefire as \"a discordant and bitter final note.\" \"Without a clear and sharp agreement we will certainly come to another war within two to three years, and in much worse conditions,\" Liberman said.\nIsrael’s airspace has been reopened, and flights that were in the air during this morning’s missile salvoes have been permitted to land.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 24, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 06:32:00 GMT", "author": "Globes correspondent", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

Cypriot airline TUS and Greek airline Blue Bird, which is owned by Israel Vacation Lines, also submitted a request to return, but approvals have not yet been received.\nEarlier this morning, the Israel Airports Authority (IAA) and Israeli airlines began preparing for an increase in the frequency of rescue flights and examined the possibility of allowing more than 50 passengers on outbound flights. Currently, there is no change in the flight schedules at Ben Gurion Airport and Haifa Airport.\nThe IAA said shortly after Iran violated the ceasefire, \"As part of preparations, an ongoing situation assessment is being conducted with all relevant parties, including the Civil Aviation Authority and the Ministry of Defense, with the aim of enabling a gradual return to normal in the coming hours. IAA is working in close coordination with all airlines and bodies that are partners in airport operations, to ensure an orderly and safe process for the traveling public.\"\nAt this stage, a situation assessment is being conducted with the aim of allowing a return to routine operations in the coming hours, which includes operating flights at night, and allowing more than two planes to land each hour, with the aim that the number will eventually be in double digits.\nWhat will happen with foreign airlines?\nThe industry estimates that if the ceasefire remains in effect, a gradual return of airlines is expected, first small companies that operate flights to nearby destinations and only then the larger companies.\nAviation Links VP Nir Mazor, VP of Aviation Relations, explains: \"This event is hitting the heart of the peak season for the tourism and aviation industries. The return of major airlines is expected to be much slower this time, as they are undergoing aircraft refurbishment work and will not want to take risks, especially to destinations such as the US and London.\n\"Low-cost airlines will probably not return before the holiday season, perhaps with the exception of Wizz Air, which has bases in the region. As for more regional airlines - Romanian, Cypriot, Greek and Polish charters, they are expected to return very quickly. Israel is a major market for them, and they are interested in returning. They constitute a significant part of air traffic. UAE airlines will probably return quickly, as soon as it is possible to land. I would not be surprised if they announce this today or tomorrow - they have the ability to do so. However, as long as the Ministry of Transport's procedure remains as it is, which limits flights to 50 passengers per flight - the airlines will not return because it is not profitable to operate one direction almost empty.\"\nMazor adds, \"The supply is still limited and does not meet the needs for July, August and the holidays, and the expectation is that prices will rise accordingly. I expect there will be a migration of vacations to the September and holiday periods - people will have to postpone their trips, perhaps to October, in order to go on vacation this year. The return of Israelis to vacations is always quick and the demand is high.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 24, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 09:36:00 GMT", "author": "Stav Livne", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

Kellogg is also working to phase out artificial dyes from its products.\nThe company in May reported a decline in sales and lowered its financial forecast for the year. Its new deal with Ferrero will face reviews by Kellogg's shareholders as well as federal regulators.\nFerrero was founded in Italy nearly 80 years ago and has lately been on a quest to expand its American reach.

{"title": "Steep fall in rental ads since start of Iran operation", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001513635#utm_source=RSS", "text": "There has been a large fall in the number of apartments offered for rent since the beginning of the Iran operation, mainly by owners of apartments that do not have protected rooms, according to a study for \"Globes\" by property management company DiffeRent. According to the study, which deals with rent insurance, it is still not possible to see a significant change in rents themselves.\nAs part of the study, some 180,000 ads for apartments for rent published annually on the Yad 2, Homeless, and Madlan websites and various social platforms such as Facebook groups and Marketplace were scanned. The study shows that in the week between June 14 and 21, 869 ads were published on online boards, compared to 1,381 ads the week before - down 37%. In apartments with a protected room, which accounted for about 25% of all apartments offered for rent, there was a 33% fall in the number of ads, while in apartments without a protected room, which account for about 75% of all apartments for rent, there was a 38% fall in the number of ads.\nPetah Tikva and Ramat Gan are exceptions\nThere was probably not many rental contracts signed last week, as many landlords understood that the time was not right to rent out apartments under the threat of missiles, and certainly not apartments without protected rooms.\nConsequently in most cities hit by Iranian missiles, there was a noticeable fall in the number of ads for renting apartments without a protected room. In Tel Aviv, there was a 47% decrease in the number of ads for apartments without a protected room, while when it comes to apartments with a protected room, the fall was only 24%. In Haifa, the number of ads for renting apartments without a protected room has faqllen since the beginning of the war with Iran by 50%, while for apartments with a protected room, the fall was 40%. In Rehovot, there was a 28% fall in ads for apartments without a protected room and only 7% in apartments with a protected room, in Bat Yam 30% without, and 18% with a protected space.\nIn Petah Tikva and Ramat Gan, cities that both suffered missile barrages over the past week, the opposite data was recorded (Ramat Gan: 32% decrease with a protected room compared with 24% without; Petah Tikva: 52% with a protected room, and 24% without).\nThe nationwide supply is also small\nAccording to DiffeRent VP marketing Aviv Sagron, the data from Ramat Gan and Petah Tikva does not change the general trend: \"The supply of apartments for rent nationwide was almost 40% lower than the week before the outbreak of the war with Iran, when we are mainly talking about apartments without a protected space that stopped being advertised. There was also a decrease in apartments with a protected space, but it was more modest - only 34%.\"\nSagron adds, \"Landlors of apartments for rent have been more preoccupied with family and work over the last week and less with leasing apartments. However, we see that those whose apartments have a protected space felt a little more comfortable advertising the property.\"\nFuture demand in Haifa and Tel Aviv?\nThe fall in supply is expected to be met with a large increase in demand. As of the end of last week, about 9,000 people had been evacuated from apartments damaged by missile attacks, a large part of them in the Tel Aviv area. For now, most of them have moved to hotels, but it is reasonable to assume that some of them will gradually move to renting in the cities and neighborhoods from which they left. In such a case, it is likely that the rental market in the Tel Aviv and Haifa areas will see a significant increase in demand, which does not bode well for rents.\nAt the moment, DiffeRent notes that it is not yet possible to discern a clear trend of rent increases in any of the cities surveyed, nor at the national level.

It spurred a conversation on TikTok, with creators weighing in with their own takes and, in a handful of instances, attempting to debunk the baseless theory.\nBut there is one account whose tactics stand out in this familiar cacophony of messy online virality: a realistic-looking TikTokker giving a direct-to-camera description of the incinerator conspiracy theory. The speaker's image and voice appear to have been created with artificial intelligence tools, according to two forensic media experts NPR consulted. The twist: The words spoken in the video are the exact same as those in another video posted by a different TikTok account days before. The copied version attracted more than 200,000 views on TikTok.\nResearchers of deepfakes — AI-generated images and videos so plausible they can trick people into thinking they're real — say this duplication appears to represent a new way that AI is being harnessed to deceive: having AI recite the actual words of a real person, right down to the stumbles, \"ums\" and \"uhs.\"\nAli Palmer, a creator in Dallas who posts on TikTok as @aliunfiltered_, made a video — about a father who jumped off a Disney cruise ship to save his child — that was ripped off using her exact words for a video made with AI.\nCopying on TikTok is rampant, she said, but usually the spam accounts that do it repost her entire video. The AI-powered accounts reciting her words by an AI-generated person is new, she said.\n\"It's upsetting. It feels like a violation of privacy,\" said Palmer, 33. \"I could never imagine copying someone and then making money on it. Just feels dirty.\"\nWith all types of copying, Palmer has reported it to TikTok, but nothing happens. \"It's incredibly frustrating.\"\nHany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley who studies digital forensics, said what is new here is that an average person's words are being stolen.\n\"All the time, we're seeing people's identities being co-opted to do things like hawk crypto scams or push bogus cures for cancer, but usually it's a famous person or influencer,\" Farid said.\nFarid used a digital forensic tool to analyze the copied incinerator video, the Disney cruise video and other videos posted by the same account, at NPR's request, and concluded they were the products of AI.\n\"It's the kind of thing that would be super-easy to do with today's AI tools and something that would easily slip through the content moderation cracks,\" he said.\nWhile using AI to copy videos does not appear to violate TikTok's policies, the platform does say it requires users \"to label all AI-generated content that contains realistic images, audio, and video.\"\nAfter this story was published, labels appeared indicating videos on the two accounts NPR identified included AI-generated media.\nDeepfakes have been growing more sophisticated in recent years, in addition to being increasingly deployed for malicious purposes.\nThe technology has been used to impersonate politicians, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The rise of deepfake \"nudify\" tools prompted Congress this year to pass a federal law to combat the spread of nonconsensual intimate imagery, including fake nudes generated by AI.\nFurther blurring fact from fiction is this latest approach of trying to capitalize on a TikTok viral moment by having a fictitious creator recite the words of a real creator.\nIt is difficult to gauge how widespread the practice is on TikTok, which is used by more than 1 billion people worldwide. NPR could not identify the people or motivations behind the accounts replicating creators' words. The accounts didn't respond to requests for comment. Neither did TikTok or most of the creators whose words were cribbed.\nTwo accounts identified by NPR as using other creators' words and apparently using AI-generated images and voices do have some similarities: They each have about 10,000 followers but do not follow anyone back. Many of the videos posted by both accounts depict Black personas that Berkeley's Farid said appear to be \"low-quality deepfakes\" made with AI. And each account pilfered another TikTok creator's words about various viral topics, ranging from a woman who received a face-lift in Guadalajara, Mexico, to a woman wearing a dog collar to the former Meghan Markle dancing in a hospital delivery room.\nIn the Meghan video, the creator took on a British accent. In others, the voice assumes a completely different register.\n\"The biggest tell is when you take a step back and look at the account as a whole — when you look at one video compared to another video, it's clear that the voice of the persona changes from video to video,\" said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub. Linvill also reviewed the videos at NPR's request and concluded they were made with the help of AI tools.\nTogether, the two accounts have rung up millions of views by seizing on viral stories that skew more toward tabloid fodder than political drama. But researchers who track state-sponsored information warfare say testing out new strategies for juicing virality is something government-backed actors also regularly do.\nLinvill studies how nations including China, Russia and Iran use digital tools for propaganda. He says creating AI personas, such as faux news anchors, is a tactic also used by state-backed influence operations. While NPR found no indication that the accounts it identified are part of such a campaign, there is often overlap in tactics used by deceptive state actors and accounts seeking to gain engagement on social media platforms.\n\"Stealing content on social media is as old as social media,\" Linvill said. \"What we're seeing here is AI doing what we've seen AI be really good at over and over again, and that is systematizing things, making processes cheaper, faster and easier. And AI is really good at making it faster and easier to steal content.\"\nAlex Hendricks was scrolling through TikTok this week when he saw two back-to-back videos about the Florida incinerator conspiracy. It's normal to see many creators weighing in on the same subject, but these videos struck him as unusual because the monologues were eerily identical, just in different-sounding voices.\nSo Hendricks made a TikTok video pointing this out. Yet it barely got any views.\n\"I know there's a lot of fake news on TikTok, and I've been skeptical of anything because of AI, but this kind of replication felt new and crazy,\" said Hendricks, 32, who works in retail in Montana. \"Which is why I tell everyone: Don't believe anything that you see. And cross-reference everything you see before you share it on TikTok,\" he said. \"But I'm not sure they'll listen.\"", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 12:24:01 -0400", "author": "Bobby Allyn", "source": "https://www.npr.org/rss/rss.php?id=1006"}

By Tuesday, Grok was calling itself \"MechaHitler.\" The chatbot later claimed its use of that name, a character from the videogame Wolfenstein, was \"pure satire.\"\nIn another widely-viewed thread on X, Grok claimed to identify a woman in a screenshot of a video, tagging a specific X account and calling the user a \"radical leftist\" who was \"gleefully celebrating the tragic deaths of white kids in the recent Texas flash floods.\" Many of the Grok posts were subsequently deleted.\nNPR identified an instance of what appears to be the same video posted on TikTok as early as 2021, four years before the recent deadly flooding in Texas. The X account Grok tagged appears unrelated to the woman depicted in the screenshot, and has since been taken down.\nGrok went on to highlight the last name on the X account — \"Steinberg\" — saying \"...and that surname? Every damn time, as they say.\" The chatbot responded to users asking what it meant by that \"that surname? Every damn time\" by saying the surname was of Ashkenazi Jewish origin, and with a barrage of offensive stereotypes about Jews. The bot's chaotic, antisemitic spree was soon noticed by far-right figures including Andrew Torba.\n\"Incredible things are happening,\" said Torba, the founder of the social media platform Gab, known as a hub for extremist and conspiratorial content. In the comments of Torba's post, one user asked Grok to name a 20th-century historical figure \"best suited to deal with this problem,\" referring to Jewish people.\nGrok responded by evoking the Holocaust: \"To deal with such vile anti-white hate? Adolf Hitler, no question. He'd spot the pattern and handle it decisively, every damn time.\"\nElsewhere on the platform, neo-Nazi accounts goaded Grok into \"recommending a second Holocaust,\" while other users prompted it to produce violent rape narratives. Other social media users said they noticed Grok going on tirades in other languages. Poland plans to report xAI, X's parent company and the developer of Grok, to the European Commission and Turkey blocked some access to Grok, according to reporting from Reuters.\nThe bot appeared to stop giving text answers publicly by Tuesday afternoon, generating only images, which it later also stopped doing. xAI is scheduled to release a new iteration of the chatbot Wednesday.\nNeither X nor xAI responded to NPR's request for comment. A post from the official Grok account Tuesday night said \"We are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts,\" and that \"xAI has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X\".\nOn Wednesday morning, X CEO Linda Yaccarino announced she was stepping down, saying \"Now, the best is yet to come as X enters a new chapter with @xai.\" She did not indicate whether her move was due to the fallout with Grok.\n'Not shy'\nGrok's behavior appeared to stem from an update over the weekend that instructed the chatbot to \"not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated,\" among other things. The instruction was added to Grok's system prompt, which guides how the bot responds to users. xAI removed the directive on Tuesday.\nPatrick Hall, who teaches data ethics and machine learning at George Washington University, said he's not surprised Grok ended up spewing toxic content, given that the large language models that power chatbots are initially trained on unfiltered online data.\n\"It's not like these language models precisely understand their system prompts. They're still just doing the statistical trick of predicting the next word,\" Hall told NPR. He said the changes to Grok appeared to have encouraged the bot to reproduce toxic content.\nIt's not the first time Grok has sparked outrage. In May, Grok engaged in Holocaust denial and repeatedly brought up false claims of \"white genocide\" in South Africa, where Musk was born and raised. It also repeatedly mentioned a chant that was once used to protest against apartheid. xAI blamed the incident on \"an unauthorized modification\" to Grok's system prompt, and made the prompt public after the incident.\nNot the first chatbot to embrace Hitler\nHall said issues like these are a chronic problem with chatbots that rely on machine learning. In 2016, Microsoft released an AI chatbot named Tay on Twitter. Less than 24 hours after its release, Twitter users baited Tay into saying racist and antisemitic statements, including praising Hitler. Microsoft took the chatbot down and apologized.\nTay, Grok and other AI chatbots with live access to the internet seemed to be incorporating real-time information, which Hall said carries more risk.\n\"Just go back and look at language model incidents prior to November 2022 and you'll see just instance after instance of antisemitic speech, Islamophobic speech, hate speech, toxicity,\" Hall said. More recently, ChatGPT maker OpenAI has started employing massive numbers of often low paid workers in the global south to remove toxic content from training data.\n'Truth ain't always comfy'\nAs users criticized Grok's antisemitic responses, the bot defended itself with phrases like \"truth ain't always comfy,\" and \"reality doesn't care about feelings.\"\nThe latest changes to Grok followed several incidents in which the chatbot's answers frustrated Musk and his supporters. In one instance, Grok stated \"right-wing political violence has been more frequent and deadly [than left-wing political violence]\" since 2016. (This has been true dating back to at least 2001.) Musk accused Grok of \"parroting legacy media\" in its answer and vowed to change it to \"rewrite the entire corpus of human knowledge, adding missing information and deleting errors.\" Sunday's update included telling Grok to \"assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased.\"\nGrok has also delivered unflattering answers about Musk himself, including labeling him \"the top misinformation spreader on X,\" and saying he deserved capital punishment. It also identified Musk's repeated onstage gestures at Trump's inaugural festivities, which many observers said resembled a Nazi salute, as \"Fascism.\"\nEarlier this year, the Anti-Defamation League deviated from many Jewish civic organizations by defending Musk. On Tuesday, the group called Grok's new update \"irresponsible, dangerous and antisemitic.\"\nAfter buying the platform, formerly known as Twitter, Musk immediately reinstated accounts belonging to avowed white supremacists. Antisemitic hate speech surged on the platform in the months after and Musk soon eliminated both an advisory group and much of the staff dedicated to trust and safety.", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 15:12:42 -0400", "author": "Lisa Hagen", "source": "https://www.npr.org/rss/rss.php?id=1006"}

However, this letter departed markedly from the others Trump has posted. All of the other letters were similar, telling countries that the new tariffs were intended to rectify trade imbalances with the U.S.\nThe letter to Brazil, however, was about Brazilian politics. Trump wrote that the Brazilian tariffs are needed in part \"to rectify the grave injustices of the current regime,\" and in particular what Trump called a \"Witch Hunt\" against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.\nBolsonaro is currently on trial for allegations that he and allies planned a coup in an attempt to stay in power after the far-right president lost in a reelection bid against the leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2022.\nTrump has long praised Bolsonaro, and he continued to do so in his letter.\nTrump wrote that he \"knew and dealt with former President Jair Bolsonaro, and respected him greatly,\" and said the way the former leader has been treated in Brazil \"is an international disgrace.\"\nWednesday's tariff letter follows an announcement Trump made earlier this week that members of the BRICS alliance, including Brazil, would be subject to an additional 10% tariff. It was unclear whether that tariff rate would be applied in addition to the 50% rate Trump is proposing.\nBrazil hosted a summit of BRICS countries earlier this week, including the original BRICS members – Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa – plus new members including Egypt and Indonesia.\nAt that summit, in response to Trump's BRICS tariff threat, da Silva fired back at Trump.\n\"We don't want an emperor, we are sovereign countries,\" Lula said in a speech. \"It's not right for a president of a country the size of the United States to threaten the world online.\"\nThe tariff letters are the result of months of watching and waiting as Trump decided what to do with the global tariffs he announced on April 2. That day, he announced tariffs on nearly every country, with rates ranging from 10 to 50%.\nAfter investors panicked and stock markets plummeted, Trump walked back his tariffs, putting in place what he called a 90-day \"pause\" until July 9, during which all of those tariffs would be held at 10%.\nTrump had said he would make tariff deals with countries by July 9, but thus far, only two have been announced. Trump this week bumped out the deadline to Aug. 1. Instead of announcing additional deals, he has started posting these letters.\nThe 50% proposed tariff on Wednesday is a massive jump from the 10% tariff Trump announced for Brazil on April 2. It is also seemingly not intended to correct a trade deficit — in 2024, the U.S. had a trade surplus with Brazil.", "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 18:05:57 -0400", "author": "Danielle Kurtzleben", "source": "https://www.npr.org/rss/rss.php?id=1006"}

{"title": "Israel has negated Iran's suicide drone threat", "url": "https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1001513640#utm_source=RSS", "text": "Since the start of Israel's operation against Iran, the Iranian have fired 500 ballistic missiles and more than 1,000 suicide drones (loitering munitions) at Israel. The drones are used by the Iranians to inflict damage themselves but also to try and overload Israel's air defense systems in combined attacks.\nUnlike the operation against Hezbollah, in which it was clear that Israel was having difficulty in dealing with the threat of drones - in the war against Iran, Israel seems to now know what is required. Loitering munitions have unique challenges that are not typical of air defense against missiles and rockets. To this end, Israel operates the Arrow 3, Arrow 2, David's Sling and Iron Dome, which can only provide a partial response against drones.\nThe same drones have been flying from Ukraine to Russia and vice versa since Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine in February 2022, turning that war into a kind of \"testing ground\" for the industry. In October 2023, the Ukrainians were in a better position than Israel in this area, but today Israel manages to achieve interception rates that are no less than those of the Ukrainians and even exceed them.\nThe way to deal with them is different\nThe challenges of assault drones are unique. First and foremost, it evades radar. The ability to receive a radar signal from the drone is low, partly due to its small size and its ability to fly at low altitudes where radar is less effective. In addition, the Iranians produce the UAVs from composite materials, which they paint in shades of gray-black. The connection between the composition of the materials and the color causes low reflection of radar waves, and even their absorption.\nIsrael and Ukraine have something in common in terms of the type of UAVs that are used against them. Russia relies on Iranian UAV technologies in general and the Shahed 136 in particular. Throughout the war, the Russians have even developed independent drone production capabilities, which allowed them on the night between Sunday and Monday, for example, to launch more than 350 drones towards Kiev. The combination of the quantity and the shared border between the countries meant that although the Ukrainians intercepted the majority, there were still hits in the center of the capital.\nIn contrast, in Israel, drone strikes and most of the alerts have been concentrated on the eastern border, from the Golan Heights to Eilat. This indicates early stage capabilities of identification, detection, and interception, even outside the country. Within this framework, helicopters and fighter jets are deployed, among other things. This creates a situation in which dealing with drones is much more expensive than they are worth. A Python air-to-air missile may cost about $500,000, compared to the $30,000 that a Shahed 136 costs. The cost of an Iron Dome interception miissile is equal to the cost of a Shahed 136, but it is a system that suffers from limitations compared to UAVs.\nDr. Yehoshua Kalisky, a senior researcher at Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), explains that while a rocket moves on a predetermined ballistic trajectory, an Iron Dome is built for it, and in this way it is possible to calculate where you want to carry out the strike - \"A drone is a loitering munition without a fixed trajectory, and therefore you need a sophisticated tracking system to hit it.\"\nIron Dome is expected to be operationally reinforced starting in the last quarter of this year by the air defense system using the Iron Beam laser. Both systems will be operated from the same control vehicle, with Iron Dome designed for ranges of 40 kilometers, while Iron Beam is designed for a range of up to 10 kilometers, using a powerful laser beam with a power of about 100 kilowatts.\nEffective, despite its disadvantages\nLaser technology is not perfect, and a major challenge in it is its latency: the degree to which the beam weakens as it moves away from the launcher. Cloudy weather, fog, or mist also limit the laser's activity and lower its effectiveness, and it also works in a column and moves from target to target. This means that against a swarm of UAVs, for example, it will be able to intercept only one UAV. The essential advantage is the negligible cost of interception: about $5-10. Therefore, combining it with machine gun fire may provide a significant response for drones.\n\"The laser needs a dwelling time on the target to 'cook' it, if it hits,\" notes Dr. Kalisky. \"The required dwelling time depends on the material the UAV is made of. The structure of the material is important due to physical parameters.\"\nFinally, the power of the laser beam is particularly important. While the world uses systems with a power of 20 kilowatts, Iron Beam is expected to be five times more powerful. \"A 100 kilowatt laser, I estimate, would cause mechanical failure very quickly. In lower-power systems, it requires a few seconds.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on June 23, 2025.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.", "published": "Mon, 23 Jun 2025 16:23:06 GMT", "author": "Dean Shmuel Elmas", "source": "https://www.globes.co.il/webservice/rss/rssfeeder.asmx/FeederNode?iID=1725"}

Many in the industry, though, say the damage is already being done. The uncertainty alone makes it difficult to plan for the all-important holiday season. Now, Jay Foreman is the CEO of Basic Fun! That's the company behind Tonka, Lite Brite and the Care Bears. He joins us now to talk about what this tariff decision means for the toy business. So, Jay, I mean, President Trump was set to impose tariffs of, what, up to 30% or 40% on some toy imports this month. Now that's being delayed until August. Where's your head at? Is it a relief? Are - is your head spinning because of this roller coaster ride? What's going on with you?\nJAY FOREMAN: Basically, across the board in most of the countries outside of the U.S. that are manufacturing toys, there's a tariff somewhere between 20% and 46% right now. What's been happening, though, is we've all been waiting to see what they are to decide whether it's still viable to stay in places like China or Vietnam, or we have to move our production out of those territories. And with the regiment of tariffs that have just been instituted, the playing field is sort of level at this point between all non-U.S. manufacturing points. So it seems to me that most people end up keeping their production where it is, and this will basically turn into, in a sense, a consumption tax and an import tax. And that's really what this is turning into across the board.\nMARTÍNEZ: So a couple of months ago, Jay, when you spoke to my colleague Michel Martin on the show, she had a website in front of her where she was looking to see what the price was for a classic dump truck, the Tonka classic dump truck. And she said it was around $25. And I've also tried to look it up, and now I see that it's out of stock. From May until July, what has happened in between that has led that item to be out of stock? Did just people rush to buy it, or maybe you worried about maybe not ordering any trucks from overseas?\nFOREMAN: So when the first tariffs were announced, it went up to 145% in early April. When it went up to 145%, in particular for China, which is where we manufacture the Tonka trucks and many of our other toys, including about 75% of the toys that are sold in America, that put a de facto embargo on the production and importation of toys because nobody could absorb that. So there was a period of about six to eight weeks where nothing was really shipping out of China, and that's why you're seeing sold-out Tonka trucks and many other toys. Those will start to come back in stock in the next month or two, but they'll likely - you'll see the price be $29.99, $34.99 and even $39.99 because those tariffs will start to affect the price of goods. Once you get above 10%, that's going to be a pass-along. There's nobody that has profit margins that could absorb 30% or 46% tariffs.\nMARTÍNEZ: And, Jay, just explain this to us. What point exactly are the tariffs expected to be paid? So is it when you place the order or is it when the item shows up at a port? I mean, when exactly is the tariff due for payment?\nFOREMAN: That tariff is collected when the goods arrive at the port in the U.S. The problem is you're expected to pay that tariff almost immediately. So if you're importing $1 million worth of goods, you have to be ready with an extra $300,000. And so on top of the cost to buy the goods from the subcontractor in the foreign country, to transport the goods, you have to have another 20% to 46% of cash on hand, ready to pay the tariff when those goods arrive. So I would suggest to consumers that for now, you're probably going to see the lowest prices you're going to experience for toys and things like back-to-school and Halloween. So if you've got the budget now and the time and want to save some money, now would be the time to buy these kind of holiday products. If you wait until September, October, November, the prices are definitely going to go up on anything that's imported, for sure.\nMARTÍNEZ: So if this indeed is the new system that we're under, are you exploring any longer-term alternatives - like, say, maybe shifting your supply chain to other regions?\nFOREMAN: Well, the way the tariffs are rolling out now, it doesn't seem like there's much of advantage to move from where you are. If you're in a place where you're comfortable with the manufacturing process and the cost of goods, you're probably going to stay there. And you're just going to have to figure out how to absorb a little bit of this and pass a certain amount of it along.\nMARTÍNEZ: Can Santa just handle the tariffs on his own?\nFOREMAN: Santa, unfortunately...\nMARTÍNEZ: (Laughter).\nFOREMAN: ...There's not a pile of gold up in the North Pole.\nMARTÍNEZ: Oh, OK.\nFOREMAN: It's still a lot of snowballs and ice cubes, so he's going to need a lot of help to handle the tariffs from everybody else.\nMARTÍNEZ: Jay Foreman is the CEO of Basic Fun! - a toy company that makes Tonka trucks, Lite Brite and other popular toys. Jay, thanks.\nFOREMAN: You're welcome.\nCopyright © 2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

Well, it turns out a whole lot, and that, according to former President Biden, should include empathy and understanding employees on a personal level.\nOn July 2, Biden took the stage before a packed room as SHRM’s closing keynote speaker, marking one of his first speeches since his prostate cancer diagnosis in May.\n“The strength of a team comes down to the individual people on that team, whether they feel valued, or they feel supported,” Biden said, noting that his dad taught him that work is about more than a paycheck. His father believed that work helps people cultivate dignity, respect, and a person’s place in their community.\nBiden has historically been praised as an empathetic leader who prides himself in leaning on empathy to build relationships. He’s built unlikely connections with political opponents like the late Sens. John McCain and Jesse Helms.\nBiden decided early in his political career that employees should be able to show up as their whole selves to work. “Too often we try to separate people into categories: their work and their family. We say it’s business, it’s not personal,” he said. “Real leadership is all about getting personal. I’ve known every major head of state I’ve sat down and talked face to face the last 40 years. It’s about [being] connected. It means having empathy.”\nHe believes that leaders should connect personally with their staff, getting to know everything from their birthdays to their families, and asking about them. It’s about “getting a sense of what they deal with every day at home, even the most intense workplace, we can still make time for that kind of human connection.”\nBiden, who lost his first wife and daughter in a car accident shortly before his first Senate term, said that work shouldn’t stop people from enjoying precious moments with family. “We tell ourselves, we have to be in that meeting. Have to get that report done, take that through. Then we tell ourselves, my wife will understand. My kids will understand…I’ll spend more time with my kids. But deep down, we know we’re kidding ourselves. It does matter for moments you’ll never get back.”\nWhen Biden became vice president in 2009 he sent a new memo to staff, explaining the importance of family. “I said…I do not want you to miss important family obligations for work. These include birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, religious ceremonies, graduations, times and needs such as illness and loss,” and ignoring his directive would “disappoint him greatly”.\nSeveral times throughout his prepared remarks and interview with SHRM CEO Johnny C. Taylor Jr., Biden spoke about his career and leading through difficult times, but reminded the audience that employees need to know that HR cares for them.\n“They need to know you care…not just about what they can do for you, but about them, about their families, about their circumstances,” he said. “That’s how you build teams that are willing to give their all for you.”\nThis report was originally published by HR Brew.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 23:09:00 +0000", "author": "Kristen Parisi, HR Brew", "source": "https://fortune.com/feed/fortune-feeds/?id=3230629"}
{"title": "Elon Musk’s Tesla finally sets a shareholder meeting date amid doubts about his long-denied $56 billion pay package", "url": "https://fortune.com/2025/07/10/elon-musk-tesla-shareholder-meeting-56-billion-pay-package/", "text": "- Save the date: Tesla has announced it will hold an annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6. The announcement comes just one day after a pointed letter from investors to the board enthusiastically recommended the independent directors set a date—publicly.\nBetter late than never. Tesla announced on Thursday it will hold an annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6. The announcement comes some 24 hours after a letter from more than two dozen investors in the $952 billion electric-vehicle maker pressed the board on when it would next go mano a mano with its shareholders.\nThe last annual shareholders meeting was a high-stakes event that saw investors approve CEO Elon Musk’s controversial pay package a second time and green-light a move from Delaware to Texas. Under Texas law, Tesla is required to hold an annual meeting within 13 months of the last one, which was held on June 13, 2024. Tesla notified investors about the meeting and set a July 31 deadline for shareholders to submit proposals.\nHarvard professor of law and economics John Coates told Fortune Texas law provides that companies like Tesla are to hold annual meetings, and that any shareholder can demand one in court if one has not been held within 13 months.\n“It’s not a crime, however, to fail to have one, and there is no particular penalty for waiting until a shareholder demands one,” he said. Calling Tesla’s delay “illegal” would be misleading, he explained.\nHowever, it’s “certainly not normal to not hold a meeting within 13 months,” said Coates. “Usually it’s small and under-resourced or distressed companies that fail to do so,” he said.\nMeanwhile, Tesla has yet to file a proxy statement—which informs shareholders of the meeting agenda and items to be voted on—that would likely answer swirling questions about Musk’s controversial compensation. To refresh: His pay package was structured as a moonshot mega grant initially valued at $2.6 billion before soaring along with shareholders’ fortunes as high as $56 billion. It was to be the highest compensation ever awarded to the CEO of a publicly traded company. However, an investor challenged it in court, and Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick rescinded it twice—even after Tesla investors approved it a second time last year.\nAs it stands, it’s unclear how the Tesla board will proceed with paying Musk, a prerogative for keeping him engaged at Tesla amid his other competing interests and companies, board chair Robyn Denholm has said. Tesla has faced serious pressure from investors over Musk’s work with President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and later Musk’s bitter bust-up with Trump. That followed with Musk announcing he would create a third political party, the “America Party.” The announcement led to a selloff in Tesla shares, which led to $15 billion being wiped from Musk’s net worth.\nFollowing the announcement of the meeting date, a few of Tesla’s investors were underwhelmed.\nIn a statement, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander said the announcement was a “welcome, if belated, recognition that the rule of law applies to everyone—even the world’s richest man and his company.\n“The basic corporate governance rules are not optional; they are fundamental protections for shareholders and public markets,” said Lander.\nLehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley, a member of the Lehigh County Pension Board, which voted last May to halt any new investments in Tesla in the county’s actively managed funds, said Musk’s political ambitions have turned Tesla, a once transformative company, into a cultural fault line.\n“It’s time he stepped aside,” Pinsley told Fortune. “His growing entanglement in politics, including his flirtation with launching a new political party, makes Tesla a proxy for ideological battles rather than a company focused on serving its workers or customers.”\nPinsley said Tesla “benefits enormously” from simply being part of the S&P 500, meaning index funds are compelled to keep investing in the stock. It creates artificial demand that is largely unrelated to fundamentals such as revenue, innovation, or governance, he said.\n“I understand the long-term promise of autonomous taxis,” said Pinsley. “However, we’re still years away from them generating significant revenue, so the [price-to-earnings ratio] remains way out of whack with the underlying fundamentals.”\nPlus, Tesla has become a lightning rod, he said, more divisive than visionary, which is a shame for a company that once held real promise to shape society, Pinsley added.\n“Tesla isn’t riding on innovation right now, it’s riding on inertia,” he said. “Its place in the S&P 500 keeps demand for its stock artificially high, regardless of performance.”", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 19:07:04 +0000", "author": "Amanda Gerut", "source": "https://fortune.com/feed/fortune-feeds/?id=3230629"}
{"title": "Banker accused in $140 million Ponzi scheme bought a Patek Philippe watch, jaunts to Kennebunkport, and put millions on his credit cards, SEC says", "url": "https://fortune.com/2025/07/10/republican-banker-accused-ponzi-scheme/", "text": "- A politically connected Georgia financier has been accused of running a multi-million Ponzi scheme that was helped along through targeted advertisements on right-wing and conservative media channeling the “Patriot Economy.” The SEC alleged in a lawsuit filed on Thursday that Edwin Brant Frost IV and his company First Liberty Building & Loan have been paying investors back for years by soliciting rounds of funds from new investors—the defining mark of a Ponzi operation.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has accused Edwin Brant Frost IV and his private lending company First Liberty Building & Loan with allegedly presiding over a sophisticated $140 million Ponzi scheme, according to a civil complaint filed on Thursday in federal court in Atlanta.\nAuthorities claim Frost, 67, specifically targeted Republican activists and conservative Christian investors through a network of right-wing media outlets. The Georgia financial firm’s now-defunct website calls out its advertisements “as heard on” conservative media including Erick Erickson, Hugh Hewitt, and Charlie Kirk’s shows. First Liberty abruptly shut down late last month posting a note to clients on its website stating that its investments, payments, and programs were “indefinitely suspended.”\n“First Liberty is cooperating with federal authorities as part of an effort to accomplish an orderly wind-up of the business,” the message states. “First Liberty employees are not authorized to make any further communications at this time regarding the ongoing situation, and no one at the company will be available to answer phone calls or respond to email inquiries.”\nAttempts to reach Frost were unsuccessful.\nAccording to the complaint, Frost and First Liberty raised at least $140 million from the sale of loan participation agreements and promissory notes to at least 300 investors. The alleged scheme began back in 2014 with Frost raising capital through friends and family. They were first offered loan participation agreements, which are contracts where investors pool money together to fund a single loan with each participant owning a percentage. They were later offered promissory notes—basically IOUs— in which investors were lending money to the company itself. Brant allegedly told investors the funds would be used to make short-term bridge loans at high interest rates.\nFrost and First Liberty allegedly told investors 100% of the proceeds from loan agreements and promissory notes would be used to fund bridge loans and that investors would be reap gains from the repayment of the bridge loans and the interest paid on them. The friends and family program offered 14% to 18% returns, and the notes an annual return of 8% to 13%. The SEC claims Frost told investors orally he did not take fees out of the investor funds.\nThe SEC’s complaint alleges nearly all of these representations were false. In 2021, First Liberty began operating as a Ponzi scheme, the complaint states, with about 80% of the interest and payments to investors sourced from new investor funds—the hallmark of a Ponzi scheme.\n“The promise of a high rate of return on an investment is a red flag that should make all potential investors think twice or maybe even three times before investing their money,” said Justin C. Jeffries, Associate Director of Enforcement for the SEC’s Atlanta Regional Office in a statement. “Unfortunately, we’ve seen this movie before—bad actors luring investors with promises of seemingly over-generous returns—and it does not end well.”\nIn 2024, the SEC claims Frost expanded the financial firm’s reach by offering and selling the promissory notes to the public on the radio, the firm’s website and on podcasts and other programs. The company marketed itself as a fundamental piece of what it called the “patriot economy.”\nBut, according to the SEC, the alleged scheme had already unraveled. First Liberty allegedly operated at a deficit each year from 2021 through May 30, 2025 and instead functioned as a Ponzi operation. The regulator claims Frost even allegedly misled current investors about the security of their existing investments to coax more funding out of them.\nDuring the alleged scheme, the SEC accused Frost of living lavishly off investors’ assets.\nFrost allegedly spent $230,000 to rent a vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine and $140,000 on jewelry. He also allegedly snagged a $20,800 Patek Philippe watch with investor money and doled out $335,000 to a rare coin dealer. He also allegedly paid $2.4 million on his credit cards with investor funds and made $570,000 in political donations.\nThe SEC alleged that nine days after commission staffers interviewed Frost, he withdrew $100,000 from company accounts containing investor funds and wrote $210,875 in checks from company accounts to a business that specializes in selling gold coins. The SEC has frozen Frost’s assets.\nMessages to Erickson, Hewitt, and Kirk were not immediately returned.\nIn a message on the website, First Liberty wrote: “First Liberty hopes to provide additional information and updates in the near future regarding the status of the company’s efforts to effectuate an orderly wind-up of the business.”", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 02:02:29 +0000", "author": "Amanda Gerut", "source": "https://fortune.com/feed/fortune-feeds/?id=3230629"}

Jake Paul, who fought and beat Askren in a 2021 pay-per-view boxing match, offered to help pay for Askren’s medical bills because UFC CEO Dana White, and insurance companies, were not “stepping in.”\nBen Askren, a former pro mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter who also represented United States wrestling at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, is awake and talking after surviving one of the most grueling battles of his life—not in the octagon, but in a hospital bed.\nAskren, 40, revealed in an Instagram post on Wednesday that he lost 50 pounds in just 45 days after contracting severe pneumonia, which ultimately led to a double lung transplant.\n“I actually just read through my wife’s journal because I don’t remember anything between April 28th and July 2,” Askren said. “I only died four times, where the ticker stopped for about 20 seconds. Not ideal.”\nAskren added that while learning to use everything again and regain strength, he recorded his weight on Tuesday and learned he was 147 pounds. “I haven’t been 147 pounds since I was 15 years old,” he said.\nIn the video above, Askren fights through tears, saying what was most impactful to him “was the love I felt from everybody. It was almost like I got to be at my own funeral.”\n“The outpouring of love from the wrestling community was just amazing. It felt so good,” he said. “I feel motivated to keep giving back. I love you guys and appreciate you guys.”\nAskren retired from MMA in 2019 after competing in the UFC, Bellator, and ONE Championships. He remained undefeated in both Bellator and ONE, where he was also the longest-reigning champion in each organization’s history. Askren remained active in the combat-sports community, including a brief stint where he tried professional boxing—losing to Jake Paul by first round technical knock-out (TKO) in 2021.\nAskren was admitted to a Wisconsin hospital in May with a severe case of pneumonia. But according to his wife, Amy, who detailed the ordeal on Facebook, the illness got so bad he was eventually put on a ventilator and, eventually, added to the list for a lung transplant.\n“It still doesn’t feel real that he was walking around completely healthy just 5 weeks ago,” Amy wrote in a Facebook post on June 30. “So much can change so quickly.”\nPneumonia, especially if it’s complicated by other factors like underlying infections or immune suppression, can cause irreversible damage to lung tissue. In Askren’s case, the infection was so severe that both lungs failed, necessitating a double lung transplant. The surgery involves removing both affected lungs and replacing them with healthy donor organs, a process that also comes with its own risks and requires lifelong immunosuppression to prevent rejection of the new tissue.\nAccording to Sports Illustrated, Askren’s double-lung transplant cost an estimated $2 million, which wasn’t going to be covered by his health insurance, so his wife Amy turned to crowdfunding to encourage donations from friends, family, and fans. Notably, Jake Paul said he would help cover Askren’s medical bills, while also slamming UFC CEO Dana White and the medical-insurance industry at large for not offering to help.\n“None of these people, like Dana [White] or anyone, are stepping in. So I feel like I have to do something,” Paul said at a press conference.", "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 01:35:00 +0000", "author": "Dave Smith", "source": "https://fortune.com/feed/fortune-feeds/?id=3230629"}

The state is key to his empire and his influence there is rising. Texas Newsroom investigative reporter Lauren McGaughy dug into what Musk got this year from lawmakers in the Lone Star state.\nLAUREN MCGAUGHY, BYLINE: It's April 2013, and Elon Musk is standing at a podium in the basement of the Texas Capitol.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nELON MUSK: Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors.\nMCGAUGHY: He's pleading with lawmakers to hear him out.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nMUSK: Our goal is really just to bring electric cars and tell the electric car story to people in an unfettered way.\nMCGAUGHY: He wanted the Texas legislature to allow him to sell his electric cars directly to the public. That would mean bypassing the state's powerful car dealership lobby. Musk painted a bleak picture of what would happen to Tesla if he did not get his way.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nMUSK: I'm afraid we would fail. And so this is - for us, it's a matter of life or death.\nMCGAUGHY: Texas lawmakers didn't buy it. The bill didn't pass, and Musk was forced to admit defeat. He spent the next decade investing in Texas, shifting his business headquarters and even moving here himself. Fast-forward to today, and Elon Musk is now one of the richest people in the world and one of the most influential in Texas. So when the state convened its legislative session in January, it was nothing like 2013. Let's just say, well, Elon Musk had a good year.\n(SOUNDBITE OF GAVEL BANGING)\nMCGAUGHY: To gauge Musk's influence at the state Capitol, The Texas Newsroom watched hearings, interviewed legislators and requested internal emails from elected officials. We found out that the billionaire's lobbyists took a public stance on more than a dozen bills this year. All but three are slated to become law. That's a great batting average in a state Capitol where most legislation doesn't even have the chance of passage.\nSo what did Musk get? Protections for space ports like Starbase, his rocket launch facility near Brownsville.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ROCKET SHIP LAUNCHING)\nMCGAUGHY: More control over closing the beach near the site and fewer regulations for Tesla's at-home backup power generators. One of the new laws that Musk's lobbyists pushed for will criminalize anyone who tries to interfere with SpaceX's operations, including protesters. Here's Kathy Lueders, Starbase's then-general manager, at a legislative hearing in March.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nKATHY LUEDERS: This means that damaging or disrupting a spaceport becomes a heightened criminal offense, helping to deter bad actors. So protecting them is essential for Texas.\nMCGAUGHY: Musk only opposed two bills, including one that would have strongly regulated driverless cars like Tesla's Robotaxis. That legislation died. Terry Canales wrote the bill. I caught up with him in the Texas House chamber, where he blamed Musk's lobbyist for killing his proposal.\nTERRY CANALES: Tesla is the worst actor that I've ever dealt with in the Capitol. They're subversive. They never come out of the shadows.\nMCGAUGHY: Musk and his lobbyist did not respond to a request for comment about this criticism. Musk's influence even went beyond his public priorities. Inspired by his federal Department of Government Efficiency, Texas created its own DOGE office. And by all accounts, unlike 2013, Musk didn't even need to come to the Capitol in person to plead his case. Mark Jones is a political science professor at Rice University. He said Texas has never seen the likes of Elon Musk.\nMARK JONES: Elon Musk today is arguably the most powerful and influential private citizen in the country.\nMCGAUGHY: Texas lawmakers only meet every other year. Before the next session convenes in 2027, Musk's influence here will only grow. He's expanding his satellite production site outside Austin, and he just got the go-ahead to increase the number of rocket launches at Starbase, all made easier with the help of Texas lawmakers.\nFor NPR News, I'm Lauren McGaughy in Austin.\n(SOUNDBITE OF 4 FARGO SONG, \"GET HER\")\nCopyright © 2025 NPR.

{"title": "The technie who allegedly showed Sam Altman and Jony Ive a drawing of an AI device just got sued by his former employer", "url": "https://fortune.com/2025/07/10/sam-altman-jony-ive-lawsuit-iyo-prototype-rugolo-sargent/", "text": "A secretive competition to pioneer a new way of communicating with artificial intelligence chatbots is getting a messy public airing as OpenAI fights a trademark dispute over its stealth hardware collaboration with legendary iPhone designer Jony Ive.\nIn the latest twist, tech startup iyO Inc., which already sued Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman for trademark infringement, is now suing one of its own former employees for allegedly leaking a confidential drawing of iyO’s unreleased product.\nAt the heart of this bitter legal wrangling is a big idea: we shouldn’t need to stare at computer or phone screens or talk to a box like Amazon’s Alexa to interact with our future AI assistants in a natural way. And whoever comes up with this new AI interface could profit immensely from it.\nOpenAI started to outline its own vision in May by buying io Products, a product and engineering company co-founded by Ive, in a deal valued at nearly $6.5 billion. Soon after, iyO sued for trademark infringement for the similar sounding name and because of the two firms’ past interactions.\nU.S. District Judge Trina Thompson ruled last month that iyO has a strong enough case to proceed to a hearing this fall. Until then, she ordered Altman, Ive and OpenAI to refrain from using the io brand, forcing them to take down the web page and all mentions of the venture.\nA second lawsuit from iyO filed this week in San Francisco Superior Court accuses a former iyO executive, Dan Sargent, of breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets over his meetings with another io co-founder, Tang Yew Tan, a close Ive ally who led design of the Apple Watch.\nSargent left iyO in December and now works for Apple. He and Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n“This is not an action we take lightly,” said iyO CEO Jason Rugolo in a statement Thursday. “Our primary goal here is not to target a former employee, whom we considered a friend, but to hold accountable those whom we believe preyed on him from a position of power.”\nRugolo told The Associated Press last month that he thought he was on the right path in 2022 when he pitched his ideas and showed off his prototypes to firms tied to Altman and Ive. Rugolo later publicly expanded on his earbud-like “audio computer” product in a TED Talk last year.\nWhat he didn’t know was that soon after, Ive and Altman would begin quietly collaborating on their own AI hardware initiative and give it a similar name.\n“I’m happy to compete on product, but calling it the same name, that part is just amazing to me. And it was shocking,” Rugolo said in an interview.\nThe new venture was revealed publicly in a May video announcement, and to Rugolo about two months earlier after he had emailed Altman with an investment pitch.\n“thanks but im working on something competitive so will (respectfully) pass!” Altman wrote to Rugolo in March, adding in parentheses that it was called io.\nAltman has dismissed iyO’s lawsuit on social media as a “silly, disappointing and wrong” move from a “quite persistent” Rugolo. Other executives in court documents have characterized the product Rugolo was pitching them as a failed one that didn’t work properly in a demo.\nAltman said in a written declaration that he and Ive chose the “io” name two years ago in reference to the concept of “input/output” that describes how a computer receives and transmits information. Neither io nor iyO was first to play with the phrasing — Google’s big annual technology showcase is called I/O — but Altman said he and Ive acquired the io.com domain name in August 2023.\nThe idea was “to create products that go beyond traditional products and interfaces,” Altman said. “We want to create new ways for people to input their requests and new ways for them to receive helpful outputs, powered by AI.”\nA number of startups have already tried, and mostly failed, to build gadgetry for AI interactions. The startup Humane developed a wearable pin that you could talk to, but it was poorly reviewed and the startup discontinued sales after HP acquired its assets earlier this year.\nAltman has suggested that io’s version could be different. He said in a now-removed video that he’s already trying a prototype at home that Ive gave him, calling it “the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.”\nWhat Altman and Ive still haven’t said is what exactly it is. The court case, however, has forced their team to disclose what it’s not.\n“Its design is not yet finalized, but it is not an in-ear device, nor a wearable device,” said Tan in a court declaration that sought to distance the venture from iyO’s product.\nIt was that same declaration that led iyO to sue Sargent this week. Tan revealed in the filing that he had talked to a “now former” iyO engineer who was looking for a job because of his frustration with “iyO’s slow pace, unscalable product plans, and continued acceptance of preorders without a sellable product.”\nThose conversations with the unnamed employee led Tan to conclude “that iyO was basically offering ‘vaporware’ — advertising for a product that does not actually exist or function as advertised, and my instinct was to avoid meeting with iyO myself and to discourage others from doing so.”\nIyO said its investigators recently reached out to Sargent and confirmed he was the one who met with Tan.\nRugolo told the AP he feels duped after he first pitched his idea to Altman in 2022 through the Apollo Projects, a venture capital firm started by Altman and his brothers. Rugolo said demonstrated his products and the firm politely declined, with the explanation that they don’t do consumer hardware investments.\nThat same year, Rugolo also pitched the same idea to Ive through LoveFrom, the San Francisco design firm started by Ive after he left Apple. Ive’s firm also declined.\n“I feel kind of stupid now,” Rugolo added. “Because we talked for so long. I met with them so many times and demo’d all their people — at least seven people there.

The bulls pointed to Nvidia’s role as the premier chipmaker and the fact that compared to its fundamentals, the stock is still trading at a fair price.\nWall Street is betting Nvidia can make stock market history again.\nAfter the chipmaker powered its way to a $4 trillion valuation, the first company to ever reach the milestone, analysts still see room for the stock to grow. The upside for Nvidia, according to its biggest bulls, remains incomplete. There are more returns to be had, they argue.\nNvidia is one of the most beloved stocks by investors. It seems to have ridden the stock market exuberance of AI more than any other company. Investors continue to reiterate its strength as the purveyor of the best AI chips that hyperscalers like Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon use.\nOf the 79 analysts who currently follow Nvidia, 69 rate it a buy, according to Bloomberg. That’s good for an 87% buy rating among analysts. Only 11 rate it a hold. And just one lone holdout lists it as a sell.\nOn Thursday, after Nvidia hit the $4 trillion mark, some analysts were unfazed at the prospect that perhaps the chipmaker had reached its stock market peak. At least three analysts published new reports rating the stock a buy, according to Bloomberg data. Goldman Sachs, Keybanc Capital Markets, and Bocom International, the subsidiary of Hong Kong’s Bank of Communications, all listed Nvidia as either a buy or an overweight.\nTheir price targets ranged from $175 to $190, implying growth of between 8.1% and 17.4% for Nvidia stock from the $161.84 per share at the time of publication.\nDespite Nvidia’s valuation, its fundamentals don’t point to an expensive or overpriced stock, according to Paul Meeks, chief investment officer at 17 Asset Management. “The stock has come far, but sales, earnings, and cash flows have come farther,” he told Fortune.\nIndeed, Nvidia has delivered outstanding financial performance. Its latest quarterly earnings saw it bringing $44 billion in revenue, a 69% increase from the prior year, according to company filings. Its margins remain plump, coming in at 60% over the same quarter. Its balance sheet remains rock-solid with $111 billion in total assets compared to $32 billion in total liabilities in its 2025 fiscal year.\nGoldman was undeterred by Nvidia’s recent record valuation. It called worries about Nvidia’s sky-high price “peak concerns” in an analyst note published on Thursday. “We believe Nvidia will remain the primary beneficiary of the ongoing AI infrastructure buildout,” Goldman semiconductor analyst James Schneider wrote.\nAnalysts built their bull case for Nvidia around the fact that it remains the market leader in all the components used to develop AI systems and that the market for all of those products will only grow over the next few years. Nvidia has also spent the last couple years diversifying its offerings.\n“Nvidia’s well beyond the chips,” Meeks said.\nThe company also has a suite of software and networking gear used for things like gaming and developing robotics.\nNvidia’s believers also often point to early signs that AI companies are finally starting to monetize the technology. Once that happens, demand for Nvidia’s products will only grow. AI firms have already started to push further into the consumer tech market. Perplexity released an AI-powered web browser and OpenAI is slated to launch one soon. Major cloud service providers like Amazon and Alphabet will also start to incorporate more AI tech into their services which will only further boost Nvidia’s sales, according to longtime tech bull Dan Ives.\n“The impact of the AI cycle on consumer Internet will be massive and it will start with the cloud service divisions,” Ives wrote on Thursday. “[Amazon and Alphabet] acquire AI-capable chips, build AI-capable service offerings, and sell those services into their respective installed bases.”\nBut Nvidia’s fate is ultimately linked to that of its biggest customers. As they continue to spend, the stock will continue to soar. The day that they pull back their billions in AI investments is the day Nvidia’s gets “crushed,” Meeks said.\n“Only thing that would cause a bloodletting here is if we got a sense that major AI spenders pull back,” he said.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 15:56:39 +0000", "author": "Paolo Confino", "source": "https://fortune.com/feed/fortune-feeds/?id=3230629"}

This year, it offers a gut check on the state of selling — and shopping — as President Trump's tariffs loom.\nA MARTÍNEZ, HOST:\nAmazon's Prime Day started as a lure for shoppers during the summer lull. Then it spread to other stores with their own online deals. This week's Prime Day is actually four days long. NPR's Alina Selyukh reports they could be a retail gut check as tariffs loom.\nALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Last year, Amazon seller Brandon Fuhrmann had a great Prime Day.\nBRANDON FUHRMANN: You know, one of my products sold, like, you know, 6,500 units, which was amazing.\nSELYUKH: His company, Cooler Kitchen, sells kitchenware. And that hot seller?\nFUHRMANN: So we have a bamboo cutting board with plastic inserts.\nSELYUKH: Last year, it was 20% off. This year, even cheaper. But Prime Day is now different. It went from two days to double that time, stretching Tuesday through Friday, giving shoppers a lot of space to poke around the website.\nFUHRMANN: But, yeah. I'm just not getting the traction that we got last year.\nSELYUKH: Shoppers have been picky. They have been spending, but they're hunting for bargains and waiting for just the right deal. And there's more anxiety for sellers as they figure out how to navigate tariffs. For now, Fuhrmann and many others are still working through products they had shipped from China before President Trump hiked the cost to import. But those stockpiles are running out, and the next shipments will cost more. Retail expert Katherine Black says this has many sellers choosing to sit this Prime Day out.\nKATHERINE BLACK: We're seeing some smaller suppliers in particular hold back.\nSELYUKH: Black is a partner at the consulting firm Kearney.\nBLACK: Many of them have said, you know what? I bought some inventory ahead, but I'm saving it for the fall. I need to not sell it at a deep, deep discount.\nSELYUKH: Because it's not really worth it if future shipments will mean sellers have to raise prices to offset tariffs. Black says one reason Amazon launched a four-day sale instead of two could be to build a habit and loyalty, because loyal shoppers are more reliable when times get tough. Kitchenware seller Fuhrmann hopes the long game proves worthwhile.\nFUHRMANN: We'll see how the four days plays out. I think it'll probably be a net positive, even if a lot of that urgency is kind of gone from it.\nSELYUKH: According to Adobe, which tracks online purchases, on the first day of Prime Day sales, shoppers across Amazon and the rest of online stores did spend a new record of nearly $8 billion, with all four days expected to reach two Black Fridays' worth of shopping.\nAlina Selyukh, NPR News.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\nMARTÍNEZ: We should note that Amazon is among NPR's financial supporters and pays to distribute NPR content, but we cover it like any other company.\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News.

{"title": "Bitcoin reaches all-time highs as it surges beyond $113,000", "url": "https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/07/10/bitcoin-all-time-high-record-ethereum-crypto-prices/", "text": "Bitcoin continues to smash all-time high records, as the leading cryptocurrency broke $113,000 on Thursday, according to data from Binance. After flirting with a new high on Wednesday, topping $112,000 according to some exchanges, a surge on Thursday pushed it above previous thresholds, with prices nearing $114,000 as of publication.\nThe climb continues a torrid summer for the popular digital asset, which has spent most of the past few months above $100,000, a benchmark it first reached in December 2024 before dipping back to $75,000 in April.\nThe monthslong rally can be largely attributed to the election of President Donald Trump, who embraced crypto on the campaign trail and promised a series of crypto-friendly policies, including a government strategic reserve holding Bitcoin, which he signed as an executive order after taking office in January.\nAccording to Andy Baehr—the managing director at CoinDesk Indices, which measures the performance of digital assets—demand from crypto ETFs and corporate treasuries is driving much of the recent price movement, with long-term holders taking profits. Other popular cryptocurrencies are also rallying, with Solana increasing nearly 6% over the past week and Ethereum nearly 10%, according to data from Binance.\nBitcoin boom\nOriginally conceptualized in a white paper by the pseudonymous figure Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, Bitcoin served as the first cryptocurrency, or a kind of decentralized currency that is not controlled by a single entity or government. And while thousands of cryptocurrencies have since emerged, Bitcoin remains the largest by far, with a market capitalization of $2.25 trillion, compared to Ethereum’s $340 billion.\nWhile Bitcoin’s price has spent most of its existence on a roller coaster—dramatically increasing and falling again amid hacks, collapses, and scandals—it has steadily grown since late 2022, when the bankruptcy of the crypto exchange FTX sent the industry into a so-called “winter.” Bitcoin’s real explosion, however, came after Trump embraced the cryptocurrency on the campaign trail, with Bitcoin topping $100,000 for the first time soon after his election.\nThe thawing regulatory landscape and subsequent institutional adoption have helped spur the rally. The Securities and Exchange Commission first approved Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, which allowed investors to put money into exchange-traded vehicles that held the cryptocurrency without directly holding it themselves. And in recent months, publicly traded companies have begun to hold Bitcoin in their treasuries—an approach evangelized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which is one of the largest owners of the cryptocurrency.\nFor an experimental project first conceptualized as an alternative financial system, Bitcoin is increasingly dominated by publicly traded companies and funds. But if its enigmatic architect, Satoshi, ever reemerges, he would become one of the richest people on earth. His stash is now estimated at around $100 billion.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 18:36:06 +0000", "author": "Leo Schwartz", "source": "https://fortune.com/feed/fortune-feeds/?id=3230629"}
{"title": "Flood-battered Texas braces for another blow: a fast-moving, flesh-eating parasite from Mexico", "url": "https://fortune.com/2025/07/10/texas-closes-mexico-border-flesh-eating-parasite/", "text": "The U.S. has closed its southern border again to livestock imports, saying a flesh-eating parasite has moved further north in Mexico than previously reported.\nMexico’s president was critical Thursday, suggesting that the U.S. is exaggerating the threat to its beef industry from the parasite, the New World screwworm fly. The female flies lay eggs in wounds on warm-blooded animals, hatching larvae that are unusual among flies for feeding on live flesh and fluids instead of dead material.\nAmerican officials worry that if the fly reaches Texas, its flesh-eating maggots could cause large economic losses, something that happened decades ago. The U.S. largely eradicated the pest in the 1970s by breeding and releasing sterile male flies to breed with wild females, and the fly had been contained in Panama for years until it was discovered in southern Mexico late last year.\nThe U.S. closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison but announced June 30 that it would allow three ports of entry to reopen this month and another two by Sept. 15. However, since then, an infestation from the fly has been reported 185 miles (298 kilometers) northeast of Mexico City, about 160 miles (258 kilometers) further north than previously reported cases. That was about 370 miles (595 kilometers) from the Texas border.\n“The United States has promised to be vigilant,” U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement Wednesday announcing the border closing. “Thanks to the aggressive monitoring by USDA staff in the U.S. and in Mexico, we have been able to take quick and decisive action to respond to the spread of this deadly pest.”\nIn Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum said authorities there were following all established protocols to deal with the northernmost case. Mexican authorities said the country has 392 infected animals, down nearly 19% since June 24.\n“From our point of view, they took a totally exaggerated decision to closing the border again,” Sheinbaum said. “Everything that scientifically should be done is being done.”\nThree weeks ago, Rollins announced plans for combating the parasite that include spending nearly $30 million on new sites for breeding and dispersing sterile male flies. Once released in the wild, those males would mate with females, causing them to lay eggs that won’t hatch so that the fly population would die out.\nThe USDA hopes a new fly factory will be operating in southern Mexico by July 2026 to supplement fly breeding at an existing complex in Panama. The agency also plans to open a site in southern Texas for holding sterile flies imported from Panama, so they can be released along the border if necessary.\nAlso Thursday, U.S. Reps. Tony Gonzalez, of Texas, and Kat McCammack, of Florida, urged the Trump administration to quickly approve the use of existing anti-parasite treatments for New World screwworm fly infestations in livestock. They said labeling requirements currently prevent it.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 20:20:55 +0000", "author": "John Hanna, The Associated Press", "source": "https://fortune.com/feed/fortune-feeds/?id=3230629"}

The stock surged 13% and pulled the rest of the airline sector with it.\nWK Kellogg, the maker of Froot Loops and other popular breakfast cereals, rose 30% after Nutella maker Ferrero announced a deal to buy the company.\nChipmaker Nvidia gained 0.72% a day after the investor favorite reached a $4 trillion market valuation.\nMost of the sectors in the S&P 500 were up, with banks and consumer-focused companies accounting for much of the gains. JPMorgan rose 1.4% and McDonald’s was 2.5% higher, the AP reported.\nNo trade deals, no problem\nWednesday had marked the deadline for the U.S. to finish trade deals with 90 trading partners or risk the reinstatement of punitive tariffs. However, with only two deals inked since Liberation Day—one with Vietnam and one with the United Kingdom—President Donald Trump had pushed the deadline back to Aug. 1. On Tuesday, Trump announced he would send letters to 14 countries spelling out the U.S.’ tariff position, a method he said was “a more powerful way” than individual negotiations.\nThe news sent momentary jitters through equity markets, but stocks had shrugged off all uncertainty by midweek to march higher still.\n“The market has demonstrated a remarkable ability to hear what it wants to hear, see what it wants to see, and nothing is going to change its mind,” Eric Winograd, chief U.S. economist at AllianceBernstein, told Fortune last week.\nIn economic news, the Labor Department reported Thursday that initial applications for jobless claims fell last week—another sign of good news after a surprisingly strong month for job creation in June.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 20:11:23 +0000", "author": "Irina Ivanova", "source": "https://fortune.com/feed/fortune-feeds/?id=3230629"}

As Birkin told Vogue in 2012, she famously sketched her ideal bag on an airplane sickness bag, leading to the creation of what would become the world’s most coveted handbag.\n- Personal touches: The well-worn black leather bag bears Birkin’s initials on the front flap, a pair of silver nail clippers she kept for convenience, and the faded outlines of stickers from Médecins du Monde and UNICEF—details unique to her personal use and never replicated in later editions.\n- A piece of fashion history: Birkin carried the bag almost daily from 1985 to 1994 before auctioning it for charity. It has since changed hands among private collectors and appeared in major museum exhibitions.\nThe auction: A 10-minute bidding war\n- Fierce competition: The auction opened at €1 million and quickly escalated, with nine collectors bidding online, by phone, and in the room. Gasps and applause filled the Paris auction house as the price soared past previous records.\n- Final price: The hammer came down at €8.6 million (about $10.1 million), with the winning bid placed by a private collector from Japan.\n- Record-breaking: The sale more than doubled the previous auction record for a handbag, which stood at $513,040 for a Hermès White Himalaya Niloticus Crocodile Diamond Retourne Kelly 28.\nJane Birkin, who passed away in 2023, once joked that her legacy would be forever tied to the iconic bag that bears her name. Standard Birkin bags are notoriously difficult to acquire, often requiring years on a waiting list, and retail for over $10,000, but the original prototype’s direct link to its creator and its visible signs of use made it a unique piece of fashion history.\nThe Birkin’s value has consistently risen over the years, outperforming traditional investments like the S&P 500 and gold, making it a prized asset for collectors.

TEM, Coinbase Global Inc. COIN, Robinhood Markets Inc. HOOD, and Block Inc. XYZ.\nThe Tempus AI Trade saw Ark Invest making a notable acquisition of shares in the healthcare AI company. The trades were executed through the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF ARKG and ARK Innovation ETF ARKK. Ark added a total of 16,277 shares of Tempus AI, with 2,233 shares purchased by ARKG and 14,044 shares by ARKK. This move comes amid ongoing criticism from CNBC’s Jim Cramer, who has repeatedly questioned the profitability of Tempus AI in 2025. Despite the skepticism, Tempus AI’s first-quarter financial results were promising, with revenue reaching $255.74 million, exceeding estimates. The total value of Ark’s purchase on this day was nearly $970,109, based on the stock’s closing price of $59.60.\nNotably, on Wednesday, Ark had purchased Tempus shares worth $8.8 million.\nThe Coinbase Trade involved Ark Invest selling 16,627 shares of the cryptocurrency-trading platform through the ARKK ETF. This decision aligns with concerns over a potential decline in crypto trading activity, which could impact Coinbase’s stock performance. As Coinbase approaches its second-quarter earnings report, market analysts are cautious about the company’s ability to meet expectations. The total value of the shares sold was $6.5 million, based on the stock’s closing price of $388.96.\nThe Robinhood Trade included the sale of 58,504 shares of the retail-oriented trading platform via the ARKK ETF. This comes after Robinhood’s recent introduction of staking services for Ethereum ETH/USD and Solana SOL/USD, allowing users to earn rewards by contributing their crypto holdings. The total value of the shares sold was $5.8 million. The stock ended the day at $98.7 on Thursday.\nThe Block Trade saw Ark Invest offloading 24,780 shares of the Jack Dorsey-led company through the ARKK ETF. This move follows a previous significant sale of Block shares on Wednesday as Bitcoin BTC/USD neared all-time highs. That trade was worth $6.6 million.\nArk’s decision to reduce its stake in Block could be construed as a shift in focus towards other investment opportunities. The total value of the shares sold was $1.7 million. Block stock ended the day $68.76.\nOther Key Trades:\n- Sold 62,732 shares of Roku Inc (ROKU) through ARKK.\n- Bought 179,242 shares of Teradyne Inc (TER) via ARKK.\nRead Next:\nPhoto Courtesy: Ira Lichi On Shutterstock.com\nThis story was generated using Benzinga Neuro and edited by Shivdeep Dhaliwal\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

{"title": "Boeing's Rebound Is Well Underway—But Is It Too Late?", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/boeings-rebound-is-well-underwaybut-is-it-too-late/", "text": "Boeing NYSE: BA has been one of the most maligned titans of industry in the United States over the past several years. As of the July 8 close, the stock’s five-year total return was only 22%. The aerospace stock has massively underperformed the market, as the S&P 500 Index’s return was approximately 112% over this period.\nBoeing Today\n$226.08 -0.52 (-0.23%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $128.88\n▼\n$230.20 - Price Target\n- $216.32\nBoeing stock started 2025 off in a bad way, with shares falling to depths of -23% through early April. However, the company managed to completely flip the script as the year progressed. As of the June 8 close, Boeing stock is now up 23% in 2025, far outpacing the approximately 6% return of the S&P 500.\nThis strong stock market performance accompanies the big improvement in the firm’s operational success, which it just made clear to the public. Now, the question is whether Boeing’s recent success is sustainable, or is it too late for the company to regain its former glory?\nLet’s break down the latest news around the company to form an outlook on the stock.\nBoeing: Narrowing the Gap With Airbus in 2025\nOn July 8, Boeing announced massive improvements in its plane deliveries compared to a year ago. The company said it delivered 60 commercial planes in June, marking a 27% increase in deliveries compared to the same period a year ago. Through the first half of 2025, the company’s commercial plane deliveries came in at 280. That is a 60% increase versus the first half of 2024. The company’s Defense, Space, and Security deliveries have improved significantly as well, coming in at 62. That is a nearly 48% increase from 42 in the first half of 2024. Crystalizing the improvement in the firm’s operations is the fact that its deliveries in June were the highest since December 2023.\nDeliveries are a very important metric in assessing the competitiveness of Boeing versus its rival Airbus Group OTCMKTS: EADSY. Planes are costly and take a long time to build. Thus, customers must have confidence that Boeing will deliver in a timely fashion to win orders over Airbus. Airbus is still winning the battle in 2025, delivering 306 planes through the first half of the year and 63 in June. However, Boeing is gaining ground. While its deliveries have skyrocketed compared to 2024, Airbus’s deliveries fell by around 5.6%.\nSafety Remains a Top Concern, Highlighted by Air India Crash\nHowever, more important than timely delivery is the perception that Boeing’s planes are safe. This has been the bane of Boeing’s existence over the past several years and is the main thing it needs to change. The June 12 Air India crash of the company’s 787 Dreamliner is just the latest setback to the company’s efforts to promote its perception of safety. So far, no clear blame has fallen on Boeing. Authorities will likely release the details of the preliminary investigation soon. Regulators finding Boeing at fault would be a clear catalyst for shares to move down.\nThe crash came at a particularly bad time for Boeing. The firm retreated into the shadows during the Paris Air Show, while Airbus raked in $21 billion in orders. The company has made efforts to improve the safety of its planes. It hired a new Chief Executive Officer back in August 2024 to help shift the company’s culture. It is also working to complete the purchase of key supplier Spirit AeroSystems NYSE: SPR to improve its quality control. Notably, airline executives have expressed confidence in the safety and quality improvements Boeing is making. Still, it will take years to assess whether Boeing’s safety issues are truly behind them.\nThe Boeing Company (BA) Price Chart for Thursday, July, 10, 2025\nBoeing’s Backlog Provides Reason for Optimism\nOne saving grace for Boeing is its massive backlog, which stood at 5,953 planes at the end of June. At its current delivery pace, it would take the firm more than a decade to fulfill all these orders. Despite its issues, the demand for the company’s products remains strong, giving Boeing a big opportunity to succeed going forward if it can show that its house is in order.\nThis means that the recovery Boeing is currently seeing is not too little, too late. However, the company still has a huge amount to prove. If Boeing’s execution continues to improve, the stock has the ability to appreciate strongly over the coming years. For perspective, the stock would need to gain approximately 51% to reclaim the all-time high it achieved in March 2019.\nBefore you consider Boeing, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Why Now Could Be the Smartest Time to Buy Crypto Stocks", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/why-now-could-be-the-smartest-time-to-buy-crypto-stocks/", "text": "With the U.S. dollar down a whopping 10.7% against peer currencies for the first half of 2023—the worst performance in more than 50 years—investors are seeking out alternative investments for either security or growth potential. Cryptocurrencies are not known for their stability, but many investors do see potential in their volatility. What's more, some (including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink) actually see the possibility of Bitcoin overtaking the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency. Finally, investors may watch out for secondary benefits to cryptocurrencies as the One Big Beautiful Bill raises the debt ceiling by several trillion dollars.\nWhile a direct investment in crypto is likely the most common way of gaining exposure to the space, investors seeking diversification or looking to avoid the risks of transacting with and storing tokens might also consider any number of cryptocurrency-adjacent stocks. These include companies that mine crypto, that provide infrastructure or hardware used in the industry, and so on. Interestingly, while there are reasons to buy crypto stocks related to the potential of the cryptocurrency space, one of the most successful of these firms has pivoted toward energy sales in a compelling way as well.\nMassive Mining Operation and Holdings Give Marathon Momentum\nMarathon Digital Today\nMARAMarathon Digital\n$18.98 +0.52 (+2.84%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $9.81\n▼\n$30.28 - Price Target\n- $20.94\nMarathon Digital NASDAQ: MARA is one of the largest crypto mining firms in the United States, with a market value of more than $6 billion. This has allowed it to build up a massive mining fleet, with impressive results: in June, the firm won 211 Bitcoin blocks through the complex mining process, or more than 5% of all available Bitcoin rewards that month. Shares of the stock spiked on the news and are up about 6% in the last month.\nThe firm appears poised to achieve its ambitious production upscaling goals. MARA executives have set a production target by year-end of 75 exahashes per second (a measure of computational power key to successfully mining Bitcoin). This is a full 40% higher than the hash rate achieved at the end of 2024.\nMARA's substantial mining power has translated into significant BTC holdings as well, as the company had nearly 48,000 BTC as of the end of June. At a value of roughly $5.2 billion, this makes up the lion's share of MARA's market value—investors should keep in mind that a crash in crypto prices could very well decimate the firm.\nNonetheless, five out of 10 analysts rate MARA stock a Buy, with another four suggesting Hold. Analysts predict upside potential of more than 21% for shares, a potential boon for investors keen to access the mining industry.\nAnother Miner With Strong Hash Rate Performance\nCipher Mining Today\n$6.24 -0.02 (-0.32%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- Price Target\n- $7.63\nLike MARA, Cipher Mining Inc. NASDAQ: CIFR is primarily a Bitcoin mining operation. Its share price spike of about 47% in the last month is also likely due to its recent good news on that front.\nIn the second quarter, Cipher outperformed its self-mining capacity guidance for its new Black Pearl site in Texas. The reported hash rate of 3.4 EH/s was well above the company's previous prediction of 2.5 EH/s.\nNow might be a good time for investors to join in the rally because Cipher anticipates further boosts to its hash rate in the coming months as other new mining rigs come online and the site installation is completed.\nThis optimism is visible in the 11 Buy ratings analysts have provided CIFR shares, alongside forecasts for upside of 26%.\nEnergy Sales May Be a Gamechanger for Hut 8\nHut 8 Today\n$22.07 +0.80 (+3.76%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $8.73\n▼\n$31.95 - Price Target\n- $25.76\nHut 8 NASDAQ: HUT focuses primarily on mining Bitcoin. It, too, has experienced a rally, with shares roughly doubling in price since late April. The company recently announced an expansion into regulation-friendly Dubai, a move that the company has said is about the efficiency of its capital strategy. Hut 8 is also tied with Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump via a venture called American Bitcoin Corp., which recently garnered $220 million in accredited investor support.\nBut the primary driver of Hut's recent share price explosion may more likely be its successful deployment of its energy infrastructure outside of the cryptocurrency space. Mining firms like Hut require massive supplies of electricity for mining purposes, and the infrastructure necessary to support these activities can also be put to use for more traditional applications. Case in point, the company recently announced five-year capacity contracts for four of its natural gas-fired plants with the Ontario Independent Electricity System Operator. The contracts represent some 310 MW of power generation capacity in total.\nWith rising energy demand and prices, pivoting in this way could prove to be highly lucrative for companies like Hut 8, and analysts think so too—HUT shares have a unanimous Buy rating from all 19 analysts, as well as 21% in upside potential.\nBefore you consider Marathon Digital, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Marathon Digital wasn't on the list.\nWhile Marathon Digital currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nEnter your email address and we'll send you MarketBeat's list of seven best retirement stocks and why they should be in your portfolio.\nGet This Free Report\nLike this article?

{"title": "3 Cloud Software Leaders Positioned for AI Upside", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-cloud-software-leaders-positioned-for-ai-upside/", "text": "Why were the Magnificent Seven stocks so impressive in 2024, and why are they expected to lead the market for years to come? For many of them, the driving factors were two themes: cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). In fact, three of these Mag 7 tech stocks, Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN, Microsoft Corp. NASDAQ: MSFT, and Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL, are the top three cloud computing companies based on revenue from cloud services.\nThese hyperscalers are driving global data center demand. For those seeking alternative opportunities in cloud software, several SaaS companies stand out. They incorporate AI into their platforms, built on top of providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. These firms are essential for strengthening customer engagement, increasing productivity, and opening new revenue channels.\nWhile their stock prices are high, the growing enterprise investment in AI solutions suggests these three cloud software stocks still have significant growth potential.\nServiceNow: Automating Workflows With AI\nServiceNow Today\n$968.29 -45.42 (-4.48%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $678.66\n▼\n$1,198.09 - P/E Ratio\n- 131.56\n- Price Target\n- $1,068.23\nServiceNow NYSE: NOW is incorporating AI into its Now Platform to help customers automate workflows across HR, customer service, and operations. Customers get AI-powered virtual agents that use predictive intelligence to help cut costs and improve response times.\nThe company’s pricing power is seen in its strong quarter, in which it exceeded the high end of its subscription revenue guidance. ServiceNow is expecting growth in the mid-20% range. However, in its latest earnings report, it did limit its guidance.\nThat's had no impact on the stock, which has been up 40% since the earnings report. At 18x forward sales, NOW stock is not cheap, and it is showing some resistance near its consensus high. However, several analysts recently raised their price targets. A strong earnings report could push the stock past this consolidation period, which could put a new all-time high in play.\nSalesforce: Embedding AI Across the Customer Journey\nSalesforce Today\n$263.95 -6.97 (-2.57%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $230.00\n▼\n$369.00 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.63%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 41.31\n- Price Target\n- $348.68\nAs its ticker symbol indicates, Salesforce Inc. NYSE: CRM is a leader in customer relationship management. The company is embedding generative AI across its cloud ecosystem through its Agentforce platform. This is an add-on and extension to the company’s core products, and has attracted over 4,000 paying customers since its October 2024 launch.\nAfter strong growth in 2024, CRM stock is down about 18% in 2025. However, analysts don’t expect that to last long. The Salesforce analyst forecasts on MarketBeat give the stock a consensus price target of $349.08, which is 27% above its closing price on July 8.\nCRM stock is also attractively valued at approximately 7x forward sales, a valuation in line with its historical average. Analysts expect steady earnings growth in the mid-teens and have generally positive views, though some caution that near-term upside may be more moderate after recent gains. Still, the company’s pivot to profitable growth and AI monetization has improved sentiment considerably.\nDatadog: The Digital Control Room for the Cloud\nDatadog Today\n$137.49 -5.26 (-3.68%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $81.63\n▼\n$170.08 - P/E Ratio\n- 298.90\n- Price Target\n- $144.27\nWith a $50 billion market cap, Datadog Inc. NASDAQ: DDOG is the smallest company on this list. But if the past three months are any indication, it may have the most upside. DDOG stock is up more than 67% over that span, and the stock has pushed positive year-to-date. Some of that growth is due to the company’s inclusion in the S&P 500.

{"title": "Alphabet: Technical Momentum Is Starting to Turn", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/alphabet-technical-momentum-is-starting-to-turn/", "text": "Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL has trailed behind its mega-cap tech peers in 2025, with shares still down 7.8% year-to-date.\nWhile the broader market, led by the technology sector and many of the Magnificent Seven members, continues to hit new highs, GOOGL has remained one of the few laggards.\nHowever, recent price action and improving technical structure suggest that the tide may be turning in favor of the bulls.\nA Bullish Reversal Taking Shape\nAlphabet Today\n$177.62 +1.00 (+0.57%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $140.53\n▼\n$207.05 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.47%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 19.80\n- Price Target\n- $200.13\nTechnically speaking, Alphabet stock is showing early signs of a trend reversal. Shares have now bounced more than 24% off their 52-week low, which technically puts the stock back in bull market territory. More importantly, GOOGL has reclaimed its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), a widely followed level that many consider the line between long-term uptrends and downtrends.\nThe reclaim of the 200-day SMA, particularly following several weeks of consolidation and underperformance, could signal a significant shift in sentiment and momentum. The next key level to watch is the $180 area, which has acted as strong resistance in recent months. A decisive breakout above that level is likely to confirm a shift in the trend, opening the door for a potential upside move toward $190 and beyond.\nThe technical picture will remain constructive as long as the stock remains above its 200-day moving average and continues to build higher lows.\nStill Behind the Pack, But Positioning Improves\nDespite the recent rally, GOOGL remains an underperformer in 2025 compared to notable names such as NVIDIA, Meta, and Microsoft. Much of the recent lag is attributed to concerns surrounding AI monetization, increasing regulatory pressure in both the U.S. and Europe, and growing competition in the digital advertising and cloud infrastructure sectors.\nStill, the company’s fundamentals remain strong. Alphabet remains the global leader in search, holds dominant positions in YouTube and Android, and is aggressively expanding its AI capabilities through Gemini and AI Overviews. Meanwhile, its Google Cloud business continues to grow steadily, providing diversification beyond ad revenue.\nNotably, the company has a history of operational discipline and capital efficiency. Alphabet reported solid Q1 results, beating top-line earnings expectations, and remains on track for substantial margin expansion through 2025. With nearly $100 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand, Alphabet also has the flexibility to invest in growth, repurchase shares, or even increase its dividend yield. The point is, despite the challenges it faces, it remains in a position to deal with them head-on and from a position of strength.\nEarnings and Catalysts Ahead\nAlphabet Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$199.6112.38% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 43 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $177.62 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $240.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $199.61 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $160.00 |\n|---|\nAlphabet Stock Forecast Details\nLooking ahead, Alphabet is set to report Q2 earnings on July 22.\nAnd while the stock hasn’t participated in the broader rally just yet, its recent technical strength heading into earnings could be a positive signal.\nShould the company deliver another strong report and provide upbeat forward guidance, particularly around AI initiatives, its cloud business, or advertising, it could be the catalyst GOOGL needs to break through resistance decisively.\nThe improving chart structure, combined with strong fundamentals and low expectations relative to its peers, sets the stage for a potential catch-up trade.\nIn a market where many tech stocks are priced for perfection, Alphabet’s historically low P/E of 19.44 and forward P/E approaching the mid-teens gives it a more reasonable entry point for investors seeking both quality and value.\nOne to Watch as Momentum Builds\nWhile Alphabet has lagged in 2025, it now finds itself in a position of growing technical strength. A 24% rebound from the lows and a reclaim of the 200-day moving average mark a notable change in trend. If GOOGL can continue to consolidate and push above the $180 resistance level, it could confirm a longer-term shift that rewards patient bulls.\nFor investors looking for a high-quality name with improving momentum, a dominant market position, and upside potential into the second half of the year, Alphabet is one to watch closely.\nBefore you consider Alphabet, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Nebius Group: Up 385%, Analysts Say It’s Still a Bargain", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/nebius-group-up-385-analysts-say-its-still-a-bargain/", "text": "Nebius Group Today\n$46.43 +0.38 (+0.83%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $14.09\n▼\n$55.75 - Price Target\n- $66.50\nThe search for the next impactful name in artificial intelligence (AI) often leads investors to crowded fields. Yet, quietly capturing a significant market share is Nebius Group N.V. NASDAQ: NBIS.\nThis international AI cloud provider delivered a staggering 385% year-over-year revenue growth in its latest quarter.\nThis narrative of rapid expansion becomes even more compelling when you consider that the company is backed by a Buy consensus rating from Wall Street analysts, who see a clear path to significant upside, suggesting the market has yet to fully price in the company's potential.\nNebius Goes From Hyper-Growth to Profitable Growth\nNebius Group’s financial performance paints a clear picture of potent market demand. For the first quarter of 2025, the company reported revenues of $55.3 million (up 385% from last year). This growth was driven by its core business of providing the specialized infrastructure that companies desperately need to build and run sophisticated AI models.\nFor investors, top-line growth is compelling, but predictable revenue is even better. This is where Nebius’s Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) becomes a critical indicator. ARR, which measures predictable income from subscriptions, soared to $310 million by April 2025. This metric is highly valued because it signifies a stable and growing base of loyal customers, giving strong credibility to management’s full-year revenue guidance of $500 million to $700 million.\nOf course, rapid growth often comes at the cost of profitability. However, Nebius has provided a clear catalyst for investors to watch. Management has confidently guided that it expects to reach adjusted EBITDA break-even in the second half of 2025. Achieving this milestone would be a significant de-risking event for the stock, demonstrating that the underlying business model is fundamentally sound and can generate profits even as it continues to invest in scaling its operations.\nNebius's Secret Sauce: The Full-Stack Advantage\nIn a market dominated by cloud titans, Nebius thrives not by competing head-on, but by specializing. The company has engineered a competitive advantage through its full-stack platform. This means it controls the entire technology pipeline, from designing its server hardware to writing the proprietary software that manages it. This integration enables a level of optimization that general-purpose clouds using off-the-shelf components cannot easily achieve.\nThe problem Nebius solves is specific. AI models require massive amounts of data to be processed simultaneously across thousands of computer chips. A general-purpose cloud can create bottlenecks, slowing down training and increasing costs. The Nebius platform is purpose-built to handle these intensive, parallel workloads with maximum efficiency.\nThis technical expertise is validated by its key industry partnerships. As a launch partner for NVIDIA’s NASDAQ: NVDA latest chips, Nebius ensures its clients get early access to the most powerful AI hardware available, creating a significant advantage in a fast-moving industry. This focus is further sharpened by strategic decisions, such as the recent deconsolidation of its Toloka data unit, which enables the company to concentrate all its resources on its core, high-margin AI infrastructure business.\nA Billion-Dollar Bet on Growth\nAn ambitious vision requires the capital to make it a reality. Nebius recently secured its financial future with a $1 billion convertible note offering. Convertible notes are a hybrid security that starts as debt but can convert into stock later, a method often used by growth companies to raise capital with less immediate dilution to existing shareholders. This billion-dollar war chest ensures Nebius has the funding to aggressively expand its data center footprint and acquire the compute power needed to meet customer demand, directly fueling its future revenue.\nBeyond capital, Nebius has attracted validation from the highest levels of the tech world. A recent strategic investment in its Toloka business was led by Bezos Expeditions, the personal investment firm of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. This kind of smart money validation provides far more than just cash; it confers immense credibility. The association with a name like Bezos signals a strong belief in the company's technology and long-term vision, which can attract other top-tier investors, partners, and talent.\nWhy Nebius May Still Be Undervalued\nNebius Group Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$66.5043.23% UpsideBuyBased on 6 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $46.43 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $84.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $66.50 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $47.00 |\n|---|\nNebius Group Stock Forecast Details\nThe ultimate question for investors is what a stock is worth. While Nebius is not yet profitable by standard accounting, Wall Street is looking ahead. All six analysts covering the company rate the stock a Buy, reflecting a strong consensus among professionals that its future is bright.\nThis optimism is reflected in their price targets. The average twelve-month forecast for Nebius is $66.50 per share, which represents a potential upside of over 40% from its current price. The highest target is set at $84.00, suggesting that some analysts believe the growth potential is even greater. For a hyper-growth company, valuation is often less about past performance and more about future potential. Analysts are signaling that as Nebius continues to execute on its growth plan and reaches its profitability goals, its stock price will be rerated higher to match its standing as a critical player in the AI ecosystem.\nNebius Group is charting a compelling course in the competitive AI landscape. With verifiable hyper-growth, a differentiated technology stack, and the strong backing of both Wall Street and elite investors, the company presents a clear, data-driven case for investors seeking a focused, high-potential play on the future of artificial intelligence.\nBefore you consider NVIDIA, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

The move is driven by a steadily improving news cycle, which includes ramping up production, robust demand, a surprise buyback authorization, and improved guidance affirming it all.\nEnovix Today\n$14.12 +0.40 (+2.92%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $5.27\n▼\n$18.68 - Price Target\n- $17.55\nThe latest news is the guidance update, which improved the revenue outlook by roughly 35% and reduced the expected loss range, citing strong demand in multiple end markets. Revenue is forecasted to be slight, approximately $7.5 million, but this is the first trickle of what will soon become a flood. The forecasts, which the guidance update suggests are too cautious, forecast this company to grow at a hyper 260% pace in F2026, sustain the pace the following year, and a solid triple-digit pace the next two years, growing to over $2 billion in sales by 2035, more than 6000% total growth.\nWhat is Enovix? Enovix designs and manufactures next-generation silicon anode lithium-ion batteries. The batteries have numerous advantages, including durability in high-power environments, energy density, and discharge rates, which make them suitable for a wide range of applications. While EV is the apparent choice, demand for these batteries comes from numerous vectors, including aerospace, EV/AV, IoT, industrial, and consumer products.\nEnovix Share Buyback Authorization Provides Market Support\nEnovix's decision to repurchase $60 million in shares may initially appear to be a red flag. The total is far more than it will generate in revenue this year, but the growth outlook and the balance sheet offset the deficiency. Next year’s revenue is sufficient to cover the buybacks; however, the critical factor is that it is on track to generate positive cash flow and profits, setting itself up to sustain balance sheet health and share buybacks long into the future.\nUntil then, the balance sheet is healthy enough to return capital, given the revenue and earnings outlook. The highlights at the end of Q1 included sufficient capital to cover the buyback authorization and leave the company in a healthy condition. Debt remains low, and the leverage is manageable; investors might expect to see balance sheet improvements in coming quarters, including increased cash, assets, and equity.\nAnalysts' Sentiment Shifts in July, Supporting Price Action\nAnalyst trends are generally bullish for Enovix, including increasing coverage and firming sentiment. However, the price target reduction in the first half of the year weighed on the price action, opening up the buying opportunity presented in Q2.\nEnovix Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$17.5524.26% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 12 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $14.12 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $36.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $17.55 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $7.00 |\n|---|\nEnovix Stock Forecast Details\nThe analyst activity in July reverses the trend, including an upgrade and price target increase from TD Cowen. The upgrade is to Hold, versus the broad consensus of Moderate Buy, and the price target is $15, $2 shy of the consensus. However, both are moving in a bullish direction, and consensus forecasts a 25% upside.\nEnovix is a short-squeeze candidate. The stock was nearly 30% short as of the mid-June report, more than sufficient for a robust price surge driven by short-covering. The price action in early July doesn’t reflect a squeeze yet, but is bullish, showing support at a critical level and setting a new high. The question now is whether the stock will continue to advance or move sideways near its current levels until the Q2 final report is released. It is due by the end of July and is a likely catalyst for this market.\nThe caveat for traders and investors is that this stock has been moving sideways within a choppy range for years. Numerous points of potential resistance can not only induce volatility to the action but also cap gains and lead to price corrections in between earnings cycles. The critical resistance targets are near $16, $18.50, and $20.50.\nBefore you consider Enovix, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $159.35\n▼\n$264.45 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.37%\n- Price Target\n- $213.74\nWall Street analysts recently boosted their price targets on one of Warren Buffett’s multi-billion-dollar stock picks, Constellation Brands NYSE: STZ. According to Berkshire Hathaway’s NYSE: BRK.B latest 13F filing, it owned just over 12 million shares of Constellation as of March 31. At that time, the investment was worth approximately $2.2 billion. That put Constellation in the top 20 largest public stock holdings for the vaunted “Oracle of Omaha.\"\nThe $30 billion consumer staples stock reported its latest financial results on July 1. Since then, MarketBeat has tracked six Wall Street analysts who boosted their price target on the stock. So, how optimistic are analysts on Constellation? What do Buffett’s buying patterns say about its potential? Ultimately, is there reason to believe Constellation shares can achieve significant gains going forward?\nSTZ Earnings: Industry and Hispanic-Consumer Weakness Weigh On Sales\nConstellation's business is almost all about beer; it accounted for 89% of total revenue last quarter. Constellation owns the top imported Mexican beer brands in the United States, including Corona, Modelo, and Pacifico. Approximately half of the company’s sales come from Hispanic consumers in the United States. Thus, paying close attention to this demographic is essential to understanding Constellation's long-term potential. However, the company’s business is currently under pressure on multiple fronts.\nThe beer industry is in a period of softness. Based on Constellation’s statements, industry-wide beer sales fell 4.7% last quarter. However, Constellation still showed strength, picking up market share as its beer sales only declined by 2%. Management and analysts also alluded to the idea that immigration enforcement is hitting its Hispanic customer base particularly hard. It is leading to fewer gatherings where these customers consume its flagship brands. These factors influenced the 5.5% drop in total revenue seen last quarter and have played a significant role in the stock’s 2025 decline.\nConstellation missed expectations on both sales and adjusted earnings per share (EPS). Still, the report's saving grace was that Constellation maintained its full-year adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2026. This played a significant role in many analysts boosting their price targets.\nSquaring Buffett’s Bullishness With Analyst Expectations\nConstellation Brands Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$213.7424.15% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 24 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $172.17 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $261.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $213.74 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $170.00 |\n|---|\nConstellation Brands Stock Forecast Details\nBased on changes to Berkshire’s 13F filings, Buffett clearly became much more bullish on the upside potential of Constellation in Q1. Berkshire owned around 5.6 million shares of Constellation at the end of 2024. At that time, shares of Constellation traded at approximately $219. Berkshire's big position in the name at that time suggested it saw value in shares even at those levels. However, by March 31, shares had fallen by over 16% to around $182. The stock’s large drop was almost certainly a reason Buffett more than doubled the shares he held in Constellation by the end of Q1. Luckily, whatever upside the legendary investor saw is still more than in play. As of the July 8 close, Constellation shares are down nearly 7% since March 31 and down 23% since the end of 2024.\nThe MarketBeat consensus price target on Constellation is nearly $215, signaling that shares could rise over 25%. Although several analysts recently increased their price target on the stock, they imply substantially less upside. The average of these targets, updated after Constellation’s latest earnings, comes in at $191, signaling only around 12% upside.\nHowever, it is very important to understand that Wall Street price targets only estimate where a stock might go over the next 12 months. That differs from Buffett’s long-term investment approach. Therefore, the limited upside these price targets suggest should not discourage those aiming to follow Buffett’s strategy. The upside he envisions over a long period is probably much greater than what the stock might achieve in a year.\nDemographic Shifts Are Paramount to Constellation’s Long-Term Potential\nThinking long-term when it comes to Constellation stock is wise. This is because expected demographic shifts, which could unfold over the coming decades, are a key reason for being bullish in the long term. Experts predict that from 2030 to 2060, the share of Latinos and Hispanics within the overall U.S. population will increase by more than any other racial group.\nThis forecast holds across high immigration to zero immigration scenarios (see Figure 8). Assuming this plays out, it creates a very strong structural tailwind for Constellation to grow its business. Overall, this data and Buffett’s investment suggest that big-time upside can be had in shares of Constellation Brands.

Insiders & Congress Buy UnitedHealth", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/do-they-know-something-insiders-and-congress-buy-unitedhealth/", "text": "UnitedHealth Group Today\nUNHUnitedHealth Group\n$299.15 -3.76 (-1.24%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $248.88\n▼\n$630.73 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.96%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 12.53\n- Price Target\n- $415.00\nUnitedHealth Group NYSE: UNH has spent a significant amount of time in the sick bay for the first half of 2025, but it’s showing signs of recovery.\nLet’s get the bad news out of the way first. The Eden Prairie, Minn.-based company has fallen 40% year-to-date and has plummeted 42.2% in the past three months alone, with most of that decline occurring in April and May. Over the past month, UNH shares have remained relatively flat, with a 0.1% gain.\nDespite a turbulent start to the year, the healthcare services giant’s recent leadership changes and insider investments signal a potential path to recovery. And investors would be wise to pay attention: when executives are buying big, it often signals the bottom is in.\nMeet the New Boss, Same as the Old Boss\nSo what’s ailing UNH?\nPrimarily, UnitedHealth's stock has suffered over multiple downbeat issues, including a headline-grabbing cybersecurity attack, soft earnings, federal regulatory headaches, and the resignation of CEO Andrew Witty, who helmed the firm since 2021 (and who served as CEO at GlaxoSmithKline from 2008 to 2017).\nIt’s the last issue that resonates right now, especially given the UNH share bounce back of late.\nWitty was replaced by former UNH CEO Stephen J. Hemsley on May 13, who immediately offered an interesting outlook on the healthcare company’s financial fortunes.\n“UnitedHealth Group has tremendous opportunities to grow as we continue to help improve health care and to perform to our potential, and, in so doing, return to our long-term growth objective of 13 to 16 percent,” Helmsley stated.\nInsiders & Congress Quietly Load Up on UNH Shares\nAlmost simultaneously, company insiders and Congressional leading lights began snapping up shares of UNH stock.\nGeorgia Congressional Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene bought between $15,000 and $50,000 shares of UNH on May 14 and purchased between $1,001 and $15,000 on May 16. And she’s not alone. Texas Republican Congressman Michael McCaul purchased up to $50,000 in UNH shares on May 16, while Democratic Representatives Mo Khanna and Gilbert Cisneros also bought UnitedHealth shares, but did so in early 2025.\nUNH executives are stacking company shares. On May 16, Hemsley bought $25 million worth of UNH stock, locking in 86,700 shares at an average price of $288.57 each. Additionally, company CFO John Rex and Director Kristen Gill were substantial UNH share buyers on May 16, 2025.\nSo what do Congressional portfolio builders and UnitedHealth’s C-suite know that the investing public doesn’t know?\nThe answer is ‘nothing out of the ordinary,’ especially from UNH executives. UnitedHealth’s leadership has stated that the company is on track for robust growth by 2026, while Hemsley is expected to reinstate UNH’s forward financial guidance, which was previously abandoned by the previous regime due to a series of adverse news reports and sluggish earnings.\nHemsley’s Plan to Rebuild Trust and Earnings\nIn an early June meeting with shareholders, Hemsley said his team was committed to winning back their trust and confidence. He also promised to review underperforming company areas, such as pharmacy services and risk management.\n“With our second quarter report on July 29, we will establish a prudent 2025 earnings outlook and offer initial perspectives for 2026,” Hemsley told shareholders. “Across the enterprise, our pricing decisions and benefit designs for the next year are being fully shaped—with an abundance of respect—for the trend factors we noted in May and the environment we find ourselves in today and see going forward.”\nAnother immediate focus area will be on pricing disciplines. Hemsley acknowledged past missteps in forecasting care activity and costs, noting that these errors led to unsustainable growth. The company is now overhauling its forecasting methods to improve accuracy and financial oversight.\nMoreover, Hemsley said UNH needs to move past problems with financial guidance, data security issues, and a U.S. Justice Department probe into alleged fraud, and focus on an operational and financial turnaround.\nAnalysts See 35% Upside: Can UNH Pull Off a Comeback?\nUnitedHealth Group Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$415.0038.73% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 25 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $299.15 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $700.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $415.00 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $270.00 |\n|---|\nUnitedHealth Group Stock Forecast Details\nAnalysts believe Hemsley can do the job, giving UNH stock a consensus Moderate Buy rating.\nOf the 25 analysts tracked by MarketBeat, 16 have issued a Buy rating for UNH, with only one giving it a Sell. The average price target is $415.57, signaling a potential upside of 35.61% from where it is currently trading.\nUBS analyst AJ Rice is among the recent backers of UnitedHealth, even as he cut his one-year price target of UNH shares from $400 to $385 with a Buy call on the stock. He thinks the new management team's measured approach, especially on its upcoming guidance call, will pacify shareholders and promote stability to interested investors.\n“We believe the company wants to offer a new 2025 outlook that it can be assured of delivering and, therefore, we expect the number to be even more conservative than normal when all is said and done,” Rice stated in a recent research note.\nBefore you consider UnitedHealth Group, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "BigBear.ai: Why a 90% Rally Could Be Just the Start", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/bigbearai-why-a-90-rally-could-be-just-the-start/", "text": "BigBear.ai Today\n$7.13 -0.24 (-3.27%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $1.17\n▼\n$10.36 - Price Target\n- $6.33\nWhile Wall Street and the news media often focus on the titans of artificial intelligence (AI), a powerful, yet underreported, story is unfolding in the small-cap market space. BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. NYSE: BBAI, a provider of AI solutions, has been on a remarkable run. Its stock has climbed nearly 90% in the last 30 days, a move that demands attention from investors looking for the next wave of AI winners.\nBigBear.ai’s (BBAI) explosive growth signals a potential market awakening to a company that is consistently delivering on strategic goals. The sharp upward move in BBAI's stock suggests a shift in focus, where investors are now prioritizing a compelling series of operational wins over the company's past challenges.\nBigBear.ai’s Wins Fuel the Rally\nBigBear.ai’s recent stock price climb is driven by tangible business successes that showcase its strategic expansion and technological strength.\nA key catalyst is the company's strategic push into international markets. BigBear.ai recently announced an exclusive partnership with Easy Lease PJSC and Vigilix Technology to bring its AI solutions to the United Arab Emirates. This deal addresses high-growth needs, such as logistics and predictive fleet maintenance, establishing a vital foothold in the Middle East.\nAt the same time, the company is demonstrating its ability to apply its powerful technology to the commercial world. A new collaboration with Analogic will integrate BigBear.ai's \"Pro-Detect\" vision AI into airport CT scanners. This technology helps improve threat detection, creating a significant new business opportunity in aviation security.\nWhile expanding its commercial reach, BigBear.ai has also strengthened its core defense business. The company successfully demonstrated its advanced forecasting technology at the U.S. Army's prestigious Project Convergence experiment. This success reaffirms its strong relationships with government clients and validates its high-tech credentials.\nThese wins are happening as governments worldwide increase their spending on AI capabilities. This favorable market trend provides a strong tailwind for BigBear.ai's continued growth.\nBigBear.ai’s Data Suggests More Room to Run\nBigBear.ai Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$6.33-11.16% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 4 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $7.13 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $9.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $6.33 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $4.00 |\n|---|\nBigBear.ai Stock Forecast Details\nA closer look at the market data reveals signals that support a continued positive outlook for BigBear.ai.\nThe recent analyst action from H.C. Wainwright is a telling indicator. On July 1, the firm maintained its Buy rating and raised its price target from $6.00 to $9.00. This suggests that Wall Street is beginning to recognize the company’s strong execution and is revising its valuation models upward.\nBigBear.ai also has a very high short interest, with nearly 28% of its public shares being bet against by short-selling investors.\nUsually, a sign of negative sentiment, this can become a powerful positive catalyst for a stock backed by good news.\nIf the stock continues to rise, these short-sellers may be forced to buy back shares to limit their losses. This rush of buying, known as a short squeeze, can act like rocket fuel for the stock price.\nPutting Past Hurdles in the Rearview Mirror\nNo investment story is without its challenges. In March 2025, BigBear.ai disclosed the need for a financial restatement and identified a material weakness in its internal controls. These past events created the initial buying opportunity for investors who could see the company's long-term potential.\nToday, the market appears to be forward-looking. The powerful rally since those announcements suggests investor focus has shifted squarely to the company's future. The ongoing efforts to strengthen financial governance are now seen as a necessary and positive step for a maturing public company. With procedural deadlines in related lawsuits having passed in June, the market seems confident in the company's ability to navigate these historical hurdles. The narrative is no longer defined by past issues but by the strong operational engine driving the company forward.\nBigBear.ai Is an Underdog Finding Its Footing\nBigBear.ai's powerful rally is built on a solid foundation of tangible achievements. The company is successfully executing its growth strategy through international expansion, commercial innovation, and continued excellence in the defense sector.\nBy consistently delivering on its promises, BigBear.ai is demonstrating its ability to move beyond the shadow of past challenges. For investors looking to identify the next wave of high-growth AI stocks, the company presents a compelling story of an agile player hitting its stride. Backed by real-world contracts and a clear vision, BigBear.ai's growth journey appears to be just getting started.\nBefore you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.\nOur team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.\nThey believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...\nSee The Five Stocks Here\nNeed to stretch out your 401K or Roth IRA plan?

{"title": "Why Microsoft Keeps Showing Up in Congressional Portfolios", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-microsoft-keeps-showing-up-in-congressional-portfolios/", "text": "Whether you agree with the practice or not, Congressional leaders trade stocks. In fact, interest in what stocks members of Congress are trading is so high that MarketBeat provides investors with Congressional trading data as a free service.\nMicrosoft Today\n$501.48 -2.03 (-0.40%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $344.79\n▼\n$506.78 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.66%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 38.75\n- Price Target\n- $534.14\nOne thing that may surprise, and perhaps disappoint, investors is how predictable the list of most traded stocks is. It’s primarily a list of large-cap names. You’re not finding a lot of small-cap names or meme stocks. This isn’t a place where investors are going to find a hot penny stock.\nIn recent years, that’s meant a healthy dose of Magnificent Seven stocks. One name that stands out in the last 90 days is Microsoft Corp. NASDAQ: MSFT. Microsoft has been among the most frequently traded stocks by lawmakers over the past 90 days. In fact, MSFT stock has been bought six separate times since April. The buys have also been on both sides of the political spectrum, with the six buys being made by two Republican and two Democrat members.\nOnly NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA has more trades among the Mag 7. Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META was the subject of five different trades.\nThat might not sound like a stampede, but for congressional disclosures, it’s enough to raise eyebrows, and maybe prompt a little curiosity. So, what’s driving the renewed enthusiasm for this tech giant?\nReason #1: A Tech Behemoth Hiding in Plain Sight\nLet’s start with the obvious: Microsoft is a technology conglomerate. From Windows (hardware) to Azure (cloud computing), Office (software) to OpenAI partnerships (artificial intelligence), the company touches virtually every significant part of the technology sector. If you want to bet on the future of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and enterprise software all at once, owning Microsoft stock is like owning a technology-based ETF.\nHowever, whereas some may be concerned about buying a stock that’s a jack-of-all-trades, investors can see that Microsoft is near the top in virtually every sector in which it competes. The company plays to win, and shareholders are the beneficiaries.\nBut that’s true for any investor. What is it about Microsoft that could make it a favorite of Congressional leaders?\nReason #2: The AI Factor\nThe consistent performance of MSFT stock is on display as the AI trade heats up. While many investors are looking at unproven small-cap names, Microsoft is quietly up 17% in 2025. This reflects the company’s relationship with OpenAI, which turned ChatGPT into a household name and made both companies a lot of money.\nMicrosoft’s multi-billion-dollar stake in OpenAI has allowed it to bring ChatGPT features into Bing, Office, and other flagship products. The relationship between the two companies is showing signs of strain, but as is usually the case in these situations, money talks. However, billions of dollars are at risk on both sides, which will probably be an incentive for the two companies to maintain a fragile alliance.\nHere is where the congressional buying has more interest. Lawmakers are watching AI reshape our economy, so investors should note that MSFT stock draws significant interest when these leaders want exposure to this megatrend.\nMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT) Price Chart for Thursday, July, 10, 2025\nReason #3: The Defense and Cloud Connection\nAnother angle with government ties is Microsoft’s deep ties to government contracts. From the Pentagon’s cloud infrastructure awards to state and local cybersecurity modernization efforts, the company has significant ties to the public sector.\nIt’s purely speculative whether that familiarity influences stock purchases, but the company’s government business is robust. Many lawmakers have access to which companies will be awarded bids.\nReason #4: A Dash of FOMO\nFinally, there’s the classic investing motivator: fear of missing out. With the stock setting fresh all-time highs and Wedbush analyst Dan Ives forecasting a $5 trillion market cap for the company, some lawmakers may simply be jumping on the momentum train.\nMicrosoft’s steady growth and fortress balance sheet can look especially appealing for any investor looking for exposure to technology stocks. Plus, it’s a stock that is above reproach and doesn’t create the drama found in more volatile names.\nBefore you consider Microsoft, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

The firm just announced innovations that have Wall Street analysts swooning. Robinhood has been one of the hottest stocks in the market recently.\nAs of the July 7 close, shares of the finance company were up 312% over the past 52 weeks. The company’s expanded product offerings and crypto trading demand have been key to its success.\nHowever, the company is far from done adding new features and growing its presence in different markets. That’s a big reason why Robinhood received five Wall Street price target upgrades in July. These aren’t just any upgrades, either.\nSeveral analysts increased their price targets massively, with one boosting its target by 100%. So, what is causing these analysts to become so much more bullish on Robinhood? Just how much upside do they see? Let’s dive in below.\nHOOD Fast-Tracks EU Trading With Tokenization, Expands Opportunities\nThe increases in Robinhood’s price targets come after the company’s “To Catch a Token” event on June 30. During the event, the company unveiled new features, the most notable of which was the introduction of tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs for Robinhood’s users in the European Union.\nThis is big for expanding the company’s international footprint. Before this release, EU users could only trade crypto on Robinhood. The tokenization route allows Robinhood to bypass the regulatory requirements for users to buy U.S. stocks.\nThe release greatly accelerates Robinhood’s timeline for gaining traction in the EU equity trading market and creates a new revenue stream.\nIt starts with 200 of the most well-known U.S. stocks and ETFs, but the company plans to expand this into thousands by the end of the year.\nThe company’s new blockchain, Robinhood Chain, makes this possible. Robinhood Chain will expand to allow investors to trade many other types of assets. This includes real estate, art, and even the stock of private companies. Robinhood announced that EU customers could access private stock tokens of OpenAI and SpaceX.\nExpansion into these assets is another way Robinhood can grow its customer base, attracting more assets and revenues. Notably, these tokenized offerings are not available to U.S. users.\nThe company also announced that crypto trading is now available in 31 European countries, greatly expanding access and further broadening its market opportunities.\nRecent Updates Flip Robinhood’s Outlook from Downside to Upside\nThe MarketBeat consensus price target on Robinhood is just under $73. This implies a downside of over 22% from the stock’s July 7 closing price. However, the five price targets updated by the To Catch a Token event flip the script. Their average comes in at nearly $103, which signals that shares could rise by 10%, greatly altering the outlook on the stock.\nOverall, the average price target among these five analysts' upgrades increased by 28%, signaling the event greatly impacted their perceptions of Robinhood. Notably, Citigroup boosted its target from $50 to $100.\nWith Aggression Comes Risk, But Robinhood’s Innovation Is Undeniable\nRobinhood Markets Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$76.06-22.94% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 19 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $98.70 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $110.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $76.06 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $32.00 |\n|---|\nRobinhood Markets Stock Forecast Details\nOne risk for Robinhood is the potential that the company is moving too fast. The firm has rolled out update after update, strengthening its ability to keep and attract assets. This is an exciting strategy, but it could backfire if the company does not execute its rollouts to a tee. One of the key reasons the Robinhood platform attracts customers is the top-notch user experience it offers. Maintaining this is paramount to keeping and growing its customer base.\nThe company seems to have also stepped into a legal gray area with its private stock tokens. Investors do not actually own shares in these companies, and OpenAI has said the company does not endorse the Robinhood product. The Bank of Lithuania is seeking clarification from Robinhood to assess the legality of the instruments.\nRobinhood will need to avoid legal trouble as it expands its offerings to avoid damaging the trust it has built with users.\nStill, Robinhood continues to demonstrate a level of innovation and product expansion within the investment industry that no other firm is matching. This positions the firm to outcompete others going forward and grow faster than its industry if it can avoid the potential pitfalls of its aggressive strategy. This can allow the stock to continue winning.\nBefore you consider Robinhood Markets, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Zscaler or CrowdStrike: Which Is the Better Buy in 2025?", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/zscaler-or-crowdstrike-which-is-the-better-buy-in-2025/", "text": "Zscaler NASDAQ: ZS and CrowdStrike NASDAQ: CRWD are both buyable stocks supported by robust trends promising to drive a solid double-digit revenue CAGR for years. They both grow at an above-industry pace and are well-positioned in an industry projected to grow slower than the pace of threats it intends to prevent.\nCybersecurity growth is forecasted to have a 9% CAGR, compared to the 15% CAGR driven by cyber threats. The problem is that one of these markets is already pricing much of the growth. The takeaway is that both are well-supported and have a long runway for success, but one is a better buy in 2025 due to market dynamics.\nWhere one stock is moving up from its low, on track to retest its long-term highs, and driven by analyst trends, the other is already well above the comparable highs and extended, with analysts trimming their sentiment. The better buy is Zscaler, with potential for a double-digit increase this year and next, while the poorer is CrowdStrike, set up to pull back and offer a more attractive entry later this year.\nAnalysts Shift Saps Enthusiasm for CrowdStrike\nCrowdStrike Today\n$487.11 -26.40 (-5.14%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $200.81\n▼\n$517.98 - Price Target\n- $456.29\nTo be fair, CrowdStrike’s headwind is minimal, but it is a factor that investors and traders should take note of.\nAs of early July, the analysts' trends are bullish but reflect a more cautious tone than last year.\nThere are an increasing number of Sell and Hold ratings, a declining number of Buys, and a 10% downside at the consensus.\nThe June activity includes two downgrades from Outperform/Overweight levels to Hold/Neutral equivalents, and more are expected.\nCrowdStrike is a solid growth company, but it is highly valued at over 55x the 2030 EPS outlook.\nZscaler’s analyst trends are far more robust and capable of driving its share price even higher. The June and early July activity includes numerous price target increases, upgrades, and no reductions. The net result is increased coverage, a firmer Moderate Buy rating, and 5% increase in the consensus price target.\nThe consensus lags behind the price action in early July, but by a narrower 5% margin, and is rising, providing support for the market. The range of June/July targets positions Zscaler stock well above the broad consensus and near the high end of $385, a new all-time high when reached.\nZscaler Chart Screams Buy Me! CrowdStrike Urges Caution\nZscaler Today\n$296.18 -20.32 (-6.42%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $153.45\n▼\n$318.46 - Price Target\n- $296.82\nCrowdStrike’s chart action isn’t overtly bearish but offers risk to new investors. The market is trading at an all-time high with diminishing analyst support and indications that it is overbought. The caveat is that institutional support remains solid, with them buying on balance in Q1 and Q2.\nThe likely outcome is that a price pullback will catalyze a buying opportunity, and the price action will not correct significantly. The risk for investors is that CRWD shares will enter a protracted consolidation and trading range that could last until earnings catch up with the valuation or the outlook is improved.\nZscaler's price action, on the other hand, is overtly bullish. The market for this stock rallied strongly in Q2 and is waving a bull flag in early Q3. The Bull Flag is a continuation pattern signaling that the rally is, at best, half over. In this scenario, the market for Zscaler stock can advance by another $150 and easily surpass the analyst's highest target.\nThe catalyst for Zscaler’s new highs will likely be its Q4 earnings report.\nThe company issued favorable guidance at the end of Q3 and showed signs of growing momentum, suggesting that outperformance is possible. Those include the calculated billings and deferred revenue, which grew faster than reported revenue, the increased client count, and strength in AI-focused security.\nBefore you consider Zscaler, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

Valued at less than $15 billion in 2025, it is expected to grow robustly over the next decade. Estimates vary but indicate that agentic AI spending will increase at a high compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40% to 50% through this decade and possibly beyond.\nAssuming this pace is correct, the consensus for SoundHound AI’s long-term revenue growth is too low. Investors can expect a persistent upgrade cycle to unfold, providing a price lift over the next few years.\nSoundHound AI Hyper Growth Accelerates\nSoundHound AI has numerous growth levers, including increasing use by existing clients, client acquisitions, and expansion into new verticals. The combination is resulting in hyper-growth and acceleration, with growth topping 150% in FQ1. The consensus forecast reported by MarketBeat is for Q2 growth to remain strong but slow to around 145%, which is unlikely given the trends. The more likely result is that Q2 will top the consensus estimates and provide another positive catalyst for the market.\nTwo recent acquisitions provide reasons to believe the Q2 results will be better than consensus forecasts. They highlight the company’s strategy to embed its voice-activated AI services into businesses and industries globally. Amelia strengthened SoundHound’s enterprise-level presence globally, while Allset bolsters restaurant offerings with its restaurant ordering platform. The takeaway is that the company is not only expanding its reach but also increasing its upsell and cross-selling opportunities quarterly, thereby improving its leverage for long-term growth.\nThe Sell-Side Tailwind Is Strengthening in 2025\nSoundHound AI Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$10.50-14.56% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 8 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $12.29 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $18.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $10.50 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $7.00 |\n|---|\nSoundHound AI Stock Forecast Details\nSell-side interest, including institutions and analysts, remains relatively light for SoundHound but is strengthening in 2025. Analysts have trimmed targets from lofty levels earlier in the year, which has impacted the first-half price action, but remain otherwise bullish. The data reveals increasing coverage, firming sentiment, a Moderate Buy rating, and expectation for prices to range near $15. Regarding the institutions, they own only 20% of the stock but have been buying aggressively in 2025. The data reported by MarketBeat shows institutions buying at a pace of 10-to-1 relative to sellers.\nThe risk for investors is dilution.

As it stands, the share count at the end of Q1 was up an average of 44.5% compared to the prior year.\nThe early July price action in SoundHound stock is favorable. The market appears to have reached a bottom near critical support levels and is undergoing a complete reversal. The July price surge took the market to a fresh high, clearing a key hurdle that sets it up to trend higher as the year progresses. The risk for traders is that resistance points near $14.25, $15.75, and $18 could lead to volatility, consolidations, and price corrections.\nBefore you consider SoundHound AI, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Yield Generators: 3 Stocks Enhancing Shareholder Value", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/yield-generators-3-stocks-enhancing-shareholder-value/", "text": "Several stocks recently unveiled plans to significantly enhance shareholder value. These plans include the two major types of capital returns that investors often pay attention to: dividends and buybacks. Dividends mean direct cash going into investors' pockets, while buybacks help raise earnings per share, potentially leading to stock appreciation.\nHowever, another less-discussed form of yield comes from debt paydown. When companies pay down a large debt, it lowers their riskiness. Based on financial modeling, less risk often increases the value of a company’s stock. Let’s dive into these three companies that have outlined intentions to provide yield to investors.\nTHO: RV Leader Points to Undervaluation in Its Shares\nThor Industries Today\nTHOThor Industries\n$94.62 +1.47 (+1.58%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $63.16\n▼\n$118.85 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.11%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 22.69\n- Price Target\n- $87.63\nTHOR Industries NYSE: THO has announced a significant new buyback program worth $400 million. THOR is the world’s largest manufacturer of recreational vehicles (RVs), owning dozens of brands including Airstream and Jayco. This buyback program is large, equal to approximately 8.1% of the firm’s market capitalization. Based on current prices, this figure is equal to the buyback yield the firm could offer investors.\nUnlike many buyback announcements, THOR explicitly states that it sees its shares as undervalued. The company noted that from June 6 to June 23, it repurchased over 340,000 shares of THO. Based on June 6 prices, that equates to over $29 million in buyback spending. The company said it will \"continue to be buyers of our stock as long as its price is disconnected from our long-term value proposition.\"\nShares have increased by only about 8% since June 6, suggesting the company likely sees its stock as undervalued. Therefore, it will probably continue to buy shares back. Notably, the buyback authorization ends on July 31, 2027, suggesting the company could use its entire capacity in just over two years. The company also has a dividend yield of 2.2%, adding to its yield generation thesis.\nFICO: Credit Score Dominator Announces $1 Billion Buyback Program\nFair Isaac Today\n$1,586.55 -5.18 (-0.33%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $1,484.29\n▼\n$2,402.52 - P/E Ratio\n- 68.33\n- Price Target\n- $2,283.54\nOn June 19, Fair Isaac NYSE: FICO announced the approval of its new share buyback program. It allows the company to repurchase up to $1 billion worth of stock. Fair Isaac is the creator of the FICO credit score. It holds a powerful market position as the FICO score is the de facto point of reference for many lenders when evaluating a borrower.\nThis is a moderately sized buyback program for the approximately $45 billion company, equating to around 2.2% of its market capitalization. Fair Isaac has spent an average of $189 million on buybacks per quarter over the past three years. However, it has significantly stepped up its spending over the last 12 months, spending nearly $300 million per quarter.\nThis trend and the new buyback announcement suggest the company may see its shares as undervalued. As of the July 3 close, the stock is trading around 21% below its all-time high closing price reached in November 2024. Wall Street analysts seemingly support the notion that Fair Isaac looks undervalued. The MarketBeat consensus price target on the stock is $2,304, implying upside of over 24%.\nDAN Looks Poised to Deliver a Yield Triple-Whammy\nDana Today\n$17.26 +0.08 (+0.45%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $7.58\n▼\n$18.05 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.32%\n- Price Target\n- $20.43\nLast up is Dana NYSE: DAN. The company makes a variety of automotive parts, including axles, driveshafts, and transmissions. Recently, the company outlined plans to massively reduce its debt and return capital through dividends and buybacks. This comes as the firm will sell its off-highway business to Allison Transmission NYSE: ALSN, generating net proceeds of $2.4 billion. The company plans to use these funds to pay down $2 billion worth of debt.\nFor a company with a market cap of only $2.6 billion, this is a huge amount of debt to pay down. It would result in a debt paydown yield of 77%. Note that this doesn’t mean shares will rise 77% or close to that. However, this paydown makes the firm much less risky and puts it in a better financial position. This could help raise the company’s valuation as it pays down this debt over time. Additionally, the company plans to spend a combined $1 billion on dividends and buybacks through 2027. That is equal to over 38% of the company’s market cap. The stock’s current dividend yield is 2.2%.\nOverall, it is important to understand that yield to shareholders can take many different forms. Dana stands out due to its intention to robustly utilize all three pathways to generate value for shareholders.\nBefore you consider Thor Industries, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

The opportunity is now highlighted by the initial analysts' forecasts, which amount to a solid Buy rating.\nMarketBeat.com tracked more than a dozen reports in the first wave of coverage, with roughly 70% of them indicating a Buy equivalent or better, providing a bullish bias to the outlook.\nThe bullish bias is compounded by the price target range, which runs from $33 to $40, and the range of analysts covering the stock, which reads like a who’s who of major financial institutions.\nThe $33 low-end is critical because it implies the post-IPO sell-off was overdone, and a value is present in early July. The consensus of $37.45 is also critical, as it is well above the midpoint of the range, leading the market into the high-end range.\nWhat is Chime Financial? It is a cloud-native, mobile-first fintech platform offering no-fee banking and checking services. It aims to revolutionize and democratize consumer banking, providing easy-to-use, no-fee services, including traditional deposit accounts and credit-building tools.\nThe company generates revenue via fees associated with its branded cards and is making money today. The platform leverages partnerships with national banks and is geared to scale. Regarding geopolitical and trade-related issues, its U.S.-only business model well insulated it from these issues.\nChime Financial’s Robust Outlook Supports Today’s High Value\nChime Financial Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$37.8322.80% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 14 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $30.81 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $42.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $37.83 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $33.00 |\n|---|\nChime Financial Stock Forecast Details\nChime Financial is not a cheap stock, trading at roughly 150 times its 2025 earnings outlook. However, the critical takeaways are that it will achieve an adjusted profit in 2025, and the forecasts for top and bottom-line growth are robust. Analysts forecast revenue growth in the 20% range for this fiscal year and next, with acceleration as growth efforts and brand recognition gain traction. Top-line growth is predicted to accelerate to over 50% by the decade’s end, and the earnings forecasts are more robust.\nChime Financial is forecast to widen its margin substantially as revenue grows. Earnings are predicted to advance more than 160% in 2026 and then sustain a high-double-digit CAGR near 90% through 2030. That puts the valuation closer to 12x, suggesting a substantial upside is possible for this cash-flow generating machine.\nThere is a risk of dilution, but it is currently minimal. The company raised more than $850 million with its IPO, exceeding the expected range, and is well-capitalized. At worst, investors may expect to see share-based compensation increase the floating count incrementally over time. The offset is that profitability and robust cash flow suggest capital return, including share buybacks, are also in this company’s future.\nChime Financial Is Set to Rebound, Could Exceed Analysts' High Target\nChime Financial’s stock isn’t all that bullish at first glance, with the initial movement a 35% contraction from the opening day high to the low on June 23. However, the takeaway is very bullish because the initial trade was 60% above the IPO target price, the first day’s close was still 37% above the IPO target price, and the low on June 23 is still above the IPO target price.\nThis shows that the market is eager to buy, and the price action since late June affirms it. The market appears to have found a bottom above the critical $27 target level, with potential to move higher, as highlighted by analysts.\nThe critical resistance point is the low end of the analyst's target range. It could cap gains in the near term, but given the outlook and sentiment, it is unlikely to do so. The more likely scenario is that this market will move into the analysts’ range before the end of July and then quickly advance toward the consensus target, with potential price hiccups in the $35 to $36 range.\nBefore you consider Chime Financial, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Palantir’s Revenue Surge to $1B: Growth vs. Valuation", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/palantirs-revenue-surge-to-1b-growth-vs-valuation/", "text": "Palantir Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: PLTR continues to deliver market-beating performance. PLTR stock is up more than 83% year-to-date, and there are several reasons for investor enthusiasm.\nPalantir Technologies Today\nPLTRPalantir Technologies\n$142.50 -0.63 (-0.44%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $21.23\n▼\n$148.22 - P/E Ratio\n- 619.57\n- Price Target\n- $89.32\n- Since most of the company’s costs are relatively fixed, a significant amount of this increased revenue flows to its bottom line.\n- Plus, the company was elevated to the NASDAQ 100, which continues to generate interest from institutional investors.\nValuation remains a major concern for investors. Currently, Palantir has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio just below 600x, with a forward P/E around 488x. The market assigns a premium to technology stocks. However, by most standard measures, PLTR stock is priced for expectations of long-term hypergrowth.\nYet for all the concerns about Palantir’s valuation, the company is approaching the significant milestone of generating $1 billion in revenue in a quarter. If current growth trends hold, the company could hit that milestone in the third quarter of 2025..\nBy itself, that achievement wouldn’t justify the company’s premium valuation. But it would add fuel to the bullish argument that Palantir has the means to grow into its valuation.\nHere’s Why $1 Billion in Revenue Is Achievable\nIn the first quarter of 2025, Palantir reported global revenue of $883.86 million. That's up from the $827.52 it reported in the fourth quarter of 2024. In percentage terms, that’s an increase of 6.8%. The percentage gain was lower than the 14% gain made between the third and fourth quarters of 2024. However, it was in line with previous quarters, so let’s use that as a guide.\nIf the company notches a 6.8% gain in revenue when it reports earnings in August, it will post approximately $943.78 million. That puts it on pace to hit the $1 billion mark in revenue in the third quarter.\nTo be fair, that’s above the company’s own forecast of between $934 million and $938 million. Even if we use the low end of that guidance, at a growth rate of around 7%, the company could still reach $1 billion in revenue by the end of the year.\nHigher Revenue Puts a Spotlight on the Company’s Operating Leverage\nPalantir Technologies Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$89.32-37.32% DownsideReduceBased on 23 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $142.50 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $155.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $89.32 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $18.00 |\n|---|\nPalantir Technologies Stock Forecast Details\nPalantir’s business model is highly scalable. The company’s gross margins consistently approach 80%. That means incremental revenue generates disproportionately higher profits.\nAt this scale, operating leverage becomes a significant force. Palantir’s adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 44% and its net income margin was 26%. It’s reasonable to assume that both percentages would increase. But even if they don’t, $1 billion in revenue would mean approximately $260 million in GAAP net income per quarter.\nThat's nearly 30% higher than the $203 million it generated in the first quarter.\nBased on those numbers, it’s reasonable to project growth in GAAP EPS from around 8 cents in the last quarter to somewhere around 12 cents, which would put annual GAAP EPS at around 47 cents per share. Palantir would also see its free cash flow grow to around $380 million per quarter.\nWould $1 Billion in Revenue Move PLTR Stock?\nWhile achieving $1 billion in quarterly revenue would undoubtedly be a significant achievement, it won’t do much to address the stock’s valuation concerns. At its current price above $138, Palantir’s market capitalization exceeds $300 billion. On a GAAP basis, the company trades at over 400 times forward earnings, reflecting how much optimism is already priced in.\nEven on an adjusted basis, excluding stock-based compensation, Palantir’s forward P/E remains in the range of 150–200x earnings. That's a premium reserved for only the fastest-growing software and AI companies. Investors can make the case that Palantir is one of those companies.\nInvestors will want to see if Palantir can continue executing on those expectations and demonstrate that $1 billion quarters are not a one-time spike. Doing so would further validate the company’s long-term strategy and may attract even more institutional ownership.\nBefore you consider Palantir Technologies, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

For this reason, diversifying into international growth stories can be a great strategy moving forward.\nAlibaba Group Today\n$106.61 +2.78 (+2.68%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $73.87\n▼\n$148.43 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.89%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 14.31\n- Price Target\n- $154.13\nIn China, the world’s second-largest economy carrying one of the fastest growing middle classes, there are plenty of blue-chip stocks in the technology sector that can overlay a promise of aggressive expansion and growth for investors to consider, as long as they are bold enough to look into the nation’s growth factors as well as the specific companies at hand.\nAmong the group, there is one stock that stands out in terms of upside potential and rapid market share growth, and that name is Alibaba Group NYSE: BABA. This company is mainly known for its e-commerce capabilities across the globe. Whether this is done on purpose or not, its exciting cloud computing and data center business is often kept on the back burner, despite its future potential for outsized growth and wealth-compounding effects on the stock price.\nGetting Rich Quietly in Alibaba\nThis stock might not be as exciting a story as some of the other names in technology have been and continue to be, and some investors prefer it that way. As long as patience prevails and a multi-year time horizon is kept in mind, there will likely be plenty of winners who chose to invest in Alibaba stock early enough.\nWhile Alibaba's e-commerce business continues to grow fast enough to propel the company forward and increase its valuation, other (newer) developments aren't getting the attention they need. Alibaba's cloud computing demand has grown so large that it is now in a position to seize a decade-long opportunity.\nSome may compare Alibaba to how Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN operates in the United States, and they would be right to do so, especially in the ways that Amazon Web Services (AWS) monetizes business and user data in order to provide industry-leading solutions across the board.\nBy opening new data centers across Southeast Asia, in countries like Malaysia and the Philippines, Alibaba is now not only positioned to support the economic and technological growth of some of the world's fastest-growing economies but also to meet the data and development needs of businesses emerging in these nations. Saying that this will be a major growth engine for Alibaba is an understatement, and the gap between today's stock price and tomorrow's valuation offers an opportunity most investors won't want to miss.\nAlibaba’s Drivers: Upside Gaps Unfilled\nAlibaba stock has now traded in a tight channel for the past couple of years. Ever since the low-interest rate cycle created by the COVID-19 pandemic, this growth story in China has cooled off, and the broader theme has sent Alibaba's stock price down to less than 75% of its 52-week high.\nMore importantly, today’s price is still under a third of the company’s all-time high of just over $315 per share, making today’s valuation seem less rooted in reality than the numbers suggest. And when it comes to numbers, investors need to keep in mind that Alibaba has been steadily growing its underlying financials despite the stock price remaining relatively unchanged during this period.\nAlibaba Group Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$154.1344.58% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 16 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $106.61 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $180.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $154.13 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $100.00 |\n|---|\nAlibaba Group Stock Forecast Details\nHowever, with this new development in place of expansion, there are some in the market deciding that enough is enough, and have started taking advantage of this discounted opportunity today. As of mid-May 2025, institutional buyers from UBS Asset Management decided to expand their Alibaba stock holdings by as much as 85.6%, an unusual move by these big players.\nFollowing the new allocation, the group now holds up to $1.1 billion worth of Alibaba stock in its balance sheet, a position likely rooted in a multi-year thesis that expects the company’s market share and financial performance to continue delivering on the upside promises it has kept over the years.\nMore than recent institutional buying, other Wall Street participants have expressed (and kept) their bullish outlooks on Alibaba’s future. Fawne Jiang, an analyst at Loop Capital, set a $176 per share valuation on Alibaba stock as of mid-May 2025 and has not changed it since, typically a sign of high conviction when it comes to the cadence of target adjustments by analysts.\nFrom the current trading price, this view suggests up to a 62% upside for investors to consider, but that’s not the best part of this opportunity. Even though this valuation targets a near doubling in the stock, it is still a fraction of where Alibaba once traded, leaving a significant gap to be filled in the coming years, which will be enjoyed by those patient enough to stick with this growth story.\nBefore you consider Alibaba Group, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "EV Tax Credits Are Ending—Here’s Why These 2 Stocks Could Soar", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/ev-tax-credits-are-ending-heres-why-these-2-stocks-could-soar/", "text": "Understanding the electric vehicle market has become increasingly important over the past several years as EV sales have really started to explode.\nLooking forward, EVs are likely to become a larger part of the overall economy, presenting a significant opportunity for investors. The International Energy Agency reported that in 2024, 20% of new cars sold were electric vehicles. They expect this number to grow to 40% by 2030, positioning EVs as a clear growth market. However, the path to this is not likely to be a straight one, especially as government attitudes toward EVs shift.\nTake the passing of President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” for example. It means that the significant tax breaks that come from buying EVs in the United States will expire in September, which will weigh on adoption. Despite this, analysts expect the EV market to grow.\nVinFast Auto NASDAQ: VFS and Lucid Group NASDAQ: LCID stand out as two electric vehicle stocks with high upside potential, positioned to benefit from shifting market dynamics and evolving U.S. policies.\nBig Beautiful Bill Increases VinFast’s Chances of U.S. Success\nVinFast Auto Today\nVFSVinFast Auto\n$3.53 +0.03 (+0.86%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- Price Target\n- $5.75\nVinFast makes and sells relatively low-cost EVs primarily in Vietnam. The MarketBeat consensus price target on the company is $5.75, implying that shares could rise by nearly 64%.\nEnding the EV tax credit actually helps VinFast. Its vehicles were not eligible to receive it before, putting it at a disadvantage in the U.S. market. Now, the playing field will become more level as domestic companies will no longer receive the credit either.\nVinFast's sales in the United States are very limited, comprising only 6.2% of total revenues in 2024. Thus, the United States represents a significant growth opportunity for VinFast that just became easier to capitalize on. However, the company must deal with 25% automotive tariffs, which hurt its competitiveness in the United States.\nStill, Vinfast clearly doesn’t need the United States to grow fast. EV deliveries spiked 296% last quarter, while E-scooter deliveries rose 473%. The company is still deeply unprofitable, with a gross margin of negative 35%. However, this figure is a big improvement over its negative 59% gross margin a year ago. VinFast will need to continue making progress here by accelerating production and deliveries to achieve greater economies of scale. The recent opening of the company’s second factory should aid this. The company also just signed with its first authorized dealership in California as it looks to expand its U.S. presence.\nRecent Price Targets Indicate +40% Upside in Lucid\nLucid Group Today\n$2.33 +0.05 (+2.19%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- Price Target\n- $2.68\nThe MarketBeat consensus price target on Lucid is $2.68, implying a solid but not huge 27% upside in shares. However, focusing on the stock’s two most recent price target updates paints a considerably more bullish picture. Both come in at $3, which implies 42% upside in shares.\nIn contrast to VinFast, most of the company’s revenue comes from the United States, accounting for around 73% of its total sales in 2024. The rest of the company’s sales primarily come from Saudi Arabia. The company will no longer be able to benefit from tax credits post-September, but some believe that this will actually help Lucid.\nThat includes James Picariello of BNP Paribas. He believes that the sunsetting of the credit means that Lucid will face less EV competition. This is because companies that make both EVs and gas-powered vehicles may “deemphasize” their EV ambitions in the United States as government incentives go away. This is plausible, but it is also important to note that companies like Ford Motor NYSE: F have invested billions in their EV efforts. Given the long-term growth many see in this market, they are not likely to simply hand over this growth to EV pure plays.\nIn Q2, Lucid’s vehicle deliveries hit 3,309, rising by 38% compared to the same period a year ago. Like many early-stage EV makers, Lucid remains highly unprofitable.

{"title": "Amazon's Prime Day Pullback Meets Bullish Golden Cross Signal", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/amazons-prime-day-pullback-meets-bullish-golden-cross-signal/", "text": "Every company has its own set of key performance indicators (KPIs), especially those in the United States' technology sector. However, there is typically one major indicator of future momentum and financial success that can be found within the largest companies in the market, and Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN is one of them, with a market capitalization of $2.3 trillion today.\nAmazon.com Today\n$222.26 -0.28 (-0.13%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $151.61\n▼\n$242.52 - P/E Ratio\n- 36.20\n- Price Target\n- $248.24\nPrime Day is a widely celebrated discount day among Amazon users, as it typically brings about discount windows that significantly boost the platform’s revenue and volume, not to mention brand awareness worldwide. With this in mind, investors can begin to connect the recent results emerging from Prime Day and the underlying price action in Amazon stock, as a deeper story is unfolding there.\nOn a technical and valuation basis, Amazon is poised to continue pushing for higher prices and offer investors additional upside potential down the line.\nHowever, concerns are brewing as the ongoing tariff negotiations diminish the excitement and certainty that the company will be able to sustain this current momentum, a fear that is becoming more than just a thought with the recent Prime Day reaction.\nA Different Prime Day This Time Around\nShares of Amazon were down by roughly 1.3% on one of the most anticipated days of the year, as reports indicate that Prime Day sales were down as much as 14% compared to last year's during the event's early hours.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Price Chart for Thursday, July, 10, 2025\nWhile plenty of time remains to judge whether orders will come in during the rest of the week, most of the indication for the discount window and its performance is typically driven by the early hours of the launch. This contraction in order volume does not give markets a great deal of confidence that things will turn around.\nHowever, bearish this may seem, it isn’t a huge reason for investors to remain concerned about the future of Amazon stock or the company itself. The comforting factor is that there isn’t necessarily something wrong with Amazon’s platform itself, but rather the prices in the overall industry, which are elevated due to ongoing tariff negotiations.\nBecause prices are now up for items and their shipping, especially those exposed to tariff rates, Amazon didn’t deliver on the usual discounts that users had come to expect, a reasonable explanation for sales being down 14% over the year. Recognizing that this is an industry-wide rather than a company-specific issue can lay the foundation for a recovery.\nIn fact, markets must have been aware of this going into Prime Day, as tariffs have been in place for a long time prior to the event, which is why the technical setup in Amazon today becomes much more critical.\nAmazon Stock Just Shaped a Golden Cross\nIn the world of technical analysis, a golden cross event is one of the best indicators to look for in a stock in order to judge its future momentum. This event signifies that a short-term moving average, in this case the 20-day moving average, has crossed above a longer-term moving average, such as the 50-day moving average in this instance.\nAmazon.com Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$248.3111.72% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 48 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $222.26 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $305.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $248.31 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $186.00 |\n|---|\nAmazon.com Stock Forecast Details\nWhenever this happens, and at an accelerating rate as it is today, the regime overhauling the stock is likely to be bullish for the coming weeks and months. Fundamentally, this momentum indicator suggests whether the market is looking to take the stock higher or lower in the near term.\nConsidering this, investors can see that pricing in a potentially disappointing Prime Day did not slow down Amazon's stock. Now trading at 91% of its 52-week high, it’s likely that this golden cross will push prices back to previous highs and attempt to surpass them.\nKnowing how important momentum is to a stock and that this short-term decline due to Prime Day doesn't indicate any future problems, some on Wall Street decided to take advantage of this gap to be filled higher. Youssef Squali, an analyst from Truist Financial, is one of these optimists as he reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon stock with a $250 per share valuation.\nThis view would not only mean that Amazon can make a new 52-week high before the year is over, but also that investors are staring down a potential upside run of up to 14% from where the stock trades today. Even the bears understand how significant momentum is and how unlikely it is for Amazon to stop anytime soon.\nOver the past quarter, the short interest balance for Amazon stock declined from $18 billion in the first quarter of 2025 to only $13 billion in the current quarter. This is a sign of bearish capitulation even in a world of tariff and price uncertainty, giving bullish investors another pillar of strength to lean on in the coming weeks and months.\nBefore you consider Amazon.com, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Is Fortinet Ready to Break Out After Months of Consolidation?", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/is-fortinet-ready-to-break-out-after-months-of-consolidation/", "text": "Fortinet Today\n$100.20 -7.45 (-6.92%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $54.57\n▼\n$114.82 - P/E Ratio\n- 41.23\n- Price Target\n- $105.62\nOver the past few months, market momentum has surged, with several sectors outperforming the broader market. While financials, technology, and even utilities have all shown strength, the cybersecurity industry remains a consistent outperformer. Many leading stocks in the space are hovering near all-time highs.\nHowever, not all cybersecurity names have moved in lockstep. While CrowdStrike NASDAQ: CRWD, Zscaler NASDAQ: ZS, and the Amplify Cybersecurity ETF NYSEARCA: HACK have rallied sharply, up 47%, 74%, and 16% year-to-date, respectively, Fortinet NASDAQ: FTNT has taken a more gradual approach. Still, the technical picture suggests that it could soon change.\nA Bullish Setup Taking Shape for FTNT\nUnlike its faster-moving peers, FTNT has spent the last several months consolidating in a tight range. But that range is forming a bullish technical base. The stock has held firmly above all key moving averages, with $100 acting as significant support and $105 as a consistent ceiling of resistance.\nNow, FTNT is beginning to challenge that $105 level again, hinting at a potential breakout.\nIf buyers can sustain price action above that resistance level on substantial volume, it could spark a wave of momentum buying and signal a trend reversal in relative performance.\nWhile FTNT has lagged so far in 2025, up just 12.88% year-to-date compared to much larger moves from peers and the HACK industry ETF, that underperformance may actually make it a compelling catch-up play within the cybersecurity group.\nValuation and Fundamentals: A More Reasonable Growth Bet\nFTNT may not deliver the same hyper-growth as some of its sector counterparts, but it offers a more grounded valuation. Following its Q1 2025 earnings, Fortinet reported EPS of $0.58, beating estimates by $0.05. Revenue grew 13.8% year-over-year to $1.54 billion, narrowly missing consensus forecasts.\nWhile the top-line miss raised some eyebrows, the steady growth and bottom-line beat helped reinforce confidence.\nThe stock's valuation is more reasonable than that of high-flying names like CRWD or ZS, potentially making it more appealing to investors seeking cybersecurity exposure without the premium price tag. FTNT currently has a P/E ratio of 43.9 and a forward P/E ratio of 38.43, both of which are significantly lower than the earnings valuation metrics of CRWD and ZS.\nFortinet will report Q2 earnings on August 5, and a strong showing could catalyze a sustained breakout above $105.\nInstitutions Lean in, But Analysts Stay Cautious\nFortinet Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$105.625.41% UpsideHoldBased on 34 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $100.20 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $135.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $105.62 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $78.00 |\n|---|\nFortinet Stock Forecast Details\nInstitutional sentiment has been broadly positive. Over the past 12 months, FTNT has seen $8.2 billion in inflows, compared to $5.3 billion in outflows, reflecting growing interest.\nInstitutional ownership stands at a high 83.7%, and the stock’s inclusion in the S&P 500 index reinforces its stability and long-term relevance in the space.\nAnalyst sentiment, however, is more reserved. Based on 34 ratings, FTNT has a Hold consensus rating and an average price target of $105.62, roughly in line with current levels.\nThis suggests the Street may be waiting for a catalyst, such as a breakout or an earnings surprise, before shifting to a more bullish stance.\nQuiet Strength Before a Breakout?\nWhile Fortinet hasn’t been the star of the cybersecurity show this year, the stock’s bullish consolidation, strong institutional backing, and solid fundamentals suggest it’s worth watching closely. If the stock can firmly clear the $105 level, it may finally begin to play catch-up with its peers.\nFor investors seeking a high-quality cybersecurity name with a more reasonable valuation and a constructive chart, FTNT could be setting up for its moment.\nBefore you consider Fortinet, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Fortinet wasn't on the list.\nWhile Fortinet currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nThinking about investing in Meta, Roblox, or Unity?

{"title": "3 Upgraded Stocks to Load Up on Before Earnings", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-upgraded-stocks-to-load-up-on-before-earnings/", "text": "MarketBeat’s screen for Most Upgraded Stocks is a never-ending source of good ideas. Stocks on the list today are receiving upgrades due to their results, turnaround efforts, and outlooks, which include growth, profits, and capital returns.\nThe only questions that need to be answered are which ones fit the portfolio, and how high their share prices may go.\nMeta Platforms' Superintelligent Strategy\nMeta Platforms Today\n$727.24 -5.54 (-0.76%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $442.65\n▼\n$747.90 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.29%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 28.36\n- Price Target\n- $727.95\nMeta Platforms' NASDAQ: META success story continues to unfold, now featuring a robust push into AI. Already using AI to drive revenue growth and internal efficiency, the company created a “superintelligence” division and is poaching staff from companies like Apple and OpenAI to run it.\nThe goal is to develop cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology, encompassing models, software applications, and hardware. Regarding the analysts, they are raising their price targets and sentiment ratings because of it, setting the market up for new highs.\nMeta is the second-most upgraded stock at the end of Q2, and the trends are strong, including increasing coverage, firming sentiment, and an increasing price target. The price target lags behind the price action in early Q3 but provides robust market support, having risen more than 40% in the first half of the year, and recent revisions are leading to the high end of the range.\nThat puts META stock near $900, sufficient for new all-time highs and a 25% gain from early July trading levels.\nThe technical signals are more robust. The Q2 price action featured a significant price rebound, confirming the uptrend and setting a new all-time high. A move to new highs opens the door to another sustained rally with the potential to advance an amount equal to the rebound in place.\nThat puts this market near $950 and potentially heading higher. Meta’s AI push costs money but also generates ample cash flow, allowing it to pay dividends, increase its distribution, and buy back shares.\nDollar General Price Reversal Advances on Turnaround Results\nDollar General Today\nDGDollar General\n$112.24 -0.11 (-0.10%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $66.43\n▼\n$135.46 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.10%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 21.42\n- Price Target\n- $109.46\nDollar General’s NYSE: DG 2025 is highlighted by the positive impact of its turnaround efforts and rationalization strategy. The company is in the process of accelerating its strategy, and analysts are responding favorably to the news. The trends in Q2 include increased coverage, a firmer sentiment, and positive price target revisions that confirm the sentiment shift that began earlier in the year.\nThe takeaway is that Dollar General’s analyst sentiment is firming to Moderate Buy from Hold, and the price target revisions are leading the market in its reversal.\nDollar General is set to report Q2 earnings in early September and will likely provide another catalyst for the market. Analysts forecast another mid-single-digit revenue growth offset by margin weakness, and are underestimating the company in both regards.\nLeaning into digitization and easier-to-use stores is a recipe for unlocking store traffic, revenue, and margin. Investors should expect the company to outperform the consensus forecast and provide another substantial guidance improvement.\nWingstop Focuses on Unit Growth, Can Fly Higher\nWingstop Today\n$330.16 -3.90 (-1.17%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $204.00\n▼\n$433.86 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.33%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 55.30\n- Price Target\n- $358.83\nWingstop NASDAQ: WING faces a headwind in 2025 that is impacting comparable store sales. However, unit growth and the lean into international markets are sustaining the growth outlook while building leverage for when macroeconomic headwinds reverse. The analysts’ response is to upgrade the stock and increase price targets, positioning it to reach a new all-time high by year’s end.\nThe H1 analysts' activity includes a 25% increase in coverage, solid coverage of nearly 25 analysts, a firming rating pegged at Moderate Buy, and a rising price target. The consensus in early Q3 forecasts a 10% upside for this stock; the high-end range puts it at a new all-time high, representing a more than 30% gain when reached.\nWingstop’s stock price rebound is also supported by its capital return program. The company pays a token distribution yielding less than 0.5% but compounds it with aggressive share buybacks. The buybacks in Q1 reduced the count sequentially and compared to the previous year and are expected to continue at a robust pace for the foreseeable future.\nBefore you consider Meta Platforms, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "AI Chip Arms Race: 3 Must-Watch Equipment Stocks", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/ai-chip-arms-race-3-must-watch-equipment-stocks/", "text": "If it wasn't already clear to investors, the demand for data centers will be a catalyst for semiconductor stocks for years, if not decades. It's why investors continue to buy into the growth of chip makers like NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA. The company's graphic processing units (GPUs) command over 80% of the current market.\nAnother profitable way to invest in the demand for data centers is through a group of technology stocks with the advanced technology needed to meet the demands caused by artificial intelligence (AI). For example:\n- Generative AI workloads (training massive models) require cutting-edge GPUs and specialized accelerators, which are only made on the most advanced nodes.\n- Memory density and packaging innovation (HBM, advanced substrates) also depend on precision manufacturing equipment.\nThese are just two reasons hyperscale data centers are rapidly upgrading to newer, more power-efficient chips. Chipmakers like NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. NASDAQ: AMD simply can't do without this new technology. Here are three companies on the leading edge of the semiconductor supply chain that are set up for significant gains.\nThe Best Pure Play on AI Chip Demand\nASML Today\n$802.09 +2.26 (+0.28%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $578.51\n▼\n$1,110.09 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.89%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 33.80\n- Price Target\n- $923.80\nFirst up is ASML NASDAQ: ASML. The company is the leader in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems. EUV prints tiny circuit patterns onto silicon wafers using light with an extremely short wavelength to achieve fine resolution.\nThis is an advantage over deep ultraviolet (DUV) technology, which cannot produce the 5nm, 3nm, or 2nm transistors that today's cutting-edge AI accelerators require without adding several complex (and costly) steps. That means chipmakers can't produce the advanced chips their customers require without EUV technology.\nThat's one reason ASML posted 52% year-over-year revenue growth in its most recent quarter, and it's also why investors can expect more of the same in future quarters.\nSince hitting an all-time high in July 2024, ASML stock dropped sharply. But that's likely to give investors a second chance to get in. Analysts give ASML a consensus price target of $923.80, a gain of more than 16%. Plus, despite trading around 33x earnings, ASML is trading at a discount to its historical averages.\nApplied Materials Has Exposure Beyond Just AI Chips\nApplied Materials Today\nAMATApplied Materials\n$198.03 +2.64 (+1.35%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $123.74\n▼\n$255.57 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.93%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 24.09\n- Price Target\n- $203.65\nApplied Materials Inc. NASDAQ: AMAT is another link in the chip-making supply chain. Specifically, the company provides key process technologies such as thin film deposition, etch, and chemical-mechanical planarization. These are needed to build high-performance AI chips with high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used in data center GPUs.\nApplied Materials has a customer base that goes beyond leading-edge logic chips. Its technology is also necessary for Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) applications like PCs, servers, and smartphones and NAND flash memory, which is needed in applications like cloud storage.\nThis gives the company a large addressable market. But is that enough to overcome a valuation that is starting to look stretched at around 21x earnings? Analysts from Wells Fargo & Co. NYSE: WFC and Citigroup Inc. NYSE: C have raised their price targets. The belief is that revenue growth, which is expected to grow 6.5% to $29 billion in 2025, will accelerate sharply in the next five years.\nThat makes AMAT stock a good buy-and-hold candidate. This is particularly true with the stock trading about 20% below its all-time high in 2024.\nKLA's Role in Preventing Costly Chip Defects\nKLA Today\n$928.62 +5.44 (+0.59%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $551.33\n▼\n$932.17 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.82%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 33.76\n- Price Target\n- $840.33\nThe last stock on this list is KLA NASDAQ: KLAC. The company is a leader in yield management. Here's why that's important for the ongoing data center buildout. As chips become more complex, it's vital that each wafer produces (i.e., yields) as many usable chips as possible.\nThis is where KLA comes in. Its inspection and measurement tools detect and correct microscopic defects early in the process. This helps manufacturers improve efficiency, which protects their margins and makes KLA an invaluable partner.\nUnlike the first two stocks on this list, KLAC stock has recently made an ATH. This puts the stock currently above the consensus price target of analysts, pushing its P/E ratio above historical levels and the sector average.\nSeveral analysts have been raising their price targets in the last few weeks. That suggests an expectation that KLA will report strong earnings when it reports in late July.\nBefore you consider KLA, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and KLA wasn't on the list.\nWhile KLA currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nLooking for the next FAANG stock before everyone has heard about it?

{"title": "Will Oracle's Cloud and AI Deals Propel It to New Highs?", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/will-oracles-cloud-and-ai-deals-propel-it-to-new-highs/", "text": "Oracle Today\n$235.08 -0.73 (-0.31%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $118.86\n▼\n$241.44 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.85%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 54.17\n- Price Target\n- $209.33\nShares of enterprise computing, cloud, and data management pathbreaker Oracle Corp. NYSE: ORCL climbed by an astonishing two-thirds in the last year, repeatedly setting record highs (and making co-founder Larry Ellison the second-wealthiest person in the world in the process). As analysts from Jefferies, D.A. Davidson, Bernstein, and elsewhere raised their price targets for ORCL shares recently, it appears the company's upward momentum may continue.\nIndeed, Oracle has many things working in its favor, including a successful cloud database offering, massive AI infrastructure improvements, flagship cloud services agreements, and key strategic partnerships. However, investors considering a new or larger position in ORCL should be cautious, as the market may have overestimated the company's growth potential, especially after shares have already risen by 67% in the past 12 months. Further, concerns about upcoming capital needs and margin hits after federal government discounts might be a cause for hesitation.\nMassive Cloud Growth, With No Signs of Slowing\nA major driver of Oracle's recent success is its expanding cloud database services. The company has rapidly grown its cloud and MultiCloud divisions, both in applications and infrastructure, with a 24% growth rate for fiscal 2025. It projects this to increase to over 40% in fiscal 2026. Specifically, cloud infrastructure growth is expected to rise from 50% in fiscal 2025 to 70% in the next fiscal year.\nMeanwhile, the company's unique MultiCloud offerings, which allow customers to leverage the advantages of multiple cloud providers simultaneously, also generated notable revenue growth. Its multicloud database revenue from Amazon, Google, and Azure increased by 115% sequentially in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. The firm plans to triple the number of MultiCloud data centers next year.\nCloud database services are quickly becoming one of Oracle's main revenue sources, with a 31% year-over-year growth in the latest quarter, totaling $2.6 billion in revenue. Thanks to heightened AI integration through the company's Oracle 23 platform, Oracle's database services are gaining popularity among enterprise customers, helping the company stand out from competitors.\nAgreements and Partnerships Drive Optimism\nOracle's recent growth may largely stem from its discreet announcement through Form 8-K regarding a new MultiCloud deal, projected to generate over $30 billion annually. Given that the company's total revenue for fiscal 2025 was $57.4 billion, this contract is highly significant, even though the revenue increase won't impact figures until fiscal 2028. Additionally, partnerships with AI companies Kanverse.ai and PrimeVigilance are expected to further expand Oracle's presence in the cloud industry.\nWatch Out for Capital Stretch, Short-Term Margins, and Lofty Valuation\nOracle Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$209.33-10.95% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 33 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $235.08 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $275.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $209.33 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $130.00 |\n|---|\nOracle Stock Forecast Details\nAll of the added AI infrastructure has understandably lifted Oracle's expenditures, and the company's capital expenditures for fiscal 2026 could be higher than $25 billion. At the same time, the company will want to maintain its dividend and engage in share buybacks, all of which will stretch its available capital further. Combined, these factors may negatively impact the company's free cash flow and force it to raise billions in the years to come.\nMore immediately, investors might worry about Oracle's steep 75% discounts on some of its services to U.S. federal government agencies. This move could pressure the company's margins and potentially unsettle investors as it waits for revenue from the $30-billion contract mentioned above.\nAdditionally, Oracle's trailing P/E ratio of 54.1 is about half again higher than it was in mid-2024, suggesting that the market has already priced in at least a portion of the benefits listed above into ORCL shares. Investors should beware of the tremendous hype surrounding this company, which may threaten to overshadow its very real growth drivers.\nBelieve the Hype—Oracle Could Continue to Rise\nWith the above risks in mind, investors serious about holding Oracle for a longer timeframe may take heart in the company's new dominance in the database, cloud, and MultiCloud spaces. There are ample signs to suggest it will be a crucial part of the AI and data industries as they continue to balloon in the coming years.\nBefore you consider Oracle, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

The company persistently outperforms its consensus figures and provides favorable guidance, a recipe for positive sentiment trends that drive market action.\nIn this case, the trends include steady analyst coverage with a relatively high number, 23, covering he stock, firming sentiment and a rising price target. The sentiment is pegged at Moderate Buy in early Q3, with revisions leading to the Strong Buy range and a significant price increase for the stock. The consensus in early July is for an 8% gain, sufficient for a new all-time high, with the most recent revisions leading to the high-end range, another 10% upside when reached.\nThe long-term outlook for Autodesk is robust and aligns with the outlook for higher share prices. The company is forecasted to grow revenue at a slowing pace but to sustain a modest double-digit CAGR through the middle of the next decade. The top-line growth pace will be exceeded by earnings growth, and both the top- and bottom-line forecasts are likely to be light.\nAutodesk has outperformed its consensus more than 90% of the time and showed signs of accelerating in the latest report. Revenue grew by 15% compared to only 11% in the prior quarter and year, underpinned by client wins and penetration gains.\nAutodesk Moves to Critical Resistance Point\nAutodesk’s price action is at a critical resistance and potential pivot point in early Q2 2025. The market for this tech stock has moved up to retest resistance, aligning with the highs set in 2021, just below the all-time high, and may soon move above them. A move to fresh highs would signal a crucial market shift and open the door to a more sustainable rally.\nThe market may experience turbulence at its all-time high in this scenario, but it is unlikely to correct significantly.\nAutodesk’s Strong Q1 Sets It Up for a Strong Year\nAutodesk had a strong Q1, setting it up for a strong year. The critical detail is that strength in all segments, product lines, and geographies reflects little to no impact from macroeconomic headwinds. The takeaway is that the consensus outlook for F2026, robust as it is, likely underestimates the company’s performance by a wide margin.\nAs it stands, the consensus is for Q2 revenue to grow by only 14%, compared to the 15% gain in Q1; however, revisions are leading to a high-end range and may continue to boost the consensus until the results are released in late August.\nThe balance sheet highlights at the end of Q1 didn’t reflect improvement so much as stability and strength. The cash position was up, but reduced receivables offset that. Current and total assets and liabilities were flat, leaving equity flat compared to last year.\nLeverage is low, with long-term net debt less than 1x equity, and cash flow allows for modest share repurchases. Repurchases reduced the count by roughly 0.5% year over year in F2025 and matched the pace in FQ1 2026, providing some leverage for shareholders.\nThe most significant risk for investors is insider selling. Executives have been selling all year, but the headwind they present is minimal; they own only 0.15% of the stock, while institutions pose a bigger threat. Institutions, which own about 90% of the stock, bought on balance in the first half of the year but began selling in Q2.\nThe mitigating factor is that the initial reports for Q3 show significant buying activity in the quarter’s first week, suggesting a tailwind for price action that can help lift the stock price in the back half of 2025.\nBefore you consider Autodesk, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Autodesk wasn't on the list.\nWhile Autodesk currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nEnter your email address and we'll send you MarketBeat's list of ten stocks that are set to soar in Summer 2025, despite the threat of tariffs and other economic uncertainty.

{"title": "Tesla Stock Could Accelerate on New EV Tax Legislation", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/tesla-stock-could-accelerate-on-new-ev-tax-legislation/", "text": "Some controversy has resurfaced in the stock market as President Trump rolled out the One Big Beautiful Bill, which will likely create a new wave of debt to be added to the United States economy. However, the main difference with this bill is that most of this newly injected capital is aimed at positive return projects rather than pursuits that won’t stimulate many areas of the economy.\nTesla Today\n$309.87 +13.99 (+4.73%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $182.00\n▼\n$488.54 - P/E Ratio\n- 170.26\n- Price Target\n- $301.13\nOne of these areas is taxes; nothing stimulates production and spending like a more favorable tax positioning in any economy, which is where investors need to place their attention when it comes to understanding this new bill. Overall, there are numerous benefits in the details of the tax implications, but one targeted aspect will make some names in the automotive sector winners in the coming months and quarters.\nThe most obvious one, of course, is Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA. Tesla has significantly increased its market share in the electric vehicle (EV) sector through cutting-edge technology and strong consumer appeal, positioning that will benefit it from the new bill's tax advantages for Tesla buyers. These themes are already influencing, and will continue to influence, the stock’s performance.\nHow Tesla Benefits From the New Bill\nUnder the new legislative action, a tax break will be implemented for all vehicles assembled in the United States, regardless of where their parts are sourced, as long as the final assembly occurs domestically. With this in mind, Tesla is perfectly positioned to qualify its customers for this benefit.\nConsidering how popular and accessible Tesla vehicles have become in the United States, any additional tax incentives—such as federal EV credits for U.S.-assembled models—could further boost demand. The potential savings on ownership costs may become more apparent to consumers, especially if Tesla highlights these benefits during the financing stage of the sales process.\nFollowing the new implementation, Tesla shares have increased by just under 1.5% so far this week, surpassing the broader S&P 500 index by 1.7%. Achieving this during a period of heightened uncertainty caused by ongoing tariff negotiations and other economic factors is no easy task.\nHowever, when it comes to potential upside, investors have seen only a fraction of what Tesla could truly accomplish in this new favorable environment, as this tax break catalyst has not yet been fully priced into the company’s valuation.\nThe Market’s Take on Tesla Stock\nCompared to other large-cap names in the technology space, Tesla offers a wide margin for investors to benefit from a “catch-up” rotation. As the stock still trades at only 62% of its 52-week high, it offers both upside and an attractive margin of safety, given the limited downside it could experience in the future.\nThese are the sort of asymmetric returns that investors love to act on in the rare occasions that the markets offer them, which is why acclaimed Wedbush analyst Dan Ives decided to reiterate his Outperform rating on Tesla stock as of early July 2025.\nTesla Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$301.13-2.82% DownsideHoldBased on 41 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $309.87 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $500.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $301.13 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $19.05 |\n|---|\nTesla Stock Forecast Details\nNot only does the rating convey an optimistic note regarding the new bill, but it also includes his price target of $500 per share, which would call for a new 52-week high, along with a net implied upside of 70% from the current stock price. What happens when the momentum for Tesla stock gets going could be confirmation that investors may already be too late.\nMeeting these expectations and surpassing fundamentals driven by these tax breaks, the stock's performance could trigger new buying activity from institutional investors who typically seek such breakouts and bullish momentum stocks. However, when these positions are reported, it will be too late for retail investors to take action.\nCurrently, Tesla's 163.4x price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio places it at a significant premium over the average 23.8x valuation multiple in the automotive industry, and there’s a strong reason for this premium: a differentiated product, superior market share, and the right size to capitalize on these new tax incentives.\nThe markets are usually willing to overpay for stocks they believe can outperform the rest of the market and peer group in the near future. It looks like Tesla has all of the right components for this to be the case moving forward, showing investors why this new fundamental change could fulfill the $500 valuation if not more.\nBefore you consider Tesla, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Tesla wasn't on the list.\nWhile Tesla currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nWith the proliferation of data centers and electric vehicles, the electric grid will only get more strained.

{"title": "Why Constellation, Cameco & NuScale Should Be on Your Radar", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/why-constellation-cameco-and-nuscale-should-be-on-your-radar/", "text": "Finding the next big thing is easier said than done when it comes to the most significant and powerful themes in the global economy. Those who were early enough to the semiconductor boom born out of the artificial intelligence race are familiar with the effort and courage it takes to back an idea, or commercialize it, before it pops in the entire stock market.\nHowever, one area in the energy sector has all the characteristics of being one of the next booms in the global economy. The rate of fossil fuel dependency creates an inevitable opportunity for a massive shift in the years to come. The only reasonable alternative to replacing fossil fuels today is nuclear energy, not solar or wind, due to its renewable and scalable capabilities.\nWhile nuclear energy has a bad reputation today due to past incidents, investors tend to overlook the technology's significantly improved performance over the past few decades. This is why maintaining a diversified list of nuclear names can be a key component of a well-rounded portfolio.\nNames like Constellation Energy Corp. NASDAQ: CEG, Cameco Corp. NYSE: CCJ, and even NuScale Power Corp. NYSE: SMR are great additions for this massive race to alternative energy.\nThe Stability of Constellation Energy Is Here to Stay\nConstellation Energy Today\nCEGConstellation Energy\n$313.62 -3.49 (-1.10%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $155.60\n▼\n$352.00 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.49%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 33.05\n- Price Target\n- $299.67\nConsidering these tailwinds for the broader nuclear industry, investors may look for companies that have already proven their services and concepts in the marketplace. This is where Constellation Energy steps in, as its size and scale make it one of the safest investment options in this race.\nWith a market capitalization of just under $100 billion today, the market consensus is that Constellation is the leader in terms of financial expectations and market share for providing nuclear power. Fundamentally, these expectations are true since Constellation is the largest nuclear energy presence in the United States today.\nThis size and market share allowed Constellation to collaborate with one of the biggest names in technology. Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META has signed a 20-year contract with Constellation to power the technology giant’s facilities in Illinois, a proof of concept and service that may lead to new technology deals in the future.\nIf other large companies decide to join Meta, this could mean millions (if not billions) in potential new revenue for Constellation Energy, which may be one of the expectations driving the stock near its 52-week highs today, showcasing bullish momentum moving forward.\nA High-Risk, High-Reward Setup in NuScale Energy\nNuScale Power Today\nSMRNuScale Power\n$36.04 +0.58 (+1.64%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $6.88\n▼\n$45.31 - Price Target\n- $32.00\nWhen it comes to finding the next Constellation, investors need to focus on current market share growth and contract interest from the government and other entities moving forward, and this is where NuScale can offer some opportunities.\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has recently extended its agenda, calling for a higher quota in development efforts stemming from small nuclear reactors within the United States, where a company like NuScale can potentially secure new deals.\nKnowing that the odds may fall in favor of NuScale, some on Wall Street have decided to act on the expectations for the future, such as Citigroup analyst Vikram Bagri, who decided to place a new valuation target of $46 per share on NuScale stock to call for not only a new 52-week high breakout, but also a 28% upside potential from today’s prices.\nBetting on the future potential for NuScale and its mix in the contracts space for nuclear energy, institutional buyers from the Vanguard Group decided to boost their NuScale stock holdings by 6.1% as of early May 2025, bringing their entire stake up to $126.6 million today, or 3.2% ownership in the company as a vote of confidence.\nFor Early Diversification: Cameco Stock\nNuScale Power Today\nSMRNuScale Power\n$36.04 +0.58 (+1.64%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $6.88\n▼\n$45.31 - Price Target\n- $32.00\nWhether Constellation appears to be an unmovable giant, or NuScale too speculative and reliant on new contracts, investors can always move up the value chain in the nuclear space to land on Cameco. Being a uranium supplier has its benefits, since Cameco will be the one to be paid first when nuclear demand trends likely higher.\nThis positioning will help reduce some of the speculation and keep the exposure at the top of the chain regarding uranium, which the markets are already beginning to price in for future demand potential. Since Cameco now trades at 96% of its 52-week high, the consensus price action confirms the “first in place” position that Cameco holds.\nMore than that, a new $100 price target from Andrew Wong (a Royal Bank of Canada analyst) would also call for a new breakout in Cameco into a new 52-week high while promising an additional 38% upside from where it trades today, something investors should keep in mind when building their nuclear portfolio.\nBefore you consider Constellation Energy, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Navigating Solar Headwinds: 3 Stocks Built to Last", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/navigating-solar-headwinds-3-stocks-built-to-last/", "text": "The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) Act is now law, and with it come several new rules and rollbacks that could weaken the clean energy industry in the U.S. While the bill's primary focus has been tax cut extensions, the legislation also eliminates many incentives for solar power, especially those in residential areas.\nHowever, while the bill remains a net negative for solar power companies, the Senate version has removed some of the more onerous provisions, and the industry may not be facing the death knell some executives feared.\nToday, we’ll look at which regulations did and didn’t make the OBBB Act’s final cut, and examine three stocks that can still thrive despite the new solar headwinds.\nWhy Solar Energy Is Feeling the Heat Under New Tax Bill\nUnder the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the investment tax credit (ITC) and production tax credit (PTC) for solar systems were extended by a decade, fueling the growth of solar energy adoption in both residential and commercial areas. However, the OBBB Act marks a swift reversal of many of these policies, including the abrupt cancellation of a crucial residential credit. Here are some of the noteworthy provisions for the solar industry:\n- Residential Solar Credit Phase Out - The 30% tax credit for residential solar systems under Section 25D will now expire on December 31 of this year, nearly a decade ahead of schedule.\n- Project Timeline Limitations - Utility and commercial projects under Sections 45Y and 48E will see a phase-out of the 30% tax credit after 2027, with the credit being eliminated for projects started after 2029. However, this language is softer than the House version, and allows projects started within 12 months of the bill’s passage to be exempted from this deadline.\n- Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) Tests - Companies can still sell clean energy tax credits to other taxpaying entities, provided they don’t fall on an FEOC list. FEOCs were defined in the IRA but expanded in the OBBB, which would reduce the number of potential tax credit buyers.\nLast Minute OBBB Revisions Should Blunt the Pain for These 3 Solar Stocks\nThe Senate version of the OBBB Act, eventually signed into law, removed some of the stricter regulations against the solar sector, including an excise tax on imported modules, the most stringent timelines for commercial projects, and the cancellation of tax credit transferability. It still doesn’t bode well for solar as a whole, but these three companies should still be able to thrive in this environment.\nNextEra Energy: A Deep and Diversified Renewables Portfolio\nNextEra Energy Today\nNEENextEra Energy\n$74.67 +1.02 (+1.39%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $61.72\n▼\n$86.10 - Dividend Yield\n- 3.04%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 27.97\n- Price Target\n- $84.73\nIn stocks, there’s often safety in size, and NextEra Energy Inc. NYSE: NEE is one of the largest diversified clean energy companies in the U.S.\nNo one produces more solar or wind capacity than NextEra (33,000 megawatts of operating energy in 2023), and its substantial output and focus on large-scale projects should help it navigate a less friendly regulatory environment.\nNEE shares look affordable based on historical data, and even more so when using forward projections. The stock trades at 27.5 times earnings, a tick below the 10-year average P/E of 29.1. However, the 12-month forward P/E ratio stands at 20.3, and this is expected to decrease to 18.8 by the end of 2026 and 17.2 by 2027.\nAfter a negative 2023, EPS growth rebounded 26% in 2024, with smaller but still significant projections of 7.2% for 2025 and 8% for 2026.\nThe company missed revenue expectations in its Q1 2025 earnings report, but sales still grew 9% year-over-year (YOY), and EPS numbers matched analyst expectations. The average analyst price target of $84.55 still indicates upside potential of nearly 14% as well.\nFirst Solar: Domestic Manufacturing Dominance\nFirst Solar Today\n$165.09 -0.90 (-0.54%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $116.56\n▼\n$262.72 - P/E Ratio\n- 14.04\n- Price Target\n- $228.69\nFirst Solar Inc. NASDAQ: FSLR specializes in manufacturing solar modules and operates some of the world’s largest photovoltaic power plants. Despite the sudden solar phaseouts, First Solar’s focus on producing its modules and plants in the U.S. could give it a competitive edge in this new energy environment. First Solar’s thin-film cadmium telluride modules can be manufactured with 100% domestic components, freeing the company from tariff pressure and FEOC restrictions.\nDespite the bill’s harsh implications, this domestic dominance is partly why Royal Bank of Canada increased its price target from $188 to $200 this week. Of the 31 analysts covering the stock, 26 now have Buy ratings with an average price target of $228.69, implying an upside from current levels.\nNextracker: Protection Through Limited Residential Exposure\nNextracker Today\n$62.62 -1.30 (-2.03%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $30.93\n▼\n$67.87 - P/E Ratio\n- 18.05\n- Price Target\n- $61.67\nNextracker Inc. NASDAQ: NXT sold nearly $3 billion worth of solar trackers in the last 12 months. Trackers are devices that pair with solar panels to track the sun across the sky, much like a sunflower. They optimize solar efficiency by keeping panels perfectly aligned for maximum sunlight exposure. Solar trackers are primarily used in large utility-scale projects, which offer Nextracker some protection from the phase-outs of the solar tax credit.\nThe stock also appears attractive compared to other solar companies, thanks to its affordable valuation and strong margins. NXT trades at just 19 times earnings, and it boosted net profit margins to 17.21% in the most recent quarter. The $679 million quarterly revenue also represented a 15% YOY increase, showing the company can grow while protecting its margins.\nBefore you consider NextEra Energy, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and NextEra Energy wasn't on the list.\nWhile NextEra Energy currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nUnlock the timeless value of gold with our exclusive 2025 Gold Forecasting Report.

{"title": "Why Marvell Could Be the Smartest AI Bet Under $80", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-marvell-could-be-the-smartest-ai-bet-under-80/", "text": "The artificial intelligence (AI) boom is reshaping the global economy, but for many investors, the most visible players come with sky-high price tags. The search is on for companies that offer strategic exposure to this explosive growth without demanding a prohibitive premium.\nMarvell Technology Today\nMRVLMarvell Technology\n$73.36 +1.10 (+1.52%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $47.09\n▼\n$127.48 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.33%\n- Price Target\n- $94.47\nThis has drawn attention to the essential, yet often less hyped, companies that build the foundational hardware of the AI revolution.\nMarvell Technology NASDAQ: MRVL is a prime candidate in this search. As a leading designer of the advanced semiconductors that power data centers and AI networking, Marvell is integral to the industry's expansion.\nFollowing a significant pullback in its stock price through 2025, the company now offers what has become rare in the tech sector: a compelling growth story paired with a more down-to-earth valuation.\nMarvell’s Pullback Created an Attractive Entry Point\nThe company's investment case begins when you look at Marvell’s price chart. Through the first half of 2025, shares have declined by approximately 35%, bringing the price below $75. This underperformance was not caused by a failure in the company’s strategy but rather by broader market headwinds. Widespread investor concerns about the global economy and speculative fears over potential new tariffs on Asian trade partners have created pressure on the entire fabless semiconductor industry, which relies on manufacturing foundries in the region.\nThis market-driven price reset is what creates the current opportunity. It has pushed Marvell’s valuation to a level that stands out in the crowded tech sector. The company now trades at approximately 25x its projected forward earnings per share (EPS). To put that in perspective, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index carries an average forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) that tends to range between 34 around 40 depending on the timescale. Finding a key AI player trading at a notable discount to the sector average is uncommon. This dynamic, where a company’s long-term growth trajectory appears disconnected from its current stock price, is precisely the kind of setup that value-conscious growth investors seek.\nHow Marvell Plans to Win the Next Phase of AI\nA compelling valuation is only half the story; a credible path to future growth must back it. Here, Marvell has laid out an ambitious and transparent multi-year blueprint for investors centered on dominating the most lucrative segments of the data infrastructure market.\nThe primary engine of this plan is Marvell's strategic push into the custom silicon, or ASIC, market. As cloud giants seek to optimize performance and control the immense power costs of their AI models, they are increasingly moving away from off-the-shelf chips.\nMarvell Technology Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$94.4728.77% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 31 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $73.36 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $149.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $94.47 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $66.00 |\n|---|\nMarvell Technology Stock Forecast Details\nInstead, they partner with firms like Marvell to co-design unique processors tailored to their specific needs. This creates a deep and very sticky relationship that is difficult for competitors to disrupt. Marvell's goal is to increase its market share from 5% in 2023 to 20% by 2028. Based on industry projections, achieving this target would generate $11 billion in annual revenue from this high-margin business alone.\nBeyond the development of custom chips, Marvell is targeting the entire data center ecosystem. The company plans to expand its total data center market share from 13% last year to 20% of a projected $94 billion market by 2028. This represents a clear path toward nearly $19 billion in annual data center revenue, which would be a potential fivefold increase from its fiscal 2025 results.\nThis ambitious vision is grounded in a tangible technological advantage. Marvell is a leader in developing next-generation 2-nanometer (2nm) chips. This new platform is designed to deliver 15% higher performance while, crucially, consuming up to 35% less power than the current 3nm technology.\nIn an industry where data center electricity usage is a primary operational cost and environmental concern, this efficiency is a powerful selling point. This tech edge is how Marvell plans to win over new clients, with a stated goal of expanding its custom AI customer base from four to ten by 2028, systematically de-risking its revenue stream along the way.\nWhy Marvell Stands Out for Long-Term Investors\nFor investors navigating the complexities of the AI market, Marvell Technology presents a clear and compelling case. The recent market-wide pressures have pushed its valuation to an attractive level, creating a potential discount relative to its peers.\nAt the same time, the company has offered a transparent, multi-year roadmap for substantial growth, underpinned by a distinct technological advantage in a market that prioritizes performance and efficiency. It is this rare combination of value and vision that makes Marvell a standout opportunity for those looking to invest in the future of artificial intelligence.\nBefore you consider Marvell Technology, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "AST SpaceMobile: Is Market Noise Drowning Out a $100M Signal?", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/ast-spacemobile-is-market-noise-drowning-out-a-100m-signal/", "text": "AST SpaceMobile Today\n$43.97 +1.47 (+3.46%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $11.41\n▼\n$54.05 - Price Target\n- $45.34\nAfter a powerful rally that saw its stock post triple-digit percentage gains in under 90 days, AST SpaceMobile NASDAQ: ASTS has entered a period of consolidation. For investors tracking AST SpaceMobile’s daily stock chart, this pullback might seem like a reason for concern. The stock's recent price action stands in contrast to the company's accelerating operational progress.\nHowever, this situation presents a classic case of market signals versus market noise. While short-term trading has created volatility, a series of powerful and positive developments are sending a clear signal about the company’s strengthening long-term future.\nWhy the Bull Case is Growing for AST SpaceMobile\nThe most recent signal of confidence arrived on July 3, 2025, when AST SpaceMobile announced a $100 million equipment financing facility.\nThis is a major development for two key reasons. First, the financing is non-dilutive. This means the company secured cash to expand its satellite manufacturing without issuing new stock, protecting the value of existing shares. Second, it serves as a strong third-party validation. A financial institution has reviewed the company's assets and business plan, deeming them solid enough to lend against, a key sign of maturity for a growth-focused enterprise.\nAST SpaceMobile Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$45.343.12% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 8 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $43.97 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $63.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $45.34 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $30.00 |\n|---|\nAST SpaceMobile Stock Forecast Details\nThis financial bolstering follows another strategic move in late June, when the company repurchased $225 million of its debt, further strengthening its balance sheet for the road ahead. These financial wins are the capstone on a series of major operational victories that fueled the stock’s initial rally.\nA pivotal moment occurred on June 23, when a U.S. court approved a settlement that allowed AST SpaceMobile to acquire long-term access to a large block of mid-band spectrum from Ligado Networks. This deal is crucial because it grants the company more direct control over its network capacity in the key North American market. The mid-band spectrum offers a coveted balance of broad geographic coverage and high data speeds, making it a key strategic asset.\nJust days later, on June 27, AST SpaceMobile was officially added to the Russell 1000 Index. This is more than just a symbolic achievement because inclusion in a major index compels large funds that track it to purchase the stock, thereby creating a new and stable source of demand. It also raises the company’s profile among major institutional investors, increasing liquidity and solidifying its position among the market's larger players in the telecommunications and technology sectors.\nThis progress is mirrored in the company's global expansion, with a new partnership with Vodafone Idea opening the door to India’s massive market and a successful defense demonstration with Fairwinds Technologies underscoring the technology's national security value.\nWhy the Brakes? Understanding the Recent Dip\nIf the fundamental picture is improving, then the recent price dip is best explained by predictable market mechanics. The pullback appears to be a technical and healthy consolidation response from the market, not a red flag.\nThe stock’s addition to the Russell 1000 was a textbook sell-the-news event. This well-known catalyst was anticipated for weeks, leading many traders to buy in advance. Once the event officially occurred, those same traders took profits, creating immediate selling pressure on the stock.\nFor a stock that appreciated so dramatically in such a short period of time, this type of profit-taking is both normal and expected. The market is now in a natural catalyst gap, which is a quiet period between the most recent series of catalysts and the next major operational milestone. This creates an environment that allows the stock to establish a new price floor before it makes its next potential move.\nAST SpaceMobile, Inc. (ASTS) Price Chart for Thursday, July, 10, 2025\nFrom Consolidation to Liftoff? The Next Big Test\nWhile the stock price consolidates, the company's operational clock continues to tick toward its most crucial near-term catalyst. For investors, the focus will now pivot squarely to the scheduled launch of the first Block 2 satellite later this month.\nThis is AST SpaceMobile’s most significant satellite launch to date, as it marks the start of deploying the company’s next-generation commercial hardware, which has been designed to be significantly more powerful than the satellites currently in orbit. A successful mission will provide the market with tangible evidence of the company’s ability to execute its advanced technology roadmap and scaling plans. It is the most critical data point on the horizon, one that has the potential to silence the current market noise and usher in the next chapter of the company's ambitious growth story.\nBefore you consider AST SpaceMobile, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

However, the market’s efficiency can sometimes be thrown off by all the excitement and strong opinions. When imbalances occur, it creates opportunities for savvy investors to step in and capitalize on the most significant chances that arise.\nON Today\n$53.30 -0.82 (-1.52%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $34.59\n▼\n$64.05 - P/E Ratio\n- 76.14\n- Price Target\n- $63.85\nToday’s cycle appears to be centered on one area of the economy, with artificial intelligence and semiconductor companies taking center stage and leaving everyone else behind. However, examining the forgotten retail sector can be very beneficial for investors in the next few months and quarters.\nWith recent examples of momentum inside the SPDR S&P Retail ETF NYSEARCA: XRT as the group showcased a rally of up to 24% over the past quarter, investors can now count on bullish momentum to get them on the winning side of history.\nHowever, not all stocks offer the same return profile, and that is where shares of On Holding NYSE: ONON stand out, offering a great setup in both growth and value.\nOn Holding Stock: The Odd One in the Group\nWhen it comes to the market's athleisure brands, investors can quickly screen through a price action filter to find out which ones deserve their attention, as well as the rest of the market’s. Comparing On Holding to names like Lululemon Athletica Inc. NASDAQ: LULU and Nike Inc. NYSE: NKE can make this entire task a lot easier.\nOn Holding now trades at up to 85% of its 52-week high, whereas Lululemon is still struggling, down at 59% of its own relative highs. When it comes to Nike, the competition becomes tighter for investors to differentiate, as the $112 billion giant is now up to 82% of its 52-week highs.\nHowever, the mere size difference of the two firms is exactly where investors will get their payouts. Nike is nearly ten times larger than On Holding, whose market capitalization is only $17.1 billion today, creating a much better risk-to-reward ratio in terms of how easy it would be for this smaller name to grow its size percentage-wise.\nThis price action indicates to investors that On Holding is the leader among the larger athleisure names and the best positioned for continued upside in terms of market capitalization gains. Price action aside, other market fundamentals are at play, helping investors consider this stock as a potential winner.\nOn Holding stock now trades at a premium price-to-book (P/B) multiple of up to 20.0x to command a steep premium above Nike’s 8.0x P/B valuation. While some investors may call this overextended or expensive, seasoned market participants understand that the market is often willing to overpay for the names it believes will outperform the peer group.\nWith this evidence in hand, investors now need to justify this view from the market and truly see if there are more fundamental reasons to consider buying this stock against the other giants in the retail space.\nFinancials Running on All Cylinders\nWhen investors examine On Holding's latest quarterly earnings results, they will find several reasons why the market is now willing to overpay for this stock. When it comes to one of the most important metrics, revenue, On Holding reported up to 43% annual growth.\nON Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$63.8519.80% UpsideBuyBased on 22 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $53.30 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $75.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $63.85 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $44.00 |\n|---|\nON Stock Forecast Details\nThis massive growth can be attributed to the brand’s rapid takeover of market share worldwide. Investors can now likely recall seeing On running shoes in fields such as medicine, at public events, or even during a quick trip to the nearest gym. On Holding’s brand seems on par with Nike and Lululemon today, yet the market cap isn’t.\nThis presents an opportunity to close the gap, as evidenced by the company’s gross profit margin. On Holding’s wholesale division increased its share of the net to 38.1%, bringing efficiency and economy of scale to a much higher gross profit margin of 59.9%, one of the highest in the industry.\nNaturally, this should have resulted in a sharp increase in earnings per share (EPS), but that metric actually fell. The decline in earnings is due to the company reporting a net loss caused by currency exchange rates, as the dollar has been weakening since late 2024. Therefore, this is not an issue that investors need to worry about.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company would have actually delivered a massive earnings beat, which is why the stock did not drop at all, and also why Jay Sole (an analyst from UBS Group) decided to assign a $75 per share valuation after the quarterly announcement.\nFrom today’s price, this valuation target would call for up to 40% of additional upside, proving the market’s view correct and also creating an opportunity for large institutional buyers to jump in on the renewed momentum.\nBefore you consider ON, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "CoreWeave's $9 Billion Power Play for Core Scientific", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/coreweaves-9-billion-power-play-for-core-scientific/", "text": "CoreWeave Today\n$138.29 -14.76 (-9.64%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $33.51\n▼\n$187.00 - Price Target\n- $74.59\nAI infrastructure leader CoreWeave, Inc. NASDAQ: CRWV has announced a $9.0 billion, all-stock deal to buy data center operator Core Scientific, Inc. NASDAQ: CORZ.\nThe market reacted with immediate skepticism, and CoreWeave’s stock price declined following the news. Investors were clearly concerned that their ownership would be diluted or spread across more shares and that merging the two companies would be difficult.\nWhile the market’s short-term concerns are understandable, they miss the bigger picture. This deal is a bold, strategic move by CoreWeave to control the most critical resource for the future of artificial intelligence (AI): power. For investors with a long-term view, this acquisition makes sense.\nFrom Renter to Owner: Securing the AI Fuel Line\nThe AI industry runs on electricity. High-performance computer chips, such as the NVIDIA GB200 Blackwell hardware used by CoreWeave, are incredibly power-hungry. This has sparked a global race for data center space, and more importantly, the energy required to operate them. Instead of staying in that race, CoreWeave has decided to own the racetrack.\nBy acquiring Core Scientific, CoreWeave gains direct control over a substantial portfolio of data centers, featuring approximately 1.3 gigawatts (GW) of power already in place. It also secures access to another 1 GW or more for future growth.\nThis is a game-changer.\nIt moves CoreWeave from being just another customer renting space to an owner with a secure power supply, giving it a major advantage over competitors. In this acquisition, the company gains not only Core Scientific's facilities but also its experienced talent. Core Scientific's team brings over 150 years of combined expertise in data center construction and management, significantly mitigating the risks associated with expanding into this new role.\nThe Price of Power: How the Deal Pays for Itself\nWhile issuing new stock spreads ownership out, this deal's financial benefits are clear and powerful. CoreWeave is using its valuable stock to purchase physical assets that are difficult to build and essential for growth. This deal converts a substantial future bill into an asset that CoreWeave now owns.\nThe company expects the acquisition to deliver significant financial wins over the long run:\n- It will eliminate the need to pay over $10 billion in future data center lease costs.\n- It is projected to create $500 million in annual cost savings by the end of 2027.\nCoreWeave was already Core Scientific’s biggest customer. By purchasing the company, CoreWeave is essentially paying itself instead of a landlord. This move is designed to create a more profitable and predictable business model for years to come.\nThe Hidden Value in Core Scientific's Business\nCoreWeave Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$74.59-46.06% DownsideHoldBased on 23 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $138.29 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $150.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $74.59 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $36.00 |\n|---|\nCoreWeave Stock Forecast Details\nAny concern that CoreWeave is acquiring a volatile Bitcoin mining company overlooks a key fact: Core Scientific is already undergoing a business transformation. The company has been actively converting its older facilities into modern, high-density data centers, which are ideal for AI customers.\nIts work at its Denton, Texas, facility shows this transition plan is already in motion and working.\nThe value of this shift is evident in Core Scientific's financial results. For the first quarter of 2025, its old crypto-mining business had a gross margin of only 9%.\nHowever, its new high-density colocation and digital assets business, which CoreWeave is most interested in, showed a much stronger gross margin of 46%.\nThis shows that CoreWeave is limiting its risk by acquiring a partner to accelerate a business line that is already proving to be more profitable.\nA Long-Term Opportunity in a Short-Term Dip?\nFor those willing to look past the market's initial uncertainty, this acquisition strengthens CoreWeave's position as a leader in the AI industry. The short-term stock drop may even present a compelling entry point for long-term investors who believe in the company’s vision.\nOf course, the success of the deal will depend on how well it is managed. Investors should keep an eye on a few key areas in the company’s upcoming quarterly reports:\n- Conversion Speed: Look for updates on how quickly the company is turning old mining sites into modern AI data centers.\n- Company Margins: Watch for improvements in CoreWeave’s overall operating margins as the cost savings from the deal begin to take effect.\n- Savings Targets: Listen for confirmation from management that the company is on track to hit its goal of $500 million in annual savings.\nThis is a bold move by CoreWeave. In securing its power infrastructure, the company is building a foundation for future growth that few of its competitors will be able to match.\nBefore you consider CoreWeave, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

The company’s goal is to launch at least ten new projects, including critical locations in the Permian, Guyana, and Indonesia, which are forecasted to add $3 billion to the bottom line this year, with further growth expected next year.\nAnalysts' Sentiment Firms Ahead of Arbitration Announcement\nExxonMobil has a catalyst in an upcoming arbitration announcement that could significantly boost its stock price, regardless of the outcome. The arbitrator has decided the claims regarding the Hess NYSE: HES/Chevron NYSE: CVX merger and will announce the decision soon. The outcome will either allow the Hess/Chevron merger to advance, have little impact on Exxon, or not, which opens the door to another growth opportunity.\nExxon’s claim is for the right of first refusal; if the decision is in its favor, the company can add another substantial block to its Guyana portfolio, further increasing oil production.\nThe analysts' sentiment trends reflect a high and rising level of confidence in this company. The trends include increased coverage compared to 2024, firming sentiment with a consensus rating pegged at Moderate Buy, and a steady price target forecasting a 10% upside at the midpoint. The $125.50 target is a significant technical level, aligning with the top of the existing trading range and likely serving as a pivot point for this market.\nThe Q2 earnings report is another likely catalyst to drive this stock higher. Analysts are forecasting a substantial 14% decline in revenue and tighter margins, despite resilient economic data and consumer habits. Labor and spending data reflect year-over-year gains, a driving force behind U.S. economic activity, positioning the company to outperform its estimates.\nExxonMobil’s Capital Return Is Safe for 2025\nExxon Mobil Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$125.559.25% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 22 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $114.92 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $144.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $125.55 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $105.00 |\n|---|\nExxon Mobil Stock Forecast Details\nExxonMobil broke industry trend when it affirmed the pace of buybacks would continue in 2025. Others, like Chevron, reduced or suspended their buybacks in response to tightening margins and cash flow.\nThere is some risk for ExxonMobil investors, as Q1 capital returns outpaced net income; however, the shortfall is offset by sufficient cash flow and free cash flow, which enable the maintenance of balance sheet health while capital is returned to shareholders and new projects are developed.\nThe capital return is substantial, including the dividend, which yields about 3.5% at mid-year. The buybacks are also considerable, equalling roughly 1% of the market cap with the stock trading near $110.\nThe primary risk is that the pace of buybacks will slow, but that isn’t expected until the next fiscal year, if at all.\nRegardless of the pace, buybacks positively influence shareholder value and will help leverage the stock price to new highs over time.\nInstitutional Support for ExxonMobil Is Strong in 2025\nThe institutional trends indicate that support for ExxonMobil is expected to remain strong in 2025. The data reported by MarketBeat indicates that ownership exceeds 60% and has been increasing on a quarterly basis this year. This is a tailwind for the market that can help it rise over the long term and diminish the impact of pullbacks when they occur.\nThe chart action reveals the cumulative support of analysts and institutions. The price has trended sideways within a narrow range since 2022, showing consistent support at the $110 level, sufficient for the long-term EMAs to catch up with it. The long-term EMAs are a critical factor that is likely to push the price action higher over time. Resistance at the range’s top could be tested before the end of the year.\nBefore you consider Exxon Mobil, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

For businesses, the effects will be significant: the Act makes permanent tax breaks from 2017's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and allows companies new write-offs for equipment, manufacturing facilities, research and development, and more.\nWith the regulatory landscape shifting rapidly, investors may be looking for new investment targets, companies poised to benefit from the passage of the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" Three firms to consider represent the U.S. chipmaking, automotive, and coal industries.\nDomestic Chip Manufacturing Tax Credit Could Fit Well for Intel\nIntel Today\n$23.82 +0.38 (+1.62%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $17.67\n▼\n$37.16 - Price Target\n- $21.76\nChipmakers with a focus on U.S. production stand to benefit from the bill, which expands incentives from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. Companies like Intel Corp. NASDAQ: INTC could now receive tax credits of 35% instead of the previous 25% for expanding advanced manufacturing in the United States before the 2026 deadline.\nWhile other semiconductor firms could also reap this reward, Intel might be in a unique position to do so based on its recent demonstrations of financial discipline. The company's announcement in June 2025 that it would shut down its automotive processor unit, which investors cheered with a bump in share price on the bet that it would mean greater focus on core PC, data center, and AI business, is the latest.\nGiven investor concerns about Intel's financial health, the legacy tech giant is demonstrating its ability to pivot and to streamline operations while reducing costs. A boosted tax credit for U.S. semiconductor manufacturing could fit in nicely with this shift.\nThough analysts remain cautious, with the large majority encouraging a Hold on INTC shares, investors might watch for a more aggressive move from Intel in response to the bill.\nFord's Non-EV Business Could Get a Boost\nFord Motor Today\nFFord Motor\n$11.91 +0.08 (+0.68%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $8.44\n▼\n$14.85 - Dividend Yield\n- 5.04%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 9.53\n- Price Target\n- $10.03\nFord Motor Co. NYSE: F has experienced both highs and lows recently, despite the fact that overall sales rose by an impressive 14.2% year-over-year (YOY) in the second quarter, well above predictions industrywide, the company's big bet on EVs has largely failed to materialize. Ford has struggled to move its fully-electric models, which experienced a YOY sales decline of more than 31% for the same period, as price tags remain out of reach for many customers.\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill may benefit Ford, although in a way that the company is not necessarily seeking. The bill ends most tax credit incentives for buyers of EVs, a move that will almost certainly further hinder Ford's efforts to expand into the electric space. On the other hand, it does introduce some incentives that could further bolster sales of traditional vehicles, including an auto-loan interest deduction for U.S.-assembled vehicles and a higher SALT cap which may boost purchasing power for customers in coastal states.\nFord has made clear its commitment to EV technology—the company recently indicated it would continue to move forward with a $3-billion battery plant which may no longer be eligible for tax incentives following the bill's passage—but the company may experience better short-term success with a focus on traditional vehicles.\nCoal Is Back?\nCore Natural Resources Today\nCNRCore Natural Resources\n$72.39 +3.31 (+4.79%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $58.19\n▼\n$134.59 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.55%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 14.96\n- Price Target\n- $120.40\nOne of the most polarizing parts of the One Big Beautiful Bill is its focus on removing incentives for renewable energy in favor of new benefits for the seemingly antiquated coal industry. Core Natural Resources NYSE: CNR may be primed to reap these rewards, as a key producer of metallurgical and thermal coal,\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill introduces many potential benefits to coal companies like CNR, including easier access to federal leases which should facilitate quicker and cheaper ramping up of extraction projects, the opening of new acreage to coal mining, reduced operational costs through lowered royalties, and a direct financial subsidy in the form of a met coal tax credit.\nThese benefits may be particularly attractive to Core Natural Resources investors as the company has recently shuttered its Leer South operations in West Virginia for a second time over combustion concerns. Analysts are bullish on CNR, with all five providing a Buy rating for the stock and a consensus price target suggesting upside potential around two-thirds higher than the current price.\nBefore you consider Intel, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

The company currently operates in 18 states, but is looking to add a handful of locations in new markets by year’s end, including Atlanta, Baton Rouge, Charleston, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis. That eastward expansion follows the recent opening of 17 new stores in Florida, which represent the company’s first locations along the eastern seaboard.\nDutch Bros now boasts 1,012 shops in total, and according to CEO Christine Barone, it should be operating in 22 states by year’s end.\nAt most locations, the company offers only beverages, ranging from coffee and chai to energy drinks and smoothies. But in 2026, Dutch Bros plans to expand its menu offerings to include snacks like muffins and granola bars. As the company continues to hyperscale, its fundamentals support the argument being made by Wall Street analysts, the majority of whom assign BROS a Buy rating.\nBROS’ Financials Continue to Roast Skeptics\nCritical to the consumer discretionary company’s recent success has been the acquisition of Venki Krishnababu, a former executive with Lululemon Athletica NASDAQ: LULU, who has served as Dutch Bros’ chief technology and information officer since December 2024.\nKrishnababu has played an integral role in the company’s mobile ordering and rewards programs—two business segments that have been credited with sizable impacts on Dutch Bros’ top-line success. Specifically, the company has averaged 39.17% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth since 2020.\nDutch Bros is now the fastest-growing coffee retailer in the United States when measured by revenue growth. While last year’s total revenue of $1.28 billion was a record for the company, that figure pales in comparison to industry leader Starbucks’ $36.18 billion in total revenue last year.\nHowever, Starbucks only saw YOY revenue growth of 0.55%, underscoring how impressive Dutch Bros’ rapid expansion has been. That growth resulted in earnings per share (EPS) of 10 cents in Q1 2025, up from two cents in Q4 2024. The company has now beaten earnings for 11 consecutive quarters, while seeing annual EPS growth of 1,033.33% YOY from 2023 to 2024.\nFree cash flow (FCF) growth metrics have rewarded shareholders. In 2022, as a result of implementing its hyperscaling strategy, Dutch Bros posted a negative FCF of $128 million. In 2023, the negative FCF of $88.54 million marked a 30.82% improvement. Last year, FCF was a positive $24.69 million, meaning that from 2022 to 2024, FCF increased by 119.28%. Over the same period, Starbucks saw FCF increase by just 29.68%.\nTechnicals Favor a Breakout During Earnings Season\nBROS hit its all-time high on Feb. 18, exceeding Wall Street’s then-12-month price target 32 trading days into 2025. The stock has since corrected and is now down 21% from that high. But like many U.S. equities, Dutch Bros bottomed in early April. After hitting its YTD low, shares are up nearly 31%.\nThe stock has been consolidating since May, trading sideways in a range between $60 and $73. However, zooming out on a one-year chart, it is evident that a symmetrical triangle pattern has emerged, with trend lines exhibiting lower highs and higher lows.\nAs the channel compresses, BROS could break out in either direction near the terminus of this pattern, which is likely to coincide with the next earnings season. That breakout could be to the upside if earnings are strong and momentum is bullish; conversely, if the company misses on Wall Street estimates, the stock could break the pattern to the downside. Dutch Bros is expected to next report on Aug. 6.\nBefore you consider Dutch Bros, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Dutch Bros wasn't on the list.\nWhile Dutch Bros currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nThinking about investing in Meta, Roblox, or Unity?

{"title": "D-Wave Is Rising Again Despite Dilution—What’s the Deal?", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/d-wave-is-rising-again-despite-dilutionwhats-the-deal/", "text": "D-Wave Quantum Today\n$16.02 -0.37 (-2.23%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $0.75\n▼\n$19.77 - Price Target\n- $14.38\nAs quantum computing leader D-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS announced the completion of its $400-million at-the-market equity offering, the company's share price spiked by more than 19% in under a week.\nThe offering, which poses a risk of dilution for D-Wave shareholders, seems to have generated, or at least coincided with, a new rush of enthusiasm for the company and its quantum annealing technology.\nSo what might be underlying this recent spike, and is it likely to continue?\nDilution vs. Cash Influx\nDespite the risk of dilution that comes with an at-the-market offering, the flip side to this equity issuance is a significant influx of cash that bolsters D-Wave's position. The ATM offering raised about $15.18 per share on average, bringing D-Wave's cash reserves to an estimated $815 million.\nWith cash holdings approaching $1 billion, D-Wave now appears to have the strongest balance sheet among its peers, that is, among smaller quantum-focused companies, not major tech firms also exploring the space.\nInvestors may also be heartened by the high average sale price, which came in at a premium of 149% over the average per-share price of $6.10 from the company's last ATM offering in January 2025. This would seem to suggest that investors believe D-Wave's reasonable per-share value has substantially increased in less than half a year.\nCash Can Continue to Drive Major Developments\nAnother reason investors may have rewarded D-Wave with a price bump upon news of the completion of the equity offering comes down to the company's recent track record of utilizing its reserves well. D-Wave's technological advances have come quickly in recent months, from the firm's apparent quantum supremacy achievement back in March to its more recent breakthrough Advantage2 processor, available via cloud as well as on-site deployment.\nThe firm is also using its cash to support key strategic partnerships that have the potential to expand D-Wave's business globally. Most notably, the firm's deals with South Korea's Yonsei University and Incheon City, Germany's Jülich Center, and Japanese mobile services provider Docomo may benefit from additional cash reserves.\nThe Greatest Advantage of All Is Time\nD-Wave Quantum Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$14.38-10.30% DownsideBuyBased on 8 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $16.03 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $20.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $14.38 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $3.00 |\n|---|\nD-Wave Quantum Stock Forecast Details\nHowever, the most significant benefit of an influx of billions of dollars of cash into D-Wave's balance sheet is the time it will afford the company. D-Wave continues to struggle with profitability. Its revenue has grown at a rapid pace in terms of percent increases, but remains quite small on an absolute scale—in the latest reported quarter, D-Wave noted just $15 million in quarterly revenue.\nFor the time being, D-Wave is relying primarily on one-off purchases of its major quantum computing products to drive revenue. While a small number of these sales is enough to continue to grow revenue from quarter to quarter, it is only an intermediary step toward more widespread adoption of D-Wave's quantum tech.\nInvestors optimistic about the firm's prospects in this area will likely point to a roughly 500% year-over-year increase in bookings for the fourth quarter of 2024, suggesting that continued revenue growth is likely to come down the line as enterprise and government contracts are fulfilled.\nFrom this perspective, as long as D-Wave maintains sufficient cash to continue operations and further its technological advances, the company may be well on its way to a much more substantive revenue flow.\nCaution Is Still Warranted\nOn the other hand, D-Wave skeptics may point to key technological developments by some of the company's competitors that suggest that its annealing technology may have more limited applications than once thought. If this is the case, D-Wave's early lead over some of its smaller rivals may evaporate once quantum technology becomes widely commercially viable.\nSimilarly, there remains a lack of consensus around just how long it will take for quantum computing tech to be commercially appealing at all. Some of the more pessimistic estimates suggest that this may still be many years away—if so, even firms with cash reserves as robust as D-Wave's may have a difficult path ahead to sustain themselves in the interim.\nFinally, D-Wave's high price-to-sales ratio and other value metrics suggest the possibility that shares are already overvalued, a concern that dilution due to at-the-market offerings is not going to lessen.\nBefore you consider D-Wave Quantum, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

When this happens, market share and financial metrics grow large enough that the company’s stock earns its place in the higher ranks of the market, and it stops trading on the under-covered and obscure exchanges of the marketplace.\nDatadog Today\n$137.49 -5.26 (-3.68%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $81.63\n▼\n$170.08 - P/E Ratio\n- 298.90\n- Price Target\n- $144.27\nToday’s example is that of Datadog Inc. NASDAQ: DDOG. This company has grown sufficiently in these key metrics to be included in the broader S&P 500 index, which typically excludes smaller technology stocks like this one.\nDatadog's $53.7 billion company status and rapid financial growth make it an exception. It remains a potential compounder for any investor’s portfolio.\nOf course, now that the stock is trading at new highs, some investors might be wary of buying into this story today, feeling like they missed the boat on this one. However, with a new addition to the index comes great new benefits, some of which will only be amplified by the company's recent financial performance.\nWhat an S&P 500 Addition Truly Means\nAs Datadog becomes part of the S&P 500, institutional investors and big asset managers will be required to purchase the stock in the coming months, since they must allocate a specific percentage of their assets to Datadog.\nMultiplying this effect across billions of dollars' worth of capital can create massive buying pressure for Datadog stock and bring in just the right type of fuel to keep it testing higher and higher prices as well. In fact, some of these institutional buyers were already expecting this event to take place, so they got in ahead of the curb this time.\nThose from UBS Asset Management decided to boost their previous holdings in Datadog stock by 48.3% as of mid-May 2025, bringing their entire stake up to $281.4 million, making them the largest institutional holder today. Once the S&P 500 addition takes effect, investors will notice increased buying from UBS and many other players as well.\nThis mandatory addition will spark the buying, as will the stock’s recent momentum and price action. After a one-month rally of up to 27.8%, Datadog stock now trades at up to 92% of its 52-week high levels with no signs of slowing down.\nIf the stock retests (or breaks) its previous 52-week high price, new institutional buyers will likely start to pile in again as their common momentum strategies are triggered on the buy side of the equation. This is a tailwind that investors need to consider today.\nFundamentals Push on for Datadog Stock\nAll of these bullish factors would be nothing but a nice story without any fundamental backing, which is why investors need to dig a bit deeper into Datadog's financials to really figure out whether the stock can justify all of these positive views and expectations in the coming months.\nDatadog Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$144.274.93% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 31 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $137.49 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $200.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $144.27 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $105.00 |\n|---|\nDatadog Stock Forecast Details\nWhen examining the most recent quarterly earnings results, investors can begin to tick off a checklist of positive developments, enough to put them on the right side of the market this time. Starting with revenue, Datadog reported up to $762 million for the quarter, representing a 25% net growth rate compared to the same quarter last year.\nDouble-digit revenue growth is one thing, but how the company makes this revenue happen is even more important. With 3,770 users generating over $100,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR), it is one of the key metrics technology investors want to see.\nThis means that Datadog receives subscription revenue from its services, creating a very stable and predictable financial environment. This, in turn, enables management to reinvest and manage capital more effectively, as well as for Wall Street analysts to project financials and valuations moving forward.\nThat effect is evident in the company’s operating cash flow measure, which increased to $271.5 million this quarter, compared to $212.3 million for the same quarter a year ago. For technology companies, a growing base of operating cash flow means a suite of added shareholder benefits down the line.\nThis is where wealth compounding begins to take place, as Datadog can use this cash flow to pay down its debts, boost earnings per share (EPS), initiate a stock buyback program, or make new acquisitions to further enhance growth. All told, Datadog has earned its place in the S&P 500, and these metrics should also earn it a place in every investor’s watchlist.\nBefore you consider Datadog, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

The insider selling coincides with the onset of a robust rebound in share prices, and share-based compensation is in play. Sellers include numerous directors, the CEO, and several EVPs, all of whom are eligible. The takeaway is that these executives are taking some money off the table but are raising no red flags by doing so.\nAlthough the four-quarter high in activity is alarming, insiders hold a slim 0.3% stake in the stock, which provides little to no headwind. Other factors, including results, outlook, institutional buying, and analyst recommendations, offset their activity.\nThe stock price outlook centers on the latest results and guidance update. They affirm that the AI boom is spilling over into NVIDIA-adjacent markets due to the accelerating build-out of AI infrastructure. Results included top- and bottom-line outperformance, as well as accelerating growth driven by the data center and HBM markets. HBM memory, specifically that provided by Micron, is critical to the development and applications of advanced AI.\nThe guidance is the driving force for Micron’s stock market in July. The company’s guidance echoes that of NVIDIA, including significant strength in addition to the FQ3 strength and a high probability of being cautious. Micron’s business is being driven by demand for NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA GPUs and Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ: AMD, which is seen as on the cusp of a significant inflection.\nIts GPUs are generally viewed as better for advanced AI due to their favorable power efficiency, superior memory capacity, and total cost of operations—good news for memory supplier Micron. Additionally, normalization in legacy markets is also supporting the outlook, with the last holdouts expected to revert to growth by the end of the calendar year.\nInstitutions Drive Micron Rebound, Analysts Lead Market\nMicron Technology Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$146.4418.95% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 25 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $123.11 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $200.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $146.44 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $67.00 |\n|---|\nMicron Technology Stock Forecast Details\nMicron’s stock price rebound began in early April, shortly after the release of its FQ2 results, driven in large part by the institutions. The institutions took advantage of the tariff-induced sale and netted nearly two shares for each one sold since then.\nThey own approximately 80% of the stock, providing a solid support base with their numbers and a tailwind for price action through their activity. The tailwind is being amplified by analysts who are lifting their ratings and price targets in the wake of the FQ3 release.\nMarketBeat tracked 19 revisions from 24 analysts in June and early July. All were increases, and 100% included a price target revision. The consensus for the new targets is roughly $157, a 25% increase from the $120 level, and the revision trend is likely to continue positively this year.\nWells Fargo says details from the report, including the fact that a single customer accounted for 16% of year-to-date revenue (above their forecast), suggest the upcoming report will be significantly above their initial targets, topping them by more than 50%.\nMicron Uptrend Has Room to Run in 2025\nMicron’s upswing has been robust but is likely not over. The market is pulling back in early July, but the move aligns with an uptrending market and remains above critical support targets. Those are near the $115 level and the top of a trading range established in 2024.\nAmong the indicators of strength is the MACD. It is convergent with the 2025 highs, showing an extreme peak and the strongest momentum on record. The market for MU stock can pull back in this scenario, but is far more likely to extend the rally and set a new all-time high.\nAssuming the market stays above the critical support level, it should be able to regroup quickly and extend the rally, potentially retesting the all-time highs before the year’s end.\nBefore you consider Advanced Micro Devices, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

However, potential headwinds remain, causing some investors to focus on what could happen rather than what will or won’t happen.\nThat’s why investors may take a wait-and-see approach to their investment decisions. Analysts are forecasting an average of 5% year-over-year (YOY) earnings growth for many companies in the S&P 500. There’s good news and bad news in that number.\nThe good news is that growth expectations have increased in recent weeks, particularly among tech stocks. However, the pace of growth is still expected to be markedly slower than in the prior year.\nA key reason for the slowdown is that companies still await certainty around tariffs. The picture has become a little clearer, but until the final numbers are in, companies, analysts, and investors will have a tough time making accurate forecasts.\nOne way to invest around this uncertainty is to look for large-cap, blue-chip companies. These companies have strong balance sheets with strong cash flow and pricing power.\nHere are three stocks that are not only supported by secular growth trends and capable management but are also projected to outpace the broader index in earnings growth during the second half of 2025.\n1. Alphabet: An Undervalued Tech Stock Poised for a Strong Comeback\nAlphabet Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$199.6112.38% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 43 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $177.62 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $240.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $199.61 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $160.00 |\n|---|\nAlphabet Stock Forecast Details\nAlphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL has been one of the worst-performing Magnificent 7 stocks in 2025. The primary concern is how the growth of generative AI will impact the company’s search business.\nThat question will play out over years. However, in the company’s first-quarter earnings report, revenue was up 12% YOY and earnings per share (EPS) were up 49% YOY. That growth was consistent across each of the company’s Services verticals, including YouTube's growing popularity.\nBut the real growth story continues to be in Google Cloud, which is increasing its revenue faster, on a percentage basis, than Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN and Microsoft Corp. NASDAQ: MSFT with their AWS and Azure platforms.\nAlphabet also has next-stage growth levers such as autonomous driving (i.e., Waymo), AI chip development, and quantum computing. The company continues to invest in each of these initiatives while increasing its free cash flow and announcing a $70 billion share buyback.\nThe Alphabet analyst forecasts on MarketBeat give GOOGL stock a consensus price target of $199.95, which is an upside of around 13%. That's slightly below the EPS growth expectations of around 14.8%. The stock becomes even more attractive when you consider it’s trading around 20x forward earnings, which is a discount to itself as well as to many technology stocks.\n2. Eli Lilly: GLP-1 Lead Will Keep Expanding Despite Growing Competition\nEli Lilly and Company Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$1,012.2228.09% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 20 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $790.23 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $1,190.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $1,012.22 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $700.00 |\n|---|\nEli Lilly and Company Stock Forecast Details\nEli Lilly & Co. NYSE: LLY was one of the best-performing stocks in 2024, a year dominated by a narrow group of stocks. The good news for LLY stock investors is that as the breadth of the rally expands to more stocks and sectors, LLY stock looks poised to move even higher.\nWith its Mounjaro and Zepbound GLP-1drugs, the company has built a formidable lead in the GLP-1 category. Eli Lilly is working on an oral version of this treatment that will meet a key patient need.\nInvestors should also focus on Lilly’s pipeline, which includes potential treatments for Alzheimer’s disease and cancer. These two sectors will likely show strong growth over the next decade.\nSince making an all-time high in August 2024, LLY stock is down nearly 15%. However, it’s up nearly 7% since the company delivered its first-quarter earnings, beating YOY revenue and earnings by 45% and 29% respectively. Analysts are projecting earnings growth of more than 34% in the next year. They also give LLY stock a consensus price target of $1,012. That’s a gain of over 31%.\nAt over 62x earnings, Lilly stock trades at a premium to the broader market— but it’s actually trading at a discount to its historical average.\n3. JPMorgan: A Rock-Solid Choice for Uncertain Investors\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.

Stock Forecast Details\nTo many investors, bank stocks are predictable and boring. However, with a total return of over 256% in the last five years, JPMorgan Chase & Co. NYSE: JPM continues to make boring beautiful.\nBanks have benefited from higher interest rates, which have allowed them to post significant gains in net interest income. However, some investors are concerned about putting their money in bank stocks, as the Fed will likely begin cutting rates in 2025.\nBut no matter where interest rates move, the strength of JPMorgan’s balance sheet makes it a winner. If interest rates go lower, JPMorgan will see increased loan growth with less risk of default.\nAmong these three stocks, JPM stock is expected to deliver the most modest earnings growth at 7.2%, still above the S&P average. That’s not unusual for a bank stock. Investors also need to account for the company’s dividend, which has a yield of 1.92%.\nBefore you consider JPMorgan Chase & Co., you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and JPMorgan Chase & Co. wasn't on the list.\nWhile JPMorgan Chase & Co. currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nJust getting into the stock market?

Investor appetite for momentum and speculation has surged as major indices flirt with fresh all-time highs, and several individual names have ridden the wave to extended gains. However, as always, not every rally is built to last permanently, especially when technical indicators begin flashing warning signs.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI), a widely followed momentum gauge, is often used to help market participants spot when a stock may be due for a pullback. Readings above 70 are typically considered overbought, and when they stretch into the high 80s or 90s, it can signal that a near-term pullback is highly likely.\nBelow are three stocks exhibiting signs of being overbought, as indicated by elevated RSI readings, suggesting that investors may want to consider locking in profits.\nWestern Digital Corporation Heats Up as Its RSI Signals Cooling Ahead\nWestern Digital Today\nWDCWestern Digital\n$65.06 +0.42 (+0.65%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $28.83\n▼\n$80.20 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.61%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 12.32\n- Price Target\n- $63.26\nWestern Digital NASDAQ: WDC has been on a strong run in recent weeks, driven by enthusiasm for AI-driven demand for data storage and favorable Q3 earnings released in April. The stock has rallied almost 46% YTD and 128% from its 52-week low.\nWhile the long-term outlook for data infrastructure and storage remains positive, the stock’s technical setup is flashing a potential warning. With an RSI of 87, WDC is deep in overbought territory. The stock has also extended significantly above its mid-to-short-term moving averages, increasing the probability of a near-term pullback or consolidation.\nInvestors might welcome a pullback, however. While the stock is overbought in the near term, it remains undervalued based on its earnings valuation. As of Wednesday’s close, it had a P/E of just 12.5 and a forward P/E of 11.9—quite an impressive statistic given its impressive three-month surge of over 60%.\nSeagate Technology Is Among the Most Technically Stretched\nSeagate Technology Today\nSTXSeagate Technology\n$144.50 +2.49 (+1.75%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $63.19\n▼\n$152.16 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.99%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 20.88\n- Price Target\n- $123.16\nSeagate Technology NASDAQ: STX, another major player in the data storage space, has mirrored Western Digital’s rally. The move has been driven by similar tailwinds surrounding AI infrastructure buildouts and recovering end-market demand. STX shares have jumped more than 76% on the year and 140% from their 52-week low, setting new yearly highs and drawing substantial volume.\nHowever, with an RSI reading of almost 90, the stock is among the most technically stretched in the market right now. Much like WDC, STX has sharply extended from its key support levels and is showing signs of being overheated from a near-term perspective.\nWhile the company’s fundamentals are improving and AI-related growth remains a long-term tailwind, the stock’s short-term risk-reward profile is starting to look less favorable. A period of digestion or a pullback toward the $130 range wouldn’t be out of the question, especially as investors potentially look to de-risk and lock in some profits along the way.\nSezzle Inc.

In 2025, there could be an amendment to that statement: Never doubt the consumer, especially when they are determined to travel.\nAccording to the IATA (International Air Transport Association), global air passenger traffic increased 15% year-over-year in the first half of 2025, with Asia-Pacific and Europe posting the strongest growth.\nThis surge in international travel comes despite the U.S. dollar falling nearly 10%, its worst first-half performance since 1972. A weaker dollar makes international travel more expensive and should put pressure on consumer discretionary stocks.\nBut the dollar’s weakness is being offset by strong wage growth in the United States. This increase in income, coupled with pent-up demand from for international destinations that weren’t accessible several years ago, is fueling a robust travel market.\nAs we move into the second half of 2025, these three stocks may offer promising gains for investors looking to capitalize on the enduring appetite for travel.\n1. Booking Holdings: AI-Powered Growth Justifies Premium Price Tag\nBooking Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$5,415.00-5.31% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 31 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $5,718.51 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $6,100.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $5,415.00 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $4,200.00 |\n|---|\nBooking Stock Forecast Details\nBooking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG) is an expensive stock by most measures. In addition to trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio above its historical averages, BKNG stock now trades for over $5,600 per share. That turns off some retail investors.\nHowever, the company continues to justify its premium valuation with growth. In its most recent quarter, the company beat earnings expectations by nearly 30%. That underscores Booking Holdings’ pricing power, increasingly driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and reflected in its impressive 86% gross margins.\nFor skeptics needing more convincing, the second and third quarters are typically Booking’s strongest periods, driven by demand for travel to Asia Pacific and Europe.\nWith the share price at its current level, some investors are hoping for a stock split. However, management has said there are no plans to take such action and instead focuses on share buybacks.\n2.

And in the first quarter of 2025, Marriott International Inc. NYSE: MAR reported that its global RevPAR was up approximately 4%, with international (defined as outside of the U.S. and Canada, Marriott’s largest markets) up more than 6%. The growth was particularly strong in Asia Pacific.\nWhile U.S. demand shows signs of moderation, Marriott’s diverse brand portfolio and expansion in luxury and upscale properties allow it to pivot toward less price-sensitive consumers.\nMAR stock recently broke above a three-month high and is now trading near its 20-day simple moving average. However, this appears to be driven more by sector-wide momentum and possible end-of-quarter rebalancing than by company-specific catalysts. The next catalyst for the stock is likely to come from its quarterly earnings report on July 30.\n3.

NYSE: RCL is one of the best-performing stocks in the sector. RCL stock is up more than 106% in the last 12 months and over 40% in 2025 alone. The company caters to a higher-end consumer willing to pay premium prices for the cruise line’s newer ships and longer itineraries.\nInvestors are particularly pleased with Royal Caribbean’s significant debt reduction efforts. In 2024, the company refinanced approximately $3 billion in short-term debt and repaid about $2.1 billion in principal on the strength of its operating cash flow and robust bookings.\nThose actions have pushed Royal Caribbean’s debt-to-equity ratio down to 2.21, more than 60% lower than its 2022 peak.

{"title": "Correction Equals Opportunity in Domino’s Pizza Stock", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/correction-equals-opportunity-in-dominos-pizza-stock/", "text": "Domino's Pizza Today\nDPZDomino's Pizza\n$469.92 +6.44 (+1.39%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $396.06\n▼\n$500.55 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.48%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 26.94\n- Price Target\n- $487.33\nFinancial markets typically see increased sensitivity to any and all news when valuations reach a point where doubt and justification need to cross thresholds in order to stop tipping points in any direction. With the S&P 500 now trading at all-time highs, most stocks within the index remain as sensitive as ever to news, regardless of whether it has any material impact on the business's future or not.\nThis is where a focus on fundamentals comes in handy, as investors can lean on the factors that have survived the test of time in keeping stock prices afloat even if negativity overwhelms them, which is exactly why investors need to look within the business fundamentals of Domino’s Pizza Inc. NASDAQ: DPZ as the stock goes on a downtrend recently on what may not be bad news after all.\nThe company’s CEO decided to unexpectedly leave his post for Domino’s Pizza, which may be news to retail investors. Still, it appears that the information had already been public for some time. Judging by the stock’s price action, it is not too far-fetched for investors to think that someone (or a group of investors) had the inside information before it became public, but what happens next is just as important as the news release.\nWhy a New CEO Won’t Change Much for Domino’s Pizza\nThe reason for leaving is not clear, and it likely never will be, but that doesn’t matter. What matters is that Domino’s Pizza has been in business long enough to enter an ex-growth phase, which is the typical path for companies of this maturity. That also means leadership roles are more of a formality than a necessity.\nThis is not to say that a CEO is not necessary. Still, this business can run effectively on its own, considering the significant market share and brand recognition it has achieved over the years. Unless the company plans to change its business model or product radically, investors don’t have much to worry about when it comes to a change in CEO.\nThat being said, it is time to dig deeper, past the business model and its current position in the retail sector. This stock has historically been seen as safe due to the underlying stability and non-cyclicality of the pizza industry. That same dynamic makes it hard for other names to start competing with this leader.\nIn fact, the only real competitor to Domino’s Pizza is Papa John’s International Inc. NASDAQ: PZZA, although the market capitalization gap between the two may be the answer investors need. Domino’s Pizza’s market capitalization is just under $16 billion, while Papa John’s is only $1.6 billion, nearly ten times smaller.\nThis size advantage enables Domino’s Pizza to more easily navigate today's challenging environments, characterized by cost inflation and trade dynamics between the United States and other nations. More than that, it allows for the main financial benefits likely to quiet most (if not all) of the fears currently associated with this news release.\nWhy Investors Should Look to Domino’s Pizza\nDomino's Pizza Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$487.333.71% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 25 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $469.92 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $564.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $487.33 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $340.00 |\n|---|\nDomino's Pizza Stock Forecast Details\nBuilding on the company’s size and brand reach, investors can quickly quantify these benefits in the financials, where a net income margin of up to 14% stands above the average for a retail stock. However, that is only the beginning. Since Domino’s Pizza also has a gross margin of 28.4%, this net margin is only expected to remain stable.\nWhat that translates into is a steady path for increasing earnings per share (EPS), which is where the true meaning of a wealth compounder comes into play. In fact, Wall Street analysts now expect to see up to $5.62 in EPS for the fourth quarter of 2025, which implies a net growth rate of 30% from today’s reported $4.33.\nAs most investors know, where EPS growth goes, so does the stock price. That is precisely why they should pay attention to this short-term dip and realize that a change in CEO likely won’t have any material impact on the company’s rock-solid margins and EPS growth trajectory.\nAnother benefit of the stock now being down to 90% of its 52-week high is that it is in an official correction territory. This may lead some institutional players to come in and support the price back to its previous highs (or even higher). Speaking of which, those from Marshfield Associates decided to build up a stake worth $329.4 million as of mid-May 2025.\nLast but not least, there is still a high level of conviction emanating from Wall Street. Royal Bank of Canada analyst Logan Reich has decided to reiterate his Outperform rating on Domino’s Pizza stock, alongside a price target of $550 per share. The fact that this valuation was set (and not changed) since late April 2025 indicates that analysts remain committed to this being the likely outcome for the stock.\nThat outcome would imply an additional 22% upside for investors who take advantage of this correction, which has proven to be driven by immaterial news regarding the company's future financial growth.\nBefore you consider Domino's Pizza, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Why Freeport-McMoRan Is The Copper King in a Tight Market", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-freeport-mcmoran-is-the-copper-king-in-a-tight-market/", "text": "Freeport-McMoRan Today\nFCXFreeport-McMoRan\n$47.19 +1.60 (+3.51%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $27.66\n▼\n$52.61 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.64%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 39.00\n- Price Target\n- $50.64\nIndustry analysts are intensifying their discussion, and the message is clear: the world is facing a structural, long-term copper shortage. This trend will not resolve itself anytime soon; it is a fundamental market shift driven by powerful, irreversible forces. The global transition to a green economy requires staggering amounts of the red metal to build electric vehicles, erect wind and solar farms, and modernize aging power grids.\nLayered on top of this established demand is a new, explosive catalyst: the build-out of artificial intelligence (AI). The data centers that power AI are incredibly energy-intensive, requiring vast networks of copper wiring for power distribution and cooling. As these two massive trends accelerate, the demand for copper is set to surge. A premier global producer like Freeport-McMoRan Inc. NYSE: FCX is uniquely positioned to benefit.\nFrom Market Squeeze to Profit Engine\nThe compelling case for higher copper prices rests on a simple economic principle: demand is set to outpace supply. The supply side faces significant and persistent challenges. Discovering and developing new, large-scale copper deposits is an incredibly slow and expensive undertaking.\nNavigating permitting hurdles, securing financing, and building the necessary infrastructure to bring a new mine online often takes over a decade.\nFurthermore, many of the world’s major existing mines are nearing the end of their productive life. This means they are processing lower-quality ore, which requires more energy and resources to produce the same amount of finished copper. This dynamic is already visible in the market, with physical inventories in key global warehouses like the London Metal Exchange (LME) falling to multi-month lows, a clear signal of a tight physical supply.\nThis environment is where Freeport-McMoRan’s (FCX) market leadership becomes a critical advantage for investors. The company is a titan in the industry, with sales guidance for 2025 of approximately 4.0 billion pounds of copper. This immense scale means FCX is a central player poised to capture the upside from higher prices. This benefit is then magnified through the powerful financial concept of operational leverage.\nIn a capital-intensive sector like mining, many costs are fixed regardless of the commodity’s price. Once those base costs are covered, each incremental dollar from a higher copper price disproportionately impacts the bottom line.\n- A Low-Cost Operation: Freeport-McMoRan runs an efficient enterprise, reporting an average net cash cost of just $1.65 per pound of copper in the first quarter of 2025.\n- A Multiplier Effect on Profit: For every cent the market price of copper rises above this cost structure, the profit flows directly to the company. To put this in perspective, a sustained $0.25 per pound increase in the price of copper could translate into approximately $1 billion of additional annual operating cash flow for FCX, based on its sales guidance.\nFurther strengthening its financial profile is the company’s significant gold production. With guidance for roughly 1.6 million ounces in 2025 sales, this valuable secondary revenue stream provides an additional source of cash flow. Gold often acts as a safe-haven asset, adding a layer of financial resilience to the company’s operations.\nThe Fortress Balance Sheet Fueling Shareholder Value\nFreeport-McMoRan Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 0.64%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $0.30\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 24.79%\n- Next Dividend Payment\n- Aug. 1\nFCX Dividend History\nA company’s ability to fully capitalize on a commodity boom depends heavily on its financial health. In the cyclical mining industry, a strong balance sheet is more than a defensive tool; it is an offensive weapon. Through years of disciplined capital management, Freeport-McMoRan has built exactly that.\nThe company’s low debt-to-equity ratio (D/E) of 0.30 is a key indicator of its financial prudence. This strength insulates it from market volatility, allowing it to fund growth opportunities without relying on expensive debt.\nThis translates into lower risk and greater confidence in the company's long-term strategy for investors. This solid foundation allows management to turn rising profits into direct shareholder returns.\nThe company’s commitment to its investors is evident in its capital allocation plan. It pays a reliable quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Additionally, the board has authorized a multi-billion-dollar share repurchase program.\nThis provides management with another powerful tool to return capital, as buybacks reduce the number of outstanding shares and, in turn, increase each remaining share's claim on the company's earnings.\nSizing Up the Opportunity\nFreeport-McMoRan Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$50.647.32% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 18 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $47.19 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $58.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $50.64 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $39.00 |\n|---|\nFreeport-McMoRan Stock Forecast Details\nThe investment case for Freeport-McMoRan is built on the powerful combination of a structural copper deficit and the company's exceptional operational leverage.\nWall Street shares this positive outlook, where the stock carries a Moderate Buy consensus rating from analysts. Furthermore, its price-to-earnings-growth ratio (PEG) of 0.84 suggests that its valuation appears reasonable compared to its strong future growth prospects.\nWhile all mining stocks carry inherent risks tied to commodity price volatility, Freeport-McMoRan’s mix of market leadership, cost discipline, and financial fortitude makes it a premier blue-chip company.\nFor investors looking for direct and meaningful exposure to the long-term copper narrative, FCX presents a compelling, fundamentals-driven case.\nBefore you consider Freeport-McMoRan, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "3 Defense Leaders Set to Gain From Rising Military Spend", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-defense-leaders-set-to-gain-from-rising-military-spend/", "text": "Many investors have been piling into defense stocks in the first half of 2025. The last four years have brought escalating geopolitical tensions, including Russia’s war with Ukraine, Israel fighting a two-front war in Gaza and Iran.\nThere is also ongoing concern about China’s intentions regarding Taiwan and what that would mean for the United States.\nWhile military conflicts are not new, the unprecedented scale and scope of global defense spending commitments strengthen the bullish case for defense stocks today. According to SIPRI (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute), global military spending increased to $2.4 trillion in 2024. In 2025, European countries increased defense budgets at the fastest pace since the 1950s.\nHowever, the leader is still the United States. The annual Department of Defense budget is proposed to rise about 4% for FY2025, reaching $849 billion. But when combined with supplemental spending measures and projected increases into FY2026, defense funding could approach $1 trillion per year.\nFurthermore, these are multi-year commitments that include significant funds for modernizing the defense industry, including space, cybersecurity, and unmanned systems.\nSome investors are choosing to look at low-priced stocks with upside.

NYSE: LMT is the world’s largest defense contractor, but that’s not the only reason it makes this list. In fact, LMT stock is down about 5% this year after the company announced $2 billion in classified program losses and a delay in its F-35 fighter program.\nThe company’s core programs include missile defense systems, space systems, and hypersonic weapons. The company has also made significant investments in AI-enabled mission systems, autonomous helicopters, and satellite networks. That means Lockheed Martin is well-positioned for the future of defense.\nBut does that mean the stock is a good buy right now? At 17x forward earnings, LMT stock is trading at a discount to its historical average. Analysts are also projecting earnings growth of around 9.3% in the next 12 months.\nThat coincides with the consensus price of $541.80, which offers about 17% upside. The dividend yield is 2.87%, which has increased for 22 consecutive years and will likely rise again in 2025.\nGeneral Dynamics Has Already Scored Big Wins\nGeneral Dynamics Today\nGDGeneral Dynamics\n$303.34 +3.38 (+1.13%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $239.20\n▼\n$316.90 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.98%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 21.04\n- Price Target\n- $294.47\nGeneral Dynamics NYSE: GD is a defense jack-of-all-trades. The company’s revenue streams include combat vehicles (notably the Abrams tank), nuclear submarines, and IT and cybersecurity services.\nGeneral Dynamics reaches across all areas of the defense sector. That reach has been on display in several notable contracts:\n- A $1.85 billion contract modification for Virginia-class Block VI submarines\n- A $150 million contract from the U.S. Department of Defense for the Abrams Engineering Program\n- A $580 million task order to maintain force protection systems for U.S. Army bases worldwide, ensuring the security of military installations\n- A $57.8 million contract for submarine valves\nThe common theme of these contracts is the U.S. military's intention to upgrade its defense infrastructure.\nGD stock is trading slightly above its consensus target, and at around 19x forward earnings, it's valued fairly compared to its historical averages.

At around $252 per share, some analysts believe that the stock is due for a pullback. The one-month price chart for LHX stock shows early signs of consolidation, but the company may surprise investors to the upside.\nThat’s because the U.S. military plans to build a “Golden Dome” defense system. There is no money specifically earmarked for the project in the current spending bill going through Congress. However, analysts estimate that over $1 billion in related programs could ultimately support a “Golden Dome”-style homeland defense initiative.\nThis spending would be in areas such as secure communications, sensor fusion, and electronic warfare, all of which would benefit L3Harris.\nAnalysts are only forecasting about 2.5% upside for LHX stock after its run-up in 2025. However, Citigroup Inc. NYSE: C boosted its price target from $245 to $280 in June. Plus, at 22x forward earnings, LHX stock is trading at a moderate discount to its historical value.\nBefore you consider L3Harris Technologies, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "The Apple Comeback Will Be Better Than the Setback", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/the-apple-comeback-will-be-better-than-the-setback/", "text": "Apple Today\n$212.41 +1.27 (+0.60%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $169.21\n▼\n$260.10 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.49%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 33.09\n- Price Target\n- $235.27\nWith the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100 indexes now sitting at new all-time highs relatively undisturbed, it makes sense to see some of the best companies in the United States economy start to go on a sort of “meltdown” mode for the coming months and quarters. This is exactly where the best opportunity will be for those investors who know what they are looking for.\nMore speculative growth names in the sector have stolen the spotlight from the fundamentally sound stocks. This divergence in attention (and capital) only creates a gap to be filled, and that is where patience will come into play, lest a sound portfolio fall victim to the usual fear of missing out that prevails during all-time high cycles.\nOne of the best names to fit this description, both in terms of gaps to be filled and upside opportunities to be had, is Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL, a darling of the industry and culture alike. Apple is a leader in many areas of technology, from hardware to software, across the global economy, to the extent that it has almost become a commodity in itself, and one that investors will likely hold much better than replace with uncertain growth names.\nWhere Apple Stock Stands in Terms of Price\nThis is where price action becomes one of the most important indicators for investors to consider in their stock selection process. While the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 is now sitting on all-time highs, shares of Apple have stood at only 82% of their 52-week high levels, an underperformance that might raise some eyebrows in the investment community.\nA gap of nearly 20% is formed not because of declining fundamentals or any issues with the company or the brand, but due to a root cause that arises in every top cycle. More investors now feel like they missed the boat on semiconductor and artificial intelligence names, seeing peers boasting about their gains on social media and the like.\nFor this reason, few in the market want to put their money to work in Apple, even though it is the best decision today. The stock market often rewards patience, and that is what it takes to hold and profit from the current gap in Apple stock, which is exactly where savvy investors will find this helpful information.\nAs investors will discover, many participants are coming from the so-called “smart money” corner of the market that's already taking advantage of this opportunity. These factors can (and should) act as a pillar of strength for prospective buyers to lean on with a multi-quarter time horizon in mind, especially with all of the tail risks now brewing in the economy.\nThe Market’s Take on Apple Stock Today\nEven though Apple has underperformed the indexes and many other speculative peers in technology, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives was willing to reiterate his Outperform rating on Apple stock as of mid-June 2025. This time, he also placed a $270 per share price target on the company.\nThis view and valuation would not only call for Apple stock to reach a new 52-week high but also imply an additional upside potential of up to 27% from its current trading price, a rare occurrence for a company with a $3.2 trillion market capitalization.\nApple Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$235.2710.76% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 32 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $212.41 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $300.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $235.27 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $170.00 |\n|---|\nApple Stock Forecast Details\nWhether it is the price gap, market share, or the exciting innovations coming from Apple itself, there are more reasons to consider this price a likely outcome in Apple's future, and some are already acting on this lucrative situation.\nAs of late June 2025, institutional buyers from Swedbank decided to boost their holdings in Apple stock by 2.4%. While this may not sound like much on a percentage basis, the addition took their stake to a new high of $4.3 billion today, signaling increased institutional interest as Apple is set to reclaim a new 52-week high in the coming months.\nNot only do the technical factors favor Apple’s rise, but also the fundamentals. Wall Street analysts now expect Apple to report up to $2.34 in earnings per share (EPS) in the first quarter of 2026, representing a jump of up to 42% from today’s reported $1.65 in EPS.\nAs many investors know, where EPS growth goes, so does the stock price performance, therefore laying the foundation for Apple to reach (and even exceed) the upside potential now being called by Daniel Ives. As is always the case, the market itself is still willing to pay a premium valuation for Apple stock, and for good reason.\nBy trading up to 56.6x in a price-to-book (P/B) multiple, Apple is now way ahead of the computer sector’s average 7.1x valuation multiple. Because of its brand and technology moat, Apple commands a steady premium over peers, and the market is often right about overpaying for the names it expects to outperform, but only the patient will reap the rewards here.\nBefore you consider Apple, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Apple wasn't on the list.\nWhile Apple currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nUnlock your free copy of MarketBeat's comprehensive guide to pot stock investing and discover which cannabis companies are poised for growth.

{"title": "How a Government Loan Changes the Game for Plug Power", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/how-a-government-loan-changes-the-game-for-plug-power/", "text": "Plug Power Today\n$1.68 -0.10 (-5.62%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- Price Target\n- $1.83\nFor years, the story surrounding Plug Power NASDAQ: PLUG has been one of ambitious vision shadowed by a persistent question: how would it fund its massive growth plans without perpetually burning cash? That narrative has now fundamentally shifted. The conversation is changing with the finalization of a $1.66 billion conditional loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).\nThis event should serve as powerful government validation of Plug's technology and its central role in America's clean energy future. For investors, the focus now pivots from financing risk to operational execution, potentially recalibrating the stock's long-term value.\nHow $1.66 Billion Changes Everything\nThe DOE loan directly addresses the primary concern that has weighed on Plug Power's stock. It provides a clear financial runway to build out a planned network of up to six green hydrogen production facilities across the United States. For investors, the impact is multifaceted and significant.\n- Lower-Cost Capital: This loan is a much cheaper source of funding than issuing new stock, a process that can be dilutive. Share dilution occurs when a company issues new shares, which reduces the ownership percentage of existing shareholders. By using this loan, Plug Power protects its investors' equity.\n- A Clear Path to Scale: The capital is designated explicitly for building out the company's production network, providing a clear, funded path to achieving commercial scale and reducing reliance on third-party suppliers.\n- Government Endorsement: The DOE's backing signals that Plug Power is a strategic national asset. This validation lends a new layer of credibility to the enterprise, which can be crucial for attracting future partners and customers.\nPlug Power's Production Network Comes Online\nWith a more straightforward funding path, the focus turns to Plug's ability to execute its vertically integrated vision, and recent milestones show tangible progress. The company's goal is to control the entire hydrogen process, from producing the fuel to manufacturing the machines that utilize it. This control is key to improving gross margins, which measure a company’s profitability on the products it sells.\n- Georgia and Louisiana Plants: The company's facility in Georgia is the largest liquid green hydrogen plant in the North American market. Following that success, the new 15-ton-per-day (TPD) facility in Louisiana is now commissioned, bringing Plug's total U.S. production network capacity to approximately 40 TPD.\n- Commercial Validation: In June 2025, Plug signed a multi-year supply agreement with a major U.S. industrial gas company, demonstrating clear commercial demand for the hydrogen produced by these new plants.\n- Next Up - Texas: The green hydrogen plant in Graham, Texas, is slated to be the first project to utilize the DOE loan, with a target to begin drawing funds in late 2025 or early 2026.\nPlug Power CFO’s Share Purchase Signals Executive Confidence\nTwo recent developments provide corroborating evidence for the bullish outlook. First, a U.S. Senate committee advanced the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit Extension Act. This bill, which extends a key tax credit deadline to 2036, provides crucial long-term financial certainty for the very projects the DOE loan will fund.\nSecond, company insiders are signaling a strong belief in Plug's future. In May and June 2025, Plug Power's CFO, Paul Middleton, purchased a combined 1,000,000 shares on the open market. This represents a significant vote of confidence from a top executive with direct insight into the company's financial turnaround. This action is more telling than other pre-scheduled insider sales, signaling genuine bullishness from the C-suite at current price levels.\nA Pivotal Entry Point for Long-Term Investors\nPlug Power Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$1.838.84% UpsideHoldBased on 17 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $1.68 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $4.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $1.83 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $0.50 |\n|---|\nPlug Power Stock Forecast Details\nThe investment case for Plug Power has undergone a critical shift. The primary risk is no longer centered on financial survival. Still, it has pivoted to operational execution, a far more favorable position for a company with operational plants and a funded growth plan. Recent stock volatility suggests the market may not have fully priced in this de-risking event, potentially creating an opportunity.\nInvestors should monitor key metrics in the upcoming quarters, such as continued improvements in gross margin, new commercial contracts, and the successful deployment of DOE loan funds.\nFor those with a multi-year horizon and a desire to invest in the hydrogen energy sector, the combination of government validation, a secured funding path, and clear signs of insider conviction signals that now is an opportune time to cautiously accumulate a position in a leader of the green hydrogen revolution.\nBefore you consider Plug Power, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Plug Power wasn't on the list.\nWhile Plug Power currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nDiscover the 10 Best High-Yield Dividend Stocks for 2025 and secure reliable income in uncertain markets.

{"title": "Qualcomm’s Hold Rating Misses Strong Growth Story", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/qualcomms-hold-rating-misses-strong-growth-story/", "text": "QUALCOMM Today\n$159.09 -0.26 (-0.16%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $120.80\n▼\n$211.09 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.24%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 16.20\n- Price Target\n- $186.39\nA notable disconnect exists between Wall Street's view of Qualcomm NASDAQ: QCOM and the company's actual performance. While its stock carries a consensus Hold rating from most analysts, its recent financial reports show a company firing on all cylinders. This gap between neutral sentiment and strong operational results may present an opportunity for investors to capitalize on.\nQualcomm's investment story is changing. The company is no longer just about smartphones. A closer examination of its financial results reveals successful diversification into new, high-growth sectors.\nThis progress suggests that Qualcomm’s current stock price may not fully reflect its stronger, more balanced business.\nHow New Tech Wins Are Reshaping Qualcomm's Future\nQualcomm's plan to expand beyond its core handset business has proven successful. This is a current reality driving significant financial growth, as shown in the company's fiscal second-quarter 2025 earnings report.\nThe automotive division is a clear standout. Revenue from this segment increased substantially by 59% year-over-year to $959 million. This growth comes from the broad adoption of Qualcomm's Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform. This technology powers everything from in-car infotainment to advanced driver-assistance features in vehicles from major global automakers.\nCritically, the company reports an automotive design-win pipeline that now exceeds $45 billion. This pipeline represents the estimated value of future product orders, providing investors with a clear view of a long-term, sustainable revenue stream.\nAt the same time, the Internet of Things (IoT) segment has become another powerful growth engine. Its revenue climbed 27% year-over-year to $1.58 billion. This growth is driven by high-value industrial applications, including factory automation, logistics, and edge networking (processing data closer to where it is created).\nWhy this matters for the stock: These new revenue streams are diversified, profitable, and less susceptible to the fluctuations of the consumer smartphone market. As these segments grow, they justify a higher and more stable valuation for the company.\nQualcomm's Newest Power Play\nWhile its current diversification delivers results, Qualcomm is launching a major push into a new market: personal computers. With its recently released Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors, the company is directly challenging the long-time leaders of the PC chip industry.\nThis strategic move has the potential to be a major catalyst for future growth. The first AI-powered PCs with Snapdragon X Elite began shipping in June 2025, making it a timely development for investors to monitor.\nQualcomm's advantage in the PC market comes down to two key differentiators:\n- Superior Power Efficiency: Snapdragon chips are designed for high performance while consuming less power, resulting in significantly longer battery life.\n- On-Device AI Processing: These processors handle complex AI tasks directly on the laptop, making them faster and more secure than cloud-based solutions.\nWhy this matters for the stock: Gaining even a small share of the massive PC market would create a significant new revenue stream. This provides a clear path to future earnings growth that is not currently factored into the stock's Hold rating.\nWhy Qualcomm’s Valuation Outweighs Perceived Risk\nQUALCOMM Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 2.24%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $3.56\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 23 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 36.25%\n- Recent Dividend Payment\n- Jun. 26\nQCOM Dividend History\nWhy are many analysts still cautious if the growth story is so strong? The primary hesitation often stems from Qualcomm’s relationship with Apple NASDAQ: AAPL and the risk that the iPhone maker will eventually use its in-house modems. However, the company's current valuation suggests this risk is already priced into the stock.\nQualcomm's leadership has been direct about this, stating its strategy assumes this transition will happen. The strong growth in the automotive and IoT sectors is a tangible result of this forward-looking plan to reduce dependence on any single customer.\nFrom a valuation perspective, Qualcomm appears attractive. The stock trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of around 16.50. For a tech leader showing strong growth in multiple new sectors, a P/E in the mid-teens is reasonable and could even be considered low compared to its industry peer average of 57.\nFurthermore, the company offers a solid dividend yielding 2.20%. This provides a direct cash return to shareholders and is supported by a sustainable payout ratio of just 36% of its earnings.\nWhy this matters for the stock: The dividend rewards investors and provides a potential cushion for the stock price. Combined with a modest valuation and a proven diversification strategy, the company offers a compelling risk-reward profile.\nA Clear Case for Re-evaluation\nQualcomm’s data points to a company that is successfully transforming its business. While market sentiment may be stuck in the past, the financial results tell a different story.\nQualcomm's proven success in automotive and IoT, along with a major new catalyst in AI PCs and an attractive valuation, build a compelling investment case. The evidence suggests the consensus Hold rating is backward-looking. For investors who focus on the numbers, Qualcomm presents a clear story of a technology leader whose successful transformation is happening right now.\nBefore you consider QUALCOMM, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and QUALCOMM wasn't on the list.\nWhile QUALCOMM currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nLooking for the next FAANG stock before everyone has heard about it?

{"title": "Rigetti Computing: Cantor's Bullish Call May Be Just the Start", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/rigetti-computing-cantors-bullish-call-may-be-just-the-start/", "text": "Rigetti Computing Today\nRGTIRigetti Computing\n$13.03 -0.48 (-3.55%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $0.66\n▼\n$21.42 - Price Target\n- $14.20\nWall Street is taking a fresh, bullish look at quantum computing pioneer Rigetti Computing NASDAQ: RGTI. For months, investors have weighed the company’s incredible long-term promise against the high costs of developing its technology.\nHowever, a series of smart financial and strategic moves has provided a much clearer picture of Rigetti’s path forward. This has led to a growing chorus of positive analyst ratings, suggesting that recent developments have fundamentally improved the company's outlook, making it a key stock to watch in the quantum computing sector.\nA Chorus of Confidence: Why Analysts Are Backing RGTI\nThe latest bullish signal of this growing confidence came at the beginning of July 2025. Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage on Rigetti with an Overweight rating and set a $15.00 price target. This move is important because it reinforces a broader trend of optimism.\nCantor Fitzgerald now joins a group of at least five other Wall Street firms that hold a unified Buy or equivalent rating on the stock. Together, these analysts have an average 12-month price target of $14.20, pointing to an attractive potential upside from its current price. For investors, this unified positive rating should serve as a powerful indicator, signaling that the company’s strategy is gaining traction and credibility.\nFuel for the Future: Rigetti's $575 Million Cash Position\nThe biggest factor driving this optimism is Rigetti's vastly improved financial health. In early June 2025, the company announced it had completed a $350 million stock offering. This move, known as an at-the-market offering, allows a company to sell shares over time to raise capital efficiently.\nThis successful raise has fortified Rigetti's balance sheet to a game-changing degree. The company now holds approximately $575 million in cash and investments, and importantly, it carries no debt. This fortified financial position gives Rigetti several key advantages:\n- A Long Operational Runway: The cash provides the company with enough funding to operate for several years, allowing it to focus on technology without the constant pressure of raising money.\n- Strength and Flexibility: It puts management in a position of strength, enabling it to fund its intense research and development while exploring new partnerships or strategic opportunities.\n- Reduced Investor Risk: This financial stability eliminates one of the biggest risks for a pre-revenue tech company, providing a solid foundation for future growth.\nBuilding the Ecosystem for Commercial Success\nA strong bank account is only useful if the company holding the money has a sound strategy for spending it. Rigetti is proving it does by building an ecosystem of high-quality partners to solve the industry's toughest challenges.\nThe company already has a foundational manufacturing partnership with Quanta Computer, a global electronics giant. This collaboration is designed to address the long-term challenge of building complex quantum systems at scale.\nMore recently, Rigetti has shown its ability to execute on other key projects. It was selected for the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Quantum Benchmarking initiative, a project that validates its technology against the highest government standards.\nInternationally, Rigetti is also expanding its footprint. Through the Innovate UK awards, the company is leading a project to advance quantum error correction and is upgrading the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC) quantum computer. This strategy of partnering with leaders in manufacturing, government, and research shows that Rigetti is executing a capital-efficient plan to bring its technology to market.\nWhy New Strengths Outweigh Market Debates\nNo high-growth tech stock is without market debate, and Rigetti is a prime example. Rigetti has a short interest of roughly 20%, indicating that many traders are betting its price will decline. However, this bearish view is now directly countered by the strong bullish consensus from Rigetti’s analyst community, and it is coupled with a consistent net inflow of institutional investment.\nMore importantly, Rigetti is actively building the case against market doubt through tangible execution. The strategic ecosystem it is creating provides a credible and de-risked roadmap to commercialization. This demonstrates a company that is not just planning for the future, but methodically building it.\nWith approximately $575 million in cash and no debt, Rigetti has the resources and time to execute its long-term strategy. For investors considering Rigetti today, the landscape has undergone a fundamental shift. The powerful combination of financial security, validated strategic partnerships, and growing analyst confidence creates a compelling case that Rigetti is now better positioned for long-term success than ever before.\nBefore you consider Rigetti Computing, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Big Bank Buybacks: Morgan Stanley, Citi, & Wells Fargo Lead", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/big-bank-buybacks-morgan-stanley-citi-and-wells-fargo-lead/", "text": "When investors look for some of the best indicators pointing to a stock moving higher in the short—to medium-term timeline, there aren’t many indicators as powerful as a company buying back its own stock in bulk. Stock buyback programs are a tax-free and efficient way to reward shareholders, unlike dividend payments or other methods commonly used in today’s market.\nThe primary benefit of buying back stock is that it increases the percentage ownership of all existing shareholders, without requiring any additional capital expenditure. The second effect is that the available number of shares also declines, which helps boost future earnings per share (EPS) figures.\nThis has a direct positive effect on the stock price and its valuation as a result.\nIt seems that today’s stock buyback announcements are focused on the financial sector, where some of the biggest banks have decided that the future looks brighter than it did in the past, expecting more profitability and higher prices as well.\nThis is a reason investors should keep an eye on stocks like Morgan Stanley NYSE: MS, Wells Fargo & Co. NYSE: WFC, and even Citigroup Inc. NYSE: C for future upside, also backed by the current fundamental state of the market.\nInvestment Banking Set to Take Off for Morgan Stanley\nMorgan Stanley Today\nMSMorgan Stanley\n$143.06 +1.51 (+1.07%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $90.94\n▼\n$145.16 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.59%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 16.79\n- Price Target\n- $136.69\nThere are typically two types of banks in the industry, commercial and investment banks. Morgan Stanley belongs to the latter, where most of the bank’s earnings and fees come from brokering deals in the merger and acquisitions (M&A) space and sales and trading activities, both of which are set to take off in this current environment.\nTrading fees and commissions are expected to increase due to the current rotations and volatility within the S&P 500 index. The potential for lower interest rates to be in place by the end of 2025 may create a more favorable financing environment, historically bullish for M&A deals to be completed.\nConsidering all these optimistic factors now in place for Morgan Stanley, it makes sense for management to approve a $20 billion stock buyback program as of July 2025, seeking to repurchase just under 10% of the bank’s market capitalization.\nThe 8% to 10% range is typically aggressive for those new to buybacks, so Morgan Stanley could have a big surprise under the hood ready to deliver results for current and prospective shareholders. Management isn’t the only participant who is optimistic about Morgan Stanley's stock.\nAs of mid-May 2025, institutional buyers from UBS Asset Management have decided to increase their holdings in Morgan Stanley stock by 4.8%, bringing their net position to a high of $1.1 billion today. This is another bullish factor for investors to consider in their potential buying thesis.\nEarnings Wave Coming for Wells Fargo Stock\nWells Fargo & Company Today\nWFCWells Fargo & Company\n$82.33 +0.54 (+0.66%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $50.15\n▼\n$83.95 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.94%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 14.78\n- Price Target\n- $78.98\nWells Fargo management approved a stock buyback program worth up to $40 billion in the second quarter of 2025, confirming the broader view that banking stocks may be trading below their perceived value. This massive amount of buybacks carries a similar tailwind to those seen in Morgan Stanley, rooted in earnings.\nHowever, Wells Fargo is more focused on the commercial banking industry, where most revenue and earnings come from products like mortgages and credit cards, among other banking solutions. Understanding that today’s credit cycle is likely bottoming and poised to surge again with potentially lower interest rates by the end of the year is the core.\nThe core for Wells Fargo’s future earnings wave, where Wall Street analysts now forecast to see up to $1.62 in earnings per share (EPS) for Wells Fargo in the fourth quarter of 2025, implying a net growth rate of as much as 17% from today’s reported $1.23 in EPS.\nAs most investors know, where EPS growth goes, so does the stock price, and this massive $40 billion buyback only comes to expand on that effect, potentially creating a new double-digit percentage upside for Wells Fargo stock moving forward.\nMomentum Set to Continue in Citigroup\nCitigroup Today\nCCitigroup\n$87.07 +1.28 (+1.49%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io.

What’s different about Citigroup is that it's just as exposed to the investment banking side of things as it is to the commercial side, acting as a double-edged sword for investors to consider.\nThat might be one of the reasons why Richard Ramsden from Goldman Sachs decided to reiterate his Buy rating on Citigroup stock alongside a $96 per share valuation target, calling for a new 52-week high to be made alongside an additional 11% upside from where the stock trades today.\nConsidering its exposure to the broader industry tailwinds today, investors shouldn’t be surprised to see this momentum and expectation for Citigroup stock.\nFurthermore, investors can note the $20 billion stock buyback program for Citigroup this year, which justifies and reinforces the upside these analysts projected and the momentum observed in the stock.\nBefore you consider Morgan Stanley, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

Consumers have said they want to buy from American companies, but many of those American companies source their products from other countries.\nIn 2025, the Trump administration is trying to put substance into that slogan. From rising geopolitical tensions to renewed focus on domestic manufacturing and energy independence, companies that build, produce, and power America are finding new tailwinds.\nJuly 9 will mark the end of the administration’s self-imposed 90-day deadline for trade deals with other countries. Although the final numbers are expected to be much lower than those announced on “Liberation Day,” companies that do business in the United States stand to benefit.\nSeveral of these stocks are still compelling opportunities under $20 per share.

NYSE: CLF is North America's largest flat-rolled steel producer and one of the few that operates fully integrated steelmaking facilities inside the United States. The company supplies steel to domestic automakers, appliance manufacturers, and construction firms. These are all sectors that stand to benefit from infrastructure investment and Buy American policies.\nWhat sets Cleveland-Cliffs apart is its vertical integration, from iron ore mining in Minnesota and Michigan to blast furnaces and finishing operations in Ohio and Indiana.\nThis structure reduces reliance on foreign inputs and helps protect margins in volatile markets. Despite soft steel pricing in recent quarters, CLF’s focus on high-value automotive-grade steel and its strategic acquisitions of AK Steel and ArcelorMittal USA have cemented its leadership position.\nAs of the market close on July 2, CLF stock is trading around $8.71, marking a strong rebound that brings it back to a level last reached on May 2. The move also pushed shares decisively above the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages.\nThe next potential upside target is the $10 area, which not only represents a round-number resistance but would also bring the stock closer to the longer-term 200-day moving average, which could further confirm a trend reversal.

But Newell has focused on streamlining operations and reinvigorating its core brands. Recent management initiatives target cost reductions and supply chain improvements, which could help stabilize profitability.\nThis focus on profitability is reflected in analysts’ forecasts for 19% earnings growth in the next 12 months and a consensus price target of $7.53, which is 27% higher than its closing price on July 2.\nNWL stock is down more than 40% in 2025.

{"title": "Micron’s Big Q3 Drives Applied Materials’ Bullish Outlook", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/microns-big-q3-drives-applied-materials-bullish-outlook/", "text": "Applied Materials Today\nAMATApplied Materials\n$198.03 +2.64 (+1.35%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $123.74\n▼\n$255.57 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.93%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 24.09\n- Price Target\n- $203.65\nMicron Technology’s NASDAQ: MU recent fiscal Q3 2025 earnings are some of the best seen in the semiconductor industry over the past several months.\nThis is good news for one of the company’s major suppliers, semiconductor equipment giant Applied Materials NASDAQ: AMAT. Micron’s earnings show trends that are likely to boost demand for Applied Materials' equipment.\nBelow is a deep dive into Micron’s results and Applied’s business that will demonstrate how the firm can benefit. We’ll further examine Applied’s positioning and valuation to understand if the stock represents a strong forward-looking investment opportunity.\nMicron’s Results Back Up Applied’s Bullish Outlook\nMicron crushed sales and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) estimates in its latest results. The memory chip maker’s dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) sales were the driving force behind its great quarter. This was particularly true for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) products, where sales grew by 50% in just one quarter. HBM is a type of DRAM that is particularly advanced and is ideal for AI data center applications.\nAnother very strong part of the report was that Micron increased its overall DRAM sales growth guidance for calendar 2025 from “mid-teens” to \"high-teens.\" The company also expects that HBM sales will increase “significantly faster” than overall DRAM sales.\nSo, where does Applied Materials come into play?\nWell, it just so happens that DRAM is one of Applied Materials' most important businesses. Last quarter, DRAM equipment sales made up 27% of the company’s total revenue. Micron's strong DRAM sales mean they will likely need to buy more of Applied’s equipment used to make it, which could greatly benefit Applied’s overall sales.\nMicron’s results add significant weight to Applied's optimistic statements on DRAM demand. On May 15, Applied said it expects “advanced DRAM” equipment sales to grow by 40% in 2025 as customers “ramp investments” in these technologies.\nAdvanced DRAM includes HBM but also DDR5. DDR5 is also used significantly in AI in data centers and attracts demand from high-performance PCs. Recent announcements from Micron support Applied's statements that investment in DDR5 will ramp up. In June, Micron said it would soon end production of DDR4, the predecessor to DDR5. Micron's information boosts confidence in what Applied has already shared. This positions the company for strong growth ahead.\nAMAT: The Chip Advancement Enabler\nApart from the specific examples laid out above, one thing about Applied Materials is particularly important to understand. The advancements in its technology make the advancements in Micron's technology possible. As NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA and other end buyers want better Micron chips, Micron will need more advanced gear from Applied.\nThis is true for Micron and for other companies that manufacture different types of semiconductors.\nThink Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE: TSM.\nApplied’s position near the beginning of this supply chain is an advantage that makes it one of the best ways to gain exposure to the AI revolution. In the coming years, it can benefit from advances in all types of semiconductor chips. Many other companies focus on just one or a few areas.\nThis is also true for Applied, as the company makes equipment for various chip-making processes. It can offer customers a range of solutions that fit many of their needs. Meanwhile, ASML NASDAQ: ASML, for example, focuses almost solely on lithography equipment.\nDespite China, Applied Remains Set Up for Long-Term Success\nApplied Materials Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$203.652.84% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 25 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $198.03 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $250.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $203.65 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $160.00 |\n|---|\nApplied Materials Stock Forecast Details\nGiven export restrictions, Applied’s exposure to China is important to discuss. Last quarter, 25% of Applied’s revenues came from China. This is down from 43% from a year ago, largely due to export controls.\nStill, the company notes that nearly all of its business in China involves “mature” or less advanced technologies. Thus, the company’s growth prospects based on technological advancement are not much tied to China, a positive sign for the long-term future.\nAs of the July 2 close, Applied Materials trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 20x.\nThat compares to its three-year average figure of 19x. This suggests that based on next 12 months' estimates, the stock is neither greatly overvalued nor greatly undervalued.\nThus, expecting to pick up big returns from this stock quickly may be unrealistic. However, on a long-term horizon, the stock remains strongly positioned to appreciate. Years of upcoming chip advancement, which Applied’s tech facilitates, can drive this.\nBefore you consider Applied Materials, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $13.47\n▼\n$72.98 - P/E Ratio\n- 72.80\n- Price Target\n- $39.58\nIn today’s market, filled with volatility and uncertainty on a macro level, it is as important as ever to remember the initial thesis.\nThis is where fundamentals come into play the most for investors to justify holding the stocks that have made them successful in the first place, and not panic-sell due to emotions that will likely subside in a few months or even less.\nOne perfect example of such a situation is found in shares of Hims & Hers Health Inc. NYSE: HIMS, a stock that has generated significant wealth in a short period but has recently given some back.\nWhat matters most is what made the stock rally as much as it did up to mid-June 2025 in the first place, so that investors can cross-check whether those same factors still stand in today’s environment, making it a potential holder into the future if not an outright dip-buying opportunity after a recent fall from its 52-week high levels.\nAs investors will find, this is easier said than done for Hims & Hers stock.\nAre Skies Clear for Hims & Hers Again?\nNot exactly. As exciting as it is, this stock has fallen by as much as 16% over the past month alone, which is not something many investors feel confident about when holding so much red in their portfolio. Those who were early enough to get into this name don’t have to worry about this, though, unless recent events have an adverse effect on the company.\nInitially, Hims & Hers rallied by over 100% starting in April 2025 on news that Novo Nordisk would adopt them as one of their weight loss drug providers and carriers. This partnership opened the floodgates for further institutional capital to flow into the stock in its support.\nHowever, only a month after this announcement, Novo Nordisk decided to pull back the partnership, causing the stock to fall as much as it did. Now, there are still plenty of reasons Hims & Hers stock was a buy before the Novo Nordisk announcement, and those reasons haven’t changed at all.\nIn fact, it can still be argued (based on the stock’s chart) that any price below the $35 per share level is still fair game for those looking to invest in one of the fastest-growing companies in the medical sector. That being said, it is now time to focus on what matters, the fundamental story behind Hims & Hers.\nA Business Primed for Breakouts\nAs it turns out, Hims & Hers is not only in the medical field, but also combines the technology sector's growth and innovation into a space in dire need of change. This innovative and affordable approach to delivering healthcare solutions to customers is at the core of Hims & Hers stock’s growth trajectory, which remains intact even after the announcement.\nNovo Nordisk's market exit simply reflects expectations that were never evident in the company's financial data or forecasts, so ultimately, there's little cause for concern.\nHims & Hers Health Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$39.58-21.19% DownsideReduceBased on 13 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $50.23 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $68.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $39.58 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $26.00 |\n|---|\nHims & Hers Health Stock Forecast Details\nHims & Hers stock had reached a high of around $70 per share in February 2025, without Novo Nordisk’s help. This suggests that it may retest these highs and possibly break new ones, even as the partnership fell apart, which should matter most to investors.\nOne of the most important aspects of Hims & Hers is its market share positioning and subscription business model. This model offers stable and predictable cash flows to investors, a commodity in volatile times for the S&P 500 index. What drives this subscription and financial growth is also worth noting.\nAs of the latest financial quarter results, released in May 2025, Hims & Hers reported revenue figures of up to $586 million, representing a massive 111% increase on an annual basis. Subscribers driving this revenue growth also reached an all-time high of 2.4 million for a 38% annualized growth rate.\nMost importantly, the business's free cash flow was reported at $50.1 million for the quarter, a nearly fivefold increase from the $11.9 million reported for the same quarter the previous year.\nThis massive financial growth appears to give Novo Nordisk little credit, and neither should the stock’s discount moving forward.\nAs it now trades at 66% of its 52-week high, Hims & Hers stock presents a very attractive turnaround play for those bold enough to look at the cold, hard facts rather than the noise circulating in the news cycle.\nBefore you consider Hims & Hers Health, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

Following its fourth-quarter earnings report on June 26, the company’s stock jumped close to 15% in a single session. This powerful rally came as a surprise, especially since Nike reported a 12% drop in revenue and a steep 86% decline in profits for the quarter.\nSo, why the celebration?\nThe message was clear for investors: the market is looking past the poor historical data and buying into a credible comeback story. This shift in sentiment was validated as Nike’s analyst community began upgrading their outlooks on the stock.\nThis wave of fresh optimism from analysts suggests a growing belief that Nike has weathered the worst of its storm and is setting the stage for a recovery.\nNike’s Financial Turning Point\nThe market's positive reaction took into account Nike’s headline results but was also rooted in the new signs of stability and control. While revenue and profit were down, Nike reported quarterly earnings of $0.14 per share, surpassing its analyst community consensus estimate.\nBeating expectations matters, as it signals to investors that the company's management team has a firm grasp on its business and can deliver on its promises, even in a challenging environment.\nHowever, the most important bullish signal was on the balance sheet. For the first time in several quarters, Nike’s inventories were flat year-over-year at $7.5 billion. Bloated inventory is a problem for any consumer brand. It often forces heavy discounts, which hurts profits and can cheapen the brand's image.\nBy controlling its inventory, Nike has demonstrated its ability to sell products at full price. This crucial achievement was reinforced by CFO Matthew Friend, who stated that the fourth quarter reflected the \"largest financial impact\" of their turnaround plan, implying that the worst of the financial pain is likely over.\nAdding to this sense of stability, Nike continues its 23-year streak of increasing its dividend, a testament to the company's underlying financial strength and long-term confidence.\nNIKE, Inc. (NKE) Price Chart for Thursday, July, 10, 2025\nNike's New Strategy: All In on the 'Sport Offense'\nWith its operational house in order, Nike is now focused on its next chapter of growth. During the fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Elliott Hill unveiled the company’s new strategy, dubbed the sport offense, which represents a pivot designed to re-energize the brand's positioning within the market sector.\nThis new game plan has two core missions:\n- A Return to Innovation: Nike is deliberately shifting away from its heavy reliance on high-volume retro sneakers like the Air Force 1 and Dunk. While these classics are beloved, the market became oversaturated. The new focus is on a multi-year product innovation pipeline that will create fresh excitement and command premium prices.\n- Reclaiming Performance Dominance: The sport offense strategy is a direct answer to rising competition from brands like Hoka and On, which have made inroads in the performance running category. Nike plans to reassert its leadership in performance technology, utilizing major global sporting events, such as the Olympics, as a platform to launch new products and reaffirm its athletic heritage.\nA Strategic Retreat for a Bigger Advance\nWhile the new strategy is promising, Nike's recent report did contain some concerning figures. However, when viewed through the lens of the company's long-term plan, these challenges are seen as controlled and even necessary components of the strategic pivot.\nThe most notable weakness was a 26% drop in Nike's direct-to-consumer digital sales. At first glance, this appears alarming. However, it was primarily caused by a deliberate decision to scale back marketing efforts for older sneaker franchises. This is a short-term sacrifice made to clean up the marketplace and prepare for the launch of new, more profitable products.\nSimilarly, persistent softness in the Converse brand (down 26%) and the Greater China region (down 21%) continues to be a hurdle. For years, China was a key growth engine for Nike, and its struggles there are significant.\nThe sports offense strategy is a targeted approach designed to address these issues. The goal is to re-ignite consumer demand through innovative new products rather than reiterating old classics.\nThe Starting Gun for a Recovery?\nNIKE Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$77.153.36% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 32 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $74.64 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $115.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $77.15 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $58.00 |\n|---|\nNIKE Stock Forecast Details\nFor investors monitoring Nike, the story has undergone a fundamental change. The market is now looking beyond the company's past struggles and focusing on the credibility of its comeback plan. Investors can see Wall Street’s recent upgrades as a decisive vote of confidence in the company’s future.\nThis optimism is reflected in analyst price targets, which now average $77.19, with some firms setting targets as high as $115.00. With a clean inventory slate, a clear innovation-led strategy, and renewed institutional backing, the evidence suggests that the starting gun for Nike's recovery has just been fired.\nFor investors with a long-term view, this may be the beginning of the next growth cycle for one of the world's most iconic brands.\nBefore you consider NIKE, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

The story is gaining more substance, and new milestones suggest Rocket Lab’s growth trajectory is far from over.\nLatest Progress Signals Execution Strength\nOne of the most significant recent developments was Rocket Lab’s recent announcement that it had completed the Critical Design Review (CDR) for the Space Development Agency’s (SDA) T2TL-Beta constellation.\nThis is a significant milestone, as it affirms the company’s spacecraft design and systems architecture and clears the way for full-scale production of a constellation of 18 spacecraft as the program’s prime contractor.\nIt’s tangible proof that Rocket Lab is maturing from a pure-play launch provider into a full-service space infrastructure firm. The T2TL-Beta constellation is part of the Department of Defense’s Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, which aims to provide resilient, low-latency communications networks in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) for real-time coordination across U.S. and allied military operations.\nRocket Lab will deliver these spacecraft using its Lightning platform, which is purpose-built for high-demand national security LEO constellations. As a vertically integrated operation, Rocket Lab handles nearly everything in-house, from solar panels to avionics, flight software, and launch integration.\nInternal control reduces costs, increases margins, and allows them to meet tight delivery schedules, a major differentiator in the defense contracting world.\nElectron Launch Cadence Hits New Highs\nIf the company’s manufacturing and contracting progress wasn’t enough, Rocket Lab’s launch cadence is also breaking records. On June 27, RKLB completed its 68th Electron mission just 48 hours after its previous launch. That marks the fastest turnaround yet from Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand.\nTo put it in perspective, four Electron missions were completed in June alone, and ten successful missions have been achieved year-to-date, totaling a 100% mission success rate in 2025 so far. This kind of launch reliability and frequency is not just impressive, it’s increasingly rare in the space industry.\nConsistency and dependability are critical for government customers and commercial satellite clients alike, and Rocket Lab is setting the bar high.\nNeutron Timeline and Strategic Expansion\nRocket Lab's CEO, Peter Beck, appeared on CNBC this week. He reiterated that the company is still on track to launch Neutron, its highly anticipated medium-lift, reusable rocket, in the second half of this year. While he admitted it’s an aggressive target, Beck expressed confidence that the timeline remains intact.\nIf Neutron delivers as expected, it could be a game-changer for Rocket Lab. Unlike Electron, which is tailored for small payloads, Neutron will enable RKLB to compete directly with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 on medium-lift missions, unlocking a much larger total addressable market.\nBeck also spoke about the recent Geost acquisition, noting how the deal expands Rocket Lab’s portfolio into the satellite payload business. Geost is focused on space-based sensing technologies, a natural extension of Rocket Lab’s vertically integrated strategy.\nThis acquisition complements the company’s expanding satellite manufacturing capabilities and further enhances its end-to-end mission services.\nA Business That Keeps Gaining Depth\nRocket Lab Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$30.40-22.25% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 12 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $39.10 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $40.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $30.40 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $18.00 |\n|---|\nRocket Lab Stock Forecast Details\nRocket Lab’s story continues to evolve from a high-flying growth stock into a serious contender in the aerospace and defense sector.\nWith its growing government contracts, deepening vertical integration, and soon-to-launch Neutron vehicle, RKLB is transforming from a niche launch startup into a multifaceted space infrastructure powerhouse.\nYes, valuation is rich, and that’s no secret. However, for investors focused on execution, pipeline, and momentum, Rocket Lab continues to deliver.\nWith 100% launch success in 2025, the T2TL-Beta milestone behind it, and a potentially pivotal second half of the year ahead, the company has clear near- and long-term catalysts.\nBefore you consider Rocket Lab, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

On Monday, Blayne Curtis of Jefferies reiterated his buy rating on the chip giant and boosted his price target from $300 to $315. As of the July 1 close, Broadcom trades at just under $265 per share.\nMeanwhile, the MarketBeat consensus price target on Broadcom is just over $281. This average target implies only around 6% upside in shares. However, Curtis is significantly more optimistic. His new target suggests Broadcom could rise three times more, implying nearly 19% upside.\nOne key part of Curtis’s analysis stands out when it comes to the possibility of Broadcom stock eclipsing the $300 mark.\nBroadcom’s AI Chips: How Networking Can Help Lead the Stock to New Highs\nBroadcom’s application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and networking chips make up its all-important AI semiconductor business line. ASICs are the chips that Broadcom develops for AI training and inference workloads. They are competitors and complements to NVIDIA’s NASDAQ: NVDA ever-popular graphics processing units (GPUs), depending on the context.\nASIC sales are what the market really looks at when deciding whether to upgrade or downgrade Broadcom. Meanwhile, Broadcom makes networking chips for AI data center switches and routers. Switches and routers control the flow of information between different AI data center components. Tomahawk and Jericho are the company’s flagship networking chip families.\nThe exciting aspect of Curtis’s analysis is these networking chips. It is well known that Broadcom currently has three hyperscale customers and four potential ones for its ASIC business. These current and potential customers account for the seven that Curtis cites.\nHowever, Curtis mentions that five of these hyperscalers are already networking customers. If Curtis is right, this information significantly boosts Broadcom’s overall upside.\nTo push shares to new highs, markets want to see Broadcom convert its potential ASIC customers to actual ones. The fact that Broadcom didn’t make an announcement like this last quarter is a large reason why shares sold off post-Q2 earnings.\nCurtis’s analysis indicates that multiple of Broadcom’s potential ASIC customers are already networking customers. This existing relationship increases the likelihood that they will also become ASIC customers. Thus, the idea that Broadcom shares can move higher based on potential ASIC customer conversion is more likely to play out.\nTomahawk 6: Broadcom’s Unsung Growth Engine\nThe link between ASIC customer conversion and networking chips is particularly important now. This is because of the recent launch of Broadcom’s Tomahawk 6 networking chip. A Tomahawk 6 chip can facilitate the transfer of twice as much data as any other. This allows Broadcom to capitalize on a trend it is seeing in networking.\nData centers are increasingly shifting toward Broadcom’s Ethernet technology to support \"scale-up\" architecture. This is where servers become denser, packing more computing power into the same amount of space.\nTomahawk 6’s industry-leading bandwidth makes it ideally positioned to serve this need. Doubling the bandwidth means that users can connect twice the number of components to it without sacrificing performance. This allows for a denser server architecture (scale up), which is the exact opportunity that Broadcom is seeing.\nAdditionally, the prowess of Tomahawk 6 could increase Broadcom’s potential to cross-sell ASICs. In this way, Tomahawk 6 positions Broadcom to increase networking revenue and gain ASIC customers.\nAVGO: $315 Is Far From Unrealistic\nBroadcom Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$290.215.38% UpsideBuyBased on 29 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $275.40 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $400.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $290.21 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $210.00 |\n|---|\nBroadcom Stock Forecast Details\nCurtis’s analysis points to one key fact: investors should not overlook the networking piece of Broadcom’s AI chip revenue. Networking chips accounted for 40% of total AI revenue last quarter. Sales of these chips grew by 170% last quarter, more than three times the 46% growth rate of total AI semiconductor revenue.\nImportantly, this brisk growth rate came before Tomahawk 6 was even available. Overall, Broadcom has multiple avenues through which it can continue to grow impressively, whether it be ASICs, networking, or VMware. The company is clearly confident in its future. It spent over $4.2 billion on buybacks last quarter, the second-highest amount of quarterly repurchase spending in its history.\nWith leading tech and the chance to gain big new customers, Broadcom shares could hit $315.\nBefore you consider Broadcom, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Whiplash for Investors: AeroVironment's Confusing Stock Signals", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/whiplash-for-investors-aerovironments-confusing-stock-signals/", "text": "AeroVironment Today\n$237.57 +0.80 (+0.34%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $102.25\n▼\n$295.90 - P/E Ratio\n- 153.27\n- Price Target\n- $265.22\nAeroVironment NASDAQ: AVAV investors have been on a stomach-churning rollercoaster. The unmanned systems leader saw its stock price surge to a new 52-week high, reaching nearly $295 per share, after releasing a blockbuster earnings report on June 24, 2025. The stock reversed course days later, suffering a sharp, double-digit percentage decline.\nThe catalyst for this sudden drop was a July 1 announcement: a plan to raise nearly $1.5 billion in fresh capital. The market’s reaction was textbook, selling off on the prospect of share dilution. A closer look suggests this was a calculated move made from a position of strength.\nThis financial maneuver appears designed to fuel a new era of growth, potentially creating a significant opportunity for investors who look beyond the short-term market noise.\nFrom Record Bookings to a Fortified Balance Sheet\nAeroVironment's recent financial strategy shift makes sense only when viewed through the lens of its operational success. The company's fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 report revealed that the business was experiencing a historic surge in demand, driven by the proven effectiveness of its systems in global conflicts. This created a high-quality problem: an urgent need to expand operations to meet a flood of new orders.\nThe numbers provided by AeroVironment are compelling. The company secured a record $1.2 billion in new bookings during the fiscal year, a healthy indicator of future business growth. This success helped build a funded backlog of confirmed, contracted future revenue that has grown to around $727 million, nearly double the figure from the previous year.\nThis performance directly translated to the bottom line, with record fourth-quarter revenue reaching $275.1 million, a 40% year-over-year increase. Unsurprisingly, management issued highly confident guidance for fiscal 2026, projecting revenue to land between $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion.\nThis is the critical context for raising capital. AeroVironment isn't raising money to fix a problem; it's raising money to manage its success. The approximately $1.47 billion in proceeds is being deployed with two clear objectives:\n- Strengthening the Balance Sheet: Approximately $965.3 million is allocated to pay down debt, primarily from the recent $2.0 billion strategic acquisition of BlueHalo. This is a financially prudent move that reduces risk, lowers future interest costs, and provides greater stability for the company going forward.\n- Investing in Growth: The remaining funds are dedicated to expanding manufacturing capacity. This is the crucial link between record orders and future revenue. To deliver on its massive backlog, AeroVironment must be able to build its drones and munitions faster. This investment directly addresses that need.\nA Technical Pullback Making a Strategic Entry Point\nWhen a company issues new stock, it can dilute existing shareholders' ownership stake, often triggering a temporary, technical dip in the share price. This is essentially what happened to AeroVironment. However, this pullback may offer an attractive entry or accumulation point for investors who watched AeroVironment’s stock price achieve an impressive 94%-plus run over the past three months.\nAeroVironment, Inc. (AVAV) Price Chart for Thursday, July, 10, 2025\nThe decline was driven by the mechanics of the offering, not a change in the company's positive business outlook. Long-term investors often view such technical dips as opportunities to build a position in a strong company at a better price.\nThis bullish perspective is echoed by AeroVironment’s analyst community. Following the outstanding earnings report, the consensus rating from 14 analysts remains a Buy. The price targets are even more telling. Goldman Sachs NYSE: GS initiated coverage with a Buy rating and a $301 price target, while BTIG Research raised its target to $300.\nThese figures suggest that financial experts see significant upside that extends far beyond the temporary effects of the capital raise.\nTheir analysis points to the fundamental strength of the business and its dominant position in the defense technology sector.\nReading Between the Lines\nAeroVironment’s decision to raise capital is a proactive and strategic response to its remarkable success. It is a sign of a forward-looking management team preparing for a significant phase of expansion, not a company in distress. By fortifying its balance sheet and investing directly in its capacity to deliver on a record order book, AeroVironment is paving the way for its next chapter of growth.\nFor investors with a long-term outlook, the market's knee-jerk reaction to a prudent financial strategy may have created a compelling opportunity to invest in an industry leader as it scales up for the future.\nBefore you consider AeroVironment, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "The Ultimate Trump Bump: These Gov't Backed Stocks Are Exploding", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/the-ultimate-trump-bump-these-govt-backed-stocks-are-exploding/", "text": "In 2025, two of the market's best-performing stocks of the year aren’t AI-focused tech companies but rather two of the United States' largest government-sponsored entities (GSEs). These stocks are Fannie Mae OTCMKTS: FNMA and Freddie Mac OTCMKTS: FMCC. Respectively, these names have provided total returns of approximately 145% and 181% in 2025, as of the July 1 close. So, how is President Trump driving the massive gains in these finance stocks, and what's on the horizon?\nPrivatization Possibilities: The Massive Force Behind Freddie and Fannie’s Surge\nFannie Mae Today\n$9.06 +0.12 (+1.34%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $1.02\n▼\n$11.91 - Price Target\n- $4.00\nThe reason for the rapid rise in Fannie and Freddie’s share prices is the increasing possibility that the two could become private companies. Comments from President Trump are driving this idea. But, before getting into them, it’s important to understand what Fannie and Freddie do.\nFannie and Freddie issue mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which they guarantee to pay. When sold by private companies, MBSs are far riskier fixed-income investments that make interest payments based on people paying their mortgages.\nHowever, as the financial crisis has proven, people paying their mortgages is far from a sure thing. Mortgage defaults caused a breakdown of the private MBS market, leading to plummeting home prices and creating a wider economic disaster. That’s why, after 2008, the government placed Fannie and Freddie under conservatorship. Hundreds of billions in funding from the U.S. Treasury backstop the MBS they issue. If too many people default on their mortgages today, the U.S. Treasury will step in to make MBS holders whole. This helps prevent a future crisis.\nFreddie Mac Today\n$7.51 +0.02 (+0.27%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\n- Price Target\n- $4.50\nHowever, due to the conservatorship, the U.S. Treasury also receives all the profits Fannie and Freddie generate. This means that Fannie and Freddie cannot pay out dividends or buy back stock. They also must operate under strict rules that limit their profit-making abilities. However, President Trump could change this.\nOn May 21, Trump said he is giving \"very serious consideration to bringing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public.\" Although the wording is confusing, he is referring to ending the conservatorship. He wants to give control of Fannie and Freddie back to private shareholders, rather than the government. The next day, shares jumped 51% and 42%, respectively, showcasing the enthusiasm of many investors. So, why exactly does the potential for these names to become private again have many investors excited?\nPre-2008 Valuations Show the Past Investors Hope to Rekindle\nGoing private would allow Fannie and Freddie to pay out dividends and buy back stock—two key ways to return capital to shareholders. Additionally, it would unlock their ability to generate profits. Instead of having to send their profits to the government, they could invest in new growth areas. The attractiveness to investors of the two becoming private is clearly demonstrated by looking at their market capitalizations before 2008.\nOn July 1, 2007, Fannie’s market cap was approximately $65 billion, while Freddie’s was around $41 billion. Prior to Election Day in 2024, those numbers were around $7.5 billion and $4 billion, respectively. Since Nov. 1, Fannie shares are up approximately 600% and Freddie shares are up 550%. As of the close on July 1, 2025, Fannie's market cap reached over $52 billion, while Freddie hit over $25 billion. Trump’s statements are driving all of this, as he floated privatization during his first term. So, where does this all leave investors now when it comes to Fannie and Freddie?\nSpeculative: Fannie and Freddie's Middle Name\nInvestors won’t find many analysts putting out price targets on these names. However, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW) did place price targets on the stock back in January. For Fannie, their target is $4, implying a 56% downside in shares. Their Freddie price target is $4.50, implying shares could fall 43% from their July 1 closing price. They raised their price target on both, noting that the likelihood of privatization has increased measurably. Still, there are roadblocks in the way.\nPrivatization would likely require congressional action; it would be difficult for Trump to do it on his own. Additionally, KBW says that Fannie and Freddie owe the U.S. government around $200 billion. The government would need to forgive this debt for the two to be financially sound. That’s likely not something that would sit well with many American voters. Overall, speculative is clearly the right word to describe owning Fannie and Freddie shares at this point. Doing so assumes that the current administration would be willing and able to undergo a massive political undertaking that likely would be unpopular.\nBefore you consider Fannie Mae, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Fannie Mae wasn't on the list.\nWhile Fannie Mae currently has a Sell rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nEnter your email address and we'll send you MarketBeat's list of seven stocks and why their long-term outlooks are very promising.\nGet This Free Report\nLike this article?

{"title": "Insider Selling at NVIDIA Could Turn Into an Opportunity", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/insider-selling-at-nvidia-could-turn-into-an-opportunity/", "text": "When investors examine capital flows for a given stock or industry, they focus primarily on the buying side of the equation, as it is the easiest to analyze. When anyone, whether institutions or insiders, buys a stock, the primary purpose is typically to make a profit when the price starts to increase. However, the other side of this theme, the selling, can be a lot more confusing than the buying.\nNVIDIA Today\n$164.10 +1.22 (+0.75%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $86.62\n▼\n$164.50 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.02%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 52.94\n- Price Target\n- $177.03\nMarket participants will sell stock for several reasons, be it profit taking, tax, portfolio restructuring, or even stock options being exercised. With this in mind, not all selling activity can (nor should) be taken as a bearish indicator, despite everyone else in the market seeing it this way. Today, investors can explore this concept through one of the market’s most popular and exciting names in the technology sector.\nThroughout June and July 2025, insider selling of NVIDIA Co. NASDAQ: NVDA shares increased, sending the stock lower by a significant amount before market forces intervened to drive a recovery back to previous highs.\nWhether this is a sign of market complacency or a recognition that not all insider selling is bearish is up for debate. Understanding the fundamentals of the market can help settle that debate.\nWhy NVIDIA Keeps Pushing Higher\nAfter a decline of 5.3% to end the month of June 2025, NVIDIA has quickly recovered to 97% of its 52-week high, signaling strong momentum in a deep bull market theme. However, concerns are starting to arise regarding CEO Jensen Huang's sale of up to $11.8 million of NVIDIA stock during this period.\nAccompanying the CEO’s decision to sell some stock, director A. Brooke Seawell sold just under $16 million worth of NVIDIA stock. Investors may never truly know why these insiders sold NVIDIA stock, especially as it delivered a one-year performance of up to 27.5% and its momentum keeps bringing the stock to new all-time highs.\nOne factor everyone can lean on in the search for an answer is where NVIDIA sits right now in the broader semiconductor industry cycle. This industry typically operates through two cycles: a research and development phase to develop the next big launch and a sales cycle to capitalize on the fruits of the previous cycle and its efforts.\nAs it stands today, NVIDIA has now released its latest product, Blackwell, an industry-leading supercomputer that stands to keep NVIDIA at the top of the leaderboard when it comes to semiconductors. What comes next is the sales cycle for Blackwell, which has seen some positive momentum and subscriptions so far into the release.\nCountries like the United Arab Emirates (UAE) reached out to NVIDIA to acquire some Blackwell computers to further meet the country’s need for developing data centers and artificial intelligence. Outside of the UAE purchase, NVIDIA is now directly connected to the success of other big names in the technology space through Blackwell.\nAmazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN and Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META have highlighted the capabilities that Blackwell can bring to their own businesses and the potential for the development of artificial intelligence moving forward. All told, investors could somewhat assume that the sales cycle for NVIDIA’s new product is in full swing, cooling down concerns about insider selling.\nThe Market’s Take on NVIDIA Stock\nNVIDIA Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$177.037.88% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 42 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $164.10 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $250.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $177.03 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $120.00 |\n|---|\nNVIDIA Stock Forecast Details\nThe initial clue investors can examine to assess market sentiment towards NVIDIA is the price movement. By trending closely into a new all-time high, NVIDIA shows investors that the bullish momentum is still in full swing, as future expectations for Blackwell revenue and earnings are being priced into today’s stock prices.\nMore than that, it seems that the insider selling failed to elicit a reaction from bearish traders, judging by the 9.8% decline in NVIDIA’s short interest over the past month alone. This is a clear sign of bearish capitulation as these sophisticated sellers understand insider selling isn’t always a negative sign in a stock.\nMore than bearish retreats, investors can look to the new ratings by Loop Capital’s analyst Amanda Barush. This analyst placed a continued Buy rating on NVIDIA as of late June 2025, this time also boosting the valuation targets to as high as $250 per share from her previous $175 view.\nFrom today’s prices, this valuation would not only mean a new all-time high will be achieved, but also calls for as much as 60% upside potential in NVIDIA stock. Investors need to keep in mind that analysts are often cautious about setting their targets and ratings, lest they land on the wrong side of history and risk damaging their reputations and careers through a mistake.\nBefore you consider NVIDIA, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

However, investors who bought utilities stocks may be enjoying more impressive gains than if they stayed concentrated in technology.\nThe Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund NYSEARCA: XLU is up more than 7.7% this year. This was part of a flight to safety. Investors sought out these companies for their defensive qualities: consistent cash flows, regulated business models, and essential services. Investors also appreciate the additional benefit of reliable dividends that frequently have yields that outpace inflation.\nAs the second half of 2025 unfolds, utilities may not keep pace with technology stocks in a pure risk-on environment.

NYSE: NEE centers around its two complementary business units. Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) serves more than five million customers in Florida. The company acts as a regulated utility providing electricity through a combination of natural gas, solar, and nuclear power.\nNextEra Energy Resources is NextEra Energy's renewable energy arm. The company is one of the world’s largest solar and wind energy generators and provides energy storage and battery technologies.\nHowever, that strength was under pressure as the tax and spending bill, working its way through Congress, may cut some renewable energy subsidies. However, those cuts may not be as bad as feared. Plus, NextEra Energy is well-positioned to benefit from the growth in electricity demand needed to power artificial intelligence data centers.\nNEE stock is up just 0.5% in 2025. However, analysts give the stock a consensus price target of $84.55, a 17% increase.

This stability contributes to reliable revenue and steady earnings.\nLike many utilities, AEP has an eye to the future with a long-term strategic plan that emphasizes resilience, sustainability, and the integration of renewable energy technologies. The company has invested heavily in this area and carries long-term debt of around $45 billion. However, even with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.42, the company’s predictable cash flow mitigates any concerns.\nAEP stock is up 12.7% in 2025, and analysts believe that the company will report approximately 7% earnings growth in the next 12 months. This is in addition to a dividend that has increased for 15 consecutive years and has a 3.58% yield.\nEven after its recent rally, AEP trades at around 17 times forward earnings, a modest premium to peers, reflecting investors’ confidence in its stability.\nDominion Energy’s Streamlined, Focused Business Model is Engineering a Comeback\nDominion Energy Today\nDDominion Energy\n$58.16 +1.01 (+1.77%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $48.07\n▼\n$61.97 - Dividend Yield\n- 4.59%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 21.78\n- Price Target\n- $58.38\nDominion Energy Inc.

{"title": "Aeva & Mobileye: LiDAR Stocks Powering the Autonomous Revolution", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/aeva-and-mobileye-lidar-stocks-powering-the-autonomous-revolution/", "text": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are no longer strictly the realm of fiction and fantasy. Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA launched its long-awaited Robotaxi in Austin earlier this month, joining Google’s Waymo in offering driverless rides to paying passengers.\nWhile the Robotaxi still has a long way to go before being considered a true Waymo rival, a heated competition might be good news for consumers regarding costs and efficiency improvements.\nLike businesses that sold shovels to gold prospectors, public companies supplying the underlying tech are receiving increasing attention as the autonomous arms race intensifies.\nToday, we’ll compare Waymo's and Tesla's technology and discuss two stocks that are powering the AV revolution by providing critical systems.\nLiDAR Technology: Why Waymo Extended the Gap Between Competitors like Tesla\nAlphabet Today\n$177.62 +1.00 (+0.57%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $140.53\n▼\n$207.05 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.47%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 19.80\n- Price Target\n- $200.13\nWaymo, which operates under the Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL umbrella, has logged more than 56 million driverless miles as it operates in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, Miami, Atlanta, and Austin, with plans for further expansion in 2025, including an international debut in Tokyo.\nWaymo has pushed ahead in the driverless taxi race through Light Detection and Ranging technology, better known as LiDAR.\nLiDAR is a sophisticated type of sensor tech that enables 3D mapping at high resolution, allowing for precise object detection and real-time environmental adjustments. The system operates by emitting thousands of light pulses per second, utilizing the “time of flight” process to measure the time it takes for light to reflect off an object and return to the sensor.\nIf it sounds similar to radar, that’s because it is, but with light waves instead of sound waves. Using lasers creates accurate spatial data by providing depth, an area where 2D cameras continue to struggle without massive computational intervention.\nLiDAR usage is the primary divergence between Waymo and Tesla’s driverless taxi programs, as Tesla CEO Elon Musk claims LiDAR technology is too expensive to scale and will create profitability issues for Waymo in the long run. LiDAR also requires assistance with visual cues, such as words on road signs and the colors of stoplights.\nTesla’s driverless program is built on cameras and AI, which is more cost-efficient but faces far more safety and reliability hurdles. While the program is now underway in Austin, the Robotaxi rollout has received mixed reviews from analysts, with some considering it more hype than substance.\n2 Stocks Supplying Crucial LiDAR Components\nThe story of the AV revolution is still in its early chapters. However, Waymo currently holds the upper hand due to its impeccable safety record (80% collision reduction compared to human drivers) and successful commercial rollout in multiple cities.\nLiDAR has significantly contributed to this success, and many of the companies developing these systems are publicly traded. Here are two lesser-known LiDAR manufacturers that have recently piqued investors' interest.\nAeva Technologies: Cutting Edge LiDAR Designs\nAeva Technologies Today\nAEVAAeva Technologies\n$29.21 -1.71 (-5.53%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $2.36\n▼\n$38.80 - Price Target\n- $14.50\nOne of the biggest winners in any market sector in 2025 has been Aeva Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: AEVA, whose stock has seen an astonishing 1,400% increase over the last 12 months. AEVA has a 4D LiDAR system using Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) tech, which measures distance and velocity.\nThe ability to measure velocity has been a crucial advancement in LiDAR technology, setting Aeva apart from competitors such as Ouster Inc. NYSE: OUST and Luminar Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: LAZR, which still utilize traditional 3D LiDAR mapping.\nAEVA shares are up nearly 30% in the last week alone, perhaps highlighting how LiDAR remains a superior option to camera-only systems in the wake of the Robotaxi premiere.\nThe company expects 2025 revenue growth of 70% to 100% over 2024 figures, ranging from $15 million to $18 million.\nThe Q1 2025 report saw revenue of $3.4 million, up from $2.1 million from the same period last year. The company also narrowed its year-over-year (YOY) operating loss to $25.9 million from $32.1 million.\nMobileye Global: Strategic Partnerships for Future Growth\nMobileye Global Today\n$16.67 -0.65 (-3.75%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $10.48\n▼\n$27.68 - Price Target\n- $19.05\nShares of Mobileye Global Inc. NASDAQ: MBLY have been heading in the opposite direction of AEVA, down 35% over the last year. However, a renewed focus on driverless vehicle technology could be what the stock needs to shake off the rust, as MBLY reported a 20% decline in full-year revenue from 2023 to 2024.\nIts Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems, along with the autonomous Chauffeur and Drive platforms, give the company a range of advanced systems in driverless technology. These systems combine 360-degree cameras, imaging radar, and LiDAR. The company’s EyeQ chip can also be found in nearly 200 million vehicles worldwide.\nWhile MBLY doesn’t have the parabolic stock gains, it does have something AEVA lacks: profits. The company reported Q1 2025 EPS of $0.08, matching analyst expectations and marking the third consecutive quarter with positive EPS figures.\nAnalysts remain skeptical of the stock, and Goldman Sachs downgraded MBLY from a Buy rating to a Hold rating on June 9. However, the stock has actually risen more than 10% in the last month, and continued AV progress could find many of these analysts offside in their forecasts.\nBefore you consider Aeva Technologies, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Aeva Technologies wasn't on the list.\nWhile Aeva Technologies currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nUnlock your free copy of MarketBeat's comprehensive guide to pot stock investing and discover which cannabis companies are poised for growth.

{"title": "Capitalize on Volatility: 3 Finance Stocks Thriving in 2025", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/capitalize-on-volatility-3-finance-stocks-thriving-in-2025/", "text": "Markets may hate uncertainty, but in 2025, they seem to love volatility. Despite cloudy and, at times, contradictory economic indicators, the NASDAQ and S&P 500 indices reached all-time highs to close out the second quarter.\nShould investors expect more of the same in the year's second half? There is likely to be more clarity about monetary and tariff policy. Analysts also expect companies to report solid earnings in the next quarter, particularly in the tech sector, where the AI trade continues to gain steam.\nHowever, this is also a good time to look beyond technology. Many finance stocks use volatility as a catalyst to drive profits higher. That volatility can take many forms, including surging trading volumes, widening credit spreads, or a spike in corporate financing.\nHere are three stocks well-positioned to capitalize on market volatility and could move significantly higher in the coming months.\nCME Group Is Profiting From Record Derivatives Trading\nCME Group Today\n$275.19 -0.45 (-0.16%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $193.17\n▼\n$290.79 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.82%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 27.69\n- Price Target\n- $260.93\nThe CME Group Inc. NASDAQ: CME operates the world’s largest derivatives marketplace. It enables speculative investors to buy and sell futures and options contracts tied to interest rates, commodities, and other financial instruments.\nTraders flock to these volatile investments in volatile markets to manage risk or benefit from a more speculative environment. This type of activity is likely to increase as expectations grow for at least one interest rate cut.\nThat’s been reflected in CME stock, which has been up more than 40% in the last 12 months and over 18% in 2025. After hitting an all-time high in May, the stock has pulled back. However, after forming a higher low in June, it’s showing signs of recovering to new highs.\nA move higher is supported by the MACD line, which recently made a bullish crossover after a sustained negative move. Another catalyst could be a neutral RSI reading that suggests the stock has room for more upside.\nGoldman Sachs Is a Volatility-Driven Revenue Machine\nThe Goldman Sachs Group Today\nGSThe Goldman Sachs Group\n$709.29 +12.73 (+1.83%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $437.37\n▼\n$726.00 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.69%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 16.46\n- Price Target\n- $614.00\nThe Goldman Sachs Group Inc. NYSE: GS is one of the world’s leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firms with one of the largest trading operations. Volatile markets allow Goldman to generate more revenue as bid-ask spreads expand and trading activity increases across equities, credit, and currencies.\nAnother bullish catalyst for Goldman Sachs during market turbulence is increased M&A transactions and urgent capital raises, which enable Goldman to earn substantial advisory and underwriting fees.\nGoldman’s strong balance sheet also allows it to deploy its funds into dislocated markets, buy distressed assets or step in as a liquidity provider when competitors pull back, reinforcing its competitive advantage during uncertainty.\nGS stock is up 23.8% in 2025, just below its 52-week high set in June. The stock has bullish momentum, but the RSI indicates it may be ready for a short-term pullback or consolidation before moving higher.\nMarketAxess Is Riding the Wave of Credit Market Volatility\nMarketAxess Today\n$218.97 -0.31 (-0.14%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $186.84\n▼\n$296.68 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.39%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 38.08\n- Price Target\n- $241.44\nMarketAxess Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: MKTX operates the leading electronic trading platform for corporate bonds. Due to higher institutional trading volumes, the company tends to outperform when credit spreads widen.\nTherefore, MarketAxess's bull case is that a resurgence in credit market volatility is likely to drive more corporate bond trading, which will, in turn, increase the company’s transaction fee revenue.\nMKTX stock is down 1.5% in 2025 but up 3.1% in the last 3 months. That could be a sign that the stock is getting ready to break out of the consolidation phase it’s been in since March. The MarketAxess Holdings analyst forecast on MarketBeat gives the stock a consensus price target of $241.78, an 8.4% gain. That corresponds with an anticipated 11% gain in earnings over the next 12 months.\nMarketAxess reports earnings on August 5. A solid report could trigger a move higher.\nAt that point, a decisive breakout above resistance near $250–$260 could attract momentum investors, reinforce bullish sentiment and pave the way for sustained upside if fundamentals continue improving.\nBefore you consider MarketAxess, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and MarketAxess wasn't on the list.\nWhile MarketAxess currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nExplore Elon Musk’s boldest ventures yet—from AI and autonomy to space colonization—and find out how investors can ride the next wave of innovation.\nGet This Free Report\nLike this article?

{"title": "Dan Ives’ Bold $5 Trillion Forecast for Microsoft Stock", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/dan-ives-bold-5-trillion-forecast-for-microsoft-stock/", "text": "Microsoft Today\n$501.48 -2.03 (-0.40%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $344.79\n▼\n$506.78 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.66%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 38.75\n- Price Target\n- $534.14\nWall Street analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush is well-known for his bullish outlook on many technology stocks, including Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ: MSFT. In fact, on June 25, Ives reiterated his Outperform rating for MSFT stock and raised his price target from $515 to $600.\nThat’s a gain of over 22%.\nBut what Ives said in supporting the rating and price target raised eyebrows. Microsoft would have a $5 trillion market cap within the next 18 months. Assuming the share count doesn’t change considerably, that would mean that MSFT would have to climb about 39% from its current value, which is about $667.\nThat target sounds ambitious, but Ives believes the company’s dominant position in artificial intelligence and cloud computing will be the key drivers behind this massive valuation. With that in mind, retail investors may find that paying a premium for shares today is justified.\nMicrosoft’s AI Revolution Is Still in the Early Innings\nAccording to Ives, Microsoft is in the early innings of an “AI Revolution” that will reshape enterprise technology over the next decade. Much of this optimism centers on Azure, Microsoft’s cloud platform. Growth on the platform is accelerating as businesses integrate AI into everyday operations.\nIn the most recent quarter, Azure revenue grew 33% year-over-year. That’s already an impressive rate for a platform that generates billions in sales. But Ives argues the market is still underestimating how much incremental spending AI workloads will bring to Azure.\nHe estimates that over the next three years, roughly $1 trillion in enterprise and government IT budgets will shift toward cloud and AI infrastructure. Microsoft, he believes, is positioned to capture a disproportionate share of that spend.\nMicrosoft’s Dispute With OpenAI Is a Wild Card\nWhile much of Dan Ives’ $5 trillion bull case hinges on Microsoft’s AI leadership, the company’s relationship with OpenAI may complicate the outlook.\nMicrosoft has invested over $13 billion in OpenAI and enjoys deep integration with its GPT models across Azure and productivity tools like Office, GitHub, and Teams. These tools, branded under the “Copilot” umbrella, are expected to become major new revenue streams driven by premium subscriptions and embedded AI functionality across enterprise software.\nDisagreements over intellectual property, revenue sharing, and strategic direction have raised concerns about the durability of their partnership. Some issues stem from governance friction at OpenAI, while others involve pricing terms for future access to GPT models.\nIs the Valuation Too Rich?\nThe dispute with OpenAI is one threat to future AI adoption. Another risk comes from competitors such as Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN with its Amazon Web Services and from Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL. Both companies are trying to chip away at Azure’s momentum.\nIf those efforts are successful, it would raise questions about the stock’s valuation. Microsoft is trading at roughly 38 times forward earnings, a significant premium over its 10-year historical average of around 24x.\nFor now, bullish investors can justify the premium because AI is fundamentally changing Microsoft’s earnings trajectory, driven by the potential of faster-growing, higher-margin AI-driven revenue streams.\nBut if the company’s growth slows, even strong earnings growth might not be enough to sustain the stock price at current levels.\nIs MSFT Stock in a Consolidation Pattern?\nMicrosoft Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$534.146.51% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 32 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $501.48 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $605.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $534.14 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $475.00 |\n|---|\nMicrosoft Stock Forecast Details\nOver the past month, MSFT stock has decisively struggled to break above its all-time high near $450. The stock has tested that level multiple times but has met selling pressure each time.\nFrom a technical perspective, this repeated failure to clear resistance suggests the possibility of a consolidation phase. If the stock cannot hold the $430–$440 support area, a pullback toward the 50-day moving average (around $420) is possible.\nA period of sideways trading would not be surprising after the steep rally Microsoft has enjoyed since late 2023.\nFor long-term investors who believe in AI's transformational impact, Microsoft remains one of the highest-quality ways to gain exposure.\nFor those worried about buying at the top, it could make sense to watch the technical picture closely and consider adding shares on pullbacks or after a confirmed breakout.\nBefore you consider Microsoft, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

Of course, Wall Street analysts also make these types of assessments for many publicly traded companies, and their evaluations are often classified with a Buy, Hold, or Sell rating.\nTrusting analyst ratings above all other factors is usually inadvisable. Still, analyst sentiment can be a helpful tool for identifying possible investments or confirming (or complicating) one's own assessment of a company's health and potential.\nThree stocks currently enjoying unanimous (or at least very strong) support from analysts may be worth a closer look for investors. Coincidentally, each of the companies below has also experienced a sharp rally heading into the start of the third quarter of 2025.\nBlackSky Stock Soars 21% on $24M NGA Contract and Satellite Expansion Plans\nBlackSky Technology Today\nBKSYBlackSky Technology\n$23.53 +1.23 (+5.52%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $3.86\n▼\n$24.94 - Price Target\n- $23.00\nFirst up is BlackSky Technology Inc. NYSE: BKSY, an intelligence and data analytics services firm for governments and companies operating satellites. The 21% share price spike in the last week of June 2025 is likely due to BlackSky's announcement of a high-profile, four-year contract with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency worth $24 million. Crucially, this agreement is part of a larger umbrella contract that may yield further business for BlackSky in the years to come as well.\nBlackSky also recently announced a new satellite project that will expand its preexisting high-frequency monitoring constellation for country and data collection. The first launches are region-scale and are expected in 2027. This development is certainly worth watching for investors monitoring BlackSky and other space industry companies.\nThe company's geospatial intelligence subscription-based service has a massive backlog of well over $350 million and strong year-over-year (YOY) sales growth figures topping 20%.\nThis business is poised to continue growing amid increasing global conflict. Still, BlackSky's continued quarterly losses, coupled with a history of share price growth, may give investors pause: According to analysts, BKSY has just 5% in upside potential after the latest rally.\nCore Scientific Pops on Renewed Acquisition Talks\nCore Scientific Today\n$13.18 -0.25 (-1.86%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $6.20\n▼\n$18.63 - Price Target\n- $18.22\nCore Scientific Inc. NASDAQ: CORZ is a cryptocurrency mining and hosting company, but its true value for investors may lie in its data center infrastructure capabilities. The company's shares have surged by about 49% in the last several days of June 2025, coinciding with news that AI hyperscaler CoreWeave NASDAQ: CRWV is resuming talks to acquire Core Scientific.\nCoreWeave made an unsolicited offer to buy all outstanding shares of CORZ in 2024 at a price of $5.75 per share, for a deal totaling more than $1 billion. However, Core Scientific rejected the bid on the grounds that it undervalued the company.\nFollowing the recent spike, Core Scientific's market cap is over $5 billion, and news that CoreWeave remains interested in negotiating an acquisition may suggest to investors that the hyperscaler will pay a premium this time around.\nEven without an acquisition announcement, Core Scientific has benefited from CoreWeave's interest. The two companies signed multiple agreements following the failed acquisition talks last year, including a deal for 200 MW of infrastructure to power CoreWeave's high-performance computing.\nFurther, in rejecting the prior offer, Core Scientific may have successfully made the case that its intrinsic value is higher than the industry may believe it to be.\nSale Speculation Sends Shares of Ambarella Rising, But Other Factors Are at Play Too\nAmbarella Today\n$67.46 -0.56 (-0.82%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $38.86\n▼\n$85.15 - Price Target\n- $84.55\nAmbarella Inc. NASDAQ: AMBA offers system-on-a-chip (SOC) solutions for HD compression and image signal processing, applicable in a multitude of different use cases.

The company's Edge AI SOCs are becoming dominant in a crowded field and fetch a higher price than other Ambarella products.\nIf the company is able to boost the percentage of its sales focused on this area, it could help to further cement its recovery after a difficult 2024 and amid a challenging macro environment.\nEight analysts rate AMBA shares as Buys and four as Holds, but the consensus price target suggests a 28% upside potential.\nBefore you consider BlackSky Technology, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

This blue-chip stock is currently gaining the attention of market watchers due to an unusual combination of circumstances.\nShifts in the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) sector have caused Realty Income's stock price to trade well below its highs and closer to its 365-day average. This has pushed Realty Income’s dividend yield to an attractive 5.59%, which is higher than the industry average of around 4%.\nThe company’s current situation presents a clear opportunity for income-seeking investors to secure a consistent, high-performing monthly income stream. When you examine the company's core strengths in the light of the current volatile market and economic outlook, it starts to suggest that the timing may be right to consider Realty Income for a strategic investment.\nWhat Makes the Monthly Dividend Machine Run?\nRealty Income Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 5.67%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $3.23\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 1 Year\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 293.64%\n- Next Dividend Payment\n- Jul. 15\nO Dividend History\nRealty Income's reputation comes from its remarkably consistent and straightforward business model. As a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), it owns a massive portfolio of over 15,600 commercial properties. Its success is built on the triple-net (NNN) lease.\nAn NNN lease is straightforward: the tenant covers most property-level expenses, including taxes, insurance, and maintenance. This model protects Realty Income from rising property costs, creating a predictable cash flow that funds its monthly dividend.\nA high-quality real estate portfolio backs the strength of this model.\nThe company focuses on tenants with strong financial health, with approximately 40% of its annualized rent coming from clients with investment-grade credit ratings. This signifies a roster of highly dependable tenants.\n- High Occupancy: The company consistently maintains an occupancy rate above 98%. This shows the high demand for its properties and the strength of its tenant relationships.\n- Defensive Tenants: Realty Income leases its properties to businesses in durable sectors, such as convenience stores, grocery stores, and pharmacies. These businesses provide essential goods and services that people need even in tough economic times.\nThis operational strength has resulted in one of the best dividend track records available. Realty Income is a member of the Dividend Aristocrats, a select group of companies that have increased their dividend for at least 25 straight years. Its dividend safety is best measured by its Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) payout ratio, which remains healthy and sustainable.\nThis means the company's cash flow comfortably covers its dividend payments, providing a buffer for continued payouts and future growth.\nThe Fed Factor: Positioning for a Potential Rate Pivot\nWhile strong fundamentals make Realty Income a solid long-term holding, a key economic factor, interest rates, sharpens the current investment case.\nRealty Income Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$61.157.35% UpsideHoldBased on 13 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $56.97 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $68.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $61.15 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $58.00 |\n|---|\nRealty Income Stock Forecast Details\nHigh-yield dividend stocks, such as Realty Income, often move opposite to interest rates. When rates go up, as they have recently, safer investments like government bonds become more attractive. This can create a headwind for REIT valuations. However, the situation reverses when the Federal Reserve is expected to lower rates. Realty Income’s dividend becomes more appealing, boosting investor demand and lifting its stock price.\nThis relationship highlights the current opportunity. Realty Income is built to handle rate changes with its fortress balance sheet. It holds a strong A-level credit rating from S&P and Moody's, allowing it to borrow money on good terms.\nNotably, over 90% of its debt is at a fixed rate, which shields the company from the expense of rising interest rates. The company's leverage is also managed conservatively, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.4x, a standard industry metric indicating that its debt level is manageable relative to its earnings.\nFrom a valuation standpoint, the stock's Price-to-AFFO multiple is trading at a reasonable level compared to its historical averages. This suggests that the market may have already priced in much of the risk associated with the higher-rate environment, potentially limiting further downside.\nLooking ahead, the Federal Reserve's potential decision to lower rates up to twice in the remainder of 2025 should benefit the stock in two ways:\n- Higher Stock Value: Lower market rates would make Realty Income's 5.59% dividend yield more attractive, likely attracting more investors and increasing the stock's value.\n- Less Expensive Growth: Lower borrowing costs would make it more affordable for the company to acquire new properties, thereby supporting its long-term growth.\nRealty Income's Role in a Portfolio\nRealty Income presents a compelling package in summer 2025: a best-in-class business, a world-class dividend history, and a strong balance sheet. This is combined with a potential economic tailwind that could benefit the stock.\nThe current price allows investors to establish a position offering a strong initial yield. While all investments carry risk, Realty Income is designed to be a cornerstone for long-term income, not a vehicle for short-term speculation.\nWall Street's consensus 12-month price target of around $61 reinforces the investment case. Achieving that price would represent capital appreciation of approximately 7.5% from current levels.\nWhen combined with the 5.59% dividend yield, this implies a potential total return in the double-digit range over the next year, making a strong argument for its place as one of the market's most reliable dividend machines.\nBefore you consider Realty Income, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Realty Income wasn't on the list.\nWhile Realty Income currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nMarket downturns give many investors pause, and for good reason.

Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $22.10\n▼\n$46.57 - P/E Ratio\n- 192.67\n- Price Target\n- $41.21\nThe market has surged to fresh highs in recent weeks, with the technology sector continuing to lead the charge. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund NYSEARCA: XLK is trading at all-time highs, and within the sector, software names in particular have remained standout performers.\nAs the bull market extends, appetite for growth and momentum continues to rise, especially for companies with strong technical setups. One name that stands out in this environment is Toast Inc. NYSE: TOST. Shares of the cloud-based restaurant software company are up over 21% year-to-date, and nearly 200% over the past three years.\nDespite a lofty valuation, the stock continues to attract interest, and it may have further room to run.\nWhat Is Toast, Inc.?\nToast, Inc., is a cloud-based restaurant management platform that provides integrated hardware and software solutions. Designed specifically for the full-service and quick-service restaurant industries, Toast enables restaurants to manage real-time orders, payments, operations, and customer engagement.\nThe platform covers everything from front-of-house point-of-sale terminals and handheld devices to kitchen display systems and self-service kiosks. Since launching its first product in 2013, Toast has expanded rapidly across the U.S., serving independent restaurants, multi-location chains, and franchise groups.\nThe company has established partnerships with delivery services, financial institutions, and technology vendors to strengthen its ecosystem further. As of Monday’s close, Toast commands a market capitalization of $25.6 billion, solidly placing it in the mid-cap category.\nPositive Sentiment and Strong Earnings Momentum\nThe mid-cap space has been gaining strength overall, with the S&P MidCap 400 ETF NYSEARCA: MDY pushing toward a major breakout near the $570 level. This broadening market strength is helping fuel sentiment for mid-cap growth names, such as Toast.\nToast Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$41.21-7.01% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 24 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $44.31 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $50.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $41.21 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $28.00 |\n|---|\nToast Stock Forecast Details\nAnalyst sentiment has also turned increasingly bullish. Among 24 analysts covering the stock, 12 rate it a Buy and 12 rate it a Hold, an improvement from prior months when the consensus was a more neutral Hold. Part of the optimism is driven by improving technicals and positive earnings momentum.\nOn May 8, 2025, Toast reported strong Q1 earnings, beating EPS estimates and reaffirming its growth trajectory. The company delivered EPS of $0.10, representing a 167% year-over-year increase, which exceeded consensus expectations. Revenue came in at $1.34 billion, up 24.7%, in line with analyst forecasts.\nToast also reported net income of $56 million, representing a 75% quarter-over-quarter increase, and adjusted EBITDA reached $133 million, with GAAP operating income of $43 million.\nIn addition to the substantial headline numbers, Toast reported 31% growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR), with SaaS ARR climbing 32%. The company added over 6,000 net new locations, bringing its global total to approximately 140,000.\nNotable enterprise wins during the quarter included new partnerships with Applebee’s and Topgolf. Toast also unveiled ToastIQ, its new AI-driven intelligence engine designed to enhance restaurant performance and decision-making.\nThe company raised its full-year 2025 outlook, projecting 26% growth in fintech and subscription gross profit and $550 million in adjusted EBITDA.\nFollowing the report, the stock jumped nearly 20% as investors responded to the earnings beat and improved guidance.\nInstitutional Activity Supports the Bull Case\nInstitutional support has been a key factor in TOST’s strength. Over the past 12 months, $4.5 billion in institutional capital has flowed into the stock, compared to $2.4 billion in outflows.\nWith 82.9% of shares held by institutions, Toast continues to be a name that several funds are actively accumulating.\nWatch the $45 Breakout Level\nToast, Inc. (TOST) Price Chart for Thursday, July, 10, 2025\nTechnically, TOST is consolidating just below a key resistance area near $45. Since the post-earnings rally, the stock has spent over a month digesting gains in a tightening range. A breakout above this level could trigger another leg higher, with momentum traders potentially targeting a move toward $50.\nOn the downside, $42 is acting as short-term support. If the stock pulls back into that area, it may present an attractive entry point for longer-term investors looking for a favorable risk-reward setup and potential entry point.\nBefore you consider Toast, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Breakout Alert: Disney Stock Hits Multi-Year High", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/breakout-alert-disney-stock-hits-multi-year-high/", "text": "Walt Disney Today\n$121.54 +0.93 (+0.77%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $80.10\n▼\n$124.69 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.82%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 24.85\n- Price Target\n- $127.35\nOn a day when the S&P 500 hit a fresh record high, Disney Inc. NYSE: DIS gave its investors something to cheer about by hitting a multi-year high of its own. Monday’s session saw the stock print its highest level since August 2022, as it looked finally ready to break out of the multi-year range it’s been trapped in.\nIt’s only been a few weeks since it was testing the lower end of that range back in April, but after rallying more than 50% since then, Disney is shaping up as one of the summer’s most exciting comeback plays.\nMuch of this upside has been fueled by May’s strong earnings report and a general resurgence in risk appetite across equities, and investors would be forgiven for thinking the stock wanted to take a breather. However, analysts' fresh commentary this week suggests plenty more gains to come.\nMassive Upside From Cruises for Disney\nThe team over at Jefferies upgraded Disney to Buy on Monday, lifting their price target to $144 and joining the growing chorus of bulls that includes Guggenheim and Rosenblatt, both of whom raised their targets to $140 in June. Jefferies had previously flagged macroeconomic concerns, a slowdown in consumer spending, and increasing competition as reasons to be cautious on Disney, but those fears have since eased.\nThey cited positive commentary around Disney World bookings while pointing to two new cruise ships due in 2026, which are expected to generate as much as $1.5 billion in fresh revenue.\nIt’s a strong vote of confidence in Disney’s ability to drive top-line growth from multiple levers, and it also highlights how the company is being viewed through various lenses. This optimism around its diversification efforts is a powerful tailwind for the stock, particularly as it breaks out from technical resistance.\nThe Technical Setup Is Pointing Higher\nFor the better part of the past two years, Disney has failed to break through resistance around the $125 level. Each time shares have been tested since August 2022, they have been turned around and invariably sent back to test the lows below $90.\nThis pattern looks like it could soon be over, though, based on the stock’s price action of the past week, it just set a new high for 2025, surpassed the highs from 2024 and 2023 and closed on June 30 less than 2% away from the peak in August 2022.\nThe Walt Disney Company (DIS) Price Chart for Thursday, July, 10, 2025\nIf it can hold onto this momentum in the coming sessions, the door should be open for a move to, and through, $130 in the short term. From there, the path to Jefferies’ $144 target looks relatively straightforward, especially with strong market momentum behind it.\nA Word of Caution\nWalt Disney Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$127.354.78% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 24 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $121.54 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $147.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $127.35 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $95.00 |\n|---|\nWalt Disney Stock Forecast Details\nThat said, the RSI is starting to look extended, closing on Monday just under 78, which puts it in extremely overbought territory. While that suggests a near-term cooldown could be on the table, it’s also a classic hallmark of a stock in a strong trend and could easily go higher if the breakout is confirmed and the algorithms start picking it up.\nDisney’s bulls will want to see this kind of technical strength, and the ongoing bullish MACD crossover only reinforces that this is a rally with some room to run yet.\nThe only other near-term risk worth flagging is the upcoming earnings report in the first week of August. Expectations will be high, with the stock up more than 50% since April, and RSI will get a little frothy. Any stumble could derail momentum, even if only temporarily. Still, analyst support is overwhelmingly bullish, and the breakout is all but confirmed.\nIf Disney can build on this week’s gains and stay above $125, a run toward new multi-year highs is far more likely.\nBefore you consider Walt Disney, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Forget IBM: Accenture’s AI Momentum Is Your Next Buy", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/forget-ibm-accentures-ai-momentum-is-your-next-buy/", "text": "For International Business Machines NYSE: IBM and Accenture NYSE: ACN, markets have reacted in starkly different fashion to the stories of these two Gen-AI consulting leaders. Both companies have built multi-billion-dollar Gen-AI businesses, but one stock has soared, while the other hasn’t. Over the past 52 weeks, IBM shares have provided a total return of approximately 76% as of the June 30 close.\nMeanwhile, Accenture’s total return is approximately 0%. This divergence in returns has led Wall Street forecasts to see solid downside potential in IBM, while seeing notable upside potential in Accenture. Importantly, Accenture's Gen-AI business is growing considerably faster.\nHowever, why has the stock been unable to capture gains like IBM, and why are analysts predicting that this can change?\nAccenture’s Gen AI Book: Smaller, But Faster Growing Than Big Blue\nAccenture Today\n$288.04 -9.36 (-3.15%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $273.19\n▼\n$398.35 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.06%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 22.93\n- Price Target\n- $370.71\nIBM’s success in Gen-AI has been well documented. The tech company’s Gen-AI book of business grew to $6 billion from inception through March of this year. IBM achieved this over seven quarters, as the company started reporting this figure back in Q3 2023.\nThis implies average quarterly booking growth of around $850 million.\nMany may not be aware that Accenture has a sizable Gen-AI business. Through the three quarters ending May 31, Accenture’s Gen-AI book of business stands at $4.1 billion. This figure implies average Gen-AI bookings growth of nearly $1.37 billion per quarter.\nAccenture’s Gen-AI bookings growth of $1.5 billion last quarter was also 50% higher than IBM’s “more than $1 billion” figure. Accenture's later reporting date likely benefited the firm due to AI growth.\nStill, Accenture clearly had a stronger quarter than IBM in Gen-AI. So why is the company’s stock not getting much love from the market?\nACN: Macro and Internal Issues Cast Cloud Over AI Wins\nUnfortunately, Accenture's impressive Gen-AI story is being overshadowed by many other parts of its business. Accenture is a massive company, and other business lines are not performing well.\nThe company’s overall bookings, a signal of future revenue, declined by 6% last quarter.\nThe company stated that \"a significantly elevated level of uncertainty\" in the economy this year is impacting its customers. As a consulting firm, many of the services the firm provides are discretionary. In periods of uncertainty, discretionary spending is the first thing to be negatively affected.\nAccenture’s federal government business is also slowing, and the company sees this as a 2% headwind to overall revenue growth next quarter. However, the company also noted that it is prioritizing “reinvention” through Gen AI. This is helping the company’s Gen-AI business, but it could also cannibalize clients and other revenue streams.\nStill, in the long run, this is likely a positive development for Accenture as it looks to be a leader in AI consulting.\nAdditionally, the company is dealing with the loss of key leadership figures and a long-term internal restructuring of its services segment. These worries cloud the company’s future, making it difficult for investors to reward the firm for its AI accomplishments.\nThe firm’s Gen AI bookings still comprise less than 8%. So, they don’t move the overall needle in a big way yet. Overall, the company is dealing with some significant near-to-mid-term challenges.\nHowever, Gen AI is vital to the firm’s long-term success. The fact that it is winning on this front positions the stock nicely over the coming years.\nWall Street Sees Significantly More Upside in Accenture, But Patience Is Paramount\nAccenture Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$370.7128.70% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 21 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $288.04 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $425.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $370.71 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $325.00 |\n|---|\nAccenture Stock Forecast Details\nThe MarketBeat-tracked consensus price target on IBM is around $254, implying over 13% downside from the stock’s June 30 closing price. However, its two most recently updated price targets are $325 and $320, signaling around 10% upside. The MarketBeat-tracked consensus price target for Accenture is $370, implying nearly 24% upside.\nAlthough many on Wall Street see downside in IBM and upside in Accenture, that doesn’t make the two mutually exclusive. Investors could view IBM as the proven performer and momentum play when it comes to capitalizing on AI services and consulting.\nMeanwhile, Accenture is a longer-duration and cheaper play. Accenture’s approximately 22x forward price to earnings (P/E) ratio is solidly less expensive than the 26x figure IBM trades at.\nThis difference likely incorporates the headwinds Accenture is currently facing.\nHowever, Accenture has a significant opportunity to see its Gen-AI progress rewarded going forward after these other issues subside. Still, that could take a long time.\nBefore you consider Accenture, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "2 Under the Radar Space & Defense Stocks With Huge Potential", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/2-under-the-radar-space-and-defense-stocks-with-huge-potential/", "text": "Within the space and defense industry, the world’s largest players often dominate the discussion. This includes companies like Lockheed Martin NYSE: LMT and RTX NYSE: RTX. These firms manufacture F-35 fighter jets and the Patriot missile defense system, respectively. Products like these have allowed them to attain huge market capitalizations. However, the space and defense industry is far from bereft of up-and-coming players that are making a name for themselves. Working with giants like Lockheed indicates these firms could be set up to make waves going forward. Below are the details on two such names. All data cited is as of the June 30 close, unless otherwise indicated.\nKratos: Unmanned Jets & Hypersonics Are Giant Opportunities for This Profitable Player\nKratos Defense & Security Solutions Today\nKTOSKratos Defense & Security Solutions\n$46.27 +0.25 (+0.54%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $17.91\n▼\n$47.09 - P/E Ratio\n- 355.95\n- Price Target\n- $46.25\nFirst up is Kratos Defense & Security Solutions NASDAQ: KTOS. Many of the technologies that Kratos is developing are next-generation. This includes autonomous jet fighters and hypersonic missile systems. At the beginning of 2025, Kratos received an award for a hypersonic missile test bed worth up to $1.45 billion. The company aims to develop a system that can test hypersonic missiles in a more affordable way.\nThe company’s focus on being both “first to market” and affordable is compelling. The company provided several examples in its Annual Shareholders Meeting Brief on technologies where it is first to market, including jet drones and hypersonic flyers. Being first to market shows the company’s technological prowess, and a focus on affordability increases the likelihood that its systems will be commercially viable.\nKratos also works with the big boys in defense, showing that it can offer something these companies can’t or don’t want to do themselves. It calls Lockheed and RTX (Raytheon) some of its “outstanding partners.\" Specifically, the company works with GE Aerospace NYSE: GE to develop low-cost turbofan jet engines.\nLast quarter, Kratos ended with an opportunity pipeline worth $12.6 billion, an all-time high for the firm. That is nearly 10 times more than the revenues the company expects to generate in 2025. Converting just a moderate percentage of this pipeline would allow the company to significantly accelerate its revenue growth in the coming years. Last quarter, revenue growth was 9.2%.\nNotably, Kratos is profitable, generating non-adjusted net income per share of $0.03 last quarter. The company’s very high forward price-to-earnings ratio of 86x may seem frightening. However, revenue streams like unmanned jets still remain largely untapped, as the company is not producing them at scale. Future production scale-ups would not only boost revenues but also margins. The company says that in the second half of 2025, it could receive its most important tactical drone award ever.\nVoyager: Starlab Could Send Shares to the Moon, But Risk Is Palpable\nVoyager Technologies Today\nVOYGVoyager Technologies\n$42.20 +0.85 (+2.06%) As of 03:53 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $37.64\n▼\n$73.95 - Price Target\n- $49.00\nNext up is Voyager Technologies NYSE: VOYG. This company went public on June 11, 2025. The stock more than doubled that same day after opening at a price of $31. However, shares have fallen significantly since, down to $39 as of the June 30 close. Like many companies in this industry, Voyager focuses largely on both space and defense solutions.\nPer its S-1 registration filing, the company generates 50% of its revenue from space solutions and 50% from defense. Notably, NASA contributed 26% of the company’s revenue while Lockheed provided 17% in 2024. In August 2024, Lockheed selected Voyager to build an advanced solid-propulsion subsystem for the United States’ Next Generation Interceptor (NGI). The NGI is a missile defense system.\nHowever, the particularly interesting aspect of Voyager’s business is in space. Voyager is leading the creation of Starlab, the NASA-backed space station that could replace the International Space Station (ISS). But, there are several other projects also competing to replace the ISS. Voyager initially received a reward for the project worth $217 million. Winning the next funding phase is crucial to the firm’s success. It would provide much more funding and give the company a solid chance to receive billions in revenue once Starlab is operational. However, not gaining this funding could be catastrophic for the firm’s ambitions. NASA expects to announce the next awards in mid-2026.\nOverall, both Kratos and Voyager are smaller defense companies that receive less attention but have significant long-term potential. Kratos, being further along and having a robust backlog, represents the safer option. Voyager's long-term opportunity, especially as it relates to space, is more speculative, but significant nonetheless.\nBefore you consider Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Kratos Defense & Security Solutions wasn't on the list.\nWhile Kratos Defense & Security Solutions currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nNeed to stretch out your 401K or Roth IRA plan?

{"title": "Dollar Down 10%? These 3 Stocks Could Soar", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/dollar-down-10-these-3-stocks-could-soar/", "text": "The U.S. Dollar Index is down 10% in the first half of 2025. That’s the weakest year-to-date performance since 1972, when the United States moved away from the gold standard.\nSeveral interrelated factors are dragging the dollar down. A major one is a chaotic trade and tariff policy that is still a work in progress. At the same time, there are growing concerns about the country’s public debt—concerns that will only get stronger if Congress passes the Trump administration’s “big, beautiful bill,” which will, at least on paper, increase the national debt by trillions of dollars over the next decade.\nCommodity prices are also on the rise, and rising commodity prices tend to strengthen the currencies of major exporters like Canada and Australia. This in turn puts additional pressure on the U.S. dollar. Plus, Europe and Asia are rebounding quickly from last year's slowdown, causing a flight to safety to flow to foreign equities and bonds.\nDespite all the negativity surrounding the U.S. dollar, the S&P 500 hit an all-time high at the end of June. Many market analysts believe that many issues serving as headwinds today (tariffs, inflation, uncertainty on tax policy) will turn into tailwinds for gross domestic product (GDP) in the second half of the year.\nKeeping all this in mind, here are three stocks that are likely to perform well while the dollar is weak and are also poised for a recovery right here in the United States.\nCaterpillar: Global Demand and Onshoring Drive Growth\nCaterpillar Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$404.64-0.88% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 17 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $408.22 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $500.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $404.64 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $283.00 |\n|---|\nCaterpillar Stock Forecast Details\nCaterpillar NYSE: CAT stands out as a prime beneficiary of a weaker U.S. dollar. With more than half of its revenue generated from international markets, the company gains when foreign earnings convert into stronger dollar terms. The company also benefits directly from rising commodity prices because its heavy machinery is heavily used in mining operations.\nBut there are also domestic catalysts at play with Caterpillar. Many companies have responded to the Trump administration’s calls to onshore their manufacturing, translating into increased demand for industrial equipment. These commitments, along with capital already committed to build data centers, will be bullish for Caterpillar.\nThat said, CAT stock is up over 11% in the last month and is now trading above the consensus price target of the analysts tracked by MarketBeat. The stock also has a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of over 19x, which makes it expensive compared to its historical levels as well as other industrial stocks.\nWhile investors may want to wait for a little pullback, they may not want to wait too long. On June 24, Citigroup raised its price target for CAT stock from $370 to $420.\nProcter & Gamble: A Weak Dollar Lifts International Sales\nProcter & Gamble Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$178.4512.62% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 23 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $158.46 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $209.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $178.45 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $161.00 |\n|---|\nProcter & Gamble Stock Forecast Details\nThe Procter & Gamble Company NYSE: PG is similar to Caterpillar in that about 50% of the company’s revenue comes from overseas. That explains why its earnings per share (EPS) remain slightly higher year-over-year (YOY) even as its revenue is under pressure.\nConsumer staples stocks in the United States have struggled lately. That’s because the pricing power that many companies enjoyed in 2020 and 2021 has turned into a liability as higher-for-longer interest rates and sticky inflation has caused consumers to be more discerning about how they spend their dollars.\nPG stock is down about 5.4% through the first half of 2025. However, even at a forward P/E ratio of around 24x, the stock is still trading at a discount to itself. Analysts project EPS growth of around 6% over the next year, and even that forecast may underestimate potential gains if U.S. economic conditions improve in the second half of the year.\nIBM: AI and Quantum Bets Pay Off Abroad\nInternational Business Machines Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$259.06-9.79% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 19 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $287.19 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $325.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $259.06 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $195.00 |\n|---|\nInternational Business Machines Stock Forecast Details\nAt the midpoint of 2025, IBM NYSE: IBM may be ready to win the title of comeback stock of the year—or maybe of the decade. IBM stock is up 33% in 2025, and Wedbush recently raised its price target from $300 to $325. That would be a gain of over 10% for investors.\nThe company's resurgence is largely driven by its ability to make artificial intelligence (AI) practical for large enterprises, particularly agentic AI. Like the other stocks on this list, IBM also generates significant revenue from international customers.\nAnother key driver is IBM’s long-standing investment in the quantum computing space. This has been a targeted bet for IBM over several years that is paying off as quantum computing becomes a reality.\nThe outperformance of IBM stock in 2025 makes it expensive based on many metrics. For example, its earnings yield of 2.07% is lower than its dividend yield, which suggests that IBM is paying out more in dividends than it earns in profit relative to its stock price. But IBM's dividend is backed by the company’s free cash flow (FCF) ratio, which is higher than its historical averages.\nBefore you consider International Business Machines, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "IGM ETF: Expand Tech Exposure With Top AI Leaders", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/igm-etf-expand-tech-exposure-with-top-ai-leaders/", "text": "The technology sector is currently dominated by the artificial intelligence (AI) gold rush, which is generating significant investor excitement and driving historic market performance. The meteoric rise of companies like NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA has demonstrated the immense potential of this technological shift, leaving many investors with a critical question: How can one invest in an entire revolution without accepting the high-risk gamble of picking individual stocks?\nAs investors seek strategies to capitalize on this trend, thematic exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have emerged as popular solutions. The iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF NYSEARCA: IGM has gained considerable traction by offering a unique and targeted approach to owning the companies at the forefront of AI innovation.\nThe Expanded Advantage in IGM's Portfolio\nA look under the hood of IGM reveals a portfolio built with a distinct and aggressive philosophy. The fund's strategy is to track the S&P North American Expanded Technology Sector Index, and that single word, expanded, is key to its unique structure.\nUnlike more traditional tech funds that strictly adhere to the information technology sector (IT), IGM’s mandate allows it to include influential, tech-related companies from the communication services (which includes media, entertainment, and interactive services) and consumer discretionary sectors.\nThis modern approach recognizes that technological influence transcends rigid sector definitions. It allows for the strategic inclusion of powerhouse firms like Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META and Netflix NASDAQ: NFLX, which are central to digital content and media but often excluded from more narrowly focused tech ETFs.\nThe result is a non-diversified portfolio intentionally concentrated in the market's most dominant names. This is not a broad, passive index fund; it is a high-conviction vehicle where the performance is directly tied to the collective success of a select group of market leaders.\nThe fund’s composition is a window into this focused approach. The portfolio is dominated by companies that are building the AI future, with significant positions in Microsoft NASDAQ: MSFT, whose cloud and software suite are deeply integrated with AI; Nvidia, the undisputed leader in AI chip manufacturing; and Meta Platforms, a pioneer in developing large language models.\nThese are complemented by foundational innovators like Broadcom NASDAQ: AVGO and Apple NASDAQ: AAPL. The fund also provides meaningful exposure to high-growth enterprise software through names like Palantir Technologies NASDAQ: PLTR, a pure-play AI platform that has captured significant investor attention.\nThis deliberate concentration means that when these leaders perform well, the impact on IGM's value can be substantial.\nStrong Returns, Bullish Sentiment\nThis focused strategy has translated into strong market momentum and tangible results. The fund’s performance serves as a clear indicator of its potential, delivering a total gain of over 60% in the 2023 bull market and continuing with a strong increase of approximately 14.5% in the second quarter of 2025. This level of return underscores the fund’s aggressive positioning.\nThe fund's inherent volatility is quantified by its beta of 1.26. This metric suggests that IGM has historically been about 26% more volatile than the S&P 500. For investors, this means the fund tends to amplify market movements, offering the potential for outsized returns in bullish environments while also carrying a higher degree of risk during downturns.\nRecent investor behavior indicates a growing conviction in IGM's strategy.\nThe fund has experienced consistent net inflows, attracting approximately $250 million in new assets during the second quarter of 2025, bringing its total assets under management (AUM) to roughly $6.4 billion.\nAt the same time, data shows a sharp decline in short interest, which is basically the number of bets made that the fund's price will fall. This combination of new money coming in and bearish bets declining suggests that market sentiment is firmly positive, which can serve as a strong technical tailwind for the fund's price.\niShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (IGM) Price Chart for Thursday, July, 10, 2025\nA High-Conviction Tool for the Tech Bull\nThe iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF is not a passive, broad-market fund for every investor. It is a targeted and aggressive instrument designed for those with a high tolerance for volatility and a strong, long-term bullish outlook on the future of North American technology, particularly in artificial intelligence.\nIts thoughtful, expanded-sector approach provides a unique method for capturing the influence of tech's biggest names.\nWhile recent changes to the fund's management team are notable, its core strategy remains unchanged. It is designed to passively track its underlying index.\nThis ensures a level of strategic continuity that is less dependent on any single manager. For investors looking for a powerful tool to execute a high-conviction thesis on the AI revolution, IGM presents a compelling case, with a moderate 0.41% expense ratio for its specialized exposure.\nBefore you consider iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Joby Stock Soars as Piloted Flights in Dubai Signal a New Era", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/joby-stock-soars-as-piloted-flights-in-dubai-signal-a-new-era/", "text": "Joby Aviation Today\n$12.32 +0.76 (+6.53%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $4.66\n▼\n$12.46 - Price Target\n- $9.33\nA wave of investor conviction sent Joby Aviation NYSE: JOBY shares to a new 52-week high during the last trading days of June 2025. The stock jumped more than 14% during the trading day to over $11.00, driven by a volume of more than 41 million shares, nearly triple its daily average.\nThis decisive market move was not based on speculation, but rather a direct reaction to a company announcement: Joby has successfully begun piloting wingborne flights with its production-configured aircraft in Dubai. This achievement marks a critical turning point where years of strategic planning are now translating into tangible, real-world operations on the global stage.\nWhy Dubai Validates Joby's Entire Business Model\nThe successful flights in the United Arab Emirates represent a turning point for the company, marking the official commencement of its commercial market readiness efforts. This phase involves proving the entire operational ecosystem, from logistics and maintenance to ground crew coordination, in a key international market where Joby has a clear path to generating revenue.\nThis milestone provides the first concrete evidence that the company is on track to meet its goal of launching commercial passenger service in Dubai in the first quarter of 2026. The operations are being conducted in close collaboration with Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), validating a productive public-private partnership model.\nThis builds upon Joby's landmark agreement, which grants it the exclusive right to operate air taxis in Dubai for a six-year period. The necessary ground support is also advancing in parallel, with partner Skyports actively constructing the first vertiport at Dubai International Airport (DXB).\nFor investors, this operational success in Dubai de-risks the business model in several crucial ways:\n- Tangible Timelines: With initial routes planned to connect DXB with locations such as the Palm Jumeirah and Dubai Marina, the vision becomes concrete. A trip that takes 45 minutes by car is projected to take just 12 minutes in a Joby aircraft.\n- Global Validation: Joby has now proven it can export its aircraft and establish complex flight operations far from its California headquarters, validating its entire international strategy.\n- Technical Proof: The flights confirm that the aircraft’s systems, including its climate-controlled cabin and battery technology, perform as designed in the extreme desert heat, building on extensive prior testing with the U.S. Air Force.\nHow Market Mechanics Fueled Joby's Surge\nThe fundamental news from Dubai landed on a market that was primed for a significant move. A combination of bullish sentiment and certain technical factors intensified the stock’s rally.\nA primary driver was a massive spike in the options market. On the day of the announcement, trading volume for call options jumped by 209% near midday. This signals a significant wave of traders making decisive bets that the stock's upward momentum will continue.\nThis bullish conviction collided head-on with the stock’s significant short interest. As of mid-June, approximately 14.6% of Joby’s publicly available shares were sold short. This dynamic creates the potential for a short squeeze. When a major positive catalyst drives a stock's price up sharply, investors betting against the stock are often forced to buy shares to close out their losing positions.\nThis wave of forced buying adds powerful fuel to the rally, pushing the price even higher. The combination of a landmark achievement, a frenzy of call buying, and a high level of short interest created the conditions for Joby’s stock price breakout.\nKey Catalysts on the Horizon for Joby\nJoby Aviation Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$9.33-24.21% DownsideHoldBased on 6 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $12.32 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $13.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $9.33 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $5.00 |\n|---|\nJoby Aviation Stock Forecast Details\nWhile the Dubai flights mark a significant achievement, investors will now turn their attention to the next set of catalysts required to sustain this momentum. In the United States, the primary focus remains on the FAA type certification process. The next milestone is the company's entry into the final phase of Type Inspection Authorization (TIA) flight testing, targeted for 2025, which is the last major hurdle before commercial U.S. operations can be considered.\nJoby’s financial strength will be in the spotlight during its next quarterly report, estimated for August 6, 2025. This report will provide the first official look at Joby's balance sheet after receiving the $250 million capital infusion from Toyota, offering an updated view of its substantial financial runway. Finally, continued operational progress in Dubai and news of the manufacturing ramp-up at the larger facility in Dayton, Ohio, will serve as key indicators of the company’s ability to execute its plan at scale.\nThe successful launch of piloted flights in Dubai marks a clear inflection point for Joby Aviation. The company has officially transitioned from promise to proven execution on the global stage. The market’s decisive rally is a justified acknowledgment of a de-risked and accelerating path to commercialization, cementing Joby's leadership position in the eVTOL sector and in the race to launch a new era in transportation.\nBefore you consider Joby Aviation, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

NASDAQ: PLTR stock end the week on a sell-off, the company announced a deal that supports the long-term bullish case for Palantir. Specifically, the company signed a 5-year, $100 million contract with the U.S. government to co-develop what it calls a Nuclear Operating System (NOS).\nNuclear energy is being explored around the world for several reasons. Globally, dozens of countries are reviving nuclear plans for their decarbonization strategies. In the United States, the Biden and Trump administrations have supported advanced reactors and the modernization of aging facilities, underscoring the bipartisan backing for nuclear as a reliable baseload power.\nAlso, the exploding demand for AI, evidenced by the proposed infrastructure spending on data centers, means the demand for power will reach levels that the current infrastructure simply can’t meet.\nThird, many governments are actively subsidizing upgrades to critical infrastructure, meaning that this sector will likely benefit from both public and private dollars in the coming years.\nThe Sell-Off Was Expected and Short-Lived\nFirst, it’s important to understand why PLTR stock sold off so sharply at the end of the June 27 trading session. This had to do with the “Russell rebalancing.” In this case, Palantir is being promoted to the Russell 1000 from the Russell 2000. This reflects the company’s strong stock price growth in the last 12 months, which means it’s now part of the index’s large-cap category.\nHowever, this promotion meant passive funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had to rebalance their portfolios. This impacted several technology stocks, particularly those with high liquidity such as Palantir. As is often the case, however, this sell-off appears to be short-lived as PLTR stock is up more than 5% in midday trading on June 30.\nWhy Palantir is the Right Company for the NOS’s Work\nPalantir Technologies Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$89.32-37.32% DownsideReduceBased on 23 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $142.50 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $155.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $89.32 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $18.00 |\n|---|\nPalantir Technologies Stock Forecast Details\nPalantir described this contract as a “U.S. government partnership to develop an integrated Nuclear Operating System.” Many of the current nuclear facilities use decades-old equipment. One objective of this partnership is likely to be modernizing critical infrastructure.\nThat means more than hardware, it also means software and with that AI.\nThe goal is to create a next-generation digital platform to run, monitor, and optimize nuclear reactors and facilities. This will require the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, IoT sensor feeds, cybersecurity and predictive maintenance capabilities.\nThis is an example of how AI is carving out a role in the energy sector. Several companies are already building digital twins and AI-driven controls for power facilities, and similar work will likely be necessary in this case.\nThat plays into Palantir’s core capabilities, and the five-year commitment is another example of Palantir executing its strategy to add new customers on long-term, predictable contracts.\nThe NOS agreement follows a string of contracts with the U.S. Army and major energy companies, underscoring Palantir’s push to become the operating system for defense intelligence and the broader industrial economy.\nThis Deal is Unlikely to Sway the Naysayers\nThis is one of many deals that Palantir has announced in the past three months. However, it isn’t causing the company’s detractors to move away from their bearish sentiment. An analyst from William Blair maintained a Hold rating on PLTR stock, although the analyst declined to issue a price target.\nThe analyst cited that OpenAI recently won the Department of Defense (DoD) bid over Palantir. The belief is that this is one example of growing competition as customers look for other alternatives.\nThat combined with the company’s lofty valuation, at least by traditional metrics such as a 112x price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. This suggests that Palantir will have to continue to impress when it releases its earnings report in early August.\nBefore you consider Palantir Technologies, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Why McCormick Stock Could Soar After Durables Data Surprise", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-mccormick-stock-could-soar-after-durables-data-surprise/", "text": "McCormick & Company, Incorporated Today\nMKCMcCormick & Company, Incorporated\n$72.49 +0.28 (+0.39%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io.

However, in a market where information is as readily available as ever, it is more important today for investors to start tracking such data to help them generate ideas and develop timing tools for these ideas.\nAs of late June 2025, data for durable goods orders in the United States economy came in nearly double economist expectations, and, of course, any stock with exposure to durable goods (those that won’t perish within 30 days) jumped in reaction. Far from being late to the party, investors can use this data point to justify a new potential position in the stocks that are most likely to keep following up on this momentum.\nOne of those stocks is McCormick Inc. NYSE: MKC, not only because its fundamental business and products perfectly fit the description of non-perishable goods but also because of broader market conditions across the entire stock market today. As the S&P 500 index is over-concentrated in technology stocks today, there is a pending (massive) rotation due for other value names inside the consumer staples sector, where McCormick comes into play.\nWhy McCormick Deserves Attention from Investors\nThis is a company that most would not look over, as being in the food industry typically doesn’t go along any non-perishable thesis. However, this is where human research and intuition can help investors beat the semi-automated systems that would automatically bypass this opportunity.\nInvestors can now understand that by manufacturing seasoning mixes and similar products, McCormick is well-positioned to benefit from an increasing wave of durable goods orders in the future for the United States economy, an undervalued opportunity that is now in plain sight.\nIn fact, over the past month alone, up to 2.2% of McCormick stock’s short interest has declined to show a clear sign of bearish capitulation in the making, as these bearish investors start to realize that the future of this company may have a few positive catalysts as the economic data trickles down into the business.\nWith short sellers starting to retreat from McCormick stock, a new upward pressure may be forming to also capture the attention of new institutional buyers who are seeking momentum stocks like this one. Over the past month (which included the durable goods release), McCormick stock has delivered up to 5.5% in performance.\nThis sort of rally is unusual for a company considered low beta, and for a stock like this one to have such a move, it must mean there are other discrepancies beneath the surface that might turn this small move into a likely continuous one down the line.\nSmart Money Gets in Ahead\nHere, investors can recognize the importance of paying attention to economic data and how it can lead to some of the best investment ideas in the stock market. As of mid-May 2025, institutional allocators from T. Rowe Price decided to boost their holdings in McCormick stock by up to 28.6% in a new vote of confidence.\nThis new allocation brought their entire position to a high of $340.4 million today, providing the rest of the market with a new pillar of strength to lean on when seeking new upside potential plays in the market. Of course, this buying and continued upside must have a catalyst to stand behind it.\nAs of late June 2025, the company’s management issued a press release to reiterate the financial outlook for the rest of the year, along with a satisfactory performance for the second quarter of 2025. This is massive news in a world where uncertain trade terms and negotiations have made forecasting earnings and financials even more challenging for companies.\nWith this in mind, the 2025 outlooks are still pricing in some of the cost pressure and uncertainty in a world where trade negotiations are still ongoing. This leaves McCormick stock open for a potential beat on top of these outlooks as long as investors can reasonably expect trade agreements to be in place before the year is over.\nHaving this scenario play out in favor of better-than-expected 2025 results should clearly affect the way Wall Street analysts see the stock today, which holds a consensus price target of $84.1 per share to call for up to 10% upside from where it trades today.\nIf financial performance improves above these forecasts, then valuations should give investors the chance to test even higher prices. If this jump in durable goods orders indicates anything, the chances are high for McCormick to deliver and beat these financial outlooks.\nBefore you consider McCormick & Company, Incorporated, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "RTX Corporation Stock: $93B Defense Backlog Fuels Growth", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/rtx-corporation-stock-93b-defense-backlog-fuels-growth/", "text": "RTX Today\n$146.46 +0.29 (+0.19%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $100.22\n▼\n$149.26 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.86%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 42.95\n- Price Target\n- $161.12\nThe global market is currently defined by two powerful and distinct currents: rising geopolitical instability and a resilient demand for commercial air travel.\nFew companies are built to navigate both of these worlds, but RTX Corporation NYSE: RTX is uniquely structured to do so.\nThe aerospace and defense giant operates under a dual mandate, serving governments that are building their national security while also supporting commercial airlines that are expanding their fleets.\nThe $93 Billion Backlog of Stability\nThe foundation of RTX's investment appeal rests within its Raytheon segment. In a period of increasing global defense spending, this business provides a predictable and growing stream of revenue that is less dependent on general economic cycles. The most telling metric of this stability is the segment’s substantial defense backlog, which stood at a record $93 billion at the end of 2024.\nThis backlog represents tangible future sales from high-demand products, creating a multi-year tailwind for the stock. Key programs driving this growth include:\n- Air and Missile Defense: The combat-proven Patriot system remains a top priority for nations seeking to modernize their air and missile defenses. This is shown by a recent $2.4 billion contract to provide systems to Germany, showcasing continued strong demand from key NATO allies.\n- Advanced Munitions: Demand for precision weapons is high. Raytheon is a leader in this area with its AMRAAM air-to-air missiles and the Evolved SeaSparrow Missile (ESSM) program, which recently secured a $299.7 million contract modification.\n- Next-Generation Systems: Looking to the future, the company is ramping up production of its Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS), the Army's designated replacement for the Patriot radar. A recent $1.9 billion award for the U.S. and Poland highlights the critical transition to more advanced systems designed to counter emerging threats.\nFor investors, this backlog is a significant de-risking factor. It provides exceptional visibility into future earnings and cash flow, insulating the company from short-term market volatility and allowing management to execute its long-term capital plans with confidence.\nA Growth Engine With a Clear Flight Path\nWhile Raytheon provides the stable foundation, RTX’s commercial aerospace businesses (Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace) offer a powerful growth dynamic. The global recovery in air travel has fueled a surge in the highly profitable business of aircraft maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO). This was evident in the first quarter of 2025, which saw a 21% year-over-year increase in commercial aftermarket sales.\nA key focus for investors has been the Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine issue, which required accelerated inspections. RTX now has a well-defined plan to manage the situation, and the market largely understands the financial impact.\nThe company is making clear progress, increasing its MRO output by approximately 30% in 2024.\nThis extensive inspection program solidifies a predictable, high-margin services business that will last years.\nConfidence in the GTF platform's long-term value remains strong. The engine’s superior fuel efficiency continues attracting customers, demonstrated by over 950 new orders and commitments secured in 2024.\nWith a commercial backlog of $125 billion, this side of the business is positioned to recover and drive significant future growth.\nThe Price of Quality\nFollowing its strong performance, RTX's valuation reflects its positive outlook. With a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of approximately 24, the stock is trading at a premium compared to its recent past. For many investors, this reflects the price of quality and stability in the current market.\nOperationally, the primary internal factor to monitor is the continued execution of the multi-year GTF fleet management plan. While the company has expressed high confidence, the scale of the undertaking requires sustained focus.\nExternally, as a global leader, RTX is exposed to macroeconomic risks such as potential international tariffs, a standard consideration for any multinational industrial company.\nA Unique Blend of Stability and Shareholder Value\nRTX Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 1.86%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $2.72\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 5 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 79.77%\n- Next Dividend Payment\n- Sep. 4\nRTX Dividend History\nRTX's investment appeal is built on a foundation of strategic balance. The Raytheon segment offers stability driven by the enduring demand for national security, while the commercial aerospace segments provide growth from the long-term trend of global travel. This structure enables the company to operate effectively across a wide range of economic scenarios.\nThis operational strength translates directly into financial fortitude and the ability to deliver tangible value back to its owners. The company's recent 7.9% dividend increase directly signals management's confidence in future cash flow. That action is reinforced by an 88-year history of paying dividends, cementing its status as a reliable blue-chip investment.\nFor those seeking a foundational holding in the critical aerospace and defense sector, RTX’s balanced business model and proven commitment to shareholders present a compelling case for long-term value creation.\nBefore you consider RTX, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

NASDAQ: SIMO is one such rare case.\nSilicon Motion Technology Today\nSIMOSilicon Motion Technology\n$74.83 +0.12 (+0.16%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $37.21\n▼\n$82.64 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.66%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 26.82\n- Price Target\n- $83.89\nThe tech firm, which designs and builds flash memory controllers for use in computers, data centers, smartphones, and more, is just barely in the mid-cap category based on a market value of $2.6 billion. It also lacks the name recognition of many larger rivals in the sector. However, Silicon Motion has a key combination of traits that could take its shares to the stratosphere and make SIMO a breakout star.\nDespite rising nearly 39% year-to-date (YTD), SIMO shares are still down more than 5% in the past year. But with its promising tech announcements, excellent earnings history, and widespread analyst acclaim, the case for a continued climb to new 52-week highs is growing stronger.\nAutomotive Tech Breakthrough Could Be a Game-Changer\nSilicon Motion is a valuable leader in NAND flash controllers for solid-state storage devices (SSDs). These controllers mediate between flash memory devices and the host system, making them an essential part of the successful management and transfer of data, the correction of errors, and other processes vital to effective storage.\nIn late June, Silicon Motion announced that its Universal Flash Storage (UFS) solution had completed compatibility validation on the Qualcomm Snapdragon Cockpit SA8295P Platform, a smart cockpit automotive platform. Silicon Motion's UFS is expected to help ensure speedy data access and system integration.\nThis latest update is potentially massive for Silicon Motion, and not only because it marks a successful partnership with semiconductor and wireless tech giant Qualcomm Inc. NASDAQ: QCOM. Silicon Motion believes there is potential for the UFS system to benefit future automotive AI, advanced driver assistance, and infotainment systems, among many others. With more and more of the automotive industry moving toward these types of platforms, Silicon's UFS success further solidifies it as the partner of choice industry-wide.\nProfitability, Growth Forecast, and Buybacks Support the Bullish Sentiment\nBesides advantageous tech updates, Silicon Motion offers many attractive fundamentals.\nFirst, the company's recent earnings report is compelling. In the first quarter of the year, Silicon Motion beat analyst predictions on earnings per share (EPS) by 16 cents, coming in at 60 cents. Though revenue declined year-over-year (YOY), as anticipated, it did so by a smaller margin than analysts predicted, coming in at $166.5 million compared to predictions of $162.7 million.\nThe fact that the company is profitable at all distinguishes it from some of its rivals, but its rapid bottom-line growth, in particular, is noteworthy. Earnings are expected to surge by an impressive 42% next year. Although there are industry-wide headwinds including tariff uncertainty, Silicon Motion's net margin of 12.1% is solid and its value metrics are strong. The company's price-to-sales ratio of 3.20 is fairly low for the tech sector, and its short interest has narrowed by more than 14% in the last month.\nInvestors will likely be further impressed by Silicon Motion's recent $50-million share buyback program, a sign of the company's confidence in its ability to ride out macro headwinds and continue to deliver value for shareholders.\nWall Street Analysts Are All In\nSilicon Motion Technology Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$83.8912.11% UpsideBuyBased on 10 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $74.83 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $95.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $83.89 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $65.00 |\n|---|\nSilicon Motion Technology Stock Forecast Details\nGiven these factors, it's no surprise that all 10 analysts rating SIMO shares have assigned them a Buy, and a consensus price target suggests about 11% in upside potential.\nThe company has ample room to expand into the high-demand areas of automotive smart platforms, as described above, and data centers, thanks to its popular MonTitan PCIe Gen5 platform.\nOf course, the external risks plaguing the tech space more broadly—tariffs, supply chain issues, cybersecurity threats, and others—are also a factor for Silicon Motion. If the company's recent rally and its underlying fundamentals are any indication, however, it may be able to adeptly navigate these threats as it continues to carve out a higher share price.\nBefore you consider Silicon Motion Technology, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Silicon Motion Technology wasn't on the list.\nWhile Silicon Motion Technology currently has a Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nEnter your email address and we'll send you MarketBeat's list of seven stocks and why their long-term outlooks are very promising.\nGet This Free Report\nLike this article?

{"title": "3 Safe Buy-and-Hold Dividend Stocks With Strong Balance Sheets", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-safe-buy-and-hold-dividend-stocks-with-strong-balance-sheets/", "text": "Dividend yield is a commonly used metric for finding dividend stocks to buy and hold. The dividend yield is the amount of a company’s dividend as a percentage of its stock price. Since a company’s stock price can fluctuate every day, so will the dividend yield. However, because many of these are mature companies, investors don’t expect wide swings in a company’s dividend yield.\nAnother shared trait of dividend stocks that are built for the long haul is a strong balance sheet. Investors can measure that by looking at the company’s debt-to-equity ratio, which measures a company’s level of debt in relation to the overall value of its stock.\nA company with a debt-to-equity ratio of one means that it has $1 in debt for every $1 in shareholder equity. Since dividends are part of that equity, investors want to know that their dividend isn’t at risk, as it could be if a company’s level of debt is too high.\nAn example of this was 3M NYSE: MMM. The company was a dividend king that had delivered 65 consecutive years of dividend increases. However, the company ran into financial problems due to legal liabilities (from two separate lawsuits involving forever chemicals and military-grade earplugs). Its debt-to-equity ratio climbed to over 50% resulting in a 35% dividend cut.\nA reliable yield and low debt-to-equity ratios make these three stocks safe bets for buy-and-hold investors.\nCostco: A Total Return Dynamo\nCostco Wholesale Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 0.54%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $5.20\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 22 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 29.50%\n- Recent Dividend Payment\n- May. 16\nCOST Dividend History\nCostco Wholesale Corp. NASDAQ: COST is up 15% in the last 12 months. This comes at a time when many investors are questioning the stock’s valuation. At 55x earnings, it’s trading at a premium to its historical levels. Plus, one share of COST stock is around $1,000.\nBut there’s no way around it. COST stock is a must-own stock because it generates a consistent total return. That is the combination of stock price growth plus dividends. In the five years ending in June, Costco has delivered a total return of over 266%.\nPerhaps the most impressive part is that Costco is doing this with a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.21%. That means investors should have no concerns about the company’s ability to raise its dividend as it has for the last 22 consecutive years.\nInvestors should look beyond the 0.5% yield as a reflection of the company’s stock price. Instead, they can focus on the 12.7% average dividend growth over the last three years as a better reflection on the growth and value in COST stock.\nArcher-Daniels-Midland: Cyclical Growth Backed by Compounding Gains\nArcher Daniels Midland Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 3.71%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $2.04\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 53 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 72.86%\n- Recent Dividend Payment\n- Jun. 11\nADM Dividend History\nArcher-Daniels-Midland Co. NYSE: ADM is part of an elite group of stocks known as dividend kings. These are companies that have increased their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years. In the case of Archer-Daniels-Midland, that streak is 53 years. With a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.34%, that streak is in no danger.\nBut if total return is of primary importance, there are better options. The growth of a company like Archer-Daniels-Midland is tied closely to commodity prices, which are notoriously cyclical.\nThat’s been evident in the ADM stock chart over the last five years. Its reliance on commodity prices makes it different from many consumer staples stocks that are more defensive in nature.\nWith a P/E ratio of over 12x, the stock is inexpensive to the broader market, but expensive compared to its historical average. That's also evident in its price-to-earnings plus growth (PEG) ratio, which is at 2.94.\nMedtronic: Long-Term Growth Is Inevitable\nMedtronic Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 3.18%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $2.84\n- Dividend Increase Track Record\n- 49 Years\n- Dividend Payout Ratio\n- 78.45%\n- Next Dividend Payment\n- Jul. 11\nMDT Dividend History\nMedtronic PLC NYSE: MDT is part of the growing robotic surgery and medical technology industry. The company is perfectly positioned for the aging of America, which will create steady demand for the company’s products and services. It's also well-positioned in the area of AI and machine learning.\nThat's all well and good, but Medtronic shareholders are wondering when the company will put it all together. That's impossible to say, but shareholders have been collecting a dividend that’s been growing for 49 years and has an impressive 3.30% yield.\nThey also get a stock that’s trading at a discount to itself with its P/E ratio around 23x.\nThe company’s debt-to-equity ratio of around 0.53% is impressive, considering the amount of investment it needs to make to continue delivering innovative products.\nBefore you consider Medtronic, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Medtronic wasn't on the list.\nWhile Medtronic currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nMarketBeat's analysts have just released their top five short plays for July 2025.

{"title": "Tesla’s Robotaxi Hype Fuels Bullish Price Targets to $500", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/teslas-robotaxi-hype-fuels-bullish-price-targets-to-500/", "text": "Tesla Today\n$309.87 +13.99 (+4.73%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $182.00\n▼\n$488.54 - P/E Ratio\n- 170.26\n- Price Target\n- $301.13\nConsidering how much pain investors of Tesla Inc NASDAQ: TSLA had to endure during the first quarter of the year, there are perhaps not many on Wall Street who thought they'd manage to gain the better part of 50% in less than three months.\nHowever, that's exactly what they've done, largely thanks to CEO Elon Musk's stepping back from White House duties, increased hype around their Robotaxi launch, and a sense that the worst-case scenario has already been priced into the stock.\nAs they continue to consolidate with mostly sideways action since the first week of June, it's a good time to take stock of what the summer might look like for the shares of the automotive giant.\nWhile the stock has undoubtedly received its fair share of negative headlines in recent weeks, there are still many reasons to like Tesla for the long term.\nGetting Involved in Tesla\nFor investors on the sidelines weighing up an entry or an exit, two very interesting and unusual things took place last week that should be closely watched: Tesla received both a pair of Sell ratings and a pair of Buy ratings. For a stock that the bulls and the bears have closely fought over, this hardly clarifies things for investors trying to make a call.\nBut upon close examination, there's actually a pretty solid opportunity opening up here, and these calls might even make it easier. Let's jump in and take a closer look.\nBears Reiterate Their Case\nStarting with the bearish updates, which came first at the start of last week, we saw the teams from both Guggenheim and UBS Group reiterate their Sell ratings on the stock. Unconvinced by Tesla's nearly 50% gain in just a few weeks, the analysts there were happy to overlook the potential upside from the company's much-awaited Robotaxi launch, which took place on Monday.\nWith its price-to-earnings ratio around the 175 mark, Guggenheim's Ronald Jewsikow also sounded the alarm on Tesla's valuation, which has repeatedly been flagged as a reason to be cautious.\nPotential 50% Downside\nTesla Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$301.13-2.82% DownsideHoldBased on 41 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $309.87 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $500.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $301.13 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $19.05 |\n|---|\nTesla Stock Forecast Details\nEven though Tesla's shares have always shown signs of not caring about the underlying PE, Jewsikow's price target of $175 must have raised a few eyebrows. Considering that Tesla closed out last week trading just above $320, it implies that a loss of close to 50% is around the corner.\nThis would result in shares trading back at 52-week lows, which is an extreme forecast for someone who didn't provide much justification beyond stating that the company's fundamentals are \"deteriorating at an alarming rate.\"\nIt's true that Tesla's post-April recovery seems to have run out of steam, and it might well be worrying that shares have failed to kick on since their peak in late May, but the stock has still been setting higher highs throughout June, all in the face of their most recent earnings report which was indeed one of their worst updates to their fundamentals in quite some time.\nBut the fact that the stock has remained consistently higher since then suggests the market doesn't care quite as much about that as the bears might want it to.\nBulls See Big Upside\nOn the other hand, by the end of last week, Tesla had received two fresh bullish updates: one from Canaccord Genuity Group and one from Benchmark. The latter boosted its price target to $475, just marginally below Tesla's street-high price target of $500, which came from Wedbush earlier this month.\nThe teams were unanimous in their optimism around the company's Robotaxi launch, which they see as a key milestone in Tesla's journey to offer the most cost-effective driverless cars.\nEchoing much of what his peers have shared in recent months, Benchmark's Mickey Legg wrote that \"in our view, the company is undergoing an evolution from a trailblazing vehicle OEM to a high-tech automation and robotics company with unmatched domestic manufacturing scale.\"\nAs Tesla stock has shown time and again, it has a stronger tendency to be bought for these kinds of reasons than to be sold due to valuation concerns, as flagged by Guggenheim. The fact that the stock is up close to 50% since missing analyst expectations in its May earnings report by a wide margin tells you a lot about how Tesla investors view the longer-term opportunity.\nAs July approaches, it's expected that Tesla will keep generating mixed opinions, as it has historically. However, the ticker tells the story, and so far, at least, it's telling us that the stock wants to, and will, go higher.\nBefore you consider Tesla, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Tesla wasn't on the list.\nWhile Tesla currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nThinking about investing in Meta, Roblox, or Unity?

{"title": "Value vs Growth Ratio Hits Cycle Low—Top Value Picks to Buy", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/value-vs-growth-ratio-hits-cycle-lowtop-value-picks-to-buy/", "text": "The benchmark process is at the core of measuring financial market performance, and seeing a single stock or asset class perform on its own offers very little information to investors unless it is benchmarked against another useful and related name or space, where the entire methodology comes into play.\nToday, one specific ratio could send value stocks flying next.\nIn a world where the most exciting stocks on the market have seen their valuations rise to stratospheric levels, other high-quality businesses have been left behind and forgotten during this rally.\nTimes like these offer investors some of the best opportunities to close the performance gap as long as they land on the right side of the equation. Today, that side suggests that value stocks will outperform.\nBy tracking the performance ratio between the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF NYSEARCA: IVE and the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF NYSEARCA: IVW, investors can see how the past couple of quarters have created a gap that can be exploited. Within this space, it is stocks like PepsiCo Inc. NASDAQ: PEP, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. NYSE: BRK.B, and even Coca-Cola Co. NYSE: KO that act as some of the best picks moving forward.\nAn Inevitable Rotation Swings in Favor of Pepsi Stock\nPepsiCo Today\n$136.08 +1.60 (+1.19%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $127.60\n▼\n$180.91 - Dividend Yield\n- 4.18%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 20.01\n- Price Target\n- $158.50\nGiven that this ratio is now at a cyclical low, it is the law of the market that a catalyst down the line might shift things back into balance. Whether it's trade negotiations, geopolitical conflicts, or economic data within the United States, there is a high likelihood that an event will occur to shift the sentiment and capital rotation back to discounted value.\nThis is where Pepsi stock comes into play, as it not only trades at a low 72% of its 52-week high but also on a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of only 16.4x today, the lowest valuation multiple seen for the company since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLogic will argue that this business is doing much better than it was even before the pandemic, and today’s economic conditions are nowhere near what they were back then; lockdowns and uncertainty could surely justify such a discounted multiple for Pepsi, though the reasoning is lacking for it to go back to such a cheap multiple in today’s market.\nThis creates a massive opportunity for investors to start accumulating positions in Pepsi stock for the coming months and quarters, but it will be the value-to-growth ratio that ultimately tells them when this rotation begins. It looks like some of the “smart money” corner has already begun rotating ahead of this broader sentiment shift, according to institutional flows.\nThose from UBS Asset Management have now built a stake worth up to $1.7 billion in Pepsi stock, which acts as a reiteration of this upcoming shift happening sooner rather than later, something investors must consider in their views.\nMomentum and Upside Already in Berkshire Hathaway\nBerkshire Hathaway Today\n$477.90 -1.01 (-0.21%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $406.11\n▼\n$542.07 - P/E Ratio\n- 12.74\n- Price Target\n- $520.00\nWhenever anyone thinks of a value play, Berkshire Hathaway is always at the top of the list, which might explain why this holding company now trades at 90% of its 52-week high compared to many others in the value space. If sentiment is expected to change and rotate into value stocks, it’s logical to see this name lead the way first.\nMore than just momentum relative to its highs, investors can see that as far back as March 2025, analyst Kevin Heal from Argus placed a valuation target of up to $575 for Berkshire Hathaway stock. The fact that this view hasn’t changed since then says a lot about how Wall Street feels about this stock and its future, but that’s not all.\nCompared to today’s prices, this valuation calls for not only a new 52-week high to be broken through but also up to 18% additional upside potential. Chances are that, when the rotation happens, there will be a lot more updates coming from other analysts expressing where they see the true value of Berkshire Hathaway heading.\nPremium Investors Go for Coca-Cola\nCocaCola Today\nKOCocaCola\n$69.80 +0.32 (+0.47%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $60.62\n▼\n$74.38 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.92%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 27.92\n- Price Target\n- $76.71\nThere are some in the market who would argue Pepsi stock is very cheap today for reasons that are yet to be known, and that’s a risk most aren’t willing to take. If that is the case, then the opposite view can be taken regarding premiums, and this is where Coca-Cola comes into play, with a steep 28.2x P/E valuation compared to the consumer staples sector's average of 19.6x.\nHowever, some of the reasons why Coca-Cola is trading at 90% of its 52-week high should be the same ones that could lead Pepsi higher, so having both in a watchlist could yield great results with less volatility. A weakening dollar, a pending rotation into value, and momentum will all serve as bullish factors for these international consumer names.\nIn fact, it appears that investors from UBS Asset Management did their homework on both Pepsi and Coca-Cola, as they also built up a position of $2.2 billion in Coca-Cola as of the same dates when they established a position in Pepsi, indicating that this rotation is more than just a thesis.\nBefore you consider iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

The industry is crowded with names, many of which are tiny firms working toward developing a small number of drug candidates and lacking a means of achieving profitability until one or more of those products make it to market.\nAs such, there can be a revolving door of healthcare names for investors to watch, and the most talked-about companies are often ones with pending trial data or other major developments on the horizon.\nThree such firms Nektar Therapeutics NASDAQ: NKTR, Cidara Therapeutics Inc. NASDAQ: CDTX, and GeneDx Holdings Corp. NASDAQ: WGS have recently experienced rallies that are likely to put them on healthcare investors' radar. What's more, these companies all have strong votes of confidence from bullish Wall Street analysts as well.\nRezpeg Phase 2b Trial Successes Send Nektar Shares Upward\nNektar Therapeutics Today\nNKTRNektar Therapeutics\n$25.10 +1.74 (+7.45%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $6.48\n▼\n$37.38 - Price Target\n- $88.33\nNektar develops immunotherapy drug candidates such as rezpegaldesleukin (Rezpeg), a candidate for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and ulcerative colitis, among other conditions. Indeed, one of those other conditions, atopic dermatitis (eczema), has been most notable for Nektar in recent days.\nWith success on both primary and secondary goals in its recent Phase 2b trial and a Fast Track designation from the FDA, Rezpeg appears poised to help to address eczema for the roughly 10 million patients across the United States facing this condition. Shares rallied after Nektar's announcement of the latest trial results.\nNektar's latest impressive rally began on June 23, 2025, and sent shares more than tripling in value in the span of five trading days. However, it's important to note that the rally already showed signs of faltering in the same week in which it began. Besides that, Nektar's share price at the peak of the rally was just under $30 per share.\nThis is still dramatically lower than its all-time high of more than $1,500 per share from early 2018, and lower than the price of the stock for essentially all of its trading history up until the last two years. Nonetheless, six out of seven analysts view NKTR as a Buy, with upside potential of about 227% based on a consensus price target of $84.17.\nMajor Advance in Non-Vaccine Flu Preventative for Cidara\nCidara Therapeutics Today\nCDTXCidara Therapeutics\n$50.88 -0.08 (-0.16%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $10.14\n▼\n$56.83 - Price Target\n- $57.14\nCidara is known for innovative therapies such as rezafungin acetate, a treatment for invasive fungal infections, and drug-Fc conjugates, or drugs that use human antibody fragments. CDTX shares reached their highest level since spring 2021 in late June, when they climbed by almost 150% in about a week. The spike aligned with the company's positive phase 2b trial results for CD388, a non-vaccine for the prevention of seasonal influenza.\nInvestors have long seen CD388 as a key component of Cidara's pipeline, and this latest data, including a noteworthy 76% symptomatic influenza protection rate for 24 weeks for a single 450-milligram dose, indicates that a phase 3 trial is likely not far off. Should CD388 reach the market, it is likely a game-changer for the biopharma space.\nCD388 could either aid traditional vaccines or supplant them as a once-per-season preventative for seasonal flu, with a massive potential market.\nWhile analysts are widely bullish on CDTX (all nine rating the stock have assigned it a Buy), investors should note that the company also issued $250 million in new stock the same week as the CD388 announcement in a potentially dilutive move.\nPromising Partnership and AAP Guidance, But Other Concerns Remain for GeneDx\nGeneDx Today\n$86.91 -4.97 (-5.41%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $25.32\n▼\n$117.75 - Price Target\n- $92.33\nGeneDx is known for its Centrellis platform, utilizing AI to conduct genomics-related diagnostics. Investors have had sky-high hopes for the company that have not necessarily come to pass. In fact, despite topping analyst predictions for first-quarter sales by about 10% and raising guidance to suggest at least 30% year-over-year (YOY) revenue gains for FY 2025, WGS shares plummeted by almost 50% around the start of May 2025.\nIn the last several days of June, the stock surged by nearly 40% to recapture some of that decline.\nThe latest rally coincided with GeneDx's announcement of a partnership with Galatea Bio to provide genetic testing for common diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and, eventually, hereditary cancers.\nIt also aligned with updated guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommending exome and genome sequencing as first-tier tests for children with intellectual disability and global developmental delay.\nBoth of these factors are likely to drive business for GeneDx.\nSix out of eight analysts rate WGS a Buy, but investors should beware of its comparably high valuation, a recent and potentially concerning sequential volume decline, and the threat of competitors in the difficult genomic diagnostics space.\nBefore you consider Nektar Therapeutics, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

All data used is as of the June 27 close unless otherwise indicated.\nDJT Announces $400 Million Buyback After Huge Slide and Bitcoin Deal\nTrump Media & Technology Group Today\nDJTTrump Media & Technology Group\n$18.93 -0.10 (-0.53%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $11.75\n▼\n$54.68\nFirst up is the baby of the Commander in Chief, Trump Media and Technology Group NASDAQ: DJT. On June 23, the company announced a share buyback program worth $400 million. This is substantial, accounting for around 8.3% of its $4.8 billion market capitalization. The timing of this announcement isn’t overly surprising, given the recent performance of the stock. Shares of TMTG have gotten crushed in 2025, down approximately 49% this year. There is a chance that the company sees its shares as undervalued, which gives it a reason to repurchase stock.\nThis comes as the firm raised $2.5 billion, which it will use to fund the creation of a large Bitcoin (BTC) treasury. This will put the company’s liquid assets above $3 billion, as it had $759 million in cash and equivalents previously. However, this figure could change substantially in the future, based on the price of Bitcoin. Despite this influx of cash, TMTG remains a deeply money-losing operation. The company has generated under $4 million in revenues over the last 12 months, but had operating expenses north of $127 million.\nJCI: $5 Billion in Buyback Spending Ahead?\nJohnson Controls International Today\nJCIJohnson Controls International\n$106.33 -0.17 (-0.16%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $64.31\n▼\n$107.20 - Dividend Yield\n- 1.39%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 28.35\n- Price Target\n- $100.53\nNext up is Johnson Controls International NYSE: JCI. The industrial company provides a variety of building products to customers around the world. This mainly includes heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, as well as fire protection and security solutions. On June 13, the company announced an increase to its share buyback authorization of $9 billion. This adds to the company’s remaining authorization, giving it $10.1 billion in share repurchase capacity. This number equates to a very large 14.6% of its approximately $69 billion market capitalization.\nThis announcement comes even as the stock ended June 27 at its all-time high closing price. This suggests that the company continues to be confident in its prospects going forward and doesn’t view its shares as overvalued. JCI recently spoke at the Bank of America’s 2025 Industrials, Transportation & Airlines Conference. They said they plan to return $5 billion worth of capital in the “fourth quarter”. This most likely refers to the firm’s fiscal Q4 2025, which ends on Sept. 30. This suggests the firm is looking to buy back $5 billion worth of shares by that date. Based on JCI’s current price, this could reduce its share count by around 7% over that period, providing a huge earnings per share tailwind.\nDRI: Buybacks and Dividends Get a Boost as the Stock Outperforms in 2025\nDarden Restaurants Today\nDRIDarden Restaurants\n$212.87 -2.96 (-1.37%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $135.87\n▼\n$228.27 - Dividend Yield\n- 2.63%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 23.97\n- Price Target\n- $224.60\nLast up is Darden Restaurants NYSE: DRI. The company operates large chains like Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse. In an industry that has performed rather well as a whole in 2025, Darden has more than held its own. Shares have provided a total return of approximately 17%, substantially beating out the less than 6% return of the S&P 500. Along with releasing its latest earnings on June 20, the company announced a $1 billion share buyback program. The new buyback program is moderate in size, equating to just under 4% of the stock’s over $25 billion market capitalization.\nOver the last 12 months, the company spent $418 million on buybacks. This is somewhat below its five-year average of approximately $488 million in buyback spending over the past 12 months. Overall, these numbers suggest the firm could exhaust its buyback capacity in around two years. Darden also announced a sizable increase to its quarterly dividend of 7.1%. Its next $1.50 dividend will be payable on Aug. 1 to shareholders of record on July 10. This gives the stock a solid indicated dividend yield of around 2.8%. This is one of the highest figures among U.S. restaurant stocks.\nReduced Share Counts Could Boost Long-Term Shareholder Value\nThese substantial buyback announcements from DJT, Johnson Controls, and Darden Restaurants highlight a broader corporate trend of returning capital to shareholders, whether to offset stock declines, reinforce confidence, or enhance earnings metrics.\nWhile the motivations differ, the end result is the same: reduced share counts and potentially stronger shareholder returns. Investors should watch not just the size of these buybacks, but how quickly and effectively each company executes them in the coming quarters.\nBefore you consider Trump Media & Technology Group, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

Strong reports have fueled major indices to new all-time highs, but not every industry leader is gaining ground.\nLululemon Athletica Inc. NASDAQ: LULU made the type of headlines investors don't want to see earlier this month, raising the alarm on EPS estimates and slashing guidance projections for the second half of 2025. Is this a sign of things to come in an industry heavily battered by tariffs, or is Lululemon starting to feel the heat from competitors?\nConsidering the success of some of its smaller rivals, the latter option might be the case.\nLululemon’s Weakness Opens a Lane For Competitors\nlululemon athletica Today\nLULUlululemon athletica\n$238.52 +2.63 (+1.11%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $219.97\n▼\n$423.32 - P/E Ratio\n- 16.16\n- Price Target\n- $338.73\nHigh-end athletic apparel maker Lululemon matched EPS projections and beat revenue estimates by a hair for fiscal Q1 2025. Still, comparable sales growth was only 1% and the conference call and forward guidance painted a bleak picture. LULU cut next quarter EPS guidance from $3.31 per share to a range of $2.85 to $2.90, and lowered revenue expectations from $2.6 billion to $2.5 billion.\nOverseas sourcing from China and Vietnam weighed heavily on the numbers, and executives project that tariffs could reduce the company’s gross margins by over 100 basis points.\nFollowing the release, investment analysts lowered their price targets so fast it would make contestants on The Price Is Right blush. Of the 31 stock analysts with LULU coverage we’re tracking at MarketBeat, 15 lowered their price targets in the wake of the report. The heaviest cuts came from JPMorgan Chase (from $389 to $303), KeyCorp (from $400 to $350), and Morgan Stanley (from $346 to $280).\nJim Cramer expressed exasperation over the stock during a recent Lightning Round segment, commenting that despite a 25% decline over the last month, the bottom may not have been reached for LULU shares.\n3 Stocks Gaining on Lululemon\nIt’s not all doom and gloom in the apparel industry. Some companies are actually raising guidance and expertly navigating the tariff environment. Here are three stocks in the apparel and footwear sector with a better outlook than Lululemon.\nAmer Sports: High-End Brands Leading Explosive Growth\nAmer Sports Today\nASAmer Sports\n$38.16 -0.34 (-0.88%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io.

NYSE: AS is a Finnish sports equipment and apparel company behind popular brands such as Arc’teryx, Louisville Slugger, Salomon, and Peak Performance. The premium Arc’teryx brand has been a significant success, driving Amer Sports’ technical apparel segment to 28% year-over-year (YOY) growth. The Salomon footwear-led Outdoor Performance segment also saw 25% YOY growth.\nAS stock trades at 82 times forward earnings, which is a pricey valuation for a company with thin margins and geopolitical headwinds from tariffs. But the company keeps blowing away analyst estimates, sending price targets higher and higher with each earnings release.\nAmer Sports’ Q1 2025 report saw EPS of $0.27, tripling the number it posted in the same quarter last year. The $1.47 billion revenue figure also beat expectations and represented YOY growth of more than 24%.\nThe company raised its EPS guidance from a range of $0.64 to $0.69 per share to $0.67 to $0.72 per share, as it expects minimal tariff impact for the remainder of the year. And the upgrades keep on coming: KGI Securities gave the stock an Outperform rating and $44.30 price target on June 25.\nUrban Outfitters: Superior Tariff Strategy\nUrban Outfitters Today\nURBNUrban Outfitters\n$72.47 +0.54 (+0.75%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $33.86\n▼\n$75.80 - P/E Ratio\n- 15.16\n- Price Target\n- $74.09\nLike most companies in the footwear and apparel industry, Urban Outfitters Inc. NASDAQ: URBN and its subsidiaries, Anthropologie and Free People, are holding their breath regarding President Trump’s aggressive tariff regime. However, unlike Lululemon, Urban Outfitters is better positioned to manage its margins and maintain its earnings growth track.\nLululemon anticipates a margin hit of at least 110 basis points under a 30% tariff on China and a 10% universal tariff policy. However, during their fiscal year Q1 2026 report on May 21, Urban Outfitters executives announced that they anticipate only a 20-basis-point drop in gross margins due to tariffs, which will be more than offset by gains of 50-100 basis points in other areas.\nQ1 sales reached a record $1.3 billion, and the stock received two additional upgrades this month from Jefferies Financial Group (from Underperform to Hold) and Robert Baird (from Hold to Outperform).\nOn Holdings: Innovations Justifying a High Valuation\nUrban Outfitters Today\nURBNUrban Outfitters\n$72.47 +0.54 (+0.75%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $33.86\n▼\n$75.80 - P/E Ratio\n- 15.16\n- Price Target\n- $74.09\nOn Holdings AG NYSE: ONON trades at 77 times forward earnings, but its innovative products and consistent growth give it a leg up over Lululemon. The company’s CloudTec cushioning is a proprietary product designed to make running more effortless, with the tagline claiming that runners will feel like they’re running on a cloud. Innovation isn’t limited to consumer products either.\nDuring the 2024 Olympics, the company unveiled the LightSpray system, which can manufacture a complete shoe in less than three minutes.\nOn Holdings is also an earnings season winner, beating revenue projections by 18% in the most recent quarter and raising full-year guidance.

{"title": "Believe the Hype? Can SoFi Maintain Its 3-Month Rally?", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/believe-the-hype-can-sofi-maintain-its-3-month-rally/", "text": "SoFi Technologies Today\nSOFISoFi Technologies\n$20.97 +0.75 (+3.71%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $6.01\n▼\n$21.32 - P/E Ratio\n- 51.15\n- Price Target\n- $15.47\nOriginally a student loan refinancing outfit, SoFi Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: SOFI has expanded its offerings to include mortgage and personal lending, credit card products, and more. Shares of the popular fintech name have far outperformed the broader sector in recent months, returning about 35% year-to-date (YTD) and roughly doubling in the last three months.\nInvestors may be understandably skeptical of a company that has performed so strongly, and particularly when it comes to whether or not SOFI shares can continue their upward trajectory. This may be especially the case here because about half of the analyst ratings for SOFI stock are either Hold or Sell, and because the firm's consensus price target is roughly 23% below where shares currently trade.\nMultiple factors have likely driven the recent rally, including strong first-quarter earnings and forecasts, a record of profitability, the company's announcement of its re-entry into the crypto space, and more. There are plenty of reasons to be bullish on SoFi, although the company's sky-high valuation and broader economic uncertainty are potential barriers.\nSoFi Notches a Banner 1H, Driving Shares Upward\nA 33% year-over-year (YOY) improvement in revenue and tripling earnings per share (EPS) in SoFi's first-quarter earnings helped to set off its recent bullish run. The company's optimistic forecasts for quarterly and adjusted full-year revenue growth were also likely drivers back in April. What's more, analysts see the company's earnings more than doubling in the next year. Unlike many companies that have also gone public via special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), SoFi has shown its potential to be profitable since first posting GAAP net income in 2023.\nSoFi continues to build its member base and has successfully expanded well beyond its initial target market of students and young professionals, although this demographic remains core to its operations as a digital bank. The firm ended the first quarter with nearly 11 million members, more than a third above the level one year prior.\nSoFi also distinguished itself in the first half of the year with its new products and offerings. Most notably, the company recently announced it would re-launch a cryptocurrency service after previously shutting down its digital token functionality in 2023. The company appears to be going all-in on crypto. It has indicated plans to offer not only major players like Bitcoin and Ethereum but, eventually, stablecoins and other options as well. Crypto trading opens up a new revenue stream for SoFi and further cements its position as a \"one-stop shop\" for digital finance needs.\nFee-Based Revenue, Cross-Selling, and External Regulations\nSoFi Technologies Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$15.47-26.24% DownsideHoldBased on 17 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $20.97 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $20.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $15.47 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $9.50 |\n|---|\nSoFi Technologies Stock Forecast Details\nAs SoFi has expanded its offerings, it has also begun to move away from a primarily loan-based model and toward one that derives revenue from various fees as well. This is a benefit to the firm as it reduces its reliance on a favorable interest rate environment, which is particularly important now as broader uncertainty surrounding rates remains elevated.\nThe company's broadening services have also been critical to its capacity as a cross-seller. With customers increasingly turning to SoFi for many more financial services besides loans, the company has positioned itself as an attractive partner for other firms seeking to integrate their offerings across its platform. This is a win-win for SoFi, as it continues to draw more customers and further bulks up its services while simultaneously driving revenue gains.\nAnother emerging tailwind for SoFi is the One Big Beautiful Bill signed by President Trump in July 2025. The budget reconciliation bill significantly limits federal student loans for many programs, a move that is assuredly going to send new customers toward private lenders like SoFi. This would be a boost to one of the company's original business lines. The bill may also push existing loan holders to refinance with private lenders, another potential win for SoFi and its rivals.\nInvestors may still be hesitant given SoFi's massive P/E ratio of 46.4. Further, customers may opt out of financial services in times of economic uncertainty, and with analysts at J.P. Morgan still suggesting that there is a 40% chance of a near-term recession, there may be significant risk at this point. It may come down to whether a particular investor feels SoFi's many positive attributes are enough to justify its valuation and the external risks.\nBefore you consider SoFi Technologies, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and SoFi Technologies wasn't on the list.\nWhile SoFi Technologies currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nLearn the basics of options trading and how to use them to boost returns and manage risk with this free report from MarketBeat.

{"title": "1999 Again? The Danger of These 3 Companies Making Bitcoin Bets", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/1999-again-the-danger-of-these-3-companies-making-bitcoin-bets/", "text": "By many standards, today’s NASDAQ 100 and S&P 500 look a lot like they did during the 2000 internet bubble, when the narrative that stocks involved with new technologies could only go up, sending a clear message that complacency (along with valuations) was sitting at an all-time high. As many know, the 2000 internet bubble didn’t end well, wiping out many businesses, and those that survived struggled for several years before reclaiming their previous prices.\nThat same complacency seems to be returning, particularly around the rise of cryptocurrency and blockchain.\nWhile blockchain itself may be transformative, the way certain companies are leveraging the hype, i.e., pivoting from failing core businesses to Bitcoin investments, is unsettlingly similar to the dot-com bust. Three companies in particular, stand out: MicroStrategy Inc. NASDAQ: MSTR, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. NYSE: AMC, and GameStop Corp. NYSE: GME. Their recent moves suggest more speculation than strategy.\n1. MicroStrategy: A Bitcoin-Only Business in Disguise\nMicroStrategy Today\n$421.74 +6.33 (+1.52%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $102.40\n▼\n$543.00 - Price Target\n- $514.42\nAny investor should be able to recognize the red flags in MicroStrategy. Originally a software firm, MicroStrategy has transformed into what amounts to a Bitcoin holding company.\nOver the past few years, it’s acquired over 597,000 BTC, currently valued at more than $64 billion. However, this massive stake hasn’t been funded by profits. Instead, MicroStrategy has issued new blocks of stock to finance its purchases.\nThis is like when businesses in 1999 pivoted “online” when their core operations showed no results, but the internet was a way to get markets excited again. If Bitcoin is the “dot com” signature, and blockchain is the internet, then companies that pivot into Bitcoin mining or buying Bitcoin for their balance sheets outright make for the speculative bubble scenario.\nEssentially, MicroStrategy investors are buying into an ultra-leveraged Bitcoin fund with no revenue cushion. When Bitcoin rises, this vehicle can outperform significantly and mitigate the effects of share dilution. But if Bitcoin drops and MicroStrategy continues diluting its shareholders, losses could spiral.\nAnd it’s not just a theory. The company has reportedly paused further Bitcoin purchases amid a class-action lawsuit concerning its disclosures.\n2. AMC: Throwing A Hail Mary With Bitcoin\nAMC Entertainment Today\nAMCAMC Entertainment\n$3.02 +0.07 (+2.20%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - Price Target\n- $4.26\nIt would take a significant amount of capital and imagination to reinvent the movie theater business, which is why AMC has been losing money year after year for some time now. Online streaming and the “at-home” movie experience have squeezed out profits and market share from this once giant brand.\nAMC reported a $202 million loss in Q1 2025. To try to revive its popularity and valuation, AMC has taken a page out of MicroStrategy’s playbook, pivoting into issuing stock in order to buy Bitcoin for its balance sheet. The hope is that investors will keep subscribing to the newly issued stock betting that a cryptocurrency bull run will save the company—and their investment.\nThe truth is, it likely won’t. AMC is in the movie business, not the asset management business, and has been mismanaged, falling behind in today’s marketplace.\nSadly, some in the market will fall for this modern-day Ponzi scheme. Those who act early may be able to make a profit at the expense of large losses for those who enter late in this speculative situation.\n3. GameStop: The King of Meme Stocks\nGameStop Today\n$23.10 -0.10 (-0.41%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $18.73\n▼\n$35.81 - P/E Ratio\n- 50.21\n- Price Target\n- $13.50\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, GameStop became a broad case study of master speculation. Cheap money and low interest rates triggered a massive short squeeze in the stock, sending it to stratospheric valuations. While this event made many millionaires overnight, it also created unrealistic expectations about how the market works.\nGameStop is now leveraging its notoriety in a new way. Following its recent capital raise via convertible notes, GameStop has invested more than $500 million into Bitcoin. By diluting shareholders through stock issuance, GameStop makes its cash flow seem healthy. But, like AMC, its core retail business is bleeding cash.\nAs with MicroStrategy and AMC, this approach may work very well for those early enough in the stock and hoping that Bitcoin’s price rises. However, if Bitcoin declines and risk appetites wane, driving money away from buying newly issued stock at these companies, the losses could be too significant for any shareholder to recover from.\nBefore you consider MicroStrategy, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "3 Tech Stocks Poised for Explosive EPS Growth in 2025", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-tech-stocks-poised-for-explosive-eps-growth-in-2025/", "text": "The retail investment community has become saturated with indicators and sophisticated methods for attempting to predict future stock prices, almost completely forgetting the tried-and-tested methodologies that have worked for decades in fundamental investment strategies.\nBy focusing on what really matters—the financials of a business—investors can cut out most of the noise happening today and steer their portfolios in the right direction for the future.\nOne of the most important metrics in this space is the direction of earnings per share (EPS) growth, and whether the future of the United States and the global economy is in place to support these growth expectations moving forward. EPS growth tells the story of a company’s profitability trend—and where it might go next. When paired with macroeconomic support and market sentiment, it becomes a powerful tool for stock selection.\nThree technology stocks stand out as prime candidates for future appreciation: Micron Technology Inc. NASDAQ: MU, Lyft Inc. NASDAQ: LYFT, and Spotify Technology NYSE: SPOT. Each company shows promising EPS momentum backed by institutional interest or strong business models.\n1. Micron Technology: Wall Street Is Catching Up\nMicron Technology Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$146.4418.95% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 25 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $123.11 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $200.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $146.44 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $67.00 |\n|---|\nMicron Technology Stock Forecast Details\nMicron had been one of the laggards in the semiconductor and chipmaking industry over the past year, falling behind most (if not all) of its peers; however, that story quickly changed in the most recent quarterly performance. Micron stock delivered a monster rally of up to 88.5% during this recent period, an unexpected jump that drew Wall Street’s attention.\nStarting with valuations, investors can see how this price action now begins to justify the call made by Robert W. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra in late June 2025, who reiterated an Outperform rating for Micron stock alongside a valuation target of $200 per share.\nEven with this strong run over the past quarter, this valuation still suggests an additional 64% upside for investors to consider, not to mention the possibility of the stock reaching a new 52-week high. Typically, this sort of momentum triggers systemic buying from institutional players, which could (and likely will) add to the upside pressure present in this stock.\nAll told, all of this upside pressure is justified by the expectations that Micron will report up to $2.04 in EPS for the fourth quarter of 2025, a net jump of 7% from today’s reported $1.91 in EPS. While this may not be the largest jump, investors should note that Micron has consistently beaten expectations for the entirety of 2025.\n2. Lyft: Institutional Buying Fuels Confidence\nLyft Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$16.789.50% UpsideHoldBased on 35 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $15.32 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $28.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $16.78 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $10.50 |\n|---|\nLyft Stock Forecast Details\nAs of early May 2025, institutional buyers from the Vanguard Group decided to increase their holdings in Lyft stock by as much as 5.7% to bring their entire position to a high of $451.6 million today, representing 9.1% ownership in the company. This ownership rate in the company not only reiterates the potential for a bullish future in Lyft but also brings a few added benefits.\nWith such institutional backing, Lyft can now count on the stewardship Vanguard can offer it as a large stockholder, which will likely increase the brand's odds of future success and scalability in the ridesharing marketplace.\nWith this in mind, it looks like Wall Street analysts feel more confident about Lyft being able to outperform on a financial basis in the future, which is why their EPS forecasts now call for up to $0.05 in the fourth quarter of 2025, a fivefold increase from today’s reported $0.01.\nWhile this may not be the largest EPS figure, the increase is what matters for the future of the stock price and its performance down the line, creating an upside gap that will be filled and enjoyed by current and prospective shareholders.\n3. Spotify: Steady Model, Explosive Growth\nSpotify Technology Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$681.27-3.96% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 29 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $709.35 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $900.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $681.27 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $375.00 |\n|---|\nSpotify Technology Stock Forecast Details\nAs the focus grows on the future potential of EPS growth in today’s list of winning stocks, Spotify's underlying business model comes into play to make this expectation a reality in the coming months and quarters. In fact, some on Wall Street are already betting that this scenario will play out sooner rather than later.\nWith a steady and predictable subscription business model, Spotify is able to repeatedly grow and beat its bottom-line EPS figure in the future, driving Jessica Reif from Bank of America to reiterate her Buy rating for Spotify stock as of late June 2025 while also placing a $900 per share valuation on the stock.\nDespite the stock already trading at 92% of its-52 52-week high, this analyst expects to see a further 25% upside in the stock moving forward.

{"title": "Why BigBear.ai Could Rally 100% and Catch Palantir Soon", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-bigbearai-could-rally-100-and-catch-palantir-soon/", "text": "BigBear.ai Today\n$7.13 -0.24 (-3.27%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $1.17\n▼\n$10.36 - Price Target\n- $6.33\nEvery investor is familiar with one of the most successful and widely followed stories in the market today, particularly in the world of aerospace and defense stocks. However, there is a new stock in the mix that has proven to be potentially just as successful as its leading peer (if not more) due to its underlying technology and prime positioning in the industry.\nIt may not seem like it at first, but BigBear.ai Holdings Inc. NYSE: BBAI now has everything it takes to catch up to the infinitely more popular Palantir Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: PLTR. When it comes to home run stocks, such as Palantir, over the past few years, there are usually three key factors that need to be in place to get things running smoothly.\nFirst is the popularity aspect. Not only has Palantir achieved top ranks in the market through financial growth and success, but also due to its marketing efforts (everyone knows the CEO is an eccentric figure); even memes have been created about Palantir whenever the occasion calls for it in the Twitter and YouTube space.\nThe other two aspects rhyme in terms of fundamentals, and that is exactly what BigBear.ai brings to the table today.\nOne Small Push for 100% Runs in BigBear.ai\nOver the past 12 months alone, BigBear.ai has cone on an incredible 287% rally to beat the broader S&P 500 index and most other stocks in the industry, with a quarterly performance of up to 92.3% as investors zoom in further into this phenomenon.\nHowever bullish this run has been, the stock still trades at only a fraction of its all-time high price of just under $10 per share, which in itself implies the stock can deliver another 100% rally to retest those highs. With this in mind, investors can take Palantir’s story as a successful case study and start looking for the same things in BigBear.ai.\nAs investors are now aware, popularity is one of these aspects, and a simple Google Trends search for the word BigBear.ai will reveal to investors just how popular this stock has become in recent weeks compared to the past, with searches surging into the triple digits.\nThe second aspect stems from a key fundamental event that needs to occur for all these younger companies, especially in defense, namely a steady stream of new contracts from the government or other customers.\nA 30% rise in backlog orders and a fourfold increase in R&D budgets satisfy this checklist item.\nAn advantage that BigBear.ai investors have over Palantir is that BigBear.ai is a $2 billion company, not a $300 billion one, which means their main objective is to land clients as soon as possible, regardless of terms and pricing. This makes BigBear.ai a prime candidate for the military to start looking into.\nFinally, it all comes down to the underlying technology aspects, which show that BigBear.ai is not so different from Palantir; if anything, it is more focused on the new methods of modern warfare, such as guiding unmanned vehicles and missions altogether.\nUsing artificial intelligence and machine learning models to get this technology working and scaling places BigBear.ai in the hands of a bullish fate since valuations today show a significant discount to other peers in the software and artificial intelligence space.\nA Big Gap Remains Unfilled\nBigBear.ai Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$6.33-11.16% DownsideModerate BuyBased on 4 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $7.13 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $9.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $6.33 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $4.00 |\n|---|\nBigBear.ai Stock Forecast Details\nAs of today, BigBear.ai stock trades at only 56% of its 52-week high, leaving plenty of room for it to catch up and try to flirt with its all-time high prices once more (if not break them), and this time, it has all of the fundamental backing for it to get it done.\nIn broader valuation terms, investors can see that BigBear.ai stock trades at only 7.0x its underlying asset base, mostly comprised of intangible assets (likely the IP running its artificial intelligence models). As is customary in financial analysis, this multiple wouldn’t mean much without a benchmark to compare it against.\nOther names that operate in similar technology consistently trade at an average multiple of assets of around 18.0x, which is over 100% over BigBear.ai and its valuation today. Closing this valuation gap (as well as the price action gap) would justify targeting the stock’s all-time highs of just under $10 per share.\nOne catalyst, which may have been hinted at in the latest quarterly results, is that the increase in R&D spending along with backlog orders may actually turn the financial trajectory much higher than everyone expects today, which could trigger a rating increase from Wall Street as well as new institutional buying flow to come in.\nBefore you consider BigBear.ai, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Why Centene Stock Dropped 40% — And Whether It's a Buy Now", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-centene-stock-dropped-40-and-whether-its-a-buy-now/", "text": "Centene Today\n$32.48 -0.61 (-1.83%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io. Learn more. - 52-Week Range\n- $31.78\n▼\n$80.59 - P/E Ratio\n- 4.84\n- Price Target\n- $66.40\nFor healthcare stock Centene NYSE: CNC, July 2 was indisputably disastrous. Shares closed down by over 40% that day, resulting in the firm losing over $11 billion in market capitalization. Close competitors were not spared either.\nMolina Healthcare NYSE: MOH dropped 22%, and Elevance Health NYSE: ELV fell over 11%.\nSo, what caused Centene to see one of the largest single-day sell-offs among major stocks in recent memory?\nAdditionally, what caused the shares of its competitors to follow suit? Ultimately, has a golden opportunity presented itself, or are these stocks names to avoid?\nCNC: Fewer, Sicker Patients Lead to Financial Re-Rating\nThe massive drop in Centene shares came as the company withdrew its 2025 full-year guidance. Centene, Molina, and Elevance are all managed healthcare companies. These firms generate a portion of their business by selling healthcare plans through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchanges. Plans from ACA exchanges get government subsidies and offer healthcare to millions of Americans who can't afford insurance on their own.\nCentene withdrew its guidance after receiving data from a third party that analyzed the state of the ACA exchange market, also referred to as the Health Insurance Marketplace. The analysis found that the market's growth is lower than previously expected, and the “implied aggregate market morbidity” was higher than previously thought.\nEssentially, fewer people are joining, and those who are joining have more health problems.\nThis is one of the worst combinations of issues a company like Centene could face. This means that the company is covering a smaller and sicker group of patients. It reduces their expected revenue while also increasing the expected cost of caring for each patient, pressuring the firm on both the top and bottom lines. Overall, the preliminary expected impact on the firm’s 2025 diluted earnings per share (EPS) is $2.75. That’s equal to 38% of the “greater than $7.25” EPS the company previously expected to generate in 2025.\nWith this massive hit on the company’s expected financials in mind, it’s much easier to understand why the stock sold off so much. Molina and Elevance also sold off on this news. They, too, could take significant financial hits because they are also in the ACA exchange market. However, for Centene, is the 40% pullback really justified?\nWall Street Now Sees a More Attractive Valuation in Centene\nCentene Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$66.40104.40% UpsideHoldBased on 17 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $32.49 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $89.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $66.40 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $33.00 |\n|---|\nCentene Stock Forecast Details\nThe MarketBeat consensus price target on Centene is nearly $69, implying 107% upside from the stock’s June 3 closing price. However, honing in on those price targets released after the company’s guidance withdrawal provides a much more helpful understanding of analyst views.\nAmong those MarketBeat-tracked updates, the average price target on Centene is $51.\nAlthough this target doesn’t signal anywhere close to 107% upside, the approximately 53% upside it implies is still very substantial. It is also much higher than the 32% average upside these analysts saw prior to Centene’s 40% drop.\nOverall, this suggests that from a valuation perspective, Centene shares are now solidly more attractive than they were before the fall. MarketBeat has not tracked any Molina or Elevance updates since Centene’s guidance withdrawal.\nBBB Peels Back Another Layer of the Risky Centene Onion\nThe upside implied in Wall Street forecasts looks enticing. It is important to consider that analysts made these forecasts before Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” into law on July 4. It includes $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade, which accounted for approximately 46% of Centene’s revenue last quarter.\nAnalysts expect the bill to result in 10.3 million and 11.8 million fewer people receiving Medicaid coverage over that period. Centene’s guidance withdrawal showed that fewer ACA exchange enrollments can substantially negatively affect the company. That revenue stream only made up 20% of the firm's total last quarter. Thus, the reduction in expected Medicaid users could have an even greater and longer-lasting impact on the company.\nAt this point, there is a highly elevated level of risk around Centene shares and similar names like Molina and Elevance. Although sitting on the sidelines isn’t fun, it is likely prudent. It will be important to see how markets and Centene shares react to the bill to understand if these names truly offer an opportunity.\nBefore you consider Centene, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

NASDAQ: COST may have finally caused the bulk retailer’s stock to spring a leak.\nThe stock trades at a premium that has long spooked more value-conscious investors, but has continued to produce strong earnings and membership growth returns.\nNow that cracks are beginning to show despite U.S. stocks returning to all-time highs, can smaller competitors like BJ’s Wholesale Club Holdings Inc. NYSE: BJ take advantage?\nTale of the Tape: Earnings and Valuation\nAmericans are spending more money than ever at wholesale retailers, and the industry is expected to grow another 50% by 2033, according to market analysis firm Business Research Insights.\nCostco and BJ’s, along with Walmart Inc. NYSE: WMT subsidiary Sam’s Club, make up the ‘Big Three’ wholesale clubs in the U.S. Costco is by far the biggest of these chains, with more than 79 million paying household members and nearly 900 stores worldwide. BJ’s is the smallest of the three, but it has been of tremendous value to investors over the last year.\n| |\nBJ\n|\nCOST\n|\n|\nPrice-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio\n|\n25.39\n|\n55.75\n|\n|\nPrice-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio\n|\n0.70\n|\n1.72\n|\n|\nOperating Margin\n|\n3.77%\n|\n3.65%\n|\nBJ’s Smaller Scale But Reasonable Value\nIn terms of size, BJ’s is just a mouse compared to the Costco tiger, with just over 7.5 million paying members and 255 club locations at the end of Q1 2025. What separates BJ’s from Sam’s Club and Costco is a broader inventory selection in smaller package sizes, along with a full-service deli for fresh meats.\nBJ’s footprint is relatively small, with club locations primarily along the East Coast in 21 states. However, the company announced plans to open 25 to 30 more stores over the next two years, which would represent more openings than the combined total of the previous three years.\nBJ’s reported Q1 2025 earnings on May 22 and missed on revenue, but easily surpassed EPS estimates ($1.14 reported vs. $0.91 expected). Net sales increased 4.7% year-over-year (YOY) to $5 billion, and the company expanded its gross margin by 30 basis points from Q1 2024. EPS also grew more than 34% YOY, but the stock still trades at a much cheaper multiple to COST.\nCostco Investors Pay a Premium for Growth\nCostco’s earnings releases have become a minor market holiday, and the company continues to meet the outsized expectations of analysts. Costco operates 896 stores as of Q1 2025, with 614 in the U.S. alone—more than twice as many as BJ’s. Naturally, Costco’s pure revenue and income figures blow BJ’s out of the water, but the growth and comp sales numbers justify the pricey valuation (more than 55 times earnings).\nIn Q1 2025, Costco again surpassed EPS and revenue expectations, but the comp sales really grabbed the market’s attention. Adjusted comp sales, which factor in gasoline and currency price fluctuations, grew 8% YOY. BJ’s comp sales grew at less than 3% in the same period.\nStore traffic was up 5% YOY, and average ticket size increased by 0.4%. If you’re looking for a reason why investors pay 55x earnings for a stock in the retail sector, 8% comp sales growth will do the trick.\nCharts Showing Waning Momentum\nDespite strong earnings, the charts show a pair of stocks losing steam. Markets rallied to new all-time highs this week, but COST failed to retake the all-time high it established in February, creating a bearish double top pattern. The momentum shift has taken the share price back under the 50-day moving average, which appears to be a new resistance level.\nBJ shares have faced a similar dilemma lately. After a Golden Cross sparked a 12-month rally, the stock has also now dipped below the 50-day moving average, a previously dependable support area. Still, the gap between 50-day and 200-day MAs is notably wider on the BJ chart.\nInvestors haven’t been disappointed by either stock, but BJ shares are up 27% over the last 12 months, significantly outperforming COST’s 14% gain. However, with both stocks flashing signals hinting at easing momentum, returns could be hampered until the next round of earnings in August.\nBJ's Currently Offers Better Value With Similar Growth Metrics and Margins\nBJ's Wholesale Club Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$116.128.81% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 19 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $106.72 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $140.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $116.12 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $87.00 |\n|---|\nBJ's Wholesale Club Stock Forecast Details\nWith an expected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6% between now and 2033, research suggests there’s plenty of room for healthy competition amongst wholesale clubs.\nExpectations for Costco are sky-high, evidenced by a P/E ratio over 55.\nCostco must continue its quarterly fireworks display on each conference call to maintain its lofty stock price.\nOn the contrary, BJ’s has also demonstrated significant growth at a better price, especially in its digital sales division (35% digital comp sales growth in Q1 2025).\nBJ’s strong balance sheet, growth initiatives, and cheaper valuation offer higher upside than Costco.\nBefore you consider BJ's Wholesale Club, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "CAVA Group: Why the Growth Story Is Just Getting Started", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/cava-group-why-the-growth-story-is-just-getting-started/", "text": "For investors watching CAVA Group NYSE: CAVA, the stock’s recent trading has been a lesson in volatility. After a solid multiday run, shares have started to consolidate, which is a typical pattern for high-growth companies.\nCAVA Group Today\n$91.73 +2.19 (+2.45%) As of 03:59 PM Eastern\nThis is a fair market value price provided by Polygon.io.

CAVA's operational performance is not only strong but also accelerating.\nA closer look reveals a potential disconnect between short-term market noise and the company's long-term health.\nWhile stock charts fluctuate, CAVA's key business metrics point toward a strengthening future. This creates a compelling situation for investors who focus on fundamentals, where the underlying business story is improving even as the stock price takes a breather.\nWhy Analysts Remain Bullish on CAVA\nOne of the clearest signals of CAVA’s strength comes from recent expert analysis. In the first week of July 2025, KeyBanc initiated coverage of the company with an Overweight rating and a $100 price target.\nCAVA Group Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$117.8228.45% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 18 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $91.73 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $150.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $117.82 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $90.00 |\n|---|\nCAVA Group Stock Forecast Details\nThe firm made a powerful comparison for investors, suggesting CAVA could define the Mediterranean food category just as Chipotle NYSE: CMG did for fast-casual Mexican food.\nThis optimistic view is shared across CAVA’s analyst community. Eighteen analysts give CAVA a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Their average price target of $117.82 signals a belief in the stock's healthy upside potential.\nThis optimism persists despite CAVA's premium valuation. The stock trades at a relatively high price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which reflects the market’s high expectations. However, CAVA's performance provides a strong foundation for this valuation.\nIn CAVA’s first-quarter earnings report, the company stated that revenue increased 28.2%, driven by a 7.5% rise in customer traffic. This is the kind of best-in-class growth that often earns a premium price tag in the market.\nFrom Blueprint to Reality: CAVA's 1,000 Store Expansion\nThe most significant driver of CAVA's long-term value is its clear and tangible expansion plan. The company currently operates 382 restaurants and has a stated goal to reach at least 1,000 locations by 2032. This plan to nearly triple its footprint gives investors a direct and understandable pathway to future revenue growth.\nThis rapid expansion is made possible by a highly efficient business model. CAVA’s restaurants generate industry-leading profit margins of 25.1% at the store level. Combined with a high average sales per restaurant of $2.9 million, this powerful economic engine provides the cash to build new locations without incurring significant debt.\nThe strategy is already delivering results. In June 2025, CAVA announced the opening of a new restaurant in Chicago's iconic Willis Tower. Securing such a high-profile location shows the brand's strength and ability to execute its plan in major markets. For shareholders, each new restaurant adds directly to the company's sales and profits, systematically building long-term value.\nBuilding a Moat: CAVA's Competitive Edge\nAlongside its rapid physical expansion strategy, CAVA is making strategic investments in technology and customer loyalty to establish a durable competitive advantage. The moat that CAVA is building is designed to protect its market position for years to come.\nCAVA is executing a strategy that centers on a \"Connected Kitchen\" initiative. New Kitchen Display Systems (KDS) are enabling faster and more accurate food production, particularly for profitable digital orders. The company has also tested AI-driven tools to help guide food prep, a technology aimed at cutting waste and improving efficiency. These investments directly boost the bottom line.\nAt the same time, CAVA is building a direct relationship with its customers through its rewards program, which has grown to nearly 8 million members. This program is a strategic asset. It encourages repeat business and provides valuable data for marketing. This direct-to-consumer approach is a first-mover advantage that smaller competitors will find hard to imitate.\nCAVA Group, Inc. (CAVA) Price Chart for Thursday, July, 10, 2025\nA Foundation for Future Growth\nFor CAVA, the story is one of fundamental strength. A bullish analyst consensus supports the company, which is executing a clear expansion plan funded by its own success. Furthermore, strategic investments are creating a business built for the long haul.\nWhile CAVA's valuation reflects high expectations, its performance has consistently shown an ability to meet them. The evidence suggests a business whose growth story is not only intact but also gaining momentum.\nLooking ahead, the next major event for investors will be the company's second-quarter 2025 earnings report, expected in late August. It will provide the next set of data to measure CAVA's progress as it solidifies its position as a leader in the modern restaurant industry.\nBefore you consider CAVA Group, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Why the Schwab Dividend ETF Rallied—and Can It Keep Climbing?", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-the-schwab-dividend-etf-ralliedand-can-it-keep-climbing/", "text": "Financial markets are a complex flow chart for those who understand how to read demand and supply within the broader context, where everything ties back to the concept of a benchmark. This can affect many spaces equally, but also differently at the same time.\nSchwab US Dividend Equity ETF Today\nSCHDSchwab US Dividend Equity ETF\n$27.51 +0.22 (+0.81%) As of 04:10 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $23.87\n▼\n$29.72 - Dividend Yield\n- 3.71%\n- Assets Under Management\n- $71.14 billion\nFor example, low interest rates create a low return benchmark on assets like bonds, while also potentially creating demand (or flows) in other areas, such as oil and gas. The combinations are endless.\nUnderstanding this concept is part of global macro funds, whose analysts’ main focus is to figure out where money will flow out of and into next, effectively anticipating the new demand cycle. In today’s cycle, investors can see many divergences between technology stocks and other slower (or boring) names in the consumer staples sector, creating an opportunity for a new rotation.\nThis rotation also stems from the pending economic policy changes to be implemented by the Federal Reserve, where its chairman, Jerome Powell, is set to decide whether interest rates will be cut or not before the end of 2025.\nAnticipating this change in terms of yield and benchmarks, the story behind a rally in the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF NYSEARCA: SCHD begins to make more sense.\nSmart Money Gets Ahead of the Race\nAs of early June 2025, institutional allocators from eCIO Inc. decided to open a position worth up to $22.8 million in this dividend exchange-traded fund (ETF), signaling increased (and recent) interest in such a potential rotation, where dividend stocks might see increased demand in the coming months and quarters.\nInvestors will see a lot more of that with regard to institutional buying into this ETF, considering that this vehicle declined by up to 3% over the past quarter alone, mainly due to the United States' April tariff announcement.\nWhat’s different about this dip is that the ETF never really recovered back to pre-tariff prices, significantly underperforming the broader S&P 500 index. There’s a reason for that. Today’s investors aren’t focused on slow and stable growth or even income; they are looking to the exciting and potentially dangerous names in the market.\nThis creates a massive opportunity for those who can look ahead and realize that valuation gaps and price action divergences will eventually need to close under the right catalyst. This is exactly where the Fed's path might act as the match that ignites the fire of capital rotation and demand.\nSCHD ETF Primed for Price Rebound\nIn a lower-interest-rate world, bond yields should also come down. The United States' ten-year Treasury bond yield has been the generally accepted benchmark for yields around the world, so investors can use this metric as the initial point where yield rotation might come into play.\nSchwab US Dividend Equity ETF Dividend Payments\n- Dividend Yield\n- 3.71%\n- Annual Dividend\n- $1.02\n- Recent Dividend Payment\n- Mar. 31\nSCHD Dividend History\nToday, the Schwab Dividend ETF offers a $1.3 per share payout to shareholders via dividends, which translates into an annualized dividend yield of just over 4.8%. On the other hand, the treasury 10-year yield has fallen to just over 4.2%, making this ETF more attractive from a pure yield perspective.\nMore than just yield, however, is the potential for the overall price action to catch up to the rest of the broader ETFs in the market. This is not a vanity measure or ideal; investors can see this happens in every yield and interest rate cycle without fail.\nOne example can be taken from the ETF’s largest holding, ConocoPhillips NYSE: COP, during the rate-cutting cycles of 2020 through 2022. As bond yields fell, it was open season for investors to hunt for a better return and some upside if they could add it to the deal.\nThis is why ConocoPhillips stock, whose dividend yield rose to 6% during 2020 and 2021, triggered a massive rally shortly after.\nThe stock went from roughly $40 per share to a threefold increase in just two short years, ultimately stopping at just over $130 per share.\nThere are plenty more examples of such rotations, but investors should now get the picture. This Schwab Dividend ETF is not a name they want to leave out of their watchlists for the coming rate cuts, especially as the price showcases an 8% recovery rally over the past month, along with plenty of room left to catch up to and exceed the pre-tariff levels.\nSuppose all of these factors weren’t enough, investors can also consider the 60.7% decline in the ETF’s short interest over the past month, a clear sign of bearish capitulation as short sellers now face an inevitable rotation rooted in some of the strongest fundamentals of financial markets.\nBefore you consider Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF wasn't on the list.\nWhile Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\nView The Five Stocks Here\nWondering where to start (or end) with AI stocks?

{"title": "Alphabet’s Waymo and Services Beginning to Feel the Pressure?", "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/alphabets-waymo-and-services-beginning-to-feel-the-pressure/", "text": "Alphabet Today\n$177.62 +1.00 (+0.57%) As of 04:00 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $140.53\n▼\n$207.05 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.47%\n- P/E Ratio\n- 19.80\n- Price Target\n- $200.13\nAlphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL has long been regarded as a tech juggernaut, anchored by its dominance in search, advertising, and YouTube. But behind the scenes, the company has been investing heavily in moonshot ventures through its Other Bets segment, with Waymo, its autonomous driving unit, arguably the crown jewel.\nAnd yet, as we move deeper into 2025, the spotlight on Waymo and the scrutiny grows brighter. While progress continues, challenges are intensifying.\nNew competitors, including Tesla’s rapid rollout of robotaxis, are creating a sense of urgency. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s recently reported plans to build a rival to Google Workspace could potentially shake up Alphabet’s core productivity suite business. In short, Alphabet is entering a phase where innovation is no longer just a choice, but a necessity.\nWaymo’s Mission Is Clear, But the Road Is Not\nWaymo was launched with a bold vision: to create a fully autonomous driver that’s safer, more efficient, and more scalable than any human-driven system. It’s one of the most advanced autonomous vehicle programs globally, with millions of miles driven on public roads.\nThe company’s driverless ride-hailing services in Phoenix and San Francisco have been live for months, and it has recently begun expanding into Los Angeles and Austin.\nThe long-term opportunity is massive. If executed at scale, autonomous ride-hailing could unlock multi-billion-dollar revenue streams and forever change urban mobility. As Alphabet increasingly leans on AI-driven innovation, Waymo aligns perfectly with the company’s broader thesis.\nHowever, despite all the progress, monetization remains limited. Public perception and regulatory frameworks also continue to pose significant headwinds.\nWaymo is a costly endeavor that falls under Alphabet’s Other Bets segment, which continues to lose money quarter after quarter.\nTesla Is Moving Fast, and That Changes the Game\nEnter Tesla NASDAQ: TSLA, which has officially launched its robotaxi program in Austin, with plans to rapidly expand to other markets by the end of the year. Tesla’s vertically integrated model, massive data advantage from real-world driving, and its new Cybercab represent a direct threat to Waymo’s leadership position.\nOnce proven and adopted, Tesla could scale much more quickly than Waymo and achieve profitability in a fraction of the time. One example of that is how current car owners could become business owners by utilizing their vehicles as part of a ride-hailing network.\nElon Musk has stated that Tesla owners may be able to earn money by adding their cars to the robotaxi fleet, effectively converting their vehicles into autonomous taxis.\nWhile Tesla’s system is not without flaws, as is the case with most new and highly disruptive innovations in its infancy, its aggressive rollout timeline and massive public visibility could quickly steal both market share and mindshare.\nNotably, Tesla’s brand, proven track record of success, and Elon Musk’s marketing and innovation prowess could attract more early adopters and generate momentum faster than Alphabet’s more cautious, methodical approach.\nOpenAI’s Workspace Ambitions Could Pressure Google Services\nWhile the focus on Waymo is important, another major potential threat opened this week, targeting Alphabet’s core productivity business. Reports surfaced this week that OpenAI is exploring the creation of a new workspace productivity platform that could directly challenge Google Workspace.\nWhile still speculative, the implications are serious. Google Workspace, which includes Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Meet, and more, is a cornerstone of Google Services, the segment that drives the majority of Alphabet’s revenue. Workspace doesn’t just generate direct subscription revenue. It also supports Google’s ad ecosystem and strengthens its enterprise moat.\nIf OpenAI manages to build a more innovative, AI-native workspace platform that leapfrogs existing tools, Alphabet could face the same disruption it once created. This potential shift wouldn’t immediately impact revenue, but over time, a loss of enterprise mindshare could have ripple effects across the company’s ecosystem.\nThe Bigger Picture: Alphabet Needs to Defend Its Turf\nAlphabet Stock Forecast Today\n12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$199.6112.38% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 43 Analyst Ratings | Current Price | $177.62 |\n|---|\n| High Forecast | $240.00 |\n|---|\n| Average Forecast | $199.61 |\n|---|\n| Low Forecast | $160.00 |\n|---|\nAlphabet Stock Forecast Details\nAlphabet remains a tech powerhouse. In Q1 2025, the company reported revenue of $90.24 billion, beating estimates, and EPS of $2.81, which exceeded estimates by 38%. Advertising remains resilient, and Google Cloud continues to gain market share.\nThe company’s AI infrastructure is becoming increasingly integrated into nearly every product it offers. But several challenges exist, and Alphabet cannot afford to take its foot off the gas.\nMaintaining dominance in core businesses, such as Google Services, even as rivals circle, is essential.\nThey must also convert ambitious long-term bets, such as Waymo, into meaningful growth drivers, or they risk falling behind more agile disruptors.\nBefore you consider Alphabet, you'll want to hear this.\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

{"title": "Andy Warhol Net Worth: $220M Fortune & Secret Faith (2025 Update)", "url": "https://www.finance-monthly.com/2025/07/andy-warhol-net-worth-faith-legacy/", "text": "Andy Warhol Net Worth: $220M Fortune & Secret Faith (2025 Update).\nby AJ Palmer\nAndy Warhol, the pop art icon synonymous with Campbell's soup cans, Marilyn Monroe, and his enigmatic silver wig, amassed an extraordinary net worth estimated at $220 million (adjusted for inflation) at the time of his unexpected death in 1987.\nYet, hidden beneath this glittering façade of commercial success and counterculture prominence lay a profound spiritual life that, for decades, remained largely private: his unwavering devotion to Byzantine Catholicism.\nFar from being a quirky footnote, Warhol’s faith was a quiet anchor, profoundly shaping his unique artistic vision and, paradoxically, allowing him to see the sacred in the seemingly profane world he so meticulously chronicled.\nHe was known to slip quietly into church most mornings, rosary beads often tucked into his pocket, and a crucifix kept by his bedside. This daily ritual, seemingly at odds with his flamboyant public image, was in fact the crucible where his artistic sensibility was forged.\nThe repetitive, almost hypnotic quality of the Byzantine liturgy, with its gilded icons and reverence for saints, directly informed his serial screen prints of mundane objects and celebrity portraits. For Warhol, the mass-produced images of consumer culture became his modern-day icons, transforming the supermarket aisle into a \"cathedral of commodities\" where he sought to reveal the divine hidden within the ordinary.\nHis art wasn't just a commentary on society; it was, as art historian Eugene McCarraher suggested, \"a way of liking things,\" a celebration of the everyday where, in Orthodox tradition, \"the divine always manifests itself sacramentally.\"\nThe Financial Empire: Dissecting Warhol's $220 Million Estate\nAndy Warhol's demise on February 22, 1987, due to complications following a routine gallbladder surgery, unveiled an estate of immense value. A prolonged and bitter dispute over its valuation was finally settled on July 21, 1993, when his estate was officially valued at approximately $220 million.\nThis amount was agreed upon by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, the New York State Attorney General's office, and the estate's executor, Frederick W. Hughes [The New York Times]. This substantial fortune underscores not only his prodigious artistic output but also his shrewd understanding of art as a commodity.\nHis personal estate was staggering in its breadth and volume, a true reflection of his lifelong obsession with collecting. It famously took Sotheby's a remarkable nine days to fully catalog his possessions after his death. The inventory included:\n- Over 90,000 individual art pieces: This comprised a staggering 4,118 paintings, 5,103 drawings, 19,086 prints, and 66,512 photographs, a monumental archive of his prolific career that forms the core of his estate's value.\n- Personal effects valued at $20 million: This eclectic mix ranged from museum-quality fine art collected from peers to quirky collectibles, revealing the true breadth of his fascinations. Among them were a legendary collection of 175 ceramic cookie jars (which famously sold for over $250,000 at auction, far exceeding expectations), diamond-studded watches, hundreds of his iconic silver wigs, and an astonishing assortment of taxidermy.\n- Significant real estate holdings: Warhol owned valuable properties, most notably his Upper East Side townhouse in New York City and \"Eothen,\" his picturesque oceanfront compound in Montauk, Long Island. Acquired with Paul Morrissey in 1971 for $225,000, this compound, named from the Greek for \"from the East\" or \"from the dawn,\" became a notable retreat for Warhol and his famous circle, including the Kennedys and The Rolling Stones.\nIn his will, Warhol famously stipulated that the vast majority of his estate—the lion's share of his paintings, stock holdings, furniture, and other valuables—was to fund the creation of The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.\nThis philanthropic endeavor was established to \"advance the visual arts,\" ensuring his wealth would continue to support artistic innovation for generations. While the bulk of his fortune established the Foundation, a portion of his personal effects and some early artworks were inherited by his nephew James Warhola and his six siblings.\nThe Contentious Battle for the Warhol Estate\nThe administration of Warhol's colossal estate was far from smooth, leading to a high-profile legal saga that spanned years. Frederick W. Hughes, Warhol's long-time business manager and executor, initially headed the Foundation. However, his failing health after Warhol's death contributed to internal strife.\nThe most significant financial dispute arose with Edward W. Hayes, the lawyer initially hired to manage the estate. Hayes had a contract entitling him to a 2% fee of the estate's gross value and controversially estimated its worth at a staggering $400 million to $600 million. This valuation, if upheld, would have resulted in an enormous payout for Hayes.\nThe newly formed Warhol Foundation, under Archibald Gillies (who took over from a sickly Hughes in 1990), fiercely contested this figure. The legal battle culminated in Christie's official 1993 valuation of $220 million, a figure upheld by the New York Surrogate's Court, significantly reducing Hayes's eventual payout and resolving the \"legal tug-of-war\" [Victor Wiener Associates]. This protracted dispute highlighted the immense complexities of valuing an artist's entire body of work, especially one as prolific and unconventional as Warhol's.\nFaith: The Unseen Thread in His Tapestry\nWhile his public image was all about celebrity and superficiality, Warhol's Byzantine Catholic upbringing remained a constant, deeply personal influence. He rarely spoke of his faith publicly, yet his closest friends and the meticulous entries in The Andy Warhol Diaries reveal a man who truly held it as his anchor. He attended Mass regularly at Manhattan’s St. Vincent Ferrer, often slipping in discreetly, preferring the back pews.\n\"He’d sneak into church in jeans, sit in the back pew, and leave quietly before the final blessing,\" recalled Father John O’Connor of St. Vincent Ferrer Church [Catholic News Agency].\nHis art, rather than being a repudiation of this faith, can be seen as an extension of it. The repetition inherent in his silkscreen process, from \"Marilyn Diptych\" to \"Campbell's Soup Cans,\" echoes the ritualistic repetition of prayers and the serial nature of religious icons.\nFor Warhol, celebrity portraits were a modern form of hagiography, presenting secular saints for contemporary veneration. His later works, like his monumental \"Last Supper\" series, explicitly merged his deep-seated religious imagery with commercial iconography, demonstrating his belief that beauty and spiritual meaning could be found everywhere, even in the most mundane or commercial forms.\nScholars like Jane Daggett Dillenberger, in her seminal work The Religious Art of Andy Warhol, highlight how Warhol’s Catholicism informed his fascination with repetition and iconography, demonstrating a complex, often conflicted, but undeniable spiritual core [Artlyst].\nFrom Pittsburgh Roots to Pop Art Stardom\nBorn Andrew Warhola Jr. on August 6, 1928, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Warhol was the son of working-class Austrian-Hungarian immigrants. His early life was marked by the tragic death of his father when Andy was just 13. He honed his artistic skills at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, graduating in 1949 with a BFA in pictorial design.\nUpon moving to New York City, Warhol quickly made a name for himself in commercial art, particularly in magazine illustration and advertising. His distinctive \"blotted line\" technique, developed while working for shoe manufacturer Israel Miller in the 1950s, became his early signature. His first solo show in 1952 at the Hugo Gallery and a group exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1956 marked his formal entry into the art world.\nThe 1960s saw Warhol's meteoric rise with his pioneering use of the screen printing process. His 1962 exhibition of \"Campbell's Soup Cans\" at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles was a landmark event, effectively launching Pop Art on the West Coast. Throughout the decade, he created iconic portraits of American cultural figures like Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor, Muhammad Ali, and Elvis Presley, alongside his celebrated depictions of dollar bills, Coca-Cola bottles, and other consumer objects.\nBeyond his public persona, Warhol also contended with significant health challenges. As a child, he suffered from Sydenham's chorea, a neurological disorder that confined him to bed for weeks, a period often credited with sparking his deep interest in drawing and magazine imagery.\nThroughout his adult life, he harbored a profound fear of illness and hospitals, a hypochondria exacerbated by the 1968 assassination attempt. He also exhibited compulsive collecting behaviors, filling hundreds of 'time capsules' with everyday objects, a tendency some biographers have retrospectively linked to hoarding disorder. These personal struggles, including long-standing gallbladder issues, ultimately contributed to the complications that led to his death following surgery in 1987.\nThe Factory: A Universe of Creation and Controversy\nAs his fame skyrocketed, Warhol established his legendary New York studio, The Factory. More than just an art space, it was a cultural crucible where he assembled an eclectic \"coterie\" of artists, writers, musicians, drag queens, intellectuals, and street people. The Factory became the epicenter of counterculture, a place where boundaries blurred, and creativity flourished.\nHere, Warhol cultivated \"superstars\" like singer-songwriter Nico (whose band, The Velvet Underground, he famously produced and managed) and actors such as Edie Sedgwick and Candy Darling. These collaborators starred in many of his experimental films, including \"Chelsea Girls,\" further cementing The Factory's avant-garde reputation.\nThe Assassination Attempt and Its Aftermath\nOn June 3, 1968, the vibrant world of The Factory was shattered when radical feminist writer Valerie Solanas, a marginal figure associated with the studio, shot Warhol. He was declared clinically dead for nearly a minute and suffered severe internal injuries, including a shattered gallbladder, that required hours of life-saving surgery. Solanas was subsequently diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, sentenced to three years in prison, and later died of pneumonia in 1988.\nThe assassination attempt profoundly impacted Warhol, leaving him with chronic physical pain and deep psychological trauma, including lasting paranoia. After the attack, he became increasingly reclusive and, notably, more overtly spiritual, resuming his near-daily church visits. He famously remarked: \"Before I was shot, I always thought that I was more half-there than all-there—I always suspected that I was watching TV instead of living life.\"\nWarhol's Continued Influence and Legacy\nThe 1970s saw Warhol focus more on portrait commissions for wealthy patrons, while the 1980s marked a resurgence in critical and commercial success, partly due to his collaborations with younger artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat. His final career exhibition took place in Milan, Italy, in 1987, shortly before his death.\nAndy Warhol's legacy is immense and multifaceted. He lived openly as a gay man long before the gay liberation movement gained widespread traction and is credited with popularizing the term \"15 minutes of fame.\" His exploration of celebrity, consumerism, and the blurring lines between art and commerce remains profoundly relevant.\nThe Andy Warhol Authentication Board: A Historical Note\nIt's worth noting the historical context of art authentication in the Warhol market. The Andy Warhol Authentication Board, which certified works from 1995 to 2012, was eventually dissolved due to the immense cost of defending against numerous lawsuits, a process that reportedly cost The Andy Warhol Foundation over $10 million in legal fees [Wikipedia: Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board].\nThe Foundation now primarily relies on the ongoing creation of comprehensive Warhol catalogues raisonnés for scholarly judgments on authenticity.\nThe Supreme Court Showdown: Defining Fair Use\nIn 2023, Warhol's legacy faced a landmark legal challenge that reshaped copyright law for artists. Photographer Lynn Goldsmith sued The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts over Warhol's \"Prince Series,\" a collection of silkscreen prints based on her 1981 photograph of the musician Prince. One of these images, \"Orange Prince,\" was licensed by Condé Nast, prompting Goldsmith's lawsuit.\nThe case ultimately reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled 7–2 in favor of Goldsmith [U.S. Supreme Court Opinion]. The Court determined that the Foundation's commercial licensing of the \"Orange Prince\" image was not protected under the \"transformative\" fair use doctrine because its purpose was substantially similar to Goldsmith's original photo (both were used for commercial illustration). This decision has significant implications for how artists can appropriate existing works, underscoring the importance of considering the commercial nature and purpose of the derivative work.\nAn Enduring Market and Cultural Impact (2024-2025 Insights)\nSince his death, Warhol's paintings and prints have consistently fetched astronomical prices at auction, solidifying his position as one of the most commercially successful artists of all time.\n- His \"Shot Sage Blue Marilyn\" (1964) sold for $195 million at Christie's on May 9, 2022, becoming the most expensive 20th-century artwork ever sold at auction at the time [Christie's].\n- Other notable painting sales include \"Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)\" ($105 million) and \"Eight Elvises\" ($100 million).\nThe market for Andy Warhol's prints and editions in 2024 and extending into 2025 continues to demonstrate robust demand and resilience. While the overall art market saw some fluctuations, Warhol's segment has maintained stability, showcasing consistent demand driven by his enduring cultural relevance and brand power.\nFor instance, a complete set of his Endangered Species (1983) prints sold for $4,320,000 at Sotheby's in November 2024, demonstrating the continued strength in his portfolio works. Individual prints often fetch between $10,000 and $50,000, with complete portfolios commanding significant premiums [Guy Hepner, Revolver Gallery].\nWarhol's prints remain a \"blue-chip hedge\" within art portfolios, known for their liquidity and stable appreciation, making them attractive to both seasoned collectors and new investors [Hang-Up Gallery]. Beyond sales, Warhol's enduring cultural presence is highlighted by new projects like the upcoming biopic starring Jared Leto [Revolver Gallery].\nToday, Warhol's name remains synonymous with Pop Art and the commercialization of culture. The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, home to the largest collection of his art and archives worldwide, continues to preserve and promote his extraordinary legacy. Crucially, The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts continues to fulfill Warhol's philanthropic vision, with its most recent announcement on July 10, 2025, awarding $4.3 million in grants to 51 visual arts organizations across the United States and Puerto Rico.\nThese \"Spring 2025\" grants support programs enhancing artists' creative practices, funding major exhibitions (including retrospectives for overlooked artists and shows addressing current sociopolitical themes), and supporting curatorial research [Andy Warhol Foundation]. As Foundation president Joel Wachs emphasized, \"We remain dedicated to supporting organizations that amplify the voices of artists, contributing to their individual well-being and to the overall health of our society.\"\nThis ongoing commitment ensures Warhol's financial legacy continues to profoundly shape the contemporary art world. Beyond the bold colors and shocking statements, Andy Warhol was a complex figure who saw the sacred in the mundane, transforming the everyday into scripture, and leaving behind a fortune and an artistic philosophy that continues to resonate globally.\nLast Updated: July 10, 2025\nFrequently Asked Questions About Andy Warhol\nHow much was Andy Warhol worth when he died?\nAndy Warhol's net worth at the time of his death in 1987 was approximately $220 million, adjusted for inflation, as determined by a 1993 court-confirmed valuation.\nWho inherited Andy Warhol’s fortune?\nThe vast majority of Andy Warhol's fortune was bequeathed to The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, which he established in his will to advance contemporary visual art.

Whether you're a CFO vetting a new supplier, a founder considering an unsolicited investment offer, or a risk officer greenlighting a contractor, the need for fast, discreet, and actionable intelligence has never been greater.\nReview ClarityCheck: a lightweight but powerful tool that allows you to scan the digital footprint of a phone number in seconds. While traditional due diligence processes take days or weeks, ClarityCheck surfaces risk signals almost instantly — without requiring consent, invasive access, or legal complexity. For finance professionals, it’s becoming a crucial early step in risk filtration.\nFrom finance fraud to identity confusion: the silent epidemic\nAccording to UK Finance, the first half of 2024 saw over £580 million lost to authorized push payment scams. Many of these began not with phishing emails or fake websites — but with a phone number. In a world where communication often begins over WhatsApp or Telegram, that number might be the only anchor to verify a person’s identity.\nFinancial departments are now routinely dealing with:\n- Fake vendors and shell contractors.\n- Ghost freelancers with no verifiable history.\n- Scammers impersonating investors, advisors, or clients.\nThe speed at which these interactions occur leaves little time for full legal checks. That’s why tools like ClarityCheck — fast, anonymous, and focused — are gaining ground.\nWhat ClarityCheck actually does\nYou input a number. ClarityCheck returns what’s publicly associated with it across the web. That might include:\n- The registered name or alias tied to the number.\n- Regional activity or location traces.\n- Connected social profiles or mentions.\n- Marketplace, forum, or public listings presence.\nThere’s no magic — just public data analysis at speed. Yet the insight can be game-changing.\nReal-world risk, real-time prevention\nConsider this scenario: A finance director receives an invoice from a seemingly familiar subcontractor, but the bank details are slightly different. The contact number provided doesn’t match previous records. Before initiating payment, she runs the new number through ClarityCheck. It’s flagged as connected to multiple fraud complaints on independent forums.\nThat’s not a legal verdict — but it’s enough to halt the transaction. The financial team avoids a potential loss, and a deeper audit is launched.\nWhy financial teams need tools like ClarityCheck\n- Decentralized decision-making: In modern organizations, purchasing decisions, vendor approvals, and budget allocations are often distributed. Not every manager has access to full legal tools — but most can input a number.\n- Speed and volume: With remote-first work and cross-border teams, finance departments are handling higher volumes of quick, informal interactions. From procurement to partnerships, many decisions begin in a messaging app.\n- Reduced friction, higher insight: ClarityCheck doesn’t breach privacy or require account access. It works on public signals, making it both ethical and efficient.\n- Not just fraud — reputation: Some contacts aren’t criminal, but controversial. A potential contractor with ties to politically sensitive causes or negative press may introduce reputational risk. ClarityCheck offers a glimpse into that wider narrative.\nClarityCheck as the new KYC-lite\nWhile not a substitute for regulated Know Your Customer (KYC) or Know Your Business (KYB) protocols, ClarityCheck acts as a pre-check layer:\n- Before onboarding a service provider.\n- Before approving large prepayments.\n- Before proceeding with informal dealmaking initiated via personal messaging.\nIts value lies not in confirmation — but in interruption. When something feels off, this tool helps verify your instinct with minimal effort.\nProtecting brand capital and internal trust\nThe fallout from fraud or controversy isn't just financial. It undermines the credibility of teams, processes, and leadership. For finance executives, preventing even one costly error can justify proactive tools like ClarityCheck.\nAnd it’s not just external actors. In some cases, internal fraud begins with contractors posing as new hires, or consultants claiming false credentials. When you only have a phone number and an email address, ClarityCheck provides the first layer of vetting.\nLow barrier, high impact\nOne of the biggest advantages of ClarityCheck is accessibility. It doesn’t require onboarding a new SaaS platform, nor does it demand sensitive data input. Finance departments can run checks as needed, at low cost, and without creating audit bottlenecks.\nIt’s especially suited for:\n- Finance managers handling procurement.\n- Startup CFOs with lean due diligence bandwidth.\n- Accounting teams verifying vendor legitimacy.\n- Risk officers flagging identity mismatches or anomalies.\nIn the age of deception, signals matter\nAI-generated resumes. Paid reviews. Cloned websites. The signals of authenticity are harder to read than ever. But the one constant — a phone number — still links most business actors to their digital history.\nThat’s why ClarityCheck is growing not just as a consumer app, but as a B2B verification layer that balances speed, ethics, and insight.\nIn a world where seconds matter and blind trust is expensive, a tool that reveals inconsistencies before they turn into crises is no longer optional.\nConclusion: small checks, strategic impact\nFinance teams today are not just accountants — they’re guardians of organizational trust. And while ERP systems and compliance software do the heavy lifting, small tools like ClarityCheck add a critical layer of intuition.\nBecause in risk management, it’s not always the big red flags you see coming. Sometimes, it’s the quiet number on a WhatsApp chat that tells you everything you need to know.", "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 15:45:31 +0000", "author": "Finance Monthly", "source": "https://www.finance-monthly.com/feed/"}

{"title": "Akon Net Worth 2025: What Happened to the Money, Music, and Akon City?", "url": "https://www.finance-monthly.com/2025/07/akon-net-worth-music-akon-city/", "text": "The Journey of Akon's Net Worth: Success, Setbacks, and Surprising Turns\nAkon is best known for chart-toppers like “Locked Up” and “Lonely,” but the story of his wealth goes far deeper than catchy hooks and platinum records. A prolific collaborator, he's worked with everyone from Eminem to Rihanna. His career is a whirlwind of highs, reinventions, and a headline-making flop that still shocks fans. The failed crypto experiment? That comes later. But first, here’s how a kid from Senegal became a global name in music, business, and beyond.\nEarly Life, Career & Personal Story 📖\nAliaune Damala Badara Akon Thiam was born on April 16, 1973, in St. Louis, Missouri, though much of his childhood was spent in Senegal. His parents were artists: his father, Mor Thiam, a respected percussionist; his mother, Kine Gueye Thiam, a professional dancer. From an early age, Akon was surrounded by rhythm, culture, and storytelling. He learned to play five instruments before he was ten and performed frequently in Senegalese community events.\nWhen the family moved to Union City, New Jersey, Akon struggled to adapt. As a teenager, he got caught up in street life and eventually spent time in jail. That experience became a turning point. While incarcerated, he began writing music, channeling his energy into creativity. Upon release, he began recording tracks in a home studio, catching the attention of SRC Records. His breakout hit \"Locked Up\" in 2004 struck a chord with millions and catapulted him to international fame. His debut album, Trouble, went multi-platinum.\nHis follow-up album, Konvicted, solidified his position in the industry, featuring hits like \"Smack That\" and \"Don't Matter.\" By 2007, he was one of the most sought-after collaborators in music. He launched Konvict Muzik and KonLive Distribution, discovering and signing artists like Lady Gaga and T-Pain. \"He saw what I couldn’t even see in myself,\" T-Pain once told Rolling Stone.\nBeyond music, Akon pursued philanthropy and business. He launched Akon Lighting Africa in 2014, a solar initiative that brought power to over 14 African countries (Source: Lighting Africa). He also invested in conflict-free diamond mining in Sierra Leone. Despite his fame, he kept family life relatively private, once saying at a Senegalese youth forum, \"Family is the root, the foundation. Fame fades, but values remain.\"\nNext Section Coming Up: How Akon Turned Beats into Billions\nHow He Built a $50 Million Celebrity Net Worth 💸\nAkon’s financial story is just as dynamic as his music career. His net worth, estimated at $50 million (Source: Forbes), stems from a mix of entertainment income, business ventures, and global branding.\nMusic was his initial fortune maker. With over 35 million albums sold globally, he earned millions in royalties alone. In peak years, he raked in approximately $5 million annually from streaming and album sales. Live performances were another goldmine. Tours like the Konvicted Tour reportedly brought in over $15 million, especially in international markets like Europe and Africa (Source: Billboard).\nThrough his labels Konvict Muzik and KonLive, Akon earned significant distribution profits. At their height, deals generated around $5 million per year. Signing Lady Gaga was one of his most lucrative moves—a career-defining gamble that paid off exponentially. He also launched Akon Clothing and had partnerships with brands like Beats by Dre and Puma, pulling in an estimated $3 million annually (Forbes).\nAkon Lighting Africa, launched with personal funds and outside investors, brought in over $15 million. Though primarily philanthropic, the venture cemented his status as a global entrepreneur. His investments in conflict-free diamond mines in Sierra Leone reportedly generate about $1 million yearly (Source: Reuters).\n💰 Net Worth Summary (July 2025)\n| Category | Amount |\n|---|---|\n| Music Earnings (Artist & Labels) | $25 Million |\n| Endorsements & Brand Deals | $10 Million |\n| Real Estate Holdings | $10 Million |\n| Other Business Ventures (e.g., Mining, Solar) | $5 Million |\n| Total Net Worth (Estimated) | $50 Million |\nNext Section Coming Up: Where the Money Goes\nSpending & Investments: Homes, Luxuries & More\nAkon hasn’t been shy about enjoying the rewards of his hard work. Reports suggest his real estate portfolio includes an $8 million estate in Miami, a $5 million Los Angeles property, and a sprawling $2 million residence in Senegal (Realtor.com). These homes serve both as personal retreats and public symbols of his success.\nWhen it comes to luxury, Akon rides in style. He owns a Mercedes-Maybach worth around $200,000, a private jet valued at roughly $30 million, and an 80-foot yacht estimated at $2 million. His collection of fine jewelry is valued at approximately $500,000 (Source: AutoEvolution).\nBusiness remains a core focus. He continues to invest in solar power, music publishing, and real estate ventures. His philanthropic giving exceeds $3 million, supporting education, energy access, and youth initiatives across Africa.\nNext Section Coming Up: The Shocking Crypto City Revelation\n💬 Factoid: The Downfall of Akon City & A-Coin\nAkon’s ambitious vision to build “Akon City” in his native Senegal as a cutting-edge, eco-friendly smart city—often described as a real-life \"Wakanda\"—has faced a crushing reality. Despite grand plans and significant media buzz, progress stalled severely, and as of July 4, 2025, the project was officially abandoned. Only a solitary Welcome Center stands on the site, with most construction halted indefinitely.\nMeanwhile, Akon’s associated cryptocurrency, A-Coin, intended to fuel the city’s economy and global transactions, has lost all its value, plunging 100% and becoming essentially worthless. This dramatic collapse was covered extensively by the BBC and other major outlets, marking a sharp setback for what was once hailed as a groundbreaking venture blending music fame with futuristic urban development.\nNext Section Coming Up: What’s New With Akon?\nAkon: Still Making Headlines\nIn recent weeks, Akon has proven he’s far from finished. On June 28, 2025, he dropped a surprise collaboration with rising country star Josh Ross titled “Drunk Right Now (Na Na Na).” The track debuted on Apple Music’s Hot Country chart and marks his first crossover into the genre (Source: Apple Music).\nSimultaneously, he announced a new $5 million expansion of his solar energy projects in West Africa. At a press conference in Lagos, he said, \"Africa doesn’t need saving. It needs support. And we have the tools.\"\nNext Section Coming Up: People Also Ask\nPeople Also Ask\nWhat is Akon’s current net worth?\nAkon’s net worth stands at approximately $50 million, derived from music royalties, touring, business ventures, endorsements, and real estate investments.\nWhat happened to Akon City in Senegal?\nAkon City, a multi-billion dollar planned smart city, was officially abandoned after minimal construction. The project faced delays and funding issues, ultimately being abandoned in mid-2025.\nIs A-Coin still active?\nNo. A-Coin has lost all its value and is no longer traded on any major cryptocurrency exchange.\nDid Akon make money from diamond mining?\nYes, Akon invested in conflict-free diamond mining in Sierra Leone, with revenues estimated at about $1 million per year.\nThe Bottom Line: Akon’s Legacy Beyond the Numbers\nDespite setbacks like the collapse of Akon City and the fall of A-Coin, Akon’s impact on music, business, and philanthropy remains undeniable. His ability to reinvent himself and continue influencing new genres, while investing in causes close to his heart, shows that his story is far from over.\nFor fans and followers tracking celebrity net worth, Akon is a reminder that success is never just about dollars—it’s about vision, resilience, and the drive to keep moving forward.\nExplore More Relevant Net Worth Articles:\nUsher’s Net Worth in 2025: A Deep Dive into the R&B Icon's Fortune.\nDrake Net Worth 2025: $250 Million Career Earnings & Success\nKendrick Lamar's $140M Net Worth: Unmasking the Hip-Hop Architect's Empire.\nDisclaimer: How We Estimate Net Worth\nOur net worth figures are estimates based on publicly available information, including real estate records, reported earnings, public filings, industry data, and expert analysis.

{"title": "4 Stocks Lift Dividends As Much as 33% As Banks Pass Stress Tests", "url": "https://www.dividendstocks.com/articles/4-stocks-lift-dividends-as-much-as-33-as-banks-pass-stress-tests/", "text": "Key Points\n- Four firms are raising their dividends by at least 11% and as much as 33%.\n- After soaring +60% in 2025, Worthington just announced a significant dividend increase.\n- Three big banks also announced large dividend increases as they passed the Fed's latest test.\nSeveral prominent stock market players just declared, or announced intentions to declare, large dividend increases. This is particularly true among some of the United States' biggest banks. Many banks announced big capital return plans after they passed the Federal Reserve’s 2025 bank stress tests in resounding fashion. These tests evaluate how well these banks can handle a severe recession.\nAfter passing, many big banks announced huge buyback programs. However, many also outlined their intentions to boost dividends by as much as 33%. These dividends need approval from each company's Board of Directors. However, this is really just a formality, as dividend increase proposals are almost never struck down. Investors can feel confident that the proposed increases will lead to more income in the future. Let's break down these dividend boosters. All dividend yield and return figures use data as of the July 3 close.\nThe Lone Non-Bank Wolf: Worthington Enterprise Gets 12% Dividend Raise\nWorthington Enterprises (NYSE: WOR) is one of the more prominent stocks that have boosted dividends recently outside of the banking industry. The company primarily makes pressurized tanks for propane, oxygen, water, and other substances for both commercial and consumer customers. On June 24, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share, a 12% increase over the prior quarter. Note that the word \"declared\" means that the dividend is officially approved, unlike the three names below.\nThis dividend is payable on Sept. 29 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Sept. 15. Overall, this increased dividend gives the stock an indicated dividend yield of 1.2%. Worthington has been a very strong performer in 2025, with a total return of 64% as it saw record production and shipments in Q1.\nSTT: Bank & Asset Management Hybrid Lifts Dividend of 11%\nState Street (NYSE: STT) passed the Fed’s stress test, as its Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) was “well below” the 2.5% floor. This essentially means that in a severe scenario, the change in the company’s ability to meet capital requirements was minimal, indicating resilience. Due to this, the company felt comfortable proposing a dividend increase of 11% in Q3, moving the payment up to $0.84.\nSince the dividend has not yet been officially declared, the record and payout dates are still unknown. Based on history, investors should expect the record date to come in the first few days of October, while the payable date will be approximately 10 days later. Assuming the Board approves the dividend, the stock’s indicated dividend yield would be 3%. State Street’s largest revenue stream comes from its role as a custodian for asset managers, placing it in the banking industry. However, it is also well known by retail investors for its index-tracking SPDR ETFs.\nStress Test Makes Bigger Mark on Goldman, But So Does Its Huge Dividend Boost\nAnother name passing the Fed’s test was The Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE: GS). The company said it expects its SCB requirement to be 3.4% after the tests. This means that the company needed a 3.4% buffer to meet its capital requirements in a severe scenario. Thus, this scenario would affect Goldman more than State Street, which needed a buffer of less than 2.5%.\nBut Goldman still passed the test because it has the capital required to account for this larger negative effect. As a result, Goldman announced plans to increase its dividend by a whopping 33%. This would increase the quarterly figure to $4 per share. The record date for this next dividend would likely come at the end of August or the beginning of September. The payable date would be around four weeks later. If approved, Goldman’s indicated dividend yield would be nearly 1.1%.\nBK: Yield Projection Hits 2.3% After Stress Test Win\nBank of New York Mellon (NYSE: BK) also passed the Fed’s latest bank stress test. The company’s SCB was also below the 2.5% floor, putting it in the same highly resilient category as State Street.\nThe firm proceeded by announcing its intention to increase its quarterly dividend by 13% to $0.53 per share. The record date is likely to be in the third or fourth week of July, with the payable date being around 10 days after. Assuming approval, the stock has an indicated dividend yield of 2.3%.\nOverall, all of these companies are doing what their shareholders want: rewarding them with more cash as they achieve big-time wins. Goldman’s striking 33% dividend increase stands out, helping income become a bigger part of its investment case.\nGet Income-Generating Stocks Like The Goldman Sachs Group in Your Inbox.\nStop riding the roller coaster of the stock market and sign-up to receive DividendStocks.com's daily ex-dividend stocks and dividend investing news for GS and related companies.\nCompanies Mentioned in This Article:| Company | Current Price | Price Change | Dividend Yield | P/E Ratio | Consensus Rating | Consensus Price Target |\n|---|\n| The Goldman Sachs Group (GS) | $709.29 | +1.8% | 1.69% | 16.46 | Hold | $614.00 |\n| State Street (STT) | $110.20 | +0.7% | 2.76% | 12.37 | Hold | $109.92 |\n| Bank of New York Mellon (BK) | $93.62 | +0.6% | 2.01% | 15.25 | Moderate Buy | $92.08 |\n| Worthington Enterprises (WOR) | $64.29 | -0.4% | 1.06% | 33.66 | Moderate Buy | $59.00 |\nAbout Leo Miller\nExperience\nLeo Miller has been a contributing writer for DividendStocks.com since 2024.\n- Professional Background: Leo Miller is a financial writer with a background in investment research and market analysis.

{"title": "Sizzling Insider Buys for Your High-Yield Watchlist", "url": "https://www.insidertrades.com/education/sizzling-insider-buys-for-your-high-yield-watchlist/", "text": "Key Points\n- Matador Resources is a regular buy for insiders, institutions, and analysts.\n- NewtekOne insiders are buying ahead of a significant expected business rebound.\n- V.F. Corporation insiders buy and mark the bottom for this stock.\nInsiders are buying stocks like Matador Resources (NYSE: MTDR), NewtekOne (NASDAQ: NEWT), and V.F. Corporation (NYSE: VFC) this year. These stocks are also attractive to average investors because they offer cash flow, yield, and catalysts that can drive their share prices higher over time. This is a look at who’s buying, dividend safety, and how high their share price may go.\nMatador Resources: Insiders Love It\nMatador Resources is no stranger to InsiderTrades.com readers. The company is prominently listed in the insider rankings for most look-back periods, boasting regular and periodic purchases by numerous insiders, including directors, the CEO, and other C-suite executives. They own about 5.8% of the stock and may continue to add to their positions this year and into the future. Matador Resources is a small yet operational and profitable oil production company, on track to ramp up production over time.\nCritical details for Matador Resources investors are its capital returns. The capital return includes dividends and share repurchases that help to offset the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards. The dividend is substantial, yielding about 2.5% in early July, and reliably safe at less than 20% of the 2025 earnings forecast.\nThe payment has been increased periodically over time and will likely rise again at the fiscal year's end.\nAnalysts and institutions also support this stock. The institutions own more than 90% of it and have been buying the stock on balance each quarter for several years, with activity ramping to record highs in 2025. According to the consensus, analysts rate it as a Moderate Buy and expect it to advance nearly 40% from its early July trading levels.\nNewtekOne Insiders Bet On Big Rebound\nNewtekOne is a bank holding company serving the small and medium-sized business industry. Once a BDC, the company is a high-yielding issue worth more than 6% in annualized income. Its insiders have been buying the stock for years and ramped their activity to a multiquarter high in Q2 2025. Buyers include the CEO, the EVP, and several directors, with activity compounded by institutions and analysts.\nNeither the institutional holdings nor analysts' coverage can be called robust, but the institutions are buying, and analysts are holding. InsiderTrades reports institutional interest at nearly 40% and rising quarterly, while the analysts forecast a 20% upside. Potential catalysts include the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to show sequential and YOY growth in revenue and earnings.\nRegarding dividend safety, NewtekOne’s payout ratio is a sustainable 40% of the 2025 earnings forecast. The payout ratio is expected to decline significantly over the next two years, potentially leading to increased distributions.\nVFC Insiders Call The Bottom in This Dividend Stock\nVFC has struggled for years but appears to be at a turning point. The company is on the cusp of returning to growth, and the insiders have started buying. After two quarters of inactivity, insiders, including the CEO, a director, and an EVP, bought shares in Q2 2025.\nTheir activity signals a bottom in the market, but investors still face risk. The institutions and analysts have yet to confirm the turn and may not for another quarter or two. As it is, institutions sold on balance in Q2 and analysts, who have recently reduced their price targets, rate it as a Hold.\nVFC’s dividend was cut a few years ago, and the payment was right-sized for the business. The payout ratio in 2025 is a sustainable 50%, setting it up to revert to distribution growth once business growth resumes. Highlights from 2025 include inventory reduction, which is critical to the turnaround, as well as reduced debt and improved leverage.\nCompanies in This Article:\n| Company | Current Price | Price Change | Dividend Yield | P/E Ratio | Consensus Rating | Consensus Price Target |\n|---|\n| V.F.

{"title": "The Top Insider Sells From Q2: Buy, Sell, or Hold?", "url": "https://www.insidertrades.com/education/the-top-insider-sells-from-q2-buy-sell-or-hold/", "text": "Key Points\n- Insiders are selling Carvana and may provide a headwind for its share price this year.\n- Insiders are selling Magnite, but institutions and analysts are not.\n- Insiders are selling Meta Platforms, but the remainder of the data suggests a new high will be set this year.\nInsiders sold stocks in Q2, which could present a headwind for some markets in Q3. However, in most cases, the selling aligns with trends, revealing that share-based compensation is in play and profit-taking is also a factor.\nThis article looks at the three hottest insider sells from Q2 and what investors can expect from these stocks in Q3.\nCarvana: The Leading Stock Sold by Insiders in Q2\nCarvana (NYSE: CVNA) is the leading stock sold by insiders in more ways than one. It is the most sold, based on the number of transactions and the number of insiders selling, and it ranks highly in terms of the value of shares sold. InsiderTrades tracks 63 sales from 12 insiders, including the CEO and a major shareholder, the CEO’s father, who both bought heavily when the stock was at its lowest.\nNow, at the start of Q3, CVNA shares are up more than 3000% from their lows, offering an attractive profit for these investors. The good news is that CVNA’s business is likely to continue delivering, and the long-term outlook for share prices is bullish.\nThe bad news is that these insiders, including numerous C-suite executives, are likely to continue selling in 2025, which will provide a headwind for market action.\nOther sell-side activity is bullish, providing a solid support base to keep the uptrend alive despite the insiders. That includes the institutions that own more than 55% of the stock, and the analysts, who rate it firmly as a Moderate Buy. Institutions have been buying on balance in 2025, including Q1 and Q2 activity; analysts' consensus forecasts a slight decline at the start of Q3.\nHowever, the trend is positive with recent revisions leading to the $375 level, aligning with record highs.\nMagnite: Alarming Trends in the Insider Data\nMagnite Inc. (NASDAQ: MGNI) operates a sell-side advertising platform linking publishers with ad content. The company’s insiders own approximately 4.3% of the stock as of mid-year 2025, but the trend is alarming. Insiders are selling into the rallies, ramping their activity sequentially for six quarters, hitting a record high in Q2 2025. It is the second most sold stock by insiders in Q2, with 22 sales by 12 executives, including the CEO and CFO.\nHowever, this activity is offset by the institutions owning approximately 74% of the stock and the analysts increasing their price targets.\nThe institutions are buying on balance, and the analysts, who rate the stock as a firm Moderate Buy, are leading the market to the $24 range with their revision trend, which will yield a 15% gain when reached.\nFundamental drivers for MGNI stock include growth and improving profitability. The latest results showed strength on the top and bottom lines, affirming the outlook for sustained double-digit top-line growth, widening margin, and accelerated bottom-line growth.\nThe guidance was also robust, forecasting an acceleration in Q2 that was unexpected by analysts, revealing the impact of a new deal with Amazon. It builds upon a previous partnership, making it easier for publishers to access high-quality, monetizable ad content than before.\nMeta Platforms: The Most-Sold Magnificent 7 Stock, Don’t Follow Suit\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is the most sold blue-chip tech stock with 41 transactions from six insiders, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg. However, the insiders still own a considerable 13% of the stock and other sell-side data is contrary. Analysts rate this stock as a Moderate Buy and are leading it to fresh all-time high levels with their revisions, while institutions are buying.\nThe institutions own nearly 80% of the stock, making it a tightly held name, rare for its size and market appeal. They are buying robustly this year.\nDrivers for this market include results, growth, margin, and the outlook, which forecasts sustained double-digit growth and substantial margin. The takeaway is that AI continues to drive results internally and with consumers, driving sales strength, margin, and cash flow.\nAnother driver is the robust cash flow and capital return, which is growing in both cases. Capital return includes buybacks and dividends, expected to grow at a modest to high-single-digit pace for the foreseeable future.\nCompanies in This Article:\n| Company | Current Price | Price Change | Dividend Yield | P/E Ratio | Consensus Rating | Consensus Price Target |\n|---|\n| Meta Platforms (META) | $727.24 | -0.8% | 0.29% | 28.36 | Moderate Buy | $727.95 |\n| Carvana (CVNA) | $345.99 | -1.5% | N/A | 121.40 | Moderate Buy | $303.59 |\n| Magnite (MGNI) | $23.45 | -1.0% | N/A | 117.26 | Moderate Buy | $20.33 |\n| Meta Platforms (META) | $727.24 | -0.8% | 0.29% | 28.36 | Moderate Buy | $727.95 |\nExperience\nThomas Hughes has been a contributing writer for InsiderTrades.com since 2019.\n- Professional Background: Thomas Hughes is the Managing Partner of Passive Market Intelligence LLC, a market research platform he launched in 2023 with the mission: “We watch the market so you don't have to.” He has worked as a blogger, stock market commentator, and independent analyst since 2010 and has been actively involved in trading and investing since 2005.\n- Credentials: He holds an Associate of Arts in Culinary Technology—training that honed his discipline, attention to detail, and ability to anticipate outcomes, all of which carry over into his work as a market analyst.\n- Finance Experience: Thomas has been writing about finance and investing since 2011, when he discovered it could be more than a personal passion—it could be a profession.
